40|$|The {{dc voltage}} {{obtained}} from the inverse spin Hall effect (iSHE) due to spin pumping in ferromagnet/normal-metal (NM) bilayers can be unintentionally superimposed with magnetoresistive rectification of ac charge currents in the ferromagnetic layer. We introduce a geometry in which these spurious rectification voltages vanish while the iSHE voltage is maximized. In this geometry, a quantitative study of the dc iSHE is performed in a broad frequency range for Permalloy/NM multilayers with NM={Pt, Ta, Cu/Au, Cu/Pt}. The experimentally recorded voltages <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to the iSHE due to spin pumping. Furthermore we measure a small iSHE voltage in single CoFe thin films...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{continuing}} debate about the extent and significance of sectarianism in Scotland and the wider links with territorial gang culture. This article focuses on a small qualitative study conducted {{in some of the}} most deprived urban communities in Glasgow. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 10 youth workers and 40 young persons (aged 16 – 18 years), with follow-up interviews conducted with senior operational police officers. Social capital indicators generated by recent research were used as a lens through which to explore the participant responses. The findings suggest that the combined social forces associated with territoriality and intense football rivalry limit the young people’s potential for maximizing social capital. However, the extent to which these issues <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to the continued existence of sectarianism in Scotland is less clear. The article concludes with some implication...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of fatty {{tissue in the}} myometrium is anomalous; this alteration has been interpreted either as a lipomatous degeneration or as a metaplasia of smooth muscle cells or, still, as a real neoplasm, frequently associated with a leiomyoma, the so-called lipoleiomyoma. The observation of a case of lipoleiomyoma stimulated us to ascertain the real incidence of this lesion which is commonly considered to be rare. We examined 620 single or multiple uterine leiomyomas with extensive sampling of all the areas suspected to contain fatty tissue islands. Five times out of seven the {{presence of}} fat cells in a leiomyoma resulted {{to be a true}} lipoleiomyoma. It has thus been possible to ascertain the incidence of lipoleiomyoma versus uterine leiomyomatosis (0, 8 %). Futhermore we observed a prevalence in menopause, an association with multiple leiomyoma and a preferential onset in the subserosa. The pathogenesis of this lesion, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to a mixed, benign, heterologous, mesenchymal neoplasm, is briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of mutagens after the heating of sugar-casein model systems at 120 C was {{examined by the}} Ames test, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100. Several sugars (glucose, fructose, galactose, tagatose, lactose, and lactulose) were compared in their mutagenicities. Mutagenicity could <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to Maillard reaction products and strongly varied {{with the kind of}} sugar. The differences in mutagenicity among the sugar-casein systems were caused by a difference in reaction rate and a difference in reaction mechanism. Sugars with a comparable reaction mechanism (glucose and galactose) showed a higher mutagenic activity corresponding with a higher Maillard reactivity. Disaccharides showed no mutagenic activity (lactose) or a lower mutagenic activity (lactulose) than their corresponding monosaccharides. Ketose sugars (fructose and tagatose) showed a remarkably higher mutagenicity compared with their aldose isomers (glucose and galactose), which was due to a difference in reaction mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Broad-spectrum {{resistance}} in potato to the {{potato cyst nematode}} (PCN) is commonly regarded as a complex inherited trait. Yet, {{in this paper we}} show that, by use of a selected set of PCN test populations, broad-spectrum resistance to the species Globodera pallida <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to the action of two loci: Gpa 5 and Gpa 6. These loci were readily mapped by means of a strategy based on two steps. Firstly, the chromosomal localization of both loci was assessed by use of an online catalogue of AFLP markers covering a substantial part of the potato genome ([URL] Subsequently the chromosomal regions of both loci were identified by means of CAPS markers based on RFLP insert sequences. Locus Gpa 5 explains at least 61 % of the genetic variation. This locus maps to chromosome 5 on a region which has previously been shown to harbor resistance factors to viral (Nb, Rx 2), fungal (R 1) and nematodal (Gpa, Grp 1) pathogens. The Gpa 6 locus exhibits a minor effect on the resistance (24 %) and acts additively to Gpa 5. Interestingly, the Gpa 6 locus maps to a region on chromosome 9 where, in the homoeologous tomato genome, the virus resistance gene Sw- 5 resides as part of a resistance gene cluster. In potato, resistance to potato virus X has been reported in the vicinity of this region. The map location of Gpa 6 indicates the presence of a resistance gene cluster {{at the end of the}} long arm of chromosome 9 of potato...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{cytochrome}} c oxidase, {{reduction of}} molecular {{oxygen in the}} active site requires transfer of electrons from cytochrome c towards heme a 3. This occurs via a chain of redox intermediates. The dynamics of the final step in this chain, reduction of heme a 3 by the chemically identical heme a, cannot be resolved in direct external electron injection experiments. Instead electron redistribution can be monitored upon photodissociation of CO from the mixed-valence (MV) enzyme-CO complex. The published value for the equilibration time in the mitochondrial enzyme is f 3 As [1]. However, a detailed spectral analysis of the microsecond data (by Wikstro¨m's group) predicted a substantial additional equilibration phase on a much faster time scale [2]. This prediction was contested (by Brzezinski's group) {{on the basis of}} nanosecond experiments [3]. We have performed transient absorption experiments with femtosecond resolution and a time window up to 4 ns under selective excitation of heme a 3 in the alpha band (595 nm) starting from the fully reduced (a 2 +a 32 +-CO) and MV (a 3 +a 32 +-CO) COcomplexes. In the MV complex only, a significant spectral evolution with a nanosecond time constant was observed both in alpha and in Soret spectral regions that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>ascribed</b> to electron equilibration (a 3 +a 32 +a 2 +a 33 +). We suggest that the intrinsic time constant of reduction of heme a 3 by heme a is on this time scale. The result will be discussed in the framework of conflicting theoretical predictions. An additional remarkable observation is that the CO-dissociation spectrum from heme a 3 depends on the redox state of heme a. This finding adds to the notion that can in principle not be treated as spectrally independent entities. This observation may relate to the strong variation in spectral decompositions using various methods...|$|E
