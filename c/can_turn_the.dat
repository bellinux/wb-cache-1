Peter insists on driving Chris {{and the rest of}} the family (Peter's wife Lois, their {{daughter}} Meg and their infant Stewie) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cross on}} the {{mountain}} was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, {{the founder of the}} city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood. Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the John the Baptist Society and now owned by the city. It was converted to fibre optic light in 1992. The new system <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.|$|E
5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E

25|$|It was in New Zealand in March 1995 that Muralitharan {{displayed}} his qualities as a match-winner on any surface. In Sri Lanka's first triumph {{on foreign}} soil, Muralitharan confused the crease-bound New Zealanders on a grassy pitch in Dunedin. The Sri Lankan manager Duleep Mendis' claim that Muralitharan <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> ball on concrete was confirmed. On {{the eve of}} his tour of Pakistan later that year, doubts were cast on his ability to trouble subcontinental batsmen. By taking 19 wickets in the series and delivering a historic 2–1 victory, the off-spinner silenced the doubters. The Pakistanis, who had negotiated Warne's leg-breaks in the previous home series, were never at ease against him.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both Torque's own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil.|$|E

500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E
500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the oscilloscope display screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are transparent plastic targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a time fuze. The goal of the game is to have the beam defocus when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E

[...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone said, [...] "The video {{exemplified}} the fact that there's no-one like Madonna, who <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> music video in to an art-form." [...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, this is a pretty rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans." [...] Bönz Malone from Spin said, [...] "Celebration: The Video Collection is a reminder that Madonna is, and always will be, a true video artist. You cannot ignore her contribution to the music video art form."

2500|$|If {{the flow}} turns {{enough so that}} it becomes {{parallel}} to the wall, {{we do not need}} to worry about pressure boundary condition.
