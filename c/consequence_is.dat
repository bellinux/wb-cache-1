5|$|Every year it is {{becoming}} more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{error is}} {{the attempt to}} use the equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls is the use of the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E
40|$|Toxicological <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> {{calculated}} for a postulated maximum caustic soda (NaOH) solution spray leak during {{addition to a}} waste tank to adjust tank pH. Although onsite risk guidelines were exceeded for the unmitigated release, site boundary <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> {{below the level of}} concern. Means of mitigating the release so as to greatly reduce the onsite <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> recommended. <b>Consequences</b> for the mitigated release were estimated and both onsite and offsite <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> found to negligible...|$|R

5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> {{that he has made}} a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|On Day 65, Odin had {{the fourth}} Grenade: the good <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> {{to double the}} {{nomination}} of a housemate and the bad <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> to ban a housemate from nominating.|$|R
5000|$|... {{will result}} in the {{immediate}} enforcement, without qualification, of the constitutional rights of the individual concerned whatever the <b>consequences</b> may <b>be.</b> If the <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> such as to enable a fugitive to escape justice then such <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> not of the court's creation; they spring from the police illegality.|$|R
5000|$|....the {{greater the}} {{probability}} of a consequence the more likely it <b>is</b> that the <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> foreseen and if that <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> foreseen, the greater the probability is that it was also intended.|$|R
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the less}} time that elapses between a {{behavior}} and its consequence, the more impactful a <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> likely to be.|$|E
25|$|Gluons {{also share}} this {{property}} of being confined within hadrons. One <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that gluons {{are not directly}} involved in the nuclear forces between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called mesons.|$|E
5000|$|On Day 51, Hugo had {{the second}} Grenade: the good <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> to choose someone {{to receive a}} clue from a secret and the bad <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> to choose someone to lose half of his/her money.|$|R
5000|$|On Day 79, Fernando had {{the sixth}} and last Grenade: the good <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> to choose a housemate to win all money from Fernando's account and the bad <b>consequence</b> <b>was</b> to choose a housemate to lose all his/her money.|$|R
40|$|Consequences {{that might}} occur if certain {{technological}} developments {{take place in}} intercity transportation <b>are</b> described. These <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> broad ranging, and include economic, environmental, social, institutional, energy-related, and transportation service implications. The possible <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> traced through direct (primary) impacts to indirect (secondary, tertiary, etc.) impacts. Chains of <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> traced, reaching as far beyond the original transportation cause as is necessary to identify all impacts felt to be influenced significantly by the technological development considered...|$|R
25|$|Each compact Hausdorff space {{possesses}} {{exactly one}} uniform structure {{compatible with the}} topology. A <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> a generalisation of the Heine-Cantor theorem: each continuous function from a compact Hausdorff space to a uniform space is uniformly continuous.|$|E
25|$|The Bs, irrational {{beliefs that}} are most {{important}} in the A-B-C model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The Bs, beliefs {{that are most}} significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative B, belief about the A, activating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the C, the emotional and behavioral <b>consequence,</b> <b>is</b> likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the C, the emotional and behavioral <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> likely to be self-helping and constructive.|$|E
25|$|A <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} kernel of the Artin map is the {{connected}} {{component of the}} identity of the idele class group, so that the abelianization of the Galois group of F is the profinite completion of the idele class group.|$|E

25|$|Another {{negative}} <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> that placebos {{can cause}} side-effects associated with real treatment. One {{example of this}} is with those that have already taken an opiate, can then show respiratory depression when given it again {{in the form of a}} placebo.|$|E
25|$|Standard Heckscher–Ohlin theory {{assumes the}} same {{production}} function for all countries. This implies that all firms are identical. The theoretical <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> {{that there is}} no room for firms in the H–O model. By contrast, the New Trade Theory emphasizes that firms are heterogeneous.|$|E
25|$|Osteoporosis {{itself has}} no symptoms; its main <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> the {{increased}} risk of bone fractures. Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist.|$|E

25|$|Skinner {{considered}} {{free will}} an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> bad, {{there is a}} high chance the action will not be repeated; if the <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> good, the probability of the action being repeated become stronger. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.|$|R
40|$|Radiological and {{toxicological}} <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> estimated for a steam {{release from}} tank C- 106 {{associated with a}} breach of the tank liner due to formation of steam under the liner after dry-out of the sludge layer in the tank.

25|$|Staffing at Pelican Island {{is made up}} of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The {{staff members}} have {{recently}} fallen from six to two which has had many negative consequences. The cuts have led to limiting refuge work and restricting public visitation. Another <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> the end of 14-year tradition of the wildlife festival.|$|E
25|$|Flint, {{as editor}} of all the short fiction, also {{maintains}} the series canon (co-ordinated by the 1632.org website) and all copyrights to the alternate history universe per se, and with Flint as the controlling editor, the <b>consequence</b> <b>is,</b> semi-pro or professional payment rates aside, Baen doesn't publish anything in the series which is not canonical.|$|E
5000|$|Dewey's Logic did {{not name}} instrumentalism or pragmatism, but argued that both schools treat {{theories}} as tools for producing consequences—premises 1 and 2. <b>Consequences</b> <b>are</b> [...] "necessary {{tests of the}} validity of propositions, provided these <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problem evoking the operations, ..." ...|$|R

Hierarchical regressions controlling for other measures found that perceived conditional risk and worry of health <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> associated with motivation to quit; only conditional risk of appearance <b>consequences</b> <b>was</b> associated with motivation to quit. Relative weights analysis indicated that perceived conditional risk of appearance consequences and worry about health <b>consequences</b> <b>were</b> the most important variables in the model.
