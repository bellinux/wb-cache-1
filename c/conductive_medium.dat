40|$|Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} {{numerical}} methods {{designed for the}} modeling and inversion of geophysical electromagnetic (EM) measurements using a conductive thin plate model. The main objectives are to study the EM induction problem in general and to develop practical interpretation tools for mineral prospecting in particular. The starting point is a linearized inversion method based on the singular value decomposition and a new adaptive damping method. The inversion method is introduced to the interpretation of time-domain EM (TEM) measurements using a thin plate in free-space. The {{central part of the}} thesis is a new approximate modeling method, which is based on an integral equation approach and a special lattice model. At first the modeling method is applied to the interpretation of frequency-domain EM (FEM) data using a thin plate in conductive two-layered earth. After this time-domain responses are modeled applying a Fourier-sine transform of broadband FEM computations. The results demonstrate that the approximate computational method can model the geophysical frequency and time-domain EM responses of a thin conductor in <b>conductive</b> host <b>medium</b> with sufficient accuracy, and that the inversion method can provide reliable estimates for the model parameters. The fast forward computation enables interactive interpretation of FEM data and feasible forward modeling of TEM responses.

This phenomenon {{is important in}} geologic carbon storage, where the dissolution of CO 2 in water increases the acidity and produce microstructures significantly different from those in an intact reservoir. We demonstrate the controlling mechanism for the dissolution patterns in natural porous materials. This was done using numerical simulations based on high resolution digital models of North Sea chalk. We tested three model scenarios, and found that aqueous CO 2 dissolve porous media homogeneously, leading to large breakthrough porosity. In contrast, CO 2 -free solution develops elongated convective channels in porous media, known as wormholes, and resulting in small breakthrough porosity. We further show that a homogeneous dissolution pattern appears because the sample size is smaller than the theoretical size of a developing wormhole. The result indicates {{that the presence of}} dissolved CO 2 expands the reactive subvolume of a porous medium, and thus enhances the geochemical alteration of reservoir structures and might undermine the sealing integrity of caprocks when minerals dissolve.

40|$|The magnetostatic vector {{fields in}} terms of {{harmonic}} scalar potentials scattered by near–surface air inclusion ofarbitrary shape, embedded in a <b>conductive</b> ferromagnetic <b>medium,</b> are investigated. The hollow inclusion is illuminatedby a current–carrying coil, which serves as the primary field. The do-main of interest is separated into homogeneoussubdomains under the assumption of a suitable truncation of the region of magnetostatic activity at a long distancefrom the incident source. Therein, the field is considered negligible and consequently a perfect magnetic boundarycondition is implied. On the other hand, the introduced methodology addresses the full coupling between the twointerfaces, i. e. the plane that distinguishes the half–space ferromagnetic material from the open air and the arbitrarysurface among the inclusion and the ferromagnetic region. To this end, continuity conditions are applied in a rigorousway, while the expected behavior of the fields, either as ascending or as descending are taken into account. Thescattering problem is solved {{by means of a}} modal approach, where potentials associated with the half–space areexpanded via cylindrical harmonic eigenfunctions, while those related with the inclusion’s arbitrary geometry admit ageneralized–type formalism, being the key to our method. However, since the transmission conditions involvepotentials with different eigenexpansions, we are obliged to rewrite cylindrical to generalized functions and vice versa,obtaining handy relationships {{in terms of}} easy–to–handle integrals, where orthogonality then would be feasible. Oncedone, the calculation of the exact solutions leads to infinite linear algebraic systems, whose solution is achievedtrivially through standard cut–off techniques.
