5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified <b>cost-efficient</b> designs.|$|E
5|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} used by NSB {{was a single}} Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more <b>cost-efficient</b> than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late.|$|E
25|$|Size limitations: Securitizations {{often require}} large scale structuring, and thus {{may not be}} <b>cost-efficient</b> for small and medium transactions.|$|E
25|$|Singapore {{has one of}} {{the most}} <b>cost-efficient</b> public {{transport}} networks in the world, according to a study by London consulting firm Credo. Public transport covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail, and taxi.|$|E
25|$|The windrow {{method and}} compost windrow turners were {{developed}} by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, <b>cost-efficient</b> way for farmers to manage dairy waste.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous {{buildings}} are usually energy-efficient in operation, and therefore <b>cost-efficient,</b> for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs {{are easier to}} satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.|$|E
25|$|The {{search for}} {{efficient}} OLED materials {{has been extensively}} supported by simulation methods. By now {{it is possible to}} calculate important properties completely computationally, independent of experimental input. This allows <b>cost-efficient</b> pre-screening of materials, prior to expensive synthesis and experimental characterisation.|$|E
25|$|An actigraph unit is a motion-sensing device worn on the wrist, {{generally}} {{for one or}} two weeks. It gives a gross {{picture of}} sleep-wake cycles and is often used to verify the sleep diary. It is <b>cost-efficient</b> when full polysomnography is not required.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles Aqueduct uses gravity {{alone to}} move water and to {{generate}} electricity, {{so it is}} <b>cost-efficient</b> to operate. Finished in 1911, the Los Angeles Aqueduct was the brain-child of the self-taught engineer William Mulholland and is still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Ranked fourteenth to seventeenth were: a {{migration}} project (guest-worker programmes for the unskilled), {{which was}} deemed to discourage integration; and three projects addressing climate change (optimal carbon tax, the Kyoto Protocol and value-at-risk carbon tax), which the panel {{judged to be}} least <b>cost-efficient</b> of the proposals.|$|E
25|$|A second common {{reason for}} this kind of {{discrimination}} is when the worker or consumer is not <b>cost-efficient.</b> For example, some stores in the US Northwest do not stock ethnic foods, despite requests for such, since they feel the cost is too high for too low a return.|$|E
25|$|During the Air Force's first decade, {{budgetary}} shortfalls led to {{the search}} for more <b>cost-efficient</b> Wing operations. In 1952, many of the World War II Combat Groups began to be phased out and inactivated as more wings assumed direct control of the combat squadrons. On 16 June 1952, the 9th Group was inactivated and the squadron was assigned directly to Wing control.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, {{this makes}} it {{incorrect}} to apply traditional statistics {{that are based on}} variance and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for <b>cost-efficient</b> interventions. For example, given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very few cars contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.|$|E
25|$|Oliver began {{a formal}} {{campaign}} to ban unhealthy food in British schools {{and to get}} children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, <b>cost-efficient</b> meals that kids enjoyed eating. His efforts brought the subject of school dinners to the political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.|$|E
25|$|Many oils can be {{recovered}} from open water surfaces by skimming devices. Considered a dependable and cheap way to remove oil, grease and other hydrocarbons from water, oil skimmers can sometimes {{achieve the desired}} level of water purity. At other times, skimming is also a <b>cost-efficient</b> method to remove most of the oil before using membrane filters and chemical processes. Skimmers will prevent filters from blinding prematurely and keep chemical costs down because there is less oil to process.|$|E
25|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} about general aviation's future past the year 2000, Weick accurately envisioned the continued interest in sport aviation and the practical use of aircraft for medium-range transportation. He {{mentioned that he}} had seen gas turbines demonstrated as early as 1922, and that their future use in light aircraft would only be viable with development of <b>cost-efficient</b> materials that could withstand the heat. He felt future aircraft would not be radically different, but could benefit from safety improvements in controllability.|$|E
25|$|Its {{development}} costs {{will have an}} impact of around -0.7% on Airbus Return on Sales target from 2015 to 2017, an estimated Bn $2 billion (1.18 billion pounds). Airbus thinks lower capital cost makes the A330neo the most <b>cost-efficient</b> medium-range wide-body aircraft in the market. Airbus says that it can pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and says there is an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s. Aerodynamic modifications are to include a re-twisted wing and optimised slats.|$|E
25|$|Many OECD {{countries}} have implemented reforms to achieve policy goals of ensuring {{access to health}} care, {{improving the quality of}} health care and health outcomes, allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare {{but at the same time}} ensuring that services are provided in a <b>cost-efficient</b> and cost-effective manner (microeconomic efficiency). A range of measures, such as better payment methods, have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers. However, introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{cases in which}} the use of a single {{computer}} would be possible in principle, but the use of a distributed system is beneficial for practical reasons. For example, it may be more <b>cost-efficient</b> to obtain the desired level of performance by using a cluster of several low-end computers, in comparison with a single high-end computer. A distributed system can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no single point of failure. Moreover, a distributed system may be easier to expand and manage than a monolithic uniprocessor system.|$|E
25|$|Landfills {{are often}} the most <b>cost-efficient</b> way to dispose of waste, {{especially}} in countries like the United States with large open spaces. While resource recovery and incineration both require extensive investments in infrastructure, and material recovery also requires extensive manpower to maintain, landfills have fewer fixed—or ongoing—costs, allowing them to compete favorably. In addition, landfill gas can be upgraded to natural gas—landfill gas utilization—which is a potential revenue stream. Another advantage is having a specific location for disposal that can be monitored, where waste can be processed to remove all recyclable materials before tipping.|$|E
25|$|Combined medical {{management}} and behavioral treatment {{is the most}} effective ADHD management strategy, followed by medication alone, and then behavioral treatment. In terms of cost-effectiveness, management with medication {{has been shown to be}} the most cost-effective, followed by behavioral treatment, and combined treatment. The individually most effective and <b>cost-efficient</b> way is with stimulant medication. Additionally, long-acting medications for ADHD, in comparison to short-acting varieties, generally seem to be cost-effective. Comorbid (relating to two diseases that occur together, e.g. depression and ADHD) disorders makes finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more costly than when comorbid disorders are absent.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{at first}} {{dismissed}} LOR as a riskier option, given that an orbital rendezvous {{had yet to}} be performed in Earth orbit, much less in lunar orbit. Several NASA officials, including Langley Research Center engineer John Houbolt and NASA Administrator George Low, argued that a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous provided the simplest landing on the moon, the most <b>cost–efficient</b> launch vehicle and, perhaps most importantly, the best chance to accomplish a lunar landing within the decade. Other NASA officials were convinced, and LOR was officially selected as the mission configuration for the Apollo program on November 7, 1962.|$|E
25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and <b>cost-efficient</b> method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce landfilling. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, torrefaction of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant will be using.|$|E
25|$|UCSD {{administration}} has been planning to replace the dated facility since 2005, as by 2030 it will be inoperable due to increased seismic regulations in California. Planners believe {{that it would be}} more <b>cost-efficient</b> to replace the facility than perform the necessary upgrades. The ten-story Jacobs Medical Center was originally proposed as a controversial replacement for the Hillcrest facility. San Diego residents and nearby hospitals such as Scripps Health argued that the move would leave South County patients underserved, and UCSD decided to build the Jacobs Medical Center as a supplement to, not a replacement for, the Hillcrest campus. A long-range development plan is expected by 2018, and the replacement hospital on the current site will likely be completed by 2030.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited amount}} of open-sea whaling was {{performed}} by interlopers—independent entrepreneurs. The Noordsche Compagnie was disbanded {{by the government in}} 1642. The decade also saw an increase in whaling outside the main bays and fjords. This gradually resulted in the abandoning of land stations as technological innovation allowed flensing along the ship, which allowed for pelagic whaling. Cooking of the oil was moved to the mainland. While more <b>cost-efficient,</b> it resulted in {{a large portion of the}} meat being wasted. During the 18th century, Dutch whaling was reduced, until it ceased after 1770. The British gradually took the lead in Arctic whaling, but by around the start of the 19th century bowhead whales were scarce around Spitsbergen and the whalers moved elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War {{the army}} could {{mobilise}} 13 brigades, although 10 of them were less well equipped. It has been downsized after {{the end of the}} Cold War, with the biggest changes taking place in the middle of the 1990s, when a number of garrisons and units were discontinued. This restructuring focused on moving from a fairly static invasion army to a flexible rapid reaction army. The Parliament in 1994 and 1995 approved a series of major organizational changes, for the Army in particular. To ensure a <b>cost-efficient</b> implementation, it is necessary to focus the activities in the Army on the process of transforming the army from a large mobilization army to a smaller, professional army.|$|E
25|$|On February 29, 2016, SEPTA {{announced}} {{which of}} those routes it would prefer as being most <b>cost-efficient</b> and environmentally-friendly. The route will branch {{off from the}} main route between Hughes Park and DeKalb Street, and will follow a PECO transmission line right-of-way from the wye junction to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. From there, it will run across {{the south side of}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike until it reaches the King of Prussia Mall. It will then follow Mall Boulevard, before crossing the Turnpike and following First Avenue. Stations will be located at Henderson Road, the Court and Plaza at King of Prussia, at the intersection of First and Clark avenues in the King of Prussia Business Park, and on First Avenue near the Valley Forge Casino Resort.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have {{tended to focus on}} specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most <b>cost-efficient</b> approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units as part of an ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become <b>cost-efficient</b> only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only be seen, if at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants {{have been made in}} the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} useful {{to compare the}} Americanist {{tradition}} with another widespread tradition, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation {{does not require a}} strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that, to represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other specific uses, gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from typefaces of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more <b>cost-efficient,</b> as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.|$|E
25|$|The sub-centers {{will always}} report any {{search and rescue}} alarm to JRCC SN, but will by default take action {{themselves}} unless JRCC NN chooses to take command itself. Actions are taken based on pre-defined plans. JRCC NN is prepared to handle situations related to land, sea and air, operations tied to offshore constructions and missions requiring international cooperation. This model is chosen for being <b>cost-efficient</b> and resource-efficient, and is unique in the world. The two Norwegian JRCCs are redundant and both can take over the other centers operations if necessary. This most commonly takes place when one center is fully occupied with a major incident and the other center takes over responsibility for the entire country. In case of war the JRCC NN will cease to operate and the employees and resources will be transferred to Norwegian Joint Headquarters, with the Norwegian Armed Forces taking over available resources.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian Aviation College was {{established}} at Bardufoss Airport in 1992 as the world's northern-most flight school. It chose the airport {{because of its}} difficult weather and terrain in combination with few aircraft movements from commercial aviation. The use of military charter flights was debated from 1976. While they were <b>cost-efficient</b> for the military, merging them with civilian routes would increase the patronage of scheduled services, which would increase frequency and aircraft size. Coordinate flights were introduced in October 1992 and resulted in three weekly services with SAS to Oslo. A new control tower, costing NOK55 million, was completed in September 1993. Plans for a new terminal commenced with the coordination of civilian and military flights, which had initially resulted in the old civilian terminal being closed. An early proposal was {{to build a new}} arrivals hall and keeping the former military terminal as a departures hall. The airport handled 142,100 passengers in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Time-Life {{executives}} {{realized the}} problems in trying to expand Home Box Office's distribution footprint using microwave towers {{because of the time}} and expense that would be incurred in developing such a vast relay infrastructure, and began looking for <b>cost-efficient</b> methods of transmitting the channel nationally. In 1974, they settled on using a geostationary communications satellite to transmit HBO to cable providers throughout the United States. Other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking their feeds to satellite due to fears that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit, as well as due to the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes, which in 1974, were sold for as much as $75,000. Seeing satellite transmission as the only viable option to expand HBO's reach, Gerald Levin allocated $6.5 million to lease transponder space on the Westar 1 satellite for a five-year term. The Time-Life board subsequently approved the plan to transmit HBO via satellite.|$|E
25|$|Smith's first Macintosh {{board was}} built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of {{supporting}} a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, {{a member of the}} Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from the Lisa's 5MHz to 8MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more <b>cost-efficient.</b> The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64KB of ROM– far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8KB of ROM; it had 128kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a , 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.|$|E

500|$|While {{preparing}} to film the Fireflash controlled landing sequence, Meddings {{was faced with}} the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios. His compact and <b>cost-efficient</b> solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the grass verge foreground, the sky background and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop. This [...] "rolling road" [...] (or [...] "roller-road") technique marked a progression from the [...] "rolling sky" [...] that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as Stingray.|$|E
