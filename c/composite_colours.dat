The main objective of our study is to design a method for extracting and mapping of lineament from Landsat 8 _OLI satellite images of the study area. Different processing techniques were used to achieve our objective : MNF Minimum Noise Fraction bands (4, 5, 6), Color composites (7, 5, 3), PCA Principal Component Analysis bands (4, 5, 7), band ratios (7 / 5, 6 / 4, 4 / 2), directional filters, and image processing applied on the Landsat 8 _OLI <b>composite</b> <b>colours.</b> The results of this study indicate that, the area is really affected by several structural trends: N-S, NW–SE, and NE–SW directions.

40|$|We first {{presented}} an isochrone database {{that can be}} widely used for stellar population synthesis studies and color magnitude diagram (CMD) fittings. The database consists of the isochrones of both single and binary stellar populations (SSPs and BSPs). The ranges for the age and metallicity of populations are 0 – 15 Gyr and 0. 0001 – 0. 03, respectively. All data are available for populations with two widely used initial mass functions (IMFs), i. e., the Salpeter IMF with- 2. 35 exponent and the Chabrier IMF. The uncertainty caused by the database (about 0. 81 %) {{is designed to be}} smaller than those caused by the Hurley procedure and widely used stellar spectra libraries (e. g., BaSeL 3. 1) when it is used for stellar population synthesis. Then based on the above isochrone database, we built a rapid stellar population synthesis (RPS) model and calculated the high-resolution (0. 3 ˚A) integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs), Lick/IDS indices and colour indices for BSPs and SSPs. In particular, we calculated the UBV RIJHKLM colours, ugriz colours and some <b>composite</b> <b>colours</b> that consist of magnitudes on different systems. These colours are useful for disentangling the well-known stellar age–metallicity degeneracy according to previous works.

The colour screen plate comprised a series of red, green and blue filters, laid down in a regular pattern of lines to form a réseau, or matrix. Because the negatives of the time required long exposure times, the colours in the screen plate were diluted to let more light through to the negative, resulting in a quicker exposure. A viewing screen with more intense colour filters was used in combination with the developed positive to project a <b>composite</b> <b>colour</b> image.|$|R
40|$|Within-population colour {{variation}} is widespread in animals, yet {{the determinants of}} variable coloration have been relatively neglected by ecologists. Age-dependent expression of conspicuous coloration is prevalent, particularly in birds. Such patterns can be generated by multiple combinations of demographic heterogeneity or within-individual change; longitudinal analyses are necessary to establish {{the importance of these}} processes. Further, although pigment-based <b>colours</b> are <b>composite</b> traits, produced by multiple component mechanisms (e. g. feather microstructure and carotenoid pigmentation), the contributions of these mechanisms to components of age dependence are rarely considered, even though doing so may yield information about the ecological causes for age-dependent coloration. We used a large-scale, longitudinal study of carotenoid-based plumage coloration in great tits (Parus major) to show age dependence of plumage coloration is driven almost exclusively by within-individual effects in the first 2  years of life. Using wavelength-specific analyses, we show that feather microstructure, while sensitive to annual variation, is independent of age, with increased carotenoid deposition driving changes in coloration. However, estimates of local carotenoid availability did not explain the change in coloration within individuals, suggesting that pigment availability may not be limiting. We thus show that it is individual-level changes in the pigment component of carotenoid-based coloration that determines age-dependent colour expression in great tits. More generally, our study highlights the utility of wavelength-specific analyses in determining the mechanisms underlying changes in expression of <b>composite</b> <b>colour</b> traits. This study investigates the increase in coloration accompanying the first- to second-year moult transition of great tits, finding that age-dependence of plumage coloration is driven almost exclusively by within-individual effects in the first 2 years of life. The results highlight the utility of wavelength-specific analyses in determining the mechanisms underlying changes in expression of <b>composite</b> <b>colour</b> traits. © 2012 The Authors.

The resin composites, filled with silanized OX- 50 and silanized diatomite (40 : 60 wt/wt), presented the best flexural strength (133. 1 MPa), elastic modulus (9. 5 GPa) and Vickers microhardness (104. 0 HV).

Multispectral Image fusion is the process of combining images optically acquired in more than one spectral band. In this paper, we present a pixel-level image fusion that combines four images from four different spectral bands namely near infrared(0. 76 - 0. 90 um), mid infrared(1. 55 - 1. 75 um),thermal- infrared(10. 4 - 12. 5 um) and mid infrared(2. 08 - 2. 35 um) to give a <b>composite</b> <b>colour</b> image.

40|$|Abstract:Quality of the <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> {{video signal}} {{has become the}} basic {{criteria}} of today’s TV transmission systems (Terrestrial / Satellite / Cable). Video streaming is increasingly finding its way in day-to-day lives of people. The videos typically passes through several processing stages {{before they reach the}} end user. The effect of most processing stages is to degrade the quality of the video that passes through it. The only reliable method to assess the video quality perceived by a human observer is to ask human subjects for their opinion, which is termed subjective video quality assessment (VQA). Subjective VQA is impractical for most applications due to the human involvement in the process. Hence we go for objective analysis, which includes the verifying <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> Video Signal parameters like sync pulses, colour burst and the luminance.

40|$|This study proposes an {{efficient}} algorithm for colour image compression with listless implementation based on set partition block embedded coding (SPECK). The {{objective of this}} work is to develop an algorithm that exploits the redundancy in colour spaces, low complexity quadtree partitioning and reduced memory requirements. Colour images are first transformed into luminance chrominance (YCbCr) planes and a wavelet transform is applied. A reduction of the memory requirement is achieved {{with the introduction of}} a state marker that matches each colour plane to eliminate the list with dynamic memory in the original colour SPECK coder (CSPECK). The wavelet coefficients are scanned using Z-order that matches the subband decompositions. The proposed algorithm then encodes the de-correlated colour plane as one unit and generates a mixed bit stream. The linear indexing and initial state marker are modified to jointly test the chrominance plane together. <b>Composite</b> <b>colour</b> coding enables precise control of the bit rate. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable with CSPECK, set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) and JPEG 2000 but with less memory requirements.

This paper presents the output achievable by a micro‐UAV for the rapid generation of aerial imagery, digital terrain models (DTM) and broadband vegetation indices for archaeological prospection from a single platform. Combined, these datasets can be used in the rapid survey of areas of interest that would not normally be considered practical due to time and cost implications and to identify archaeological features that are not readily visible in aerial imagery alone. The adoption of a single platform with a dual camera set up was used to generate a suite of datasets covering and area of 10 km 2 in seven flights. This study provides a work‐flow protocol for the deployment of a micro‐UAV in terms of data acquisition and processing {{that can be used for}} site prospection and site investigation. Real‐time processing of the aerial imagery and generation of well established broadband indices (e. g. normalized vegetation index (NDVI), false <b>colour</b> <b>composites,</b> NDVI <b>colour</b> <b>composites)</b> enabled in‐field decision making and planning to maximise the best use of researchers in the field.

The catalogue merges data from standard surveys and catalogues (Principal Galaxy Catalogue, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, HyperLeda, and the NASA Extragalactic Database) and provides detailed morphological information. Imaging data are obtained from the SDSS DR 4 in the u, g, r, i, and z bands for a sample of 4458 PGC galaxies, whereas photometric and spectroscopic data are obtained from the SDSS DR 5 catalogue. Point-Spread Function models are derived in all five bands. <b>Composite</b> <b>colour</b> images of all objects are visually examined {{by a group of}} astronomers, and galaxies are staged along the Hubble sequence and classified according to 16 morphological attributes describing their structure, texture, as well as environment and appearance on a five-level scale.

The main characteristics and reliability of the catalogue are examined, including photometric completeness, type mix, systematic trends and correlations. The final EFIGI database is a large sub-sample of the local Universe, with a dense sampling of Sd, Sdm, Sm and Im types compared to magnitude-limited catalogues.
