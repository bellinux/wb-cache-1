The two <b>coccolith</b> types were originally thought to be produced by different families of coccolithophores. Now, however, it is known through a mix of observations on field samples and laboratory cultures, that the two <b>coccolith</b> types are produced by the same species but at different life cycle phases.

40|$|Workshop on Assessment of Mesozoic Calcareous Nannoplankton Diversity and Evolution, Rutgers Univ, New Brunswick, NJ, DEC, 2003 International audienceThe coccolithophores {{are among}} the few organisms of the {{phytoplankton}} to calcify. Although together with the planktonic foraminifera they dominate calcite production in the open ocean, the amount of calcite they secrete is difficult to deter-mine. The amount of calcite {{in the form of}} <b>coccoliths</b> that is dissolved during sedimentation is also difficult to estimate as is the amount of calcite represented by sedimented <b>coccoliths.</b> Because of their minuteness, <b>coccoliths</b> cannot be directly weighed. Instead. indirect methods must be used to estimate their weight. I describe here a method that allows quick estimations of the weight of individual <b>coccoliths.</b> based on the measure of their brightness when viewed in cross-polarized light. This birefringence method can only be applied to the group Heliolithae (excluding some of the <b>coccoliths</b> produced in the Family Coccolithaceae). For Coccolithaceae and some Ortholithae an estimate of the weight can be made using a correcting factor. The birefringence method is highly reproducible (+/- 0. 13 pg). However, a significant systematic error of 13. 5 % may occur when <b>coccoliths</b> with asymmetrical appearance in cross polarized light (e. g., Helicospheara carteri) are not measured in specific orientations...|$|R
50|$|Coccoliths {{are formed}} within the cell in vesicles {{derived from the}} golgi body. When the <b>coccolith</b> is {{complete}} these vesicles fuse with the cell wall and the <b>coccolith</b> is exocytosed and incorporated in the coccosphere. The coccoliths are either dispersed following death and breakup of the coccosphere, or are shed continually by some species. They sink through the water column to form {{an important part of}} the deep-sea sediments (depending on the water depth). Thomas Huxley was the first person to observe these forms in modern marine sediments and he gave them the name 'coccoliths' in a report published in 1858.Coccoliths are composed of calcium carbonate as the mineral calcite and are the main constituent of chalk deposits such as the white cliffs of Dover (deposited in Cretaceous times), in which they were first described by Henry Clifton Sorby in 1861.|$|E
50|$|Research also {{suggests}} that ocean acidification due to increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere may affect the calcification machinery of coccolithophores. This may not only affect immediate events such as increases in population or <b>coccolith</b> production, but also may induce evolutionary adaptation of coccolithophore species over longer periods of time. For example, coccolithophores use H+ ion channels in to constantly pump H+ ions out of the cell during <b>coccolith</b> production. This allows them to avoid acidosis, as <b>coccolith</b> production would otherwise produce a toxic excess of H+ ions. When the function of these ion channels is disrupted, the coccolithophores stop the calcification process to avoid acidosis, thus forming a feedback loop. Low ocean alkalinity, impairs ion channel function and therefore places evolutionary selective pressure on coccolithophores and makes them (and other ocean calcifiers) vulnerable to ocean acidification. In 2008, field evidence indicating an increase in calcification of newly formed ocean sediments containing coccolithophores bolstered the first ever experimental data showing that an increase in ocean CO2 concentration results {{in an increase in}} calcification of these organisms.Decreasing <b>coccolith</b> mass is related to both the increasing concentrations of CO2 and decreasing concentrations of CO3 in the world’s oceans. This lower calcification is assumed to put coccolithophores at ecological disadvantage. Some species like Calcidiscus leptoporus, however, are not affected in this way, while the most abundant coccolithophore species, E. huxleyi might be (study results are mixed). Also, highly calcified coccolithophorids have been found in conditions of low CO−3 contrary to predictions. Understanding the effects of increasing ocean acidification on coccolithophore species is absolutely essential to predicting the future chemical composition of the ocean, particularly its carbonate chemistry. Viable conservation and management measures will come from future research in this area. Groups like the European-based CALMARO are monitoring the responses of coccolithophore populations to varying pH’s and working to determine environmentally sound measures of control.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coccolith</b> fossils are {{prominent}} and valuable calcareous nannofossils (see Micropaleontology). Of particular interest are fossils {{dating back to}} the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago. This period is thought to correspond most directly to the current levels of CO2 in the ocean. [...] Finally, field evidence of coccolithophore fossils in rock were used to show that the deep-sea fossil record bears a rock record bias similar to the one that is widely accepted to affect the land-based fossil record.|$|E

[...] Because of their abundance and wide geographic ranges, the <b>coccoliths</b> which make up the layers of this ooze and the chalky sediment formed as it is compacted serve as valuable microfossils.|$|R
50|$|Tuffeau {{dates to}} the Mesozoic era (Upper Cretaceous Turonian stage). The Loire Valley formed {{the floor of a}} vast sea 90 million years ago. Over the millennia, {{sediment}} from the sea floor, comprising fossilized living organisms and sand particles, became compressed to form what is now known as Tuffeau stone. It differs from genuine chalk by the presence of foraminifera and many remains of shells originally deposited in shallow water (between 2 and 20 meters) and subsequently agitated, near a coastline. In contrast, true chalk is rich in another type of shelly micro-fossil, the <b>coccolith,</b> which was deposited in deeper (~ 200 meters), and quieter, water.|$|E
50|$|Chalk is a {{limestone}} {{that consists}} of <b>coccolith</b> biomicrite. A biomicrite is a limestone composed of fossil debris ("bio") and calcium carbonate mud ("micrite"). Most of the fossil debris in chalk consists of the microscopic plates, which are called coccoliths, of microscopic green algae known as coccolithophores. In addition to the coccoliths, the fossil debris includes a variable, but minor, percentage of the fragments of foraminifera, ostracods and mollusks. The coccolithophores lived in {{the upper part of}} the water column. When they died, the microscopic calcium carbonate plates, which formed their shells settled downward through the ocean water and accumulated on the ocean bottom to form a thick layer of calcareous ooze, which eventually became the Chalk Group.|$|E
50|$|In case {{of marine}} sediments, ooze does {{not refer to}} a sediment's consistency, but to its composition, which {{directly}} reflects its origin. Ooze is pelagic sediment that consists of at least 30% of microscopic remains of either calcareous or siliceous planktonic debris organisms. The remainder typically consists almost entirely of clay minerals. As a result, the grain size of oozes is often bimodal with a well-defined biogenic silt- to sand-size fraction and siliciclastic clay-size fraction. Oozes can be defined by and classified according to the predominate organism that compose them. For example, there are diatom, <b>coccolith,</b> foraminifera, globigerina, pteropod, and radiolarian oozes. Oozes are also classified and named according to their mineralogy, i.e. calcareous or siliceous oozes. Whatever their composition, all oozes accumulate extremely slowly, at {{no more than a}} few centimeters per millennium.|$|E

50|$|While {{the exact}} {{function}} of the coccosphere is unclear, many potential functions have been proposed. Most obviously coccoliths may protect the phytoplankton from predators. In addition, these exoskeletons may confer an advantage in energy production, as coccolithogenesis seems highly coupled with photosynthesis. Organic precipitation of calcium carbonate from bicarbonate solution produces free carbon dioxide directly within the cellular body of the alga, this additional source of gas is then available to the Coccolithophore for photosynthesis. It {{has been suggested that}} they may provide a cell-wall like barrier to isolate intracellular chemistry from the marine environment. More specific, defensive properties of coccoliths may include protection from osmotic changes, chemical or mechanical shock, and short-wavelength light. It has also been proposed that the added weight of multiple layers of coccoliths allows the organism to sink to lower, more nutrient rich layers of the water and conversely, that coccoliths add buoyancy, stopping the cell from sinking to dangerous depths. <b>Coccolith</b> appendages have also been proposed to serve several functions, such as inhibiting grazing by zooplankton.|$|E
5000|$|Emiliania huxleyi {{was named}} after Thomas Huxley and Cesare Emiliani, who {{were the first to}} examine sea-bottom {{sediment}} and discover the coccoliths within it. It is believed to have evolved approximately 270,000 years ago from the older genus Gephyrocapsa Kampter c. [...] and became dominant in planktonic assemblages, and thus in the fossil record, approximately 70,000 years ago. It is the most numerically abundant and widespread coccolithophore species. The species is divided into seven morphological forms called morphotypes based on differences in <b>coccolith</b> structure (See Nannotax for more detail on these forms). Its coccoliths are transparent and commonly colourless, but are formed of calcite which refracts light very efficiently in the water column. This, and the high concentrations caused by continual shedding of their coccoliths makes E. huxleyi blooms easily visible from space. Satellite images show that blooms can cover areas of more than 10,000 km, with complementary shipboard measurements indicating that E. huxleyi is by far the dominant phytoplankton species under these conditions. This species has been an inspiration for James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis which claims that living organisms collectively self-regulate biogeochemistry and climate at nonrandom metastable states.|$|E
50|$|Coccolithophore blooms are {{typically}} not harmful to marine {{life in the}} ocean. As these organisms thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, the coccolithophores offer a source of nutrition for small fish and zooplankton. E. huxylei viruses (EhVs) {{have been shown to}} be linked to the termination of these blooms. The termination stage of the bloom is indicated by a color change in the water. When large amounts of coccoliths (carbonate shell surrounding E. huxylei) are shed from E. huxylei cells from cell death or lysis, the water turns white or turquoise. In areas of dense bloom termination, the white color is reflective and can be seen in satellite imagery. Wilson et al. (2002) used analytical flow cytometry to measure the abundance of viruses at different locations in and around the bloom area. The researchers found that the concentrations of viruses were higher inside the 'high reflectance area', suggesting that virus-induced lysis of E. huxleyi cells resulted in <b>coccolith</b> detachment. Other studies by Martinez et al. (2007) and Bratbak et al. (1993) found higher concentrations of EhV viruses as the E. huxleyi bloom declined, indicating that lytic viral infection was the main cause of bloom termination. EhV viruses therefore have important roles in regulating biomass production in marine environments and ecological succession. This regulation of coccolithophore populations by EhV viruses therefore has significant effects on biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon cycle.|$|E

In general, the <b>coccolith</b> assemblage is dominated by Gephyrocapsa muellerae and Emiliania huxleyi, whilst significant changes in palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic conditions are mainly shown by variations of subordinate species. A drastic increase in <b>coccolith</b> accumulation rates and a change from a less to a higher diverse species assemblage indicate a rapid increase in surface water temperatures during the onset of MIS 5 from c. 127. 5 ky on. Highest <b>coccolith</b> numbers, high numbers of taxa and a large diversity indicate highest coccolithophore primary productivity and peak interglacial conditions during MIS 5. 5, which are due to the high influence of relatively warm surface water to this region. <b>Coccolith</b> numbers peak again around 120 ky and decline afterwards but stay above glacial levels. The two cooling events of MIS 5. 4 and 5. 2 interrupt the generally warm conditions and are indicated by lowered <b>coccolith</b> numbers, a drop of thermophile species and a reduction of the species diversity. Decreasing <b>coccolith</b> numbers and a slightly reduced diversity indicate that environmental conditions deteriorated towards the onset of MIS 4. The analysis of the <b>coccolith</b> assemblage reveals that not only the stadial events MIS 5. 4 and 5. 2 are characterised by colder conditions, but furthermore confirms the upcoming notion that MIS 5. 5 was terminated by a slight short-term cooling of the surface water which occurred around 124 ky...|$|E

40|$|The Sr/Ca {{ratio of}} coccoliths was {{recently}} proposed {{as a potential}} indicator of past growth rates of coccolithophorids, marine algae, which play key roles in both the global carbonate and carbon cycles. We synthesize calibrations of this proxy through laboratory culture studies and analysis of monospecific <b>coccolith</b> assemblages from surface sediments. Cultures of coccolithophorids Helicosphaera carteri, Syracosphaera pulchra and Algirospira robusta confirm a 12 % increase in Sr/Ca per °C previously identified in Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. This effect is not due merely to increases in growth rate with temperature and {{must be considered in}} palaeoceanographic studies. In light-limited cultures of E. huxleyi, Calcidiscus leptoporus and G. oceanica at constant temperature, <b>coccolith</b> Sr/Ca ratios vary by 10 % across the range of possible growth and calcification rates for a given species. Among dioerent species under similar culture conditions, Sr/Ca ratios vary by 30 %. Although the highest ratios are in the cells with highest calcifcation and organic carbon fixation rates, at lower rates there is much scatter, indicating that dioerent mechanisms control interspecific and intraspecioc <b>coccolith</b> Sr/Ca variations. In field studies in the Equatorial Pacific and Somalia coastal region, <b>coccolith</b> Sr/Ca correlates with upwelling intensity and productivity. A more dynamic response is observed in larger coccoliths like C. leptoporus (2355 % variation in Sr/Ca) than in smaller coccoliths of G. oceanica or Florisphaera profunda (615 % variation in Sr/Ca). This response suggests that, despite temperature effects, <b>coccolith</b> Sr/Ca has potential as an indicator of coccolithophorid productivity. If the variable Sr/Ca response of dioerent species accurately reflects their variable productivity response to upwelling (and not different slopes of Sr/Ca with productivity), <b>coccolith</b> Sr/Ca could provide useful data on past changes in <b>coccolith</b> ecology.
