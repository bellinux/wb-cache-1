5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive <b>cut-outs</b> {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between column and deck-box on a semi-submersible platform is often subjected to high stress concentrations {{that can be}} governing for the structural strength. One common design used to withstand the high stresses is a cast integral in high tensile material, which is both heavy and expensive to manufacture, which is why an alternative <b>cut-out</b> design is investigated. This thesis aims at analysing the current node connection, with a finite element analysis (FEA), with regard to yield stresses, buckling, fatigue damage, weight and cost in order to propose an alternative <b>cut-out</b> design using the same criteria. The cast integral, which is analysed as a reference case and used for comparison of designs, is of a typical design used by GVA Consultants AB. The alternative <b>cut-out</b> design is first studied in a simplified two-dimensional (2 D) case, developed with applied loads and boundary conditions following recommendations from the classification society DNV-GL. Different geometrical <b>cut-out</b> shapes used in other applications are tested and evaluated. The <b>cut-out</b> design with the lowest yield stresses is implemented and further evaluated in {{a case study of}} a complete semisubmersible production platform. The <b>cut-out</b> design is investigated with a parametric study for the complete loading condition, which is defined from previous calculations performed by GVA. The <b>cut-out</b> is analysed with both the simplified fatigue assessment and with a stochastic approach, in order to investigate differences and inaccuracies in the methods. The parametric study shows that the use of a <b>cut-out</b> design may be advantageous in the centre bulkhead {{connection between}} the column and the deck-box. The adjacent geometry is of simple character and the <b>cut-out</b> does not affect the overall structural design. The <b>cut-out</b> is found to be a feasible alternative to the cast integral, with yield stresses and fatigue damage in the same range. Further refinements of the <b>cut-out</b> design could, however, decrease both yield stresses and fatigue damage, which is why the cutout is recommended in future work. The suggested <b>cut-out</b> solution leads to a decrease of 4. 5 % in weight for a reference structure. For the same reference structure the production cost is estimated to decrease by 9. 5 %, hence, the <b>cut-out</b> design is recommended for the centre bulkhead connection. However, it is concluded that the <b>cut-out</b> design is only developed for one specific semisubmersible platform in specific load conditions, for which reason further analysis and adjustments are needed for other applications and structures...|$|R

5|$|The film {{included}} several technical errors. Cut-out cardboard pieces {{were used to}} depict military aircraft during battle scenes in the film, and one film critic said viewers were almost {{able to identify the}} threads attached to the cardboard <b>cut-outs.</b> Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film, though this technology would not be invented for twenty-five years after the film's time period. There were other problems. Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film's production. A set-piece for the film included a re-created version of a lighthouse at Incheon, but this was obliterated by a typhoon. The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots.|$|E

25|$|Solutions of Donnell's eight order {{differential}} equation gives the various buckling modes of a thin cylinder under compression. But this analysis, {{which is in}} accordance with the small deflection theory gives much higher values than shown from experiments. So it is customary to find the critical buckling load for various structures which are cylindrical in shape from empirically based design curves wherein the critical buckling load Fcr is plotted against the ratio R/t, where R is the radius and t is the thickness of the cylinder for various values of L/R, L the length of the cylinder. If <b>cut-outs</b> are present in the cylinder, critical buckling loads as well as pre-buckling modes will be affected. Presence or absence of reinforcements of <b>cut-outs</b> will also affect the buckling load.|$|E

25|$|Two {{aircraft}}, with {{serial numbers}} N249 & N250 were built, the first flying on 25 August 1929 {{and the second}} on 31 August. The aircraft showed promise and high speed but had problems with fuel supply when banking, which led to engine <b>cut-outs.</b> For such a risky business as low-altitude air-racing, this was an unacceptable risk and the aircraft were withdrawn from competition in the 1929 Schneider Trophy, leaving the way clear for the Supermarine S.6 to win.|$|E

The Model 7 was the first type to use the end stop <b>cut-out</b> and it also featured an acceleration trip which, {{in the event of}} heavy overloads, could open the <b>cut-out</b> before the pointer had reached two-thirds of full scale. The acceleration <b>cut-out</b> was not however used in the Model 8. From the Mark III version, the Model 8 had further protection by a fuse on its resistance ranges and fuse protection was provided on all ranges of the Model 8 Marks 6 & 7.|$|R
50|$|Pressuretrols have 2 settings: A main cut-in or <b>cut-out</b> setting (depending on model), and a {{differential}} setting (which {{is either}} additive or subtractive, and usually stated on the controller). The main setting is accessible {{from the outside}} of the controller, but the differential is often located inside the controller box, and typically the cover must be removed by removing a screw to access the differential control. If the main setting is a cut-in setting, then the differential setting sets the <b>cut-out</b> setpoint by adding to the cut-in setting(additive), and if the main setting is a <b>cut-out</b> setting, then the differential sets the cut-in by subtracting from the <b>cut-out</b> setting (subtractive).|$|R

Series production commenced in October 1917, with 121 Dolphins delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{fuselage}} the empennage was steel framed and fabric covered. The tailplanes were mounted just below the top of the fuselage, each braced from below with a single strut and carrying a balanced elevator. A curved, deep, balanced rudder, mounted on a small fin and slightly pointed on top, worked in elevator <b>cut-outs.</b> The airliner had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The two mainwheels were mounted independently on V-struts from the lower fuselage with near-vertical oleo struts to the wing roots. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of Wizard on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and {{published}} Dot and Tot of Merryland in 1901. The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with John R. Neill on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published The Oz Toy Book: <b>Cut-outs</b> for the Kiddies without authorization.|$|E

These special qualities deserve to be recognized and re-introduced. This research analyzes the genre-specific characteristics of <b>cut-out</b> animation with the goal to preserve and to further develop this animation form via a digital workflow. Findings {{of this study suggest that}} most of the characteristics of traditional <b>cut-out</b> animation can be preserved, and even improved, through a careful digital transition from analogue to digital production design...|$|R
50|$|A shadow puppet is a <b>cut-out</b> figure held {{between a}} source of light and a {{translucent}} screen. Shadow puppets can form solid silhouettes or be decorated with various amounts of <b>cut-out</b> details. Colour can be introduced into the <b>cut-out</b> shapes to provide a different dimension and different effects {{can be achieved by}} moving the puppet (or light source) out of focus. Javanese shadow puppets known as Wayang Kulit are the classic example of this. In China, it became popular from Song Dynasty.|$|R

Her paintings and sculpture have been exhibited in galleries, educational settings, and nursing homes throughout the state of Virginia. Carolyn is an abstract colorist, whose preferred medium is acrylic. Influenced by the non-representational style of Jackson Pollock and by the Washington, D.C. color field painter, Sam Gilliam, Carolyn experiments with color effects to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Inspired by the late work of Henri Matisse, Carolyn creates textured <b>cut-outs</b> to achieve a representational effect.|$|E
25|$|Both the Vampire and the Greif flew at the 3rd Rhön {{contests}} in {{the summer}} of 1922. It was expected than the Greif would out-perform the older Vampyr but despite encouraging early trials it did not; on the same day and under similar conditions the Vampyr flew for over three hours but the Greif could only manage 26 minutes. The cut-out in the leading edge for the pilot seems to have greatly increased the induced drag; the losses were much greater than those caused by similar sized trailing edge <b>cut-outs</b> on other designs, as the pressure differences between upper and lower surfaces and the strength of the associated lossy vortexes are smaller there.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the paper}} cut-out was Matisse’s major medium {{in the final}} decade of his life, his first {{recorded}} use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the Le chant du rossignol, an opera made by Igor Stravinsky. Albert C. Barnes arranged for cardboard templates {{to be made of}} the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of <b>cut-outs</b> were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the work}} of the border guards focused on {{maintaining}} and scrutinising the border defences. This included carrying out repair work, looking for evidence of escape attempts, examining the area for signs of suspicious activities and so on. The patrol times and routes were deliberately varied to ensure that there was no predictability, ensuring that a patrol could potentially appear at any time from either direction. Guards posted in watchtowers {{played an important role in}} monitoring the border, though shortages of personnel meant that the watchtowers were not continuously manned. During the final years of the East German state, the lack of manpower was so severe that cardboard <b>cut-outs</b> of guards were placed in towers to present the illusion that they were occupied.|$|E
25|$|Romanian conceded {{defeat in}} May 1918, and the Academy could resume work in Bucharest under a German-friendly Conservative regime, with Alexandru Marghiloman as Prime Minister. In October, Bianu joined his {{returning}} peers and {{reported on the}} damages incurred during the previous years. He scandalized public opinion further after ordering public mourning at the Academy {{after the death of}} a pro-Austrian cleric, Vasile Mangra. The loyalist government was fully restored in Bucharest within a month, following the unexpected defeat of Germany, which led to the establishment of Greater Romania (which included united Transylvania). In December, Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu was welcomed by the Academy. According to the now-disgraced Marghiloman, his supporters were either barred from attending or, in Bianu's case, silenced. In this new climate, Bianu was investigated by an Academy commission as a wartime collaborator in March 1919, but refused to present himself for questioning. As he put it, the group investigating him only relied on <b>cut-outs</b> from the anti-Germanophile press.|$|E
