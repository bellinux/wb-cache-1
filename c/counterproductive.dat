5|$|Criticising {{mainstream}} Western {{education as}} <b>counterproductive</b> to {{the ethos of}} the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools {{for the education of}} children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro took {{a congressional}} trip to Nicaragua {{at the start}} of 1984, where she spoke to the Contras. She decided that the Reagan Administration's {{military}} interventions there and in El Salvador were <b>counterproductive</b> towards reaching U.S. security goals, and that regional negotiations would be better.|$|E
5|$|Graham Cluley, a {{security}} expert for Sophos, argued that Anonymous' actions against child porn websites hosted on a darknet could be <b>counterproductive,</b> commenting that while their intentions may be good, {{the removal of}} illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French {{military}} accused Huế of surreptitiously supporting Định in contravention of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be <b>counterproductive</b> in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via price controls, was <b>counterproductive</b> and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are <b>counterproductive</b> when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{responded to}} the attack by {{increasing}} its drone attacks against militants in Pakistan. Nearly every day after the CIA facility was attacked, the U.S. military conducted drone strikes aimed at leaders of the Haqqani network in North Waziristan. In the week after the attack, the U.S. military conducted five drone strikes, an unusually high number. However, U.S. counter-terrorism officials cautioned against linking these attacks to the bombing. After reports of drone strikes, Pakistan {{said it would not}} support the attacks in its territory, as they were <b>counterproductive.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also <b>counterproductive,</b> as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be <b>counterproductive</b> for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be <b>counterproductive.</b> The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as the first sequel to their 1985 bestseller Super Mario Bros. The games are similar in style and gameplay, apart from a steep increase in difficulty. Like the original, Mario or Luigi venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. Unlike the original, the game has no two-player option and Luigi is differentiated from his twin plumber brother with reduced ground friction and increased jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks such as poison mushroom power-ups, <b>counterproductive</b> level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 levels across eight worlds, and five bonus worlds.|$|E
5|$|The failed {{offensive}} {{was investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG {{as a cause of}} the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training. Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised the offensive as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically <b>counterproductive</b> move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} sold {{and the new}} owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his wife Delia, a sculptor; and his goth {{daughter}} Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove <b>counterproductive,</b> despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, was met with outrage by the Serbian puppet government, which responded with pleas, interventions and threats of resignation. The killings led German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of mass reprisal shootings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. The killing of airplane factory workers in Kraljevo convinced the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also <b>counterproductive.</b> The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether that autumn. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy Hermann Neubacher.|$|E
5|$|Four of XXIBomber Command's {{next five}} raids were made against targets in Nagoya. The first {{two of these}} attacks on 13 and 18December used {{precision}} bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test {{the effectiveness of these}} weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to area bombardment would be <b>counterproductive,</b> but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXIBomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27December, but did not damage the facility. On 3January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an area bombing raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved <b>counterproductive</b> as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E
5|$|Several senior German {{military}} officials were tried and convicted for {{their involvement in}} the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg trials and the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The massacre {{had a profound effect}} on the course of the war in Yugoslavia. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led Partisans and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, and convinced Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and <b>counterproductive,</b> as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park and the co-located 21stOctober Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were <b>counterproductive</b> as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E
25|$|The {{forms of}} <b>counterproductive</b> {{behavior}} {{with the most}} empirical examination are ineffective job performance, absenteeism, job turnover, and accidents. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of <b>counterproductive</b> behavior have also been investigated including violence and sexual harassment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Counterproductive</b> work {{behavior}} (CWB) can {{be defined}} as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result {{from a wide range of}} underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft). It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of <b>counterproductive</b> behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the <b>counterproductive</b> behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, four former {{clients of}} JONAH sued the {{organization}} for fraud, claiming that it sold them therapies that were ineffective and <b>counterproductive.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} weight loss to be permanent, changes in diet and {{lifestyle}} must be permanent as well. Short-term dieting has not been shown to produce either long term weight loss or better health, and may even be <b>counterproductive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conscientious {{employees}} {{are generally more}} reliable, more motivated, and harder working. They also have lower rates of absenteeism and <b>counterproductive</b> work behaviors such as stealing and fighting with other employees. Furthermore, conscientiousness is the only personality trait that correlates with performance across all categories of jobs.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in <b>counterproductive</b> work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and <b>counterproductive)</b> behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, 1983, ASALA {{carried out}} another attack at the Orly Airport near Paris, in which 8 people were killed, {{most of them}} not being Turks. The attack {{resulted}} in a split in ASALA, between those individuals who carried it out, and those who believed the attack to be <b>counterproductive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of estradiol-like compounds {{has been}} observed in leguminous plants, such as Phaseolus vulgaris and soybeans. where they are termed phytoestrogens. Thus, consumption may have oestrogenic effects. In light of this, consumption can be <b>counterproductive</b> to patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer, which usually includes depriving the cancer cells of estrogens.|$|E
25|$|He told General Jones that Iranian {{internal}} turmoil {{presented an}} opportunity to weaken the regime—which he encouraged—but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements {{in support of the}} reformers were <b>counterproductive.</b> The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained.|$|E
25|$|Banks or governments relying {{heavily on}} {{seigniorage}} and fractional reserve sources of revenue {{can find it}} <b>counterproductive.</b> Rational expectations of inflation take into account a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means.|$|E
25|$|The Junta of Aranjuez {{provided}} {{that each of}} the Spanish colonies send a representative to participate in its deliberations. This provision had a <b>counterproductive</b> effect in New Spain. The Spanish party feared {{it was the beginning of}} colonial autonomy, a position it had long opposed. The Criollos deemed a single representative much too minor a concession to be of value.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{result of}} the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point will become <b>counterproductive</b> for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.|$|E
25|$|Those who deliver {{training}} must exemplify both military {{skills and}} cultural sensitivity. While one's own country might consider searching after-action reviews a recognized learning experience, such techniques are <b>counterproductive</b> {{in countries where}} even one-on-one direct criticism is insulting, {{and even more so}} if criticism is delivered in front of third parties. Especially in intelligence and psychological operations, the FID and HN personnel should recognize they can learn from one another.|$|E
