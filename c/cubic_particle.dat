40|$|Recent {{divergence}} in analysing the magnetization {{processes in}} isolated particles between analytical micromagnetics and numerical micromagnetics {{has focused on}} whether {{it is necessary to}} use nucleation theory in the analysis. Complete saturation is the necessary condition for using nucleation theory. A ferromagnetic elliptical particle can be uniformly magnetized in a large field, As the field decreases, there exists a nucleation field at which the magnetization deviates from uniform magnetization. On the contrary, a ferromagnetic cube can never be saturatedly magnetized in any finite homogeneous field. It is difficult to apply the theory of a nucleation field of an elliptical particle to a <b>cubic</b> <b>particle.</b> One practical way to discuss the 'nucleation' in a <b>cubic</b> <b>particle</b> is to supervise the magnetization changes from a positive quasisaturation state to a negative quasisaturation state, and find what kind of reversal modes appear. In this paper, a three-dimensional micromagnetics model is implemented to analyse the magnetization reversal processes in cubic particles at a field (1. 1 x 10 (6) Oe) where the quasisaturation is well developed in a <b>cubic</b> <b>particle.</b> The sizes of particles vary from 400 - 1000 Angstrom. A fine mesh with 10 x 10 x 10 and a small decreasing step of applied field 10 Oe are used in the calculations. The 'nucleation' in a <b>cubic</b> <b>particle</b> starts from the quasiquantization state (flower state). For a particle whose size is smaller than 1000 Angstrom, the equilibrium magnetization states during magnetization reversal processes are a flower state and an anti-flower state, and a coherent rotation happens when the magnetization state changes from a flower state to an anti-flower state. For a larger particle with a size of 1000 Angstrom, there exist rather complicated equilibrium magnetization states i. e. a flower state, anticlockwise vortex state, intermediate state, clockwise vortex state, and anti-flower state all appear during the reversal processes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{critical}} instantaneous lift force required to move an initially stationary magnetic cube {{from the wall}} of a cylindrical pipe was examined using a novel method in which an electromagnet was employed. The electromagnet was used to control the contact force between the magnetic particle and the pipe wall by, in effect, varying the effective particle density from 1000 kgm⁻³ to more than 12, 000 kgm⁻³. This control over the effective particle density provided a simple and non-intrusive technique of determining {{the critical}} lift force acting on the <b>cubic</b> <b>particle</b> for a broad range of fluid velocities. The <b>cubic</b> <b>particle</b> was chosen to be greater in size than the depth of the von Kármán viscous sub-layer for the range of fluid velocities examined. Critical instantaneous lift forces deduced from the experimental data resulted in an average lift coefficient, CL, of 3 for pipe Reynolds numbers of Re < 20, 000. A wall-corrected drag coefficient, Cᴅᴡ, of Cᴅᴡ = 114 Rep ⁻⁰‧⁸ Cᴅ for 100 < Rep < 1000 was used to calculate the critical lift force, where Rep is the particle Reynolds number and Cᴅ the drag coefficient. The wall-corrected drag coefficient correlation given above was determined in separate experiments in which the horizontal displacement of the cube, after its sudden release from the soffit of the pipe, was recorded. The release was achieved by firstly holding the particle in position using a magnet and then rapidly removing the magnet. This paper appears {{to be the first to}} non-intrusively evaluate the critical instantaneous lift force acting on a specific <b>cubic</b> <b>particle</b> at the pipe wall over a broad range of superficial fluid velocities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractColloidal lipid {{particles}} such {{as solid}} lipid nanoparticles and liquid crystalline nanoparticles have great opportunities as drug carriers especially for lipophilic drugs intended for intravenous administration. In order to evaluate drug release from these nanoparticles and determine their behavior after administration, emulsion droplets {{were used as}} a lipophilic compartment to which the transfer of a model drug was measured. The detection of the model drug transferred from monoolein <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> and trimyristin solid lipid nanoparticles into emulsion droplets was performed using a flow cytometric technique. A higher rate and amount of porphyrin transfer from the solid lipid nanoparticles compared to the monoolein <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> was observed. This difference might {{be attributed to the}} formation of a highly ordered particle which leads to the expulsion of drug {{to the surface of the}} crystalline particle. Furthermore, the sponge-like structure of the monoolein <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> decreases the rate and amount of drug transferred. In conclusion, the flow cytometric technique is a suitable technique to study drug transfer from these carriers to large lipophilic acceptors. Monoolein <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> with their unique structure can be used successfully as a drug carrier with slow drug release compared with trimyristin nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency {{of a conventional}} fibrous filter was investigated with particular emphasis on the removal of particles with different shapes. A previous study has shown that particles of spherical shape are removed from the gas carrier with efficiencies which are higher when compared to <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> of the same aerodynamic size. In this project, to challenge our previously made explanation, spherical PSL and <b>cubic</b> MgO <b>particles</b> were tested along with particles of sodium chloride (NaCl) of intermediate shape (<b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> with rounded edges) at a range of filtration velocities from 5 to 20 cm/s. It was found that particles of NaCl are removed with efficiencies lower then those for PSL particles but higher than the efficiencies for <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> of MgO, at the lowest filtration velocity when inertial effects are egligible. The rounded NaCl particles, depending on the geometry of the contact, could either land on the rounded corner and hence roll, land on a sharp edge and hence tumble, or slide. This range of options alters the probability of detachment of the particle. The difference between the filter efficiencies for <b>cubic</b> MgO <b>particles</b> and intermediate shaped NaCl particles is decreasing {{with the increase in}} velocity. With increasing velocity, the {{filtration efficiency}} of the <b>cubic</b> MgO <b>particles,</b> exceeds the filtration efficiency for the intermediate shaped NaCl particles, due to the dominating inertial effects of the denser, and hence heavier, MgO particles.

The results indicate that the drag coefficient is closely related to the particle shape, especially at high Reynolds numbers. The voxel resolution of spherical particle plays a key role in accurately predicting the drag coefficient at high Reynolds numbers. For non-spherical particles, the drag coefficient is more influenced by the particle morphology at moderate or high Reynolds numbers than at low ones. The inclination angle has an important impact on the pressure drag force due to the change of projected area. The simulated drag coefficient agrees well with the experimental data or empirical correlation for both spherical and non-spherical particles...|$|E

However, the deposition mechanism in PJD is still under investigation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the shape of {{particles}} is an important factor that determines the fluid flow behavior of suspensions. Interactions of <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> with one another and with the flow medium are unique because of their sharp edges, corners and flat surfaces. Using theory, simulations and experiments, the structure and flow properties of cube-shaped particles in suspension over a range of volume fractions is studied to understand the effect of shape on fluid structure and rheology. At very low volume fractions, the sharp edges and corners of cubes are found to profoundly alter the velocity field around the cube. The stresslet-strain relationship for a cube is anisotropic and depends on the orientation of the cube with respect to the velocity flow field. The effective viscosity of the suspension in a simple shear flow is obtained by computing the orientationaly averaged stresslet acting on cubes. These calculations yield a universal intrinsic viscosity, [[eta]] = 3. 1 for sharp cubes, which is higher than the corresponding value for spheres [[eta]] = 5 / 2. Using the 2 D velocity flow profile around sharp corners we further find that the pressure becomes singular near the edges of the cube, which results in the increased value of stress and hence the higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles. In the presence of an external torque acting on each cube, the orientation distribution is no longer isotropic. This can be achieved by using magnetic cubes in magnetic field. The general expression for the stress in a suspension of mag- netic cubes subjected to linear velocity field in presence of an external magnetic field is calculated. We find that the intrinsic viscosity for the weakly Brownian suspension in a simple shear flow can be varied between [[eta]] = 3. 25 to [[eta]] = 5. 5 by changing the strength and the direction of the applied magnetic field. At low to moderate volume fractions, Brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to study the structure and flow behavior of suspensions. Simulations were performed over a wide range of volume fractions and Pe to study its rheological properties. Our equilibrium results show that <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> behave like spheres interacting with a soft repulsion potential function for volume fractions less than 0. 25. This soft repulsion potential captures the orientationally averaged excluded volume of the cubes and produces identical probability distributions as that of for cubes at very low volume fractions. For higher volume fractions, <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> starts to lose their orientational freedom resulting in the deviation of equilibrium properties from that of soft spheres. We also found that suspension of <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> when subjected to simple shear will produce higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles in suspensions with equivalent volume. We show that the suspension rheology in this regime can be discussed in terms of ordering and collisions among hard <b>cubic</b> <b>particles.</b> In order to gain insights from experiments, <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> of varying sizes (10 nm to 5 micron sized cubes) and chemistries (PbT e,Fe 3 O 4 and MnCO 3) were synthesized. Polymer brushes were also attached on the surfaces of PbT e and Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes to characterize the effect of particle surface chemistry on flow behavior. MnCO 3 spherical particles of similar sizes as that of MnCO 3 cubes were also synthesized and their suspension behavior studied to empirically characterize the effects of shape. A key result from this study is that irrespective of the cube size, size distribution, and surface chemistry, the intrinsic viscosity([[eta]]) for cube-shaped particles is [[eta]] = 3. 1 ± 0. 2 which agrees well with the value estimated from theory. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R

The development of next-generation energy storage devices with high power and high-energy density {{is a key to}} the prosperity of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles (EVs and HEVs, respectively), which are expected to replace conventional vehicles if only gradually, and help solve the problems of air pollution and climate change. In the field of energy storage, the nanotechnological market potential concerns first and foremost, enhanced batteries for portable electronics or hybrid and electric vehicles, nano-optimized supercapacitors and nonporous hydrogen storage materials. The world market for battery materials showed double-digit growth amounting to more than 1. 2 billion dollars. Lithium, aluminum, iron, and zinc show great promise for use in air batteries. Among these metals, zinc, particularly as a nanoparticle, has attracted great interest due to its low equivalent weight, abundance, and high energy density. Zinc has received the most consideration as a potential metal-air battery candidate, because it is an electropositive metal that is relatively stable in aqueous and alkaline electrolytes without significant corrosion. It has been used over many years in commercial primary zinc-air batteries. A promising high-capacity power source for portable applications as well as in larger sizes, such as for electric vehicles, can be achieved through the development of a practical rechargeable zinc-air battery that has an extended life cycle. Moreover, it would also be safe and environmentally friendly. When microwave or radio-frequency-induced plasma is generated at the surface of a metallic electrode submerged into a liquid, nanoparticles are synthesized by erosion of the electrode. In-liquid plasma has been successful in the synthesis of many kinds of nanoparticles such as zinc, zinc oxide, tungsten oxide, silver, gold, and magnesium hydroxide just to name a few. By applying plasma to a zinc electrode in an alcoholic solvent, metallic zinc nanoparticles are produced, while, in water, a mixture of zinc and zinc oxide nanoparticles is formed. This suggests that the oxidative or reductive atmosphere of the vapor of the liquid determines the physical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles. Plasma can be observed easily in the vapor, which is generated by the evaporation of the surrounding liquid. During plasma generation, characteristic Zn lines were detected at 468. 0, 472. 2 ??? 481. 1 and 636. 2 nm, and the excitation temperature was approximately 3400 K as estimated from emission intensity of these lines by the Boltzmann plot method. After plasma irradiation, there is a great reduction as the absorbance decreases. On the short-wavelength side where a Zn peak is assumed to have been observed, the peak height increased during the elapsed time of plasma generation. While on the long-wavelength side where a ZnO peak was observed, the peak height decreased. The Beer-Lambert law predicts that the intensity of an absorption peak is directly proportional to the concentration of the compound. The TEM images of ZnO nanoparticles before plasma generation were a mixture of rectangular and hexagonal crystals of 50 to 200 nm in length and rods approximately 200 nm in length.

A unique sunflower-like eutectic colony structure was observed, where theNi–Al-rich B 2 phase formed as the primary phasewith a spherical or ellipsoidalmorphology, theNi–Al-rich B 2 /Cr-rich A 2 eutectics grew on the primary phase in a radial manner, and the primary B 2 phase further decomposed into nearly <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> dispersed in the matrix at lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{hot-rolled}} {{ship plate}} with high strength and high toughness is successfully developed through chemical composition design and TMCP process. Experimental methods, such as OM, TEM and X-EDS, {{were used to}} study the microstructure and precipitates of steel. The primary microstructural constituent is acicular ferrite, quasi-polygonal ferrite with second constituents along grain boundaries. Lath width of acicular ferrite is about 1 µm. <b>Cubic</b> <b>particles</b> about several hundreds nanometers and nanometer particles exist in experimental steel. It can be concluded that acicular ferrite {{is the main reason}} for high strength and super toughness. precipitation hardening due to dispersed precipitations of carbonitrides can not be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} 3 D simulations of complex effective permittivity and permeability for random binary mixtures of <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> below the percolation threshold. We compare two topological classes {{that correspond to}} different spatial particle arrangements: cermet topology and aggregate topology. At a low filling factor of f= 10 %, where most particles are surrounded by matrix material, the respective effective material parameters are indistinguishable. At higher concentrations, a systematic difference emerges: cermet topology is characterized by lower effective permittivity and permeability values. A distinction between topological classes might thus be a useful concept {{for the analysis of}} real systems, especially in cases where no exact effective-medium model is available...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of magnetic nanoparticles is intimately entwined with their structure, mean size and magnetic anisotropy. Besides, ensembles offer {{a unique way}} of engineering the magnetic response by modifying {{the strength of the}} dipolar interactions between particles. Here we report on an experimental and theoretical analysis of magnetic hyperthermia, a rapidly developing technique in medical research and oncology. Experimentally, we demonstrate that single-domain <b>cubic</b> iron oxide <b>particles</b> resembling bacterial magnetosomes have superior magnetic heating efficiency compared to spherical particles of similar sizes. Monte Carlo simulations at the atomic level corroborate the larger anisotropy of the <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> in comparison with the spherical ones, thus evidencing the beneficial role of surface anisotropy in the improved heating power. Moreover we establish a quantitative link between the particle assembling, the interactions and the heating properties. This knowledge opens new perspectives for improved hyperthermia, an alternative to conventional cancer therapies.

30|$|Furthermore, SEM {{analysis}} of particles {{obtained from the}} phosphate-containing ZnO-hydro suspension without lecithin revealed <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> with an edge length of ~ 1  µm. These <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> consisted of about equal mass fractions of Zn and O and also contained 10  % P, {{as shown by the}} EDX analysis. Thus, the formed crystals corresponded to a zinc phosphate compound. Consequently, the phosphate ions in the suspensions were consumed by both the released hydroxyl ions and the resulting zinc phosphate compound. Hence, not enough phosphate ions were available to act as pH buffers. Dissolution equilibrium was presumably reached when the pH stopped increasing. In contrast to these findings, Michelmore et al. [37] described the reaction of solid ZnO with water and phosphate ions to form a hydroxyphosphato complex according to the equation ZnO + H 2 O + HPO 42 − ←→ Zn(OH) 2 (HPO 4) 2 −. In Michelmore’s study, investigations with ZnO and polyphosphate yielded zinc polyphosphate complexes that precipitated on the ZnO surfaces. They further found that the concentration of dissolved zinc increases with increasing polyphosphate concentration. It is therefore conceivable that similar processes can even occur when simple phosphate is used. If such complexes of zinc and phosphate were formed and were bound to the particle surface, they would be separated during centrifugation. Consequently, the measured zinc concentration in the supernatant would be less than expected. Another aspect, described for TiO 2, is that surface hydroxyl groups can be exchanged with phosphate ions [38]. The same substitution might occur on the ZnO surface.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of particle shape on filtration processes was investigated. Two types of particles, including spherical polystyrene latex (PSL) and iron oxide, and perfect cubes of magnesium oxide, were examined. It {{was found that}} the removal efficiency of spherical particles on fibrous filters is very similar for corresponding sizes within the range of 50 - 300 nm, regardless {{of the fact that the}} densities of PSL and iron oxide differ by a factor of five. On the other hand, the removal efficiency of magnesium oxide <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> was measured, and found to be much lower than the removal efficiency for the aerodynamically similar spheres. Such disparity was ascribed to the different nature of the motion of the spherical and <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> along the fiber surface, following the initial collision. After touching the fiber surface and before coming to rest, the spherical particles could either slide or roll compared to the cubic ones, which could either slide or tumble. During tumbling, the area of contact between the particle and the fiber changes significantly, thus affecting the bounce probability, whilst for the spheres, the area of contact remains the same for any point of the particle trajectory. The extra probability of particle bounce by the cubes was derived from the experimental data. The particle kinetic energy was proposed to be responsible for the difference in removal efficiency of particles with alternative shapes, if all other process parameters remain the same. The increase in kinetic energy is shown to favor the increase of the bounce probability. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|R

By varying synthetic parameters including precursors, solvents, amount of surfactants, and heating {{rate of the}} solution, the particle size from 2 to 9 nm can be tuned with 1 nm accuracy. While most particles are spherical in shape, <b>cubic</b> <b>particles</b> can be obtained when particles are greater than 7 nm. Rod-shape nanoparticles have also been obtained.
