50|$|The test {{is similar}} to the <b>Charpy</b> impact test but uses a {{different}} arrangement of the specimen under test. The Izod impact test differs from the <b>Charpy</b> impact test in that the sample is held in a cantilevered beam configuration as opposed to a three-point bending configuration. The test is named after the English engineer Edwin Gilbert Izod (1876-1946), who described it in his 1903 address to the British Association, subsequently published in Engineering.|$|E

40|$|Finite element substructuring {{strategies}} are presented to obtain numerical solutions for three typical problems {{of interest to}} the composites community: (1) impact and toughness characterization of composites using <b>Charpy's</b> impact test specimen; (2) free-edge stress analysis of composite laminates; and (3) fracture toughness predictions of composites for individual and combined fracture of modes I, II, and III. The key issue common to these problems is the presence of singular or near singular stress fields. The regions prone to see steep stress gradients are substructured with progressively refined meshes to study the local response simultaneously with the global response. The results from the select examples indicate that finite element substructuring methods are computationally effective for composite singularity mechanics...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Charpy</b> impact test, {{also known}} as the <b>Charpy</b> V-notch test, is a {{standardized}} high strain-rate test which determines the amount of energy absorbed by a material during fracture.

It is widely applied in industry, since it is easy to prepare and conduct and results can be obtained quickly and cheaply. A disadvantage is that some results are only comparative.|$|E

40|$|It was {{generally}} {{believed that the}} mechanical properties of carbon steel were remarkably changed by heat treatment.

In this paper, the present investigators, therefore, made a study of the effect of the quenching temperature and coolant on formatitive condition of low carbon martensite in the mild steel with carbon 0. 07 % preceded by normalizing at appropriate temperature through means of hardness, impact and metallography test. A summary of the results is shown below : (1) Except for spindle oil, in order to produce the maximum quench hardening effect it is necessary to quench after keeping 10 minutes about 900 ℃, and it is unconcerned in coolant.

40|$|Green {{composites}} {{based on}} polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) with 10 to 20 wt% natural fibres were manufactured by extrusion and characterized. Two {{different types of}} fibres were used: fibrous wastes of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (PO) and sawdust (SD). PHA was successfully compounded with both fibres using 10 wt% acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) as plasticizer. Thermal, rheological, mechanical (tensile and <b>Charpy’s</b> impact tests) and morphological characterizations of the developed composites were conducted. The composites showed good thermal and mechanical properties, the impact energy-absorbing capability was markedly increased with increasing the fibre loading of PO or SD {{compared with that of}} the unfilled material. The biodegradability of the composites based on PHA and PO fibres was assessed in sea water using standardized procedures based on the carbon dioxide evolution. Whereas, the biodegradability of the composites based on PHA and SD was assessed by measuring the amount of carbon mineralized during incubation under composting conditions. Both tests showed that the presence of the fibres facilitated the disintegration of the composite films increasing their biodegradation rate in the two different investigated environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the flexural and impact strength of 3 commercially available denture base resins after reinforcing them with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT’S). Each acrylic resin was first solubilised in Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then carbon nanotubes were added in different percentages respectively. A total of 50 specimens were made from each material (Eclipse, Triad Visible light cure (VLC) and Lightplast) following the International Standard Organization (ISO; 1567 : 1999). Carbon nano tubes were chemically incorporated into the polymer. <b>Charpys</b> impact test and flexural strength analysis was made. Data were analyzed using one way-ANOVA for comparisons. The results revealed a significant rise (p< 0. 05) in the 2 impact strength and flexural strength of Eclipse (12. 5 kj/mm, 128 MP) when compared with Triad Visible light cure (VLC) and Lightplast at 2 % addition. The flexural strength of each material also increases gradually with increasing percentage of SWCNT’s addition. In terms of impact and flexural strengths Eclipse denture base showed better results when compared with the other light cured reinforced denture base acrylic resin. Higher standard deviation values were seen for Eclipse. Reinforcing the acrylic resin is beneficial and significantly affects the material properties...|$|R
40|$|Ternary blends of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with a {{constant}} weight percentage of 60 %, 10 % and 30 % respectively were compatibilized with soybean oil derivatives epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), maleinized soybean oil (MSO) and acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO). The potential compatibilization {{effects of the}} soybean oil-derivatives was characterized in terms of mechanical, thermal and thermomechanical properties. The effects on morphology were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). All three soybean oil-based compatibilizers led to a noticeable increase in toughness with a remarkable improvement in elongation at break. On the other hand, both the tensile modulus and strength decreased, but in a lower extent to a typical plasticization effect. Although phase separation occurred, all three soybean oil derivatives led somewhat to compatibilization through reaction between terminal hydroxyl groups in all three biopolyesters (PLA, PHB and PCL) and the readily reactive groups in the soybean oil derivatives, that is, epoxy, maleic anhydride and acrylic/epoxy functionalities. In particular, the addition of 5 parts per hundred parts of the blend (phr) of ESO gave the maximum elongation at break while {{the same amount of}} MSO and AESO gave the maximum toughness, measured through <b>Charpy’s</b> impact tests. In general, the herein-developed materials widen the potential of ternary PLA formulations by a cost effective blending method with PHB and PCL and compatibilization with vegetable oil-based additives...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a growing}} demand for {{invasive}} procedures involving the inferior vena cava, in particular for placement of vena cava filters. It {{is not always easy}} to identify the more distal renal vein with cavography, for safe release of filters. OBJECTIVES: To determine parameters for the relationships between the renal veins and the infrarenal vena cava and their corresponding vertebral bodies, their relationships with biotype and the occurrence of anatomic variations, the relationships between vertebral bodies and the bifurcation of the common iliac veins and the distance from this bifurcation to the outflow of the more distal renal vein, with reference to placement of vena cava filters. METHODS: A total of 150 abdominal computed tomography scans conducted from October to November 2011 were analyzed and classified according to the biotype exhibited (using <b>Charpy's</b> angle). Scans were performed at MEDIMAGEM and analyzed at the Integrated Vascular Surgery Service, both part of Hospital da Benefic&# 234;ncia Portuguesa in S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: In 127 of the 150 scans analyzed (84. 66 %), the more distal renal vein emerged between the first lumbar intervertebral space (L 1 -L 2) and the body of L 2, irrespective of patient biotype. Just 23 patients (15. 33 %) exhibited a more distal renal vein with outflow below the body of L 2, i. e. in the projection of the space between L 2 and L 3.

This is most commonly realized using the <b>Charpy</b> impact test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the Izod impact strength test, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. <b>Charpy</b> testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.|$|E
