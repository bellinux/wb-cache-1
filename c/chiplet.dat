50|$|A POWER8 {{processor}} is a 12-chiplet {{design with}} variants consisting of either 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 chiplets, {{in which one}} <b>chiplet</b> consists of one core, 512 KB of SRAM L2 cache on a 64-byte wide bus (which is twice as wide as on its predecessor), and 8 MB of L3 eDRAM cache per <b>chiplet</b> shareable among all chiplets. Thus, a six-chiplet processor would have 48 MB of L3 eDRAM cache, while a 12-chiplet processor would have a total of 96 MB of L3 eDRAM cache. The chip can also utilize an up to 128 MB of off-chip eDRAM L4 cache using Centaur companion chips. The on-chip memory controllers can handle 1 TB of RAM and 230 GB/s sustained memory bandwidth. The on-board PCI Express controllers can handle 48 GB/s of I/O {{to other parts of}} the system. The cores are designed to operate at clock rates between 2.5 and 5 GHz.|$|E

Our goal in this short {{paper is to}} motivate future research on nanophotonic system-in-package (NSiP) : an integration strategy that uses CMOS-compatible nanophotonic devices to implement an efficient package-level network for high-performance SiPs. 1. Nanophotonic System-in-Package (NSiP) An NSiP is composed of nanophotonic chiplets that commu-nicate using tightly integrated nanophotonic devices. We use the term nanophotonic <b>chiplet</b> to emphasize that these components are specifically engineered for an NSiP as opposed to standard electrical chips that might use wire or flip-chip bonding and find applications as discrete parts. Note that a nanophotonic <b>chiplet</b> will also include electrical interfaces (e. g., power, ground, off...|$|E

The cavity spectrum can be read out remotely by detecting the photoluminescence of embedded Quantum Dots. Both transfer printing and deterministic positioning of the cavities on foreign substrates by individual micromanipulation is demonstrated. The microscopic environment of the particles, including their bonding to the substrate, determines the cavities' resonance spectrum, which can be exploited in applications.

40|$|The {{scalability}} {{trends of}} modern semiconductor technology lead to increasingly dense multicore chips. Unfortunately, physical limitations in area, power, off-chip bandwidth, and yield constrain single-chip designs {{to a relatively}} small number of cores, beyond which scaling becomes impractical. Multi-chip designs overcome these constraints, and can reach scales impossible to realize with conventional single-chip architectures. However, to deliver commensurate performance, multi-chip architectures require a cross-chip interconnect with bandwidth, latency, and energy consumption well beyond the reach of electrical signaling. We propose Galaxy, an architecture that enables the construction of a many-core “virtual chip ” by connecting multiple smaller <b>chiplets</b> through optical fibers. The low optical loss of fibers allows the flexible placement of <b>chiplets,</b> and offers simpler packaging, power, and heat requirements. At the same time, the low latency and high bandwidth density of optical signaling maintain the tight coupling of cores, allowing the virtual chip to match the performance of a single chip that is not subject to area, power, and bandwidth limitations. Our results indicate that Galaxy attains speedup of 2. 2 x over the best realistic single-chip alternatives with electrical or photonic interconnects (3. 4 x maximum), and 2. 6 x smaller energy-delay product (6. 8 x maximum). We show that Galaxy scales to 4 K cores and attains 2. 5 x speedup at 6 x lower laser power compared to Oracle Macrochip...|$|R

A standard wire-bonding machine was used to place ~ 100 -mm bumps on unreleased MEMS chiplets. The bumped <b>chiplet</b> was then flip-chip bonded to a secondary substrate containing a microwave coplanar wave-guide (CPW). After bonding, the entire assembly was run through the MEMS release process, after which the MEMS host substrate was removed. The thermosonic bonding was a very reliable prototyping tool with a 100 % bonding yield. Quality and repeatability was demonstrated by functional microwave assemblies that exhibited low power loss at 40 -GHz. The transfer process {{can be used with}} any MEMS that can be wire bonded; and can be applied to a variety of applications.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} recent {{progress}} {{in the field of}} directed self-assembly, wherein discrete inorganic semiconductor device components are assembled on flexible substrates, and compares these results with prior work. The research aims to develop self-assembly-based <b>chiplet</b> assembly processes that can extend minimal die sizes and throughput beyond what is currently possible with robotic pick and place methods. This manuscript concentrates on self-assembly that is driven by the reduction of surface free energy between liquid solder-coated areas on a substrate and metal-coated contacts on semiconductor dies that act as binding sites. Scaling prior results to sub- 100 micrometer-sized components has required a transition to a new self-assembly platform. Specifically, recent work has moved from a drum delivery concept to a new scheme that uses a stepwise reduction of interfacial free energy at a triple interface between oil, water, and a penetrating solder-patterned substrate to introduce components. Finally, this paper also discusses design rules to produce highly periodic “selftiled” domains on rigid, flexible, and curved substrates. We describe discrete, self-tiled, and microconcentrator-augmented solar cell modules as applications that are fault tolerant and reduce the amount of Si material used by up to a factor of 22 when compared to conventional cells.

40|$|Nanocarbonic {{materials}} (such as carbon nanotubes, graphene flakes, {{and thin}} graphite <b>chiplets)</b> have been imbedded in polymers or ceramics {{to improve their}} electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. The difficulties in increasing the thermal conductivity together with high values obtained for the electrical conductivity combined with reasonable values for the Seebeck coefficient suggest to use these materials for thermoelectric power generation. In this contribution we report on results on carbon nanotube networks in the polymer PVDF [2] and in aluminum oxide ceramics. In particular, we succeeded in preparing flexible multilayer fabrics of CNT/PVDF, so-called "power felts", which generate a thermoelectric power of about 50 mV at a temperature difference of 90 K between the hot and the cold end of the sample. Nanocarbon networks in aluminum oxide ceramic are developed for application at higher temperatures. First results of increasing the Seebeck coefficient by chemical treatment of the nanocarbonic materials will be presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of High-Performance Computing (HPC) system design is the choice of main memory capacity. This choice becomes increasingly important now that 3 D-stacked memories are entering the market. Compared with conventional Dual In-line Memory Modules (DIMMs), 3 D memory <b>chiplets</b> provide better performance and energy efficiency but lower memory capacities. Therefore, the adoption of 3 D-stacked memories in the HPC domain depends on whether we can find use cases that require much less memory than is available now. This study analyzes the memory capacity requirements of important HPC benchmarks and applications. We find that the High-Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) benchmark could be an important success story for 3 D-stacked memories in HPC, but High-Performance Linpack (HPL) {{is likely to be}} constrained by 3 D memory capacity. The study also emphasizes that the analysis of memory footprints of production HPC applications is complex and that it requires an understanding of application scalability and target category, i. e., whether the users target capability or capacity computing. The results show that most of the HPC applications under study have per-core memory footprints in the range of hundreds of megabytes, but we also detect applications and use cases that require gigabytes per core. Overall, the study identifies the HPC applications and use cases with memory footprints that could be provided by 3 D-stacked memory <b>chiplets,</b> making a first step toward adoption of this novel technology in the HPC domain.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} self-assembling and electrically connecting small (20 – 60  micrometer) semiconductor <b>chiplets</b> at predetermined locations on flexible substrates with high speed (62500  chips/ 45  s), accuracy (0. 9  micrometer, 0. 14 °), and yield (>  98 %). The process {{takes place at the}} triple interface between silicone oil, water, and a penetrating solder-patterned substrate. The assembly is driven by a stepwise reduction of interfacial free energy where chips are first collected and preoriented at an oil-water interface before they assemble on a solder-patterned substrate that is pulled through the interface. Patterned transfer occurs in a progressing linear front as the liquid layers recede. The process eliminates the dependency on gravity and sedimentation of prior methods, thereby extending the minimal chip size to the sub- 100  micrometer scale. It provides a new route for the field of printable electronics to enable the integration of microscopic high performance inorganic semiconductors on foreign substrates with the freedom to choose target location, pitch, and integration density. As an example we demonstrate a fault-tolerant segmented flexible monocrystalline silicon solar cell, reducing the amount of Si that is used when compared to conventional rigid cells...|$|R

V raziskavi se je pokazalo, da peč na sekance ni primerna zaradi prevelike porabe prostora ter njene velike začetne investicije. Prav tako ni primerna peč na pelete, ker jih je potrebno kupiti, cena le teh je občutno višja kot cena drv in sekancev. Zato smo izbrali peč na drva, Herz Firestar 40 kW, ki je glede na način uporabe in rabo lesne biomase za domačo kmetijo najbolj primerna. Izračun stroškov nam je pokazal, da se začetna investicija, glede na ceno nove in porabo stare peči, povrne v 7 letih. Z novo pečjo Herz Firestar 40 kW, se bo porabilo občutno manj drv, zmanjšali se bodo stroški ogrevanja in ob tem povečal dobiček od prodaje drv na kmetiji. In {{the thesis}} {{operation}} of a biomass furnace is presented. The choice of the most suitable Herz furnace for a domestic farm with farm tourism according to the initial investment, cost and energy consumption {{as well as a}} period of return on investment was adressed. The study showed that the furnace operating on wood <b>chiplets</b> is not suitable due to excessive space consumption and due to a large initial investment. In addition, furnace operating on wood pellets was also found not economic, because all the pellets need to be bought. The price of the wood pellets is substantially higher than the price of logs and wood chips. Therefore, log burning furnace Herz Firestar 40 kW was chosen due to the most efficient and economic application for domestic farm purposes. Calculation of costs revealed that initial investment, taking into account the price and improved efficacy of a new furnace compared to an old one, becomes profitable after 7 years. We conclude that by purchasing of a new furnace Herz Firestar 40 kW significantly less wood is spent, thus reducing the costs of heating and increasing profits from the firewood sale on the farm...|$|R

Futures ICs and passives will also decrease in size, e. g. for RF-ID applications forecast die sizes are smaller than 250 mikron, thicknesses less than 50 mikron and pitches way below 100 mikron.

Handling shall be feasible for miniaturized components as <b>chiplets,</b> smallest SMDs as well as for nano-scaled building blocks. The physical principle is a change in the droplet contact angle of a droplet when immersed into an electrical field, an effect that can be used for droplet movement component transport. The process flow under evaluation starts with positioning of a droplet, containing a component, on a super-hydrophobic surface realized by a nano-particle filled coating of the carrier substrate with moderate accuracy. The droplet will be moved quickly until the desired position is reached using the mentioned electrowetting effect. Fine positioning and orientation of the component can then be achieved by magnetic guiding during evaporation of the water droplet. The crucial point of this approach is to find a suitable configuration of the magnetic field, which exerts such forces on the component needed for a movement in the wanted position. Besides the design of the magnetic field, the magnetic properties of the components are essential for the action of the field. Microelectronic components typically undergo only inadequate interaction with magnetic fields so that magnetically based positioning procedures fail. To overcome this difficulty, magnetically addressable markers must be designed and attached to the components. An effective technical realization of this principle is the application of thin polymer based layers, filled with magnetically interacting micro- or nano-particles, on top of the components. The layers can be applied cost-effectively on wafer level during fabrication of the components by use of e. g. common stencil printing process.

Touchless and self-assembly based procedures {{seem to be a}} promising method for handling miniaturized components not directly fabricated at the very place where they are needed. Based on the "electrowetting on dielectrics" effect (EWOD) a contactless handling technology well known from lab-on-chip applications for liquid transport, sorting, mixing and splitting is used as a basis for microelectronics assembly purposes on standard printed circuit boards. Handling shall be feasible for miniaturized components as <b>chiplets,</b> smallest SMDs as well as for nano-scaled building blocks. The physical principle is a change in the droplet contact angle of a droplet when immersed into an electrical field. By applying a moving e-field to the droplet, it can be guided to a defined spot. Using this effect in combination with conventional circuit board technologies might yield a moderate cost approach to exactly place fluid droplets. The process flow under evaluation starts with positioning of a droplet, containing a component, on a hydrophobic surface of the carrier substrate with rough accuracy. Using the mentioned electro wetting effect the droplet will be fast moved until the desired position is reached. The precise placement of the droplet in µm range takes place by means of field gradients and local manipulation of the carrier surface. The assembly is finished with the evaporation of the component containing droplets and the transfer of all components to the final substrate. The experimental work including electrical layout, substrate manufacturing, hydrophobic surface modification and droplet handling is combined with a simulation. The electrowetting conveying system is simulated using the Many Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics method (MDPD), where clusters of fluid molecules are represented by coarse grained particles. Wetting behavior is introduced by position-fixed wall particles: the force between a wall and a fluid particle is adapted such that the required contact angle emerges. The electrowetting model uses the Lippmann equation to find the influence of the applied voltage on the wetting behavior, i. e., the attractive forces between wall and fluid particles are modified to simulate the electrostatic forces on the contact line. The micro parts are also simulated by connected particles with special interaction forces for (almost) rigid body motion.
