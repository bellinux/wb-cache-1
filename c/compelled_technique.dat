Estimating global effect sizes from nested data, and testing effects against global null hypotheses, is, however, more challenging {{than in the}} traditional setting of independent and identically distributed data.

40|$|Understanding the {{governing}} mechanism of solar magnetism remains an outstanding challenge in astrophysics. Seismology {{is the most}} <b>compelling</b> <b>technique</b> with which to infer the internal properties of the Sun and stars. Waves in the Sun, nominally acoustic, {{are sensitive to the}} emergence and cyclical strengthening of magnetic field, evidenced by measured changes in resonant oscillation frequencies that are correlated with the solar cycle. The inference of internal Lorentz stresses from these measurements has the potential to significantly advance our appreciation of the dynamo. Indeed, seismological inverse theory for the Sun is well understood for perturbations in composition, thermal structure and flows but, is not fully developed for magnetism, owing to the complexity of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equation. Invoking first-Born perturbation theory to characterize departures from spherically symmetric hydrostatic models of the Sun and applying the notation of generalized spherical harmonics, we calculate sensitivity functions of seismic measurements to the general time-varying Lorentz stress tensor. We find that eigenstates of isotropic (i. e. acoustic only) background models are dominantly sensitive to isotropic deviations in the stress tensor and much more weakly so to anisotropic stresses (and therefore challenging to infer).

40|$|Sensing static or slowly varying {{magnetic}} fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution {{is critical to}} many applications in fundamental physics, bioimaging and materials science. Several versatile magnetometry platforms have emerged over the past decade, such as electronic spins associated with Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. However, their high sensitivity to external fields also makes them poor sensors of DC fields. Indeed, the usual method of Ramsey magnetometry leaves them prone to environmental noise, limiting the allowable interrogation time to the short dephasing time T 2 *. Here we introduce a hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that allows sensing static {{magnetic fields}} with interrogation times up to the much longer T 2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field sensitivity. While more generally applicable, we demonstrate the method for an electronic NV sensor and a nuclear ancilla. It relies on frequency upconversion of transverse DC fields through the ancilla, allowing quantum lock-in detection with low-frequency noise rejection. In our experiments, we demonstrate sensitivities better than 6 uT/vHz, comparable to the Ramsey method, and narrow-band signal noise filtering better than 64 kHz. With technical optimization, we expect more than an one order of magnitude improvement {{in each of these}} parameters. Since our method measures transverse fields, in combination with the Ramsey detection of longitudinal fields, it ushers in a <b>compelling</b> <b>technique</b> for sensitive vector DC magnetometry at the nanoscale.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Information {{visualization}} is a <b>compelling</b> <b>technique</b> for {{the exploration}} {{and analysis of}} the large and complex data sets generated by computer applications. Visualization takes advantage of the immense power, bandwidth, and pattern recognition capabilities of the human visual system. It enables users to see large amounts of data in a single display, and to discover patterns, trends, and outliers within the data. Visualization is becoming increasingly important in Semantic Web tools. In particular, visualization is used in tools that support the development of ontologies, such as ontology extraction tools or ontology editors. The majority of existing works is, concerned by the creation of ontologies, once the consensus is achieved (called post-consensus ontologies); but the main problem is how to reach this consensus? This work tries to answer this question by proposing to create a pre-consensus ontology starting from the opinions of various actors. For instance, we insist on the necessity to keep different definitions of the same concept and multimedia illustrations of the concepts. In this paper, our work {{within the framework of the}} TOWNTOLOGY project aims at writing urban ontologies in a visual form. This visualization is a way to be explored towards a co-operative system for reaching consensus. From the descriptive point of view of ontologies, an extension of XML is designed and used. As results, we build a Towntology prototype system (the Towntology Tool suite) in order to store the ontology, to display the ontology in visual graphic form, to navigate in the ontology, to query it and to update it...|$|R

Our aim was to assess the performance and repeatability of crowdsourcing for the classification of retinal fundus photography. One hundred retinal fundus photograph images with pre-determined disease criteria were selected by experts from a large cohort study. After reading brief instructions and an example classification, we requested that knowledge workers (KWs) from a crowdsourcing platform classified each image as normal or abnormal with grades of severity. Each image was classified 20 times by different KWs. Four study designs were examined to assess the effect of varying incentive and KW experience in classification accuracy. All study designs were conducted twice to examine repeatability. Performance was assessed by comparing the sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Without restriction on eligible participants, two thousand classifications of 100 images were received in under 24 hours at minimal cost. In trial 1 all study designs had an AUC (95 %CI) of 0. 701 (0. 680 - 0. 721) or greater for classification of normal/abnormal. In trial 1, the highest AUC (95 %CI) for normal/abnormal classification was 0. 757 (0. 738 - 0. 776) for KWs with moderate experience. Comparable results were observed in trial 2. In trial 1, between 64 - 86 % of any abnormal image was correctly classified by over half of all KWs. In trial 2, this ranged between 74 - 97 %. Sensitivity was ≥ 96 % for normal versus severely abnormal detections across all trials. Sensitivity for normal versus mildly abnormal varied between 61 - 79 % across trials. With minimal training, crowdsourcing represents an accurate, rapid and cost-effective method of retinal image analysis which demonstrates good repeatability.

While there is a volume of analytical and high-level simulation results demonstrating its merits, {{there has been little}} work evaluating it in actual sensornet settings. This article bridges the gap between theory and practice. Having analyzed a number of proposed hierarchical routing protocols, we have developed a framework that captures the common characteristics of the protocols and identifies design points at which the protocols differ. We use a sensornet implementation of the framework in TOSSIM and on a 60 -node testbed to study various trade-offs that hierarchical routing introduces, as well as to compare the performance of hierarchical routing with the performance of other routing techniques, namely shortest-path routing, compact routing, and beacon vector routing. The results show that hierarchical routing is a <b>compelling</b> routing <b>technique</b> also in practice. In particular, despite only logarithmic routing state, it can offer small routing stretch: An average of ~ 1. 25 and a 99 th percentile of 2. It can also be robust, minimizing the maintenance traffic or the latency of reacting to changes in the network. Moreover, the trade-offs offered by hierarchical routing are attractive for many sensornet applications when compared to the other routing techniques. For example, in terms of routing state, hierarchical routing can offer scalability at least an order of magnitude better than compact routing, and at the same time, in terms of routing stretch, its performance is within 10 - 15 % of that of compact routing; in addition, this performance can further be tuned to a particular application. Finally, we also identify a number of practical issues and limitations of which we believe sensornet developers adopting hierarchical routing should be aware. © 2012 ACM...|$|R

In this context, this study analyzes the challenges of bullwhip effect on the perspective of ingenious optimization strategies, and further contemplates to establish the engineering patterns of interrelationships on the magnitude of pooling the resources to advance supply chain capabilities. The suppression of bullwhip effect on underlying optimization strategies is sought to elevate accelerated responsiveness, improve network demand visibility and reduce volatility in frequencies to inventory replenishment. A rigorous and disciplined quantitative approach afforded the tentatively development of pattern of interrelated supply chain dimensions. The factor analysis method was used on 448 responses and insightful findings were produced from the <b>compelling</b> purposive sampling <b>technique.</b> The findings indicate that the magnitude of better ameliorating bullwhip effect, the value of competitive economic information and strength of selected optimization strategies depend on the model of unified engineering patterns. This paper provides insights to FMCG industry on using innovative strategies and modern technology to enhance supply chain visibility through integrated systems networks...|$|R
40|$|Pilgrimage {{is perhaps}} the most {{characteristic}} and <b>compelling</b> literary <b>technique</b> of the medieval period. In spite of the diversity of instantiations of pilgrimage in medieval literature, critics have examined pilgrimage almost exclusively as an allegorical apparatus signifying spiritual, semiotic, or historical progress. This project re-evaluates the allegorical significance of pilgrimage and also explores how the non-allegorical significance of pilgrimage influenced premodern literary strategy and history in England. ^ Pilgrimage is a fundamentally spatial phenomenon, and yet it has barely been considered in the context of critical mark on medieval space and place. Moreover, the cultural significance of English pilgrimage has been particularly neglected. Pilgrimage was a peculiarly vexed practice in England, where orthodox and heterodox Christian antipathy towards the ritual culminated in Henry VIII 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition of pilgrimage in the Injunctions of l 536 and 1538. This proscription, along with England 2 ̆ 7 s location marginal to the renowned pilgrimage routes through Europe and Palestine, has resulted in the uniquely interrupted and expurgated history and geography of insular pilgrimage. I examine pilgrimage as a spatial, spiritual, and anthropological phenomenon to theorize and historicize medieval English place. Moreover, I investigate how the fundamentally spatial phenomenon of pilgrimage inflects the dynamics between premodern place and premodern literature. ^ Throughout the dissertation I consider {{the ways in which the}} operations of pilgrimage and place complicate our understanding of allegory in premodern texts, attending to the significance of particular pilgrimage destinations in each of the texts I analyze. In my Prologue of Place, I explore how the allegorization of place instantiated at Walsingham, Norfolk 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Newe Nazareth, 2 ̆ 2 engages both the operations of late medieval allegory and late medieval conceptions of place to illuminate a connection between the literal and the local. Each subsequent chapter explores how the historical, cultural, and spatial phenomenon of pilgrimage informs the textual strategies of pilgrimage in The Vision of Piers Plowman, The Siege of Thebes, and The Book of Margery Kempe respectively. In my Epilogue of Place, I return to study the case of Walsingham to consider pilgrimage and periodization. I examine how pilgrimage 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition ultimately affected English place and transformed the literary technique of pilgrimage. ...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{burden of}} {{anaerobic}} bacteria colonizing human body comprises about 90 % {{of its total}} biomass. The biotic relationship between humans and its microbiota sets reciprocal benefits, albeit with pathogenic potencial for the human being in particular dysbiosis situations. Infections adjacent to or originating from the skin or mucous membranes of the intestinal, genitourinary and upper respiratory tracts are often polymicrobial in nature, whereby should anaerobes be invariably included in the etiological differential diagnosis of these conditions. Gram negative bacilli such as Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas spp., Prevotella spp.  and Gram positive cocci such as Peptostreptococcus spp. stand out for their high virulence and frequence of isolation in suppurative infections and abcesses with metastatic or contiguous relation to human microbiota. The fastidious nature of anaerobic bacteria, especially of less aerotolerant species, <b>compels</b> to particular <b>techniques</b> of sample collection, transport and cultural isolation that challenge clinicians and microbiologists for a full efficient practice. Such requirements bring on a poor identification of anaerobic bacteria in the clinical practice and undervaluation of its aetiopathogenic potential amongst common polymicrobial infections. An approach over microbial flora’s composition in the different human anatomical sites is a primary goal of the present article. Clinicians are intended to recognize the variability and proportion of likely involved anaerobic microorganisms in certain infectious processes related to human microbiota, in order to optimize samples processing {{and the establishment of}} an appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy, mindful of anaerobic coverage and according to known susceptibility profiles...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) have become popular {{and the possibility of}} diagnosis based on non-invasive <b>techniques</b> <b>compels</b> us to overcome the difficulties originated on the environmental changes that canaffect the signal. We perform a nonparametric segmentation which consists of locating the points where the sig-nal can be split into stationary segments. By finding stationary segments we are able to analyze the size of thesesegments and evaluate how the signal changes from one segment to another, looking at the statistical momentsgiven in each patch, for example, mean and variance. We analyze HRV data for 15 patients with congestive heartfailure (CHF; 11 males, 4 females, age 56 &# 177; 11 years), 18 elderly healthy subjects (EH; 11 males, 7 females, age 50 &# 177; 7 years), and 15 young healthy subjects (YH; 11 females, 4 males, age 31 &# 177; 6 years). Our results confirmhigher variance for YH, and EH, while CHF displays diminished variance with p-values < 0. 01, when comparedto the healthy groups, presenting higher HRV in healthy subjects. Moreover, it is possible to distinguish betweenYH and EH with p < 0. 05 through the segmentation outcomes. We found high correlations between the resultsof segmentation and standard measures of HRV analysis and a connection to results of detrended fluctuationanalysis. The segmentation applied to HRV studies detects aging and pathological conditions effects on thenonstationary behavior of the analyzed groups, promising to contribute in complexity analysis and providingrisk stratification measures...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveHybrid {{thoracic}} endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) {{has expanded}} the surgical management of complex thoracic aneurysms. Aortic arch debranching generally requires a sternotomy. We describe our experience performing a right anterior minithoracotomy for hybrid TEVAR. MethodDuring a 3 -year period, 7 patients (aged 76 ± 15 years; 57 % were male) with aortic arch aneurysms underwent hybrid TEVAR via a right anterior minithoracotomy. Of all with prior thoracic or abdominal aortic surgery, 4 had a prior sternotomy. All patients {{included in this}} series had an American Society of Anesthesiology score of 4 or greater. ResultsRepairs were performed via a 5 -cm incision at the third to fourth intercostal space to access the ascending arch. A Satinsky clamp on the ascending aorta facilitated bypass with the 10 -mm arm of a bifurcated 10 / 12 -mm graft to the innominate artery or right common carotid artery (12 -mm arm: endoprosthesis conduit). The remaining arch vessels were bypassed as needed; subsequently, a thoracic stent graft was deployed by the 12 - or 14 -mm arm. Primary technical success was 86 % (6 patients); 1 patient required conversion to sternotomy secondary to bleeding. Complications included cerebrovascular accident in 2 patients (28 %) and respiratory failure in 2 patients (28 %). The average length of stay was 12 days with no wound infection. One death occurred during the 30 -day period. ConclusionsRight anterior minithoracotomy is a <b>compelling,</b> less invasive <b>technique</b> for hybrid TEVAR. Further experience {{will be necessary to}} completely evaluate the merits of this approach...|$|R
40|$|Cellular phones offer a {{whole range}} of {{interesting}} and exciting possibilities for entertainment systems coupled with a very resource-constrained environment. In this article we consider the possibilities currently achievable through the example of a networked sports service. Applications that keep users up-to-date with sports results and playing fantasy team games, {{based on the results of}} actual events, are well established on the Internet; they attract millions of subscribers world-wide. As yet, the sports results services on cellular phones, even within countries that offer 3 G services, are by and large SMS or WAP-based, and there are no dedicated fantasy team game services for cellular phones. In this article we present a novel application using GPRS that not only keeps users up-to-date, wherever they are, with the events of the English Premier Football League, but also provides the opportunity of playing a real-time fantasy football game as these events transpire. As we are seeing moves by cellular phone manufacturers to adopt standardized operating systems, we compare application development in Symbian, Brew, and J 2 ME. Although J 2 ME is not an operating system, it has, up until recently, been the only means of cross-platform application development for cellular phonesThis application not only takes advantage of the "nature" of the cellular network, rather than porting existing services off the Internet, but radically improves currently available services in terms of cost and efficiency. It also highlights the fact that resource constraints on a cellular phone are not a bar to creating <b>compelling</b> content. This <b>technique</b> could be applied to {{a whole range}} of sports from Formula 1 to baseball...|$|R
