The establishment method of the high precise <b>coordinate</b> transformation <b>grid</b> model of CGCS 2000 is proposed. First,the minimum curvature equation of coordinate transformation is discussed. And it possesses both the whole and local smooth characteristics,so it can be better in keeping with consecutive smooth characteristics for the coordinate transformation of map's linear feature. Second,the iterative calculation method of grid nodes and the establishment method of regional grid model using the resolution of collocation by two minimization steps are advanced. The data structure of grid model is constructed. Third,the countrywide optimized grid interval and transformation precision of high precise <b>coordinate</b> transformation <b>grid</b> model of CGCS 2000 are presented. The <b>coordinate</b> transformation <b>grid</b> models from BJS 54 and XAS 80 to the CGCS 2000 have been constructed using 48 433 points of 2000 national geodetic control network of China,and the positioning external accuracy of both models are 0. 26 m and 0. 03 m respectively...|$|R
500|$|A {{wind rose}} is a graphic tool used by meteorologists {{to give a}} succinct view of how wind speed and {{direction}} are typically distributed at a particular location. [...] Presented in a polar <b>coordinate</b> <b>grid,</b> the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions. [...] The length of each spoke around the circle {{is related to the}} frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction per unit time. [...] Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, emanating from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles. A wind rose plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind direction ranges. [...] Wind roses typically use 8 or 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of numerical solutions of systems of nonlinear flow equations (Navier-Stokes equations) to the grid used is investigated {{through the use}} of the South China Sea (SCS) numerical ocean model. Traditionally, rectangular <b>coordinate</b> <b>grids</b> are used in environmental modeling. The advantage of rectangular <b>coordinate</b> <b>grids</b> is their simplicity in the generation process. However, rectangular <b>coordinate</b> <b>grids</b> are not well suited for regions with complex terrain (coastlines and topography) and occasionally lead to poor accuracy in numerical solutions. The grid generation techniques are being introduced to coastal ocean modeling to study the {{sensitivity of}} numerical solutions to the grid used and to investigate the enhancement of the modeling process. Grid generation techniques are broadly used in aeronautical engineering community for solving CFD problems. One orthogonal (l 2 lxl 9 l) and two curvilinear nearly-orthogonal grids (l 2 lxl 9 l and lSlx 24 l) are designed to couple with the SCS numerical ocean model. The grids are designed using the EAGLEView grid generation code developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) of Mississippi State University. EAGLEView implements a grid generation technique using mainly elliptic and algebraic generation systems. The designed grids are processed with the SOS numerical ocean model for 200 days to study the sensitivity of numerical solutions to the grid used. The solutions of the temperature and salinity fields are presented and analyzed. The advantages of curvilinear nearly- orthogonal grids are also discussed. (MM) U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|Many {{empirical}} {{models and}} climatologies of high-latitude ionospheric processes, such as convection, {{have been developed}} over the last 40 years. One common feature {{in the development of}} these models is that measurements from different times are combined and averaged on fixed <b>coordinate</b> <b>grids.</b> This methodology ignores the reality that high-latitude ionospheric features are organized relative to the location of the ionospheric footprint of the boundary between open and closed geomagnetic field lines (OCB). This boundary is in continual motion, and the polar cap that it encloses is continually expanding and contracting in response to changes in the rates of magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause and in the magnetotail. As a consequence, models that are developed by combining and averaging data in fixed <b>coordinate</b> <b>grids</b> heavily smooth the variations that occur near the boundary location. Here we propose that the development of future models should consider the location of the OCB in order to more accurately model the variations in this region. We present a methodology which involves identifying the OCB from spacecraft auroral images and then organizing measurements in a grid where the bins are placed relative to the OCB location. We demonstrate the plausibility of this methodology using ionospheric vorticity measurements made by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars and OCB measurements from the IMAGE spacecraft FUV auroral imagers. This demonstration shows that this new methodology results in sharpening and clarifying features of climatological maps near the OCB location. We discuss the potential impact of this methodology on space weather applications...|$|R
