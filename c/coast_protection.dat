500|$|One {{serious threat}} {{to the future of the}} Head is erosion of the exposed {{southern}} cliff face from wind and rain, as well as erosion caused by the sea primarily through the process of Longshore drift. A comparison of Ordnance Survey maps reveals that 25 metres of cliff was washed away from 1915 to 1962, a process accelerated by the Bournemouth cliff's concreted promenade and groynes, construction of which started in the early 20th century. It is thought that in the last 200 years around 150 metres of land has been lost from the head. The first attempt to counteract erosion came in the 1930s when Bournemouth Council constructed a breakwater now known as [...] "the Long Groyne". Since then, a gabion revetment has been constructed to secure the weakest point at the eastern end of the Head. In a long-term project to secure the head's future, from 2005 to 2008 Poole Bay was replenished with 1.8 million cubic metres of beach material, drawing ire from some surfers and beach lovers owing to the increase in sharp stones on Southbourne beach in particular. The project's organizers, the Poole Bay Partnership, state that: [...] "The resulting wide beaches have been a success in terms of their function as a <b>coast</b> <b>protection</b> structure and for the enjoyment they provide to the area's residents and visitors." ...|$|E

5000|$|... ==Geology== The spit {{formed from}} loose flint pebbles {{which had been}} eroded from the cliffs further west. Although {{originally}} formed by natural processes, Hurst Spit has been declining in volume, probably since the 1940s when <b>coast</b> <b>protection</b> works in Christchurch Bay first began to interrupt {{the flow of the}} shingle towards the spit. In 1989 the spit was so weakened that it was danger of being permanently breached. A stabilisation scheme took place in 1996-7. This scheme rebuilt the shingle bank using dredged shingle, and saw the building of a new rock revetment utilising larvikite rocks shipped from Norway at the western end of the spit and near the castle. The spit has to be replenished from time to time, most notably {{in the aftermath of the}} 2013-14 UK winter storms when New Forest District Council had to rebuild and reinforce parts of the spit.
