It examines the role of 2 ̆ 2 important rights 2 ̆ 2 in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s collateral order cases and attempts to determine whether 2 ̆ 2 importance 2 ̆ 2 is an additional requirement of the collateral order test. The author seeks to define what the <b>Court</b> <b>means</b> by an 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 right or issue, and to explain the view that some rights are sufficiently 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 to outweigh costs of piecemeal appeals. The author considers the 2 ̆ 2 unreviewability 2 ̆ 2 requirement of the collateral order doctrine, specifically what constitutes an 2 ̆ 2 unreviewable 2 ̆ 2 order under the doctrineand what, if anything, is the distinction between an 2 ̆ 2 unreviewable 2 ̆ 2 order and an order that leads to 2 ̆ 2 irreversible 2 ̆ 2 harm.

40|$|Legislatures {{sometimes}} {{address the}} risk that a court will declare {{all or part of}} a law unconstitutional by including 2 ̆ 2 fallback 2 ̆ 2 provisions that take effect on condition of such total or partial invalidation. The most common kind of fallback provision is a severability clause, which effectively creates a fallback of the original law minus its invalid provisions or applications. However, fallback law can and sometimes does take the express form of substitute provisions. Fallback law can raise a surprisingly large number of constitutional and policy questions. A fallback provision itself must be constitutional, but how to discern the constitutionality of the fallback will not always be obvious, especially where the original provision 2 ̆ 7 s defect consists in its use of some impermissible procedure, for then courts will need to ascertain whether the fallback purges the taint of the original provision. Fallback law can also be challenged as impermissibly delegating lawmaking authority, and one state, Oregon, forbids fallback law based on an express non-delegation provision of its state constitution. Although congressional use of fallback law does not violate federal principles of non-delegation, it can run afoul of the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s duty to consider the constitutionality of its enactments, regardless of whether that duty permits broad or narrow deference to the courts. A legislature might adopt a fallback provision that does not aim to achieve the same basic objectives as the original provision, but instead penalizes the courts for invalidating it. By harming the courts or innocent third parties, a fallback can be used to coerce a ruling upholding the original provision. Such coercive fallbacks should be deemed unconstitutional, even {{on the assumption that the}} legislature could enact the same provision separately as an ex post response to an unpopular judicial decision. Assuming legislators overcome the constitutional obstacles to fallback law, they face a policy tradeoff in deciding what event triggers the fallback. Awaiting a final ruling on the validity of the original provision by the U. S. Supreme Court or state high <b>court</b> <b>means</b> leaving in place a legal void, the very evil that fallbacks aim to prevent; yet, making lower courts 2 ̆ 7 decisions trigger the fallback 2 ̆ 7 s applicability either creates legal inconsistency or gives those courts inordinate lawmaking power. Accordingly, legislatures should always hesitate before crafting expressly substitutive fallback law and should sometimes hesitate before crafting severability rules...|$|E

The main purpose of establishing international institutions and organizations is to end disputes between States through diplomatic means through the rules of international law. In the event of violation of the law, these institutions should be separated from those disputes and independent and have the authority to solve and end these disputes. Currently, the International Criminal Court which is governed by the Rome Statue in 1998, takes on the role of prosecuting individuals who commit crimes against humanity and war crimes during disputes. On July 1, 2002, with the ratification of 60 states, the international criminal court (ICC) entered into force. The primary mission of the International Criminal Court is to help put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes. It is responsible prosecute individuals who commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is,also, within its competence to deal with the crime of aggression when agreement is reached on the definition of the crime of aggression. The International Criminal Court is therefore legally and functionally independent and is not part of the United Nations system. However, there is a close relationship between the United Nations and the criminal court, through the Negotiation Relations Agreement, and the Security Council can bring a case before the International Criminal Court and refer international criminal cases that fall under the jurisdiction of the Court. The Court has 18 judges, elected by States parties for a period of nine years, where the judge must remain in office until any trial or appeal has already begun. Two judges may not be from the same country. On January 2015, the State of Palestine became a member of the Rome Statue in the International Criminal Court. The accession of Palestine to the International Criminal <b>Court</b> <b>means</b> that as Palestine is entitled to go to court if it is able to do so through the UN Security Council against Israel, it also, means the Palestinian Authority's commitment to the conditions of membership in the court and its willingness to hand over Palestinian persons accused of war criminals regardless of the status and/or position from the Prime Ministry, President or to the smallest solider or person. This person will also be trailed against crimes committed to any individual or state that maybe aligned with Israel. As a member of the ICC, the State of Palestine is obliged to hand over immediately those who are wanted by the court. They will be prosecuted according to a list of charges against them on various charges that are considered as an act of terrorist that led to the killing of civilians and it will not be considered as an act of resistance to the occupation. These acts include the firing of rockets on Israeli cities or bombings in Jerusalem, and/or Tel Aviv. The State of Palestine has to recognize that as a member of the ICC there are other members that are pro-Israel and against the rights of Palestinians people to fight for freedom and independence and for the establishment of an independent state with its capital in Jerusalem.

40|$|Najnoviji međunarodni ugovor koji uređuje prijevoz robe je Konvencija o ugovorima o međunarodnom prijevozu robe u cijelosti ili djelomično morem, iz 2009. Ova Konvencija, poznata pod nazivom Rotterdamska pravila, sadržava, između ostalog, i odredbe o sudskoj nadležnosti za odlučivanje u postupcima protiv prijevoznika i pomorskog izvršitelja za naknadu štete nastale tijekom prijevoza robe. Radi se o iznimno važnom pitanju za međunarodni prijevoz i međunarodnu trgovinu uopće, o čemu svjedoči i činjenica da je upravo u pogledu odredaba o sudskoj nadležnosti bilo ponajviše prijepora tijekom stručnog rada na izradi konačnog teksta Rotterdamskih pravila. U ovome radu te se odredbe kritički analiziraju i uspoređuju s uređenjem istog pitanja u pravu Europske unije (osobito Uredbom 44 / 2001) kao i s općeprihvaćenim rješenjima sadržanima u formularnim ugovorima o prijevozu robe morem. U zaključku se daje ocjena uspjelosti uređenja pitanja sudske nadležnosti u Rotterdamskim pravilima te iznosi stajalište o utjecaju sadržaja tih odredaba na odluku pojedinih država da postanu stranka toga međunarodnog ugovora. For many years, the {{international}} maritime community has sought uniformity and harmonization of law regulating {{carriage of goods}} by sea. Historically, {{there have been several}} well known attempts at establishing uniform international law in this field, including: the Hague Rules (1924); the Hague/Visby Rules (1968); the Hamburg Rules (1978); and the International Multimodal Transportation Convention (1980), but none of these attempts has managed to achieve the global level of acceptance necessary for international uniformity. On 23 September 2009, sixteen countries signed new Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, known as “the Rotterdam Rules“. The Convention is designed to legislate not only for international maritime carriage of goods but also for international multimodal carriage of goods, where a maritime leg is provided for in the contract of carriage. It is best described as a “maritime plus” instrument. If entered into force, the Convention will significantly change the market position of maritime stakeholders, including shippers, carriers, freight forwarders and marine insurers. The Hague and Hague-Visby Rules do not deal with jurisdiction. The provisions of the Rotterdam Rules on this issue are based upon the corresponding provisions in the Hamburg Rules. These chapters were the subject of focused discussion, contrasting those in favour of including such provisions with those who preferred to leave the areas to domestic or other rules. The situation was further complicated by the European Commission 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the negotiations, since the EU have exclusive competence to negotiate on behalf of its Member State in respect of jurisdiction. A compromise solution was found, whereby the chapter on jurisdiction was made subject to an “opt-in” reservation: only those States that specifically make a declaration that they are to be bound by those chapters will be bound by them. Under the Rotterdam Rules, actions against the carrier may be brought in the following places situated in a Contracting State: the domicile of the carrier; the place of receipt agreed in the contract of carriage; the place of delivery agreed in the contract of carriage; the port where the goods are initially loaded on a ship; or the port where the goods are finally discharged from a ship. Alternatively, the new Convention permits proceedings to be brought in a court designated by an agreement between the shipper and the carrier. However, such a court will be exclusive only exceptionally. In fact, the exclusive choice of court agreement is effective only if contained in a volume contract. Should the claimant wish to file suit against the maritime performing party, the action must be filed in a competent court situated within the domicile of the maritime performing party, or the port where the goods were received or delivered by the maritime performing party or the port in which the maritime performing party performs its activities with respect to the goods. After a dispute has arisen, the parties to the dispute may agree to resolve it in any competent <b>court</b> (<b>means</b> a court in a Contracting State).
