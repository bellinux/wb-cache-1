5000|$|<b>Chapes</b> or [...] "caps" [...] {{of various}} designs could be fitted {{to the bar}} to enable one strap end to be secured before {{fastening}} the other, adjustable end. This made buckles easily removable and interchangeable, leading to a significant advantage since buckles were expensive. Unfortunately, the teeth or spikes on the semi-circular <b>chapes</b> damaged the straps or belts, making frequent repairs of the material necessary. Buckles fitted with [...] "T"-, anchor-, or spade-shaped <b>chapes</b> avoided this problem but needed a slotted end in the belt to accommodate them.|$|E

5000|$|With the [...] "locket" [...] or [...] "throat" [...] fitting at the top, open, {{end of the}} {{scabbard}} (9 in the diagram; confusingly, in French this is a chappe), the chape {{is often}} {{the only part of}} a scabbard to survive in the ground for archaeologists to find. Notable scabbard <b>chapes</b> include the Germanic Thorsberg chape, with an inscription in runes, from about 200 AD. [...] A striking silver chape terminating in the heads of animals or monsters from the St Ninian's Isle Treasure is now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. This might be Anglo-Saxon or Scottish or Pictish, and dates to about 800 AD. [...] Perhaps the most interesting period for <b>chapes</b> is Celtic art, where a variety of shapes and ornament were used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treasure}} is {{the best}} survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period, some pieces gilded. As Prof. O'Dell says, there were pieces for secular use such {{as a series of}} different penannular brooches (some of them probably as unfinished half-ware) and different <b>chapes</b> from sword scabbards, pieces which might have been used for religious ceremonies and rituals like the bowls, spoons, and [...] "thimbles" [...] and all of those joined with some pieces of unsure meanings like the heavy ring chains or collars which are referred to as [...] "power symbols of Pictish chieftains" [...] by some scholars. The brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal. [...] Two of the scabbard <b>chapes</b> and a sword pommel appear to be Anglo-Saxon pieces, probably made in Mercia in the late 8th century; one has an inscription with a prayer in Old English. One of the mounts has a triple spiral design. We know of exchanges of gifts between Anglo-Saxon and Pictish rulers, and generally [...] "weapons are among the objects which travelled most widely in the early medieval period".|$|E
5000|$|The buckle {{essentially}} {{consists of}} four main components: the frame, chape, bar, and prong. The oldest Roman buckles are of a simple [...] "D"-shaped frame, in which the prong or tongue extends {{from one side to}} the other. In the 14th century, buckles with a double-loop or [...] "8"-shaped frame emerged. The prongs of these buckles attach to the center post. The appearance of multi-part buckles with <b>chapes</b> and removable pins, which were commonly found on shoes, occurred in the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|For {{the last}} few hundred years, buckles have been made from brass (an alloy of copper and zinc). In the 18th century, brass buckles {{incorporated}} iron bars, <b>chapes,</b> and prongs due to the parts being made by different manufactures. Silver was also used in buckle manufacturing for its malleability and for being strong and durable with an attractive shine. White metal, any bright metallic compound, was also used in all styles of buckles; however, if iron was present, rust will form if it is allowed to be exposed and remain in damp conditions.|$|E

50|$|Tavernier was now {{eager to}} visit the East. At Ratisbon—with the help of Pere Joseph, Cardinal Richelieu's agent and éminence grise—Tavernier was able to join the retinue {{of a pair of}} French travelers, M. de <b>Chapes</b> and M. de St. Liebau, who had {{received}} a mission to go to the Levant. In their company he reached Constantinople early in 1631, where he spent eleven months, and then proceeded by Tokat, Erzerum, and Erivan to Safavid Persia. His farthest point in this first journey was Isfahan. He returned by Baghdad, Aleppo, Alexandretta, Malta, and Italy, and was again in Paris in 1633.|$|E
50|$|On September 3, 1924, a {{group of}} 56 young {{military}} officers (mostly lieutenants and sub-lieutenants coming from middle classes or working classes), led by Colonel Marmaduke Grove and Major Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, attended the session where the congressional salary discussion was to take place. They quietly sat in the public tribunes, {{and waited for the}} topic to be broached. At that point the president of the chamber, feeling intimidated, demanded that the public be cleared, as the discussion was to be secret. As the officers silently started to leave, they began to rattle the scabbards (<b>chapes)</b> of the sabers they wore as part of their dress uniform against the floor, as a way to indicate their discontent with the political class in general, and in sign of support to Alessandri's social agenda.|$|E
5000|$|Frame-style buckles are {{the oldest}} design. In a frame-and-prong buckle the prong {{attaches}} to {{one end of}} the frame and extends [...] "away" [...] from the wearer {{through a hole in the}} belt, where it anchors against the opposite side of the frame. The oldest styles have a simple loop or [...] "D" [...] shaped frame (see: D-ring), but [...] "double-loop" [...] or [...] "center post" [...] buckles whose prongs attach to a fixed center section appear in the 8th century. Very small buckles with removable center pins and <b>chapes</b> were introduced and used on shoes, beginning in the 17th century, but not often for waist-belts.

50|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality. Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard <b>chapes,</b> but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern Northern Ireland, notably {{in a series of}} engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, {{both before and after the}} Roman invasion. It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.|$|E

40|$|The Ottawa Embayment is a intracratonic rift basin that {{preserves}} {{a unique}} and eventful history through deep time. Its evolution records opening of the Iapetus Ocean with the break-up of Rodinia, followed by {{the formation of a}} continental passive margin, trapping siliciclastic sediments eroded from the adjacent Grenville Province. Samples were collected from a transect across the crystalline rift flank and through the embayment. We investigate the influence of crystallinitiy and non-ideal crystal <b>chapes</b> on He diffusion and resulting zircon (U-Th) /He age with the use of zircon (U-Th) /He thermochronometry, raman spectroscopy and x-ray micro-computed tomography. We then integrate our thermochronology data with regional geology to utilize multi-sample numerical modelling to improve our understanding of the thermal history of the Ottawa Embayment and the evolution of intracratonic rift basins. The works collected within define a comprehensive temperature-time history for the basin and rift flank from the Late-Mesoproterozoic to present day...|$|E

40|$|Microgravity and its {{environment}} have {{adverse effects on}} the immune system. Abnormal immune responses observed in microgravity may pose serious consequences, especially for the recent directions of NASA for long-term space missions to Moon, Mars and deep Space exploration. The study of space flight immunology is limited due to relative inaccessibility, difficulty of performing experiments in space, and inadequate provisions in this area in the United States and Russian space programs (Taylor 1993). Microgravity and stress experienced during space flights results in immune system aberration (Taylor 1993). In ground-based mouse models {{for some of the}} microgravity effects on the human body, hindlimb unloading (HU) has been reported to cause abnormal cell proliferation and cytokine production (Armstrong et al., 1993, <b>Chapes</b> et al. 1993). In this report, we document that a nutritional nucleotide supplementation as studied in ground-based microgravity analogs, has potential to serve as a countermeasure for the immune dysfunction observed in space travel...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{implementation}} of waterproofing layer is {{an important element in}} the construction of road bridge. It is thus necessary to monitor the implementation of waterproofing layer during the construction (or rehabilitation) of the work. Traditional methods of mechanical survey are more and more replaced by infrared thermography. Thermal contrasts due to the presence of water or air under impermeable layer are easily detectable with an infrared camera. With the assistance of modeling, the optimum conditions for monitoring are visualized. The purpose of modeling was to fix the limits of a numerical inversion in order to characterize the nature of the defect. The last stage was the validation of the method on a site test of the Laboratoire Régional des Ponts et Chaussées (LRPC) in Autun. Heat flux and temperatures are measured at the surface of the waterproofing layer. An inverse analysis based on a frequency analysis method then makes it possible to characterize the nature of the defect.
