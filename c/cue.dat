40|$|Although {{children}} with autism often fail follow the gaze of others in natural situations they are sensitive to directional <b>cues</b> by eye movements. This suggests that the low-level aspects of gaze <b>cueing</b> and are intact in persons with autism, while the higher level social skills like joint attention and attribution of desire and intention are impaired. The present study investigates whether these low-level aspects of gaze <b>cueing</b> are indeed intact. Children with high functioning ASD (n = 22) and matched controls (n = 22) performed two choice reaction time tasks in which eye- or arrow direction correctly (congruent) or incorrectly (incongruent) <b>cues</b> target location. In {{children with}} normal development right side <b>cueing,</b> but not left side <b>cueing,</b> induced a congruence effect for eyes, while this <b>cueing</b> effect was evident for right and left side <b>cueing</b> for arrow <b>cues.</b> In children with ASD left side <b>cueing,</b> but not right side <b>cueing,</b> induced a congruence effect for eyes while right sight <b>cueing,</b> but not left side <b>cueing,</b> provoked a congruence effect for arrow <b>cues.</b> These findings indicate that children with ASD have functional, but atypical, low-level visual orienting to eye gaze and arrow <b>cues.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — Aim: This {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study examined reactivity to alcohol, polydrug, marijuana and emotional picture <b>cues</b> in students who were referred to a college alcohol and drug assistance program. Methods: The fMRI data of 10 participants (5 females; 5 males) were collected while they viewed standardized emotional and appetitive <b>cues.</b> Results: Positive and negative emotional <b>cues</b> produced greater activity than neutral <b>cues</b> in the expected brain areas. Compared with neutral <b>cues,</b> alcohol <b>cues</b> produced greater brain activation in the right insula, left anterior cingulate, left caudate and left prefrontal cortex (Z = 2. 01, 1. 86, 1. 82, 1. 81, respectively; P < 0. 05). Drug <b>cues</b> produced significantly greater left prefrontal activity compared with neutral <b>cues,</b> with polydrug <b>cues</b> activating the right insula and marijuana <b>cues</b> activating left anterior cingulate. Conclusions: Students at-risk for alcohol abuse showed neural reactivity to alcohol <b>cues</b> in four brain regions, which is consistent with their greater use of alcohol. Insula activation to appetitive <b>cues</b> may be an early marker of risk for progression to alcohol/drug abuse...|$|R

To accommodate these findings we propose an alternative model of the processes mediating visual sex discriminations: Form <b>cues</b> can be used directly if they are available and unambiguous.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the validity effect produced by gaze <b>cues</b> should be ascribed solely to reflexive, bottom-up mechanisms or to volitional, top-down mechanisms. We find, in a central <b>cueing</b> paradigm, that masked eye gaze <b>cues</b> can indeed produce a validity effect; however, the efficacy of these masked gaze <b>cues</b> is sharply constrained by experimental context. Specifically, masked gaze <b>cues</b> only produced a validity effect when they appeared in the context of unmasked (clearly visible) and predictive gaze <b>cues.</b> In contrast, unmasked gaze <b>cues</b> produced reliable validity effects independent of experimental context, including Experiment 4 wherein 80 % of the <b>cues</b> were invalid (i. e. counter-predictive). Collectively, these results suggest that the effective processing of masked gaze <b>cues</b> requires volitional control, whereas the processing of unmasked gaze <b>cues</b> benefits from both reflexive and top-down mechanisms. 1 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The 2006 World Championship {{began with}} O'Sullivan {{defeating}} Dave Harold 10–4, {{followed by a}} struggle through to a 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 {{at the end of}} the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his <b>cue.</b> This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the <b>cue,</b> before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his <b>cue</b> and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new <b>cue.</b> O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.|$|E

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a <b>cue</b> for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees.
