25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more <b>comfortable</b> <b>talking</b> about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "It starts and ends with Courteney and Jennifer being really great friends and excited to work together again—especially doing comedy together.

2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not <b>comfortable</b> <b>talking</b> to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it." [...] He added, [...] "It's not just Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{scholarly}} monograph, Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues, Wendy J. Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives {{students the opportunity to}} talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak is one way to do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>talking</b> about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E

How gallantly he defended my life against a dozen of the enemy's cavalry was shown {{by the fact that he}} received the Victoria Cross, and I can tell you that such an immense number of brave deeds were performed during the Mutiny that George's must be considered an extraordinary act of bravery to have obtained for him that honour." ...|$|R

And now, as I am not busy at present, let us have a <b>comfortable</b> <b>talk</b> as to what has happened since we met last. I was at the banquet at the grand master's on the night when you related your adventures.

40|$|I {{am pleased}} to have this {{opportunity}} {{to talk to you}} about the physician 2 ̆ 7 s role in the assessment of normal behavior. One source of my appreciation relates to the fact that this topic is rarely discussed explicitly in symposia organized by psychiatrists for non-psychiatrist physicians. A major reason for underemphasis of this subject is that psychiatrists are quite divided in their perspectives and opinions regarding normal behavior. Not surprisingly, we psychiatrists are much more <b>comfortable</b> when <b>talking</b> to non-psychiatrists about the nuances of maladaptation or of emotional illness...|$|R
