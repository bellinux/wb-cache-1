5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
40|$|Isolated porcine thyroid {{cells were}} cultured on {{collagen}} gels (control group, TSH-stimulated group, and double-layered culture). They were split or cut to remove cytoplasmic soluble proteins for replica preparations. Some specimens were immunostained with anti-actin antibody or decorated with Si myosin fragments to identify actin filaments. The basal <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> of thyroid <b>cells</b> of monolayer culture were {{in contact with}} collagen gels and the apical <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> faced the culture medium. Networks of actin filaments were attached to the cytoplasmic sides of the apical <b>cell</b> <b>membranes,</b> while intermediate filaments were localized along the basal ones. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) treatment induced the formation of microvilli only on the apical <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> and the accumulation of actin filaments under the apical <b>cell</b> <b>membranes,</b> indicating the apical-basal polarity of the cells. In double-layered culture, the primitive follicular lumens with micro-villi appeared between two adjacent cells. The interaction of <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> with collagen gels is a determinant factor in the orientation of apical-basal polarity. Moreover, the TSH treatment and cell-cell contact further in-tensify the polarization through reorganizing the cytoskeletons...|$|R

The model membranes used in our calculations for normal and leukemic thymocytes comprised 23 and 25 kinds of lipids, respectively, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol. The mole fractions of the lipids adopted here were based on previously published experimental values. Our calculations clearly showed that the membrane area was increased in leukemic cells, and that the isothermal area compressibility of the leukemic plasma membranes was double that of normal <b>cells.</b> The calculated <b>membranes</b> of leukemic <b>cells</b> were thus considerably bulkier and softer in the lateral direction {{compared with those of}} normal cells. The tilt angle of the cholesterol and the conformation of the phospholipid fatty acid tails both showed a lower level of order in leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> compared with normal <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> The lateral radial distribution function of the lipids also showed a more disordered structure in leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> than in normal <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> These observations all show that, for the present thymocytes, the lateral structure of the membrane is considerably disordered by canceration. Furthermore, the calculated lateral self-diffusion coefficient of the lipid molecules in leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> was almost double that in normal <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> The calculated rotational and wobbling autocorrelation functions also indicated that the molecular motion of the lipids was enhanced in leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Thus, here we have demonstrated that the membranes of thymocyte leukemic cells are more disordered and more fluid than normal <b>cell</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane,</b> a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.
