5|$|<b>Compulsory</b> {{conscription}} was abolished in January 2008. Until 2008 {{military service}} was <b>compulsory</b> for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 {{from the earlier}} scheme of nine-month conscription tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compulsory</b> {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is <b>compulsory</b> for all. The legislation concerning <b>compulsory</b> education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of <b>compulsory</b> education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{public schools}} are {{operated}} by the Education Bureau. The system features a non-compulsory three-year kindergarten, followed by a <b>compulsory</b> six-year primary education, a <b>compulsory</b> three-year junior secondary education, a non-compulsory two-year senior secondary education leading to the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examinations and a two-year matriculation course leading to the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examinations. The New Senior Secondary academic structure and curriculum was implemented in September 2009, which provides for all students to receive three years of <b>compulsory</b> junior and three years of <b>compulsory</b> senior secondary education. Under the new curriculum, {{there is only one}} public examination, namely the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education.|$|E
5|$|The <b>compulsory</b> {{education}} {{period in}} Malta has been {{between five and}} 16 years of age since {{the introduction of the}} Education Act 1988. This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, school attendance became <b>compulsory</b> for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not <b>compulsory)</b> and 14 years of age in 1946, when <b>compulsory</b> school attendance was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise. <b>Compulsory</b> schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (applying to England and Wales), commonly known as Forster's Education Act having been drawn up by William Edward Forster, created the concept of <b>compulsory</b> education for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education <b>compulsory</b> was {{at the discretion of}} school boards; education was <b>compulsory</b> in approximately 40% of schools by 1873. In areas where education was considered a problem, elected school boards could be set up. These boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by Parliament, to require attendance and fine the parents of children who did not attend. There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which varied by board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.|$|E
5|$|There are 192 {{institutions}} catering for <b>compulsory</b> education, 42 {{schools for}} {{upper secondary education}} and 9 higher education institutions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Compulsory</b> {{education}} {{is divided into}} ten years. Schools which have all ten years, year one to seven, and years eight to ten are common. Those schools which teach from years eight to ten often have a wider catchment area. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the Reykjavík urban area, schools can be up to 1200 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can have fewer than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools have fewer than 100 pupils. All <b>compulsory</b> education institutions are mixed sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; psychological counselling is also available.|$|E
5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a <b>compulsory</b> language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi <b>compulsory</b> in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi <b>compulsory</b> from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the <b>compulsory</b> Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students {{who did not want to}} learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the interwar {{years and}} World War II, {{widespread}} poverty in Malta prevented {{the children of}} the lower classes from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared <b>compulsory</b> in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the <b>compulsory</b> education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Education in Malta is <b>compulsory</b> through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three {{different}} providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made <b>compulsory</b> in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became <b>compulsory</b> was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Education is <b>compulsory</b> for {{children}} between the ages of 6 and 14. Education is free for Bahraini citizens in public schools, with the Bahraini Ministry of Education providing free textbooks. Coeducation is not used in public schools, with boys and girls segregated into separate schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the <b>compulsory</b> {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system <b>compulsory</b> in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, the Germans {{began to}} {{implement}} <b>compulsory</b> deportation of Belgian workers {{to work in}} German factories. The introduction of the policy, which had been imposed in World War I and which the Committee had hoped to avoid at all costs, marked the last blow to the Committee's influence.|$|E
5|$|In his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, The Plan: Big Ideas for America, Emanuel {{advocated}} a three-month <b>compulsory</b> universal service program for Americans {{between the ages}} of 18 and 25. An expanded version was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the 610 Office {{performs}} functions {{unrelated to}} the monitoring and persecution of unrecognized religions.

5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of <b>compulsory</b> education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year <b>compulsory</b> education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E
5|$|Learning one of {{the other}} {{national}} languages at school is <b>compulsory</b> for all Swiss pupils, so many Swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{reserved}} {{the right}} not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included <b>compulsory</b> unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were incompatible with it.|$|E
5|$|Primary schools, {{secondary}} {{schools and universities}} were introduced in 1872 {{as a result of}} the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, <b>compulsory</b> education in Japan comprises elementary and middle school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.|$|E
5|$|The French {{system of}} {{education}} is the norm and French {{is the language of}} teaching, although the Sango language is promoted in schools. A substantial percentage of the population is literate. Schooling is <b>compulsory</b> for children ages 6 to 14.|$|E
5|$|The Scout is {{required}} to achieve six different interest badges from the Scout Badge Book.

5|$|The {{levels of}} {{education}} in the Faroe Islands are primary, secondary and higher education. Most institutions are funded by the state; there are few private schools in the country. Education is <b>compulsory</b> for 9 years between the ages of 7 and 16.|$|E
5|$|The right against exploitation, {{given in}} Articles 23 and 24, {{provides}} for two provisions, namely {{the abolition of}} {{trafficking in human beings}} and Begar (forced labour), and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories, mines, etc. Child labour is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution. Begar, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for <b>compulsory</b> services for public purposes. <b>Compulsory</b> military conscription is covered by this provision.|$|E
5|$|The year 1918 saw the {{introduction}} of the Education Act 1918, commonly also known as the Fisher Act as it was devised by Herbert Fisher. The act enforced <b>compulsory</b> education from 5–14 years, but also included provision for <b>compulsory</b> part-time education for all 14 to 18-year-olds. There were also plans for expansion in tertiary education, by raising the participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after World War I made this impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18. The 1918 act was not implemented until a further act of 1921 was passed.|$|E
5|$|Their {{principal}} {{purpose is}} to help ease the transition into upper secondary education and help the pupil to choose a course of study. Pupils are awarded a certificate with their marks {{at the end of}} the <b>compulsory</b> schooling period.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} support for <b>compulsory</b> {{military}} service amongst the public, however, and {{combined with the}} financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the <b>compulsory</b> training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Upper {{secondary}} education or framhaldsskóli (lit. “continued school”), follows lower {{secondary education}}. These schools are {{also known as}} gymnasia in English. It is not <b>compulsory,</b> but everyone who has had their <b>compulsory</b> education {{has the right to}} upper secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 2007. Like all other schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools are mixed sex.|$|E
