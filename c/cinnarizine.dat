25|$|In {{acquired}} angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as {{tranexamic acid}} or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. <b>Cinnarizine</b> {{may also be}} useful because it blocks the activation of C4 {{and can be used}} in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot.|$|E
2500|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (dimenhydrinate), scopolamine, Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), promethazine, cyclizine, and Stugeron (<b>cinnarizine).</b> <b>Cinnarizine</b> {{is not available}} in the United States, as it is not approved by the FDA. As these medications often have side effects, anyone involved in high-risk activities while at sea (such as SCUBA divers) must evaluate the risks versus the benefits. Promethazine is especially known to cause drowsiness, which is often counteracted by ephedrine in a combination known as [...] "the Coast Guard cocktail.". There are special considerations {{to be aware of}} when the common anti-motion sickness medications are used in the military setting where performance must be maintained at a high level.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, <b>cinnarizine</b> {{can be used}} in scuba divers {{without an}} {{increased}} risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity which can result in seizures, and is a high risk in closed-circuit oxygen diving. This is also relevant to divers who could potentially have to undergo hypobaric decompression therapy, which uses high oxygen pressure and could also be affected by any cinnarizine-induced CNS oxygen toxicity risk. However, <b>cinnarizine</b> does not heighten toxicity risk, and in fact, evidence even seems to suggest that <b>cinnarizine</b> may be beneficial in helping delay O2 toxicity in the central nervous system.There is also evidence that <b>cinnarizine</b> may be used as an effective anti-asthma medication when taken regularly.|$|E
5000|$|Bioavailability of orally {{administered}} <b>cinnarizine</b> {{is typically}} low and variable {{due to high}} incidence of degradation. However, {{it has been found}} than when administered intravenously in lipid emulsion, better pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were achieved. [...] The lipid emulsion administration had a higher AUC and lower clearance than the solution form, which meant that there was an increased bioavailability of <b>cinnarizine,</b> allowing for an improved therapeutic effect. [...] Plasma pharmacokinetics of <b>cinnarizine</b> administered intravenously follows a three-compartment model first with a fast distribution phase, followed by a slower distribution phase, and ending with a very slow elimination. [...] The Vss (steady state apparent volume of distribution) for lipid emulsion administration was 2x lower (6.871+/- 1.432 L/kg) than that of <b>cinnarizine</b> given in solution (14.018 +/- 5.598 L/kg) and it was found that significantly less <b>cinnarizine</b> was taken up into the lung and brain in the lipid emulsion condition. This is significant because it would reduce the likelihood of toxic side effects in the central nervous system.|$|E

5000|$|Beyond an anti-vertigo treatment, <b>cinnarizine</b> {{could be}} also {{viewed as a}} {{nootropic}} drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain {{and the fact that}} it is also used as a labyrinthine sedative. <b>Cinnarizine</b> inhibits the flow of calcium into red blood cells, which increases the elasticity of the cell wall, thereby increasing their flexibility and making the blood less viscous. This allows the blood to travel more efficiently and effectively through narrowed vessels in order to bring oxygen to damaged tissue. It is also effectively combined with other nootropics, primarily piracetam; in such combination each drug potentiates the other in boosting brain oxygen supply. [...] An animal study comparing the effectiveness of <b>cinnarizine</b> and flunarizine (a derivative of <b>cinnarizine</b> that is 2.5-15 times stronger [...] for treatment of transient global cerebral ischemia, it was found that <b>cinnarizine</b> helped to improve the functional abnormalities of ischemia, but did not help with damage to the neurons. Flunarizine, on the other hand, offered more neuronal protection, but was less effective in treating subsequent behavioral changes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> is {{also known}} to cause acute and chronic parkinsonism due to its {{affinity}} for D2 receptors, which strongly counter-suggests its actual usefulness for improving neurohealth. Cinnarizine's antagonistic effects of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum leads to symptoms of depression, tremor, muscle rigidity, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia, which are characterized as Drug-Induced Parkinson's disease and is the second leading cause of Parkinson's. Evidence {{suggests that it is}} one of the metabolites of <b>cinnarizine,</b> C-2, that has an active role in contributing to the development of drug-induced Parkinson's. It is also of note that an estimated 17 of 100 new Parkinson's cases are linked to administration of either <b>cinnarizine</b> or Flunarizine, making <b>cinnarizine</b> and drug-induced Parkinson's a serious issue. Those people especially at risk are elderly patients, in particular women, and patients who have been taking the drug for a longer amount of time. [...] There is also evidence that suggests that patients with a family history of Parkinson's, or a genetic predispostion to the disease are more likely to develop the drug induced form of this disease as a result of <b>cinnarizine</b> treatment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study that}} {{administered}} 75 mg doses of <b>cinnarizine,</b> {{twice a day}} for twelve days, to healthy volunteers, observed that <b>cinnarizine</b> did build up in the body, with a steady-state accumulation factor of 2.79 +/- 0.23. However, the AUCT for this amount of time (T=12 days) was {{not significantly different from}} the AUC∞, which was estimated from the single dose administration. As a very weakly basic and also lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility, <b>cinnarizine</b> is able to cross the blood brain barrier by simple diffusion. [...] It is because of this property that it is able to exert its effects on cerebral blood flow in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to antagonizing D2 receptors, treatment with <b>cinnarizine</b> {{has also been}} shown to lead to reduced presynaptic dopamine and serotonin, as well as alterations in vesicular transport of dopamine. [...] Terland et al. have shown that chronic treatment with <b>cinnarizine</b> builds the drug concentrations high enough that they interfere with the proton electrochemical gradient necessary for packaging dopamine into vesicles. <b>Cinnarizine,</b> pKa = 7.4, acts as a protonophore, which prevents the MgATP-dependent production of the electrochemical gradient crucial to the transport and storage of dopamine into vesicles, and thereby lowers the levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia neurons and leads to the Parkinson's symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|When {{prescribed}} for balance problems and vertigo, <b>cinnarizine</b> is typically taken {{two or three}} times daily depending on the amount of each dose and when used to treat motion sickness, the pill is taken at least two hours before travelling and then again every four hours during travel. [...] However, a recent 2012 study comparing the effects of <b>cinnarizine</b> to transdermal scopolamine for the treatment of seasickness, concluded that scopolamine was reported as significantly more effective and as having fewer adverse side effects than <b>cinnarizine.</b> This led to the conclusion that transdermal scopolamine is likely a better option for the treatment of motion sickness in naval crew and other sea travelers.|$|E
5000|$|Hydroamination {{could find}} {{applications}} {{due to the}} valuable nature of the resulting amine, {{as well as the}} greenness of the process. Functionalized allylamines, which can be produced through hydroamination, have extensive pharmaceutical application, although presently such species are not prepared by hydroamination. Hydroamination has been utilized to synthesize the allylamine <b>Cinnarizine</b> in quantitative yield. <b>Cinnarizine</b> treats both vertigo and motion sickness related nausea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> {{has also}} {{been found to be}} a {{valuable}} second-line treatment for idiopathic urticarial vasculitis.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{several cases}} of {{pediatric}} and adult <b>cinnarizine</b> overdose have been reported, with effects including {{a range of}} symptoms such as somnolence, coma, vomiting, hypotonia, stupor, and convulsions. [...] The cognitive complications likely result from the antihistaminic effects of <b>cinnarizine,</b> while the motor effects are {{a product of the}} antidopaminergic properties. In cases of overdose, the patient should be brought to and observed in a hospital for potential neurological complications.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> is {{classified}} as a selective antagonist of T-type voltage-operated calcium ion channels, because its binding blocks the channels and keeps them inert. [...] It has a Ki (inhibitory constant) value of 22nM. It is also known to have antihistaminic, antiserotoninergic and antidopaminergic effects, binding to H1 histamine receptors, and dopaminergic (D2) receptors. The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of <b>cinnarizine</b> for smooth muscle contraction inhibition is 60mM [...] {{and it has been}} shown that this drug preferentially binds to its target calcium channels when they are in an open, as opposed to closed conformation. [...] In treatment of nausea and motion sickness it was previously hypothesized that <b>cinnarizine</b> exerts its effects by inhibiting the calcium currents in voltage gated channels in type II vestibular hair cells within the inner ear. [...] However, more recent evidence supports the idea that at pharmacologically relevant levels (0.3µM-0.5µM), <b>cinnarizine</b> is not lessening vestibular vertigo by blocking calcium channels, but rather by inhibiting potassium (K+) currents that are activated by heightened hydrostatic pressure on the hair cells. It is true that <b>cinnarizine</b> does abolish calcium currents in vestibular hair cells as well; it is just that this only occurs at higher concentrations of drug (3µM). [...] The inhibition of these currents works to lessen the vertigo and motion-induced nausea by dampening the over-reactivity of the vestibular hair cells, which send information about balance and motion to the brain.|$|E
50|$|Side effects {{experienced}} {{while taking}} <b>cinnarizine</b> {{range from the}} mild to the quite severe. Possible side effects include drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, headache, skin problems, lethargy, gastrointestinal irritation, hypersensitivity reactions, as well as movement problems/muscle rigidity, and tremor. Because <b>cinnarizine</b> can cause drowsiness and blurred vision, {{it is important that}} users make sure their reactions are normal before driving, operating machinery, or doing any other jobs which could be dangerous if they are not fully alert or able to see well.|$|E
50|$|After administration, <b>cinnarizine</b> is {{completely}} metabolized {{within the body}} and the metabolites are eliminated by one third in the urine and two thirds in solid waste.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> {{is mainly}} {{used to treat}} nausea and {{vomiting}} associated with motion sickness, vertigo, Ménière's disease, or Cogan's syndrome. Studies have shown it to produce significant improvement in hearing loss in some patients.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{derivatives}} of benzylamine and its salts {{have been}} shown to have anti-emetic properties, including those with the N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)benzylamine moiety. [...] Commercially available motion-sickness agents including <b>cinnarizine</b> and meclizine are derivatives of benzylamine.|$|E
50|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} with antihistaminics such as <b>cinnarizine,</b> however, {{can be used}} to suppress the symptoms of vestibular neuronitis while it spontaneously regresses. Prochlorperazine is another commonly prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms of vertigo and nausea.|$|E
5000|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (dimenhydrinate), scopolamine, Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), promethazine, cyclizine, and Stugeron (<b>cinnarizine).</b> <b>Cinnarizine</b> {{is not available}} in the United States, as it is not approved by the FDA.

50|$|In {{acquired}} angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as {{tranexamic acid}} or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. <b>Cinnarizine</b> {{may also be}} useful because it blocks the activation of C4 {{and can be used}} in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> is a {{medication}} derivative of piperazine, and characterized as an antihistamine and a calcium channel blocker, {{it is also}} known to promote cerebral blood flow, and so is used to treat cerebral apoplexy, post-trauma cerebral symptoms, and cerebral arteriosclerosis. However, it is more commonly prescribed for nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness [...] or other sources such as chemotherapy, vertigo, or Ménière's disease. <b>Cinnarizine</b> was first synthesized by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1955. The nonproprietary name {{is derived from the}} cinnamyl substituent on one of the nitrogen atoms, combined with the generic ending [...] "-rizine" [...] for [...] "antihistaminics/cerebral (or peripheral) vasodilators". It is not available in the United States or Canada. It has also been cited {{as one of the most}} used drugs for seasickness within the British Royal Navy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> is most {{commonly}} taken orally, in tablet form, with frequency {{and amount of}} dosage varying depending on the reason for taking the medication. Once ingested, the substance is absorbed quite rapidly and reaches a peak plasma concentration in 1-3 hours post-administration. Cmax, the maximum level of the drug in the tested area (typically blood plasma), has been measured to be 275 +/- 36 ng/mL, where tmax, {{the amount of time}} that the drug is present at the max amount in the blood, was 3.0 +/-0.5 hours. AUC∞, (the area under the curve extrapolated to infinity) which can be used to estimate bioavailability, was 4437 +/- 948 (ng.h/mL). The half-life elimination varies from 3.4-60 hours, depending on age. [...] However, the mean terminal half-life elimination for young volunteer subjects administered 75 mg <b>cinnarizine,</b> was found to be 23.6 +/- 3.2 hours.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinnarizine</b> is {{predominantly}} {{used to treat}} nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, vertigo, Ménière's disease, or Cogan's syndrome. [...] In fact, {{it is one of}} only a select few drugs that has shown a beneficial effect in the chronic treatment of the vertigo and tinnitus, associated with Meniere's disease. However, due to increased levels of drowsiness caused by the medication, it is generally of limited use in pilots and aircrew who must be dependably alert. [...] In a clinical study (n=181), treatment with <b>cinnarizine</b> reduced the occurrence of moderate vertigo experience by 65.8% and extreme vertigo by 89.8%. It acts by interfering with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus by limiting the activity of the vestibular hair cells which send signals about movement. The disparity of signal processing between inner ear motion receptors and the visual senses is abolished, so that the confusion of brain whether the individual is moving or standing is reduced. Vomiting in motion sickness could be a physiological compensatory mechanism of the brain to keep the individual from moving so that it can adjust to the signal perception, but the true evolutionary reason for this malady is currently unknown.|$|E
50|$|A {{drug that}} is UA {{can be sold}} OTC but only by pharmacists. The drug {{can be on the}} shelves like any other product.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} <b>cinnarizine,</b> a drug {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of vertigo was assessed in animal models of visceral nociception, inflammation and gastric mucosal injury. <b>Cinnarizine</b> (1. 25 – 20 mg/kg, s. c.) caused dose-dependent inhibition of the abdominal constrictions evoked by i. p. injection of acetic acid by 38. 7 – 99. 4 %. This effect of <b>cinnarizine</b> (2. 5 mg/kg) was unaffected by co-administration of the centrally acting dopamine D 2 receptor antagonists, sulpiride, haloperidol or metoclopramide, the peripherally acting D 2 receptor antagonist domperidone, but increased by the D 2 receptor agonist bromocryptine and by the non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist chlorpromazine. The antinociception caused by <b>cinnarizine</b> was naloxone insenstive, but enhanced by propranolol, atropine and by yohimbine. The antinociceptive effect of <b>cinnarizine</b> was prevented by co-treatment with the adenosine receptor blocker theophylline or by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K ATP) blocker glibenclamide. <b>Cinnarizine</b> at 2. 5 mg/kg reversed the baclofen-induced antinociception. <b>Cinnarizine</b> at 2. 5 mg/kg reduced immobility time in the Porsolt’s forced-swimming test by 24 %. <b>Cinnarizine</b> inhibited the paw oedema response to carrageenan and reduced gastric mucosal lesions caused by indomethacin in rats. It is suggested that <b>cinnarizine</b> exerts anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and gastric protective properties. The mechanism by which <b>cinnarizine</b> modulates pain transmission is likely to involve adenosine receptors and K ATP channels...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple, {{rapid and}} precise reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{has been developed}} for simultaneous estimation of <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate in Tablet Dosage Form. Chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex Partisil ODS C 18 (250 X 4. 6 mm) 5 m column using Acetonitrile: Water (90 : 10) as a mobile phase. The detection of the synthetic mixture was carried out at 265 nm with a flow rate of 0. 7 ml/min. The retention times were 4. 3 and 5. 8 minutes for <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate, respectively. Proposed method was validated as per ICH guidelines for linearity, accuracy, precision; specificity and robustness for estimation of <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate in Tablet Dosage Form and results {{were found to be}} satisfactory. The linearity of the method was excellent over a concentration range 20 - 100 μg/ml for <b>Cinnarizine</b> and 40 - 200 μg/ml for Dimenhydrinate. The correlation coefficient was 0. 996 and 0. 992 for <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate, respectively. The limit of detection was 1. 62 μg/mL and 2. 62 μg/mL for <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate, respectively. The limit of quantitation was 4. 93 μg/mL and 7. 95 μg/ml for <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate, respectively. The relative standard deviation values for repeatability, intraday precision and interday precision studies were less than 2 % and % recovery was 98 % to 102 % for both drugs. So the proposed method was found to be suitable for the routine estimation of <b>Cinnarizine</b> and Dimenhydrinate in Tablet Dosage Form...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Investigations into antimotion {{sickness}} drugs {{fall into}} two main categories: efficacy (’benefits’) and side-effects (’costs’). This study was of the second type. Oral <b>cinnarizine</b> (30 mg: normal dose; and 75 mg: 2. 5 x normal dose) and placebo, were investigated using a battery of automated mental, motor, physiological and other tests in twelve young healthy male volunteers. The higher <b>cinnarizine</b> dose level was chosen to exaggerate effects and {{make it easier to}} track them. Oral hyoscine (1. 2 mg: 2 x normal dose) was employed as a positive internal control. Side-effects were almost exclusively due to hyoscine whereas <b>cinnarizine</b> was almost free of significant effects even at the higher dose of 75 mg. Hyoscine impaired performance 1 - 3 hours postdrug, whereas the effects of <b>cinnarizine</b> occurred approximately 5 - 7 hours postdrug. This paralleled the slower time-course for the protective action of <b>cinnarizine</b> against motion sickness noted in earlier studies. These results, taken in conjunction with previous trials, suggest that oral <b>cinnarizine</b> would seem less likely than hyoscine to produce unwanted decrements in performance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Calcium-antagonists (CA) are {{heterogeneous}} {{group of}} drugs with different efficacy in migraine prophylaxis. Several studies have firmly demonstrated flunarizine (FLU), and verapamil as the proven calcium-antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. <b>Cinnarizine</b> (CIN), is another CA with less complications and less antihistaminic action. There is very few studies {{to show the}} effect of this drug on migraine. The current study evaluates the efficacy and safety of <b>cinnarizine</b> on migraine in comparison to sodium valproate, an acceptable drug in migraine prophylaxis. Methods: The current study is a randomized double blind clinical trial on 133 participants with intractable migraine headache to evaluate the positive effect of <b>cinnarizine</b> in comparison to sodium valproate. The data was collected and analized by SPSS software. Results: The mean age of cases was 34. 3 ± 10 years in <b>Cinnarizine</b> group and 33. 4 ± 11 in Sodium Valproate users. The headache frequency decreased to about 50 % and its severity to about 30 % in both groups. Although the effect of <b>Cinnarizine</b> was started earlier than sodium valproate, {{there was no significant difference}} between two groups of cases in improvement of headache attacks. Statistically significant difference was noted in drug’s complication led to discontinuation of treatment, 5. 2 % in <b>Cinnarizine</b> users in respect to 14 % in valproate group. Conclusion: The patients who received <b>Cinnarizine,</b> similar to the patients on sodium valprote showed significant improvement in headache attacks, frequency, duration and severity. <b>Cinnarizine</b> such as sodium valproate is an effective drug in migraine prophylaxis even in intractable headache, but with lesser severe complication...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{present study was}} to formulate directly compressible orodispersible tablets of <b>Cinnarizine</b> with improved solubility and bioavailability by using solid dispersion technique. <b>Cinnarizine</b> is a H 1 receptor antagonist and widely used in the treatment of motion sickness, vomiting and vertigo disorder. Solid dispersion of <b>Cinnarizine</b> was prepared by Solvent evaporation method and physical mixture using novel polymer soluplus as carrier. 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 these three different weight ratios of drug and carrier respectively were taken. Saturation solubility of drug was determined in physical mixture and solid dispersion formulation. The prepared solid dispersion formulations were further characterized by drug contents, FTIR spectroscopy, DSC and in-vitro drug release. From that crystalline form of <b>Cinnarizine</b> is converted into amorphous state during formulation of solid dispersion. Solid dispersion by solvent evaporation method in 1 : 3 ratios showed better results than other formulations. Orodispersible tablets of <b>Cinnarizine</b> were compressed using selected solid dispersion 1 : 3 formulation and excipients with kyron T 314 as a superdisintegrant. Orodispersible tablet shows disintegration time 13 seconds and in-vitro drug release 99. 75 %, which is better as compare to marketed conventional tablet 66. 92 % within 15 minutes. Thus formulation of orodispersible tablet of <b>Cinnarizine</b> solid dispersion showed increased solubility and bioavailability with patient complies and convenience.
