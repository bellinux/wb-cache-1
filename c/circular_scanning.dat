To reduce the test data volume and test application time, the problem addressed here is minimizing the number of conflicting bits by optimally reordering test vectors. Each vector represents a city, and the number of conflicting bits between two test vectors is regarded as the distance between them. Thus, the problem corresponds to the travelling salesman problem (TSP), which is NP-complete. The genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme could reduce the test data volume efficiently without any additional hardware cost.|$|R

To reduce the conflicting bits that needed to be updated, the conflicting bit minimization problem can establish the correspondence with the travelling salesman problem, which is NP-complete.

The experimental results show that the average compression ratio is improved about 3.97 % compared with paper [17], improved about 34.28 % compared with paper [16], and improved about 42.51 % compared with paper [14].

This paper begins with a review of the theoretical description of the velocity sensed by a dual mirror scanning Laser Vibrometer incident in an arbitrary direction on a rotating target of flexible cross-section undergoing arbitrary vibration. This comprehensive velocity sensitivity model can be applied to any Laser Vibrometer measurement configuration on any target and is sufficiently versatile to incorporate time dependent beam orientation.

The velocity sensitivity model allows a detailed analysis of the form of the measurement that is obtained in actual scan configurations.
