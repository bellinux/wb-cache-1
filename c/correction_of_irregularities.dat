40|$|AbstractNon-natural {{irregularities}} are {{an inevitable}} part of long-time climate records. They are originated {{during the process}} of measuring and collecting data from weather stations. In order to use those records as an input for environmental projects or climate studies, it is essential to detect and correct the irregularities through the process of homogenisation. The use of geostatistical approaches as homogenisation techniques has already been proven to be successful. The gsimcli homogenisation process is based on a geostatistical simulation method, the direct sequential simulation. This method generates a set of equally probable and independent realisations, and calculates a probability distribution function at the candidate station's location. This probability distribution function is then used in the identification and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Currently, gsimcli is being developed into an open source software package. During the homogenisation process, gsimcli requires the selection of several parameters in the detection and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities.</b> The candidate stations’ order to be homogenised, the value of the probability used in the detection of irregularities, and the statistic value {{to be used in the}} correction of the irregularity or in the replacement of missing data, are examples of parameters to be chosen for the homogenisation with gsimcli. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of those parameters, in order to find the most suitable set of values for the homogenisation of monthly precipitation data. A benchmark data set, comprising climate records from an Austrian precipitation network, will be used in this analysis. Performance metrics are calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the homogenisation process. The set of parameters providing the best values of performance metrics will be defined as the default set of homogenisation parameters for precipitation data...|$|E

The firmament is visualized on a two-dimensional dial, holes are drilled for the larger stars and the dial is illuminated from behind to make the stars visible in the evening. A switch allows the clock to be run forward and backwards in time. The clock is controlled by Sørnes' own invention, an electromagnetic balance wheel escapement. It feeds the system with a constant revolution of one rotation per second and is in this clock powered by two 1.5 V batteries. He experimented with the escapement for many years but eventually resorted to more traditional solutions. The accuracy of the celestial orbits suffered as the calculations were based on regular calendars without full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>irregularities.</b> Around {{at the same time}} he designed and constructed a large reflecting telescope.|$|R
40|$|Corresponding authorEarnings misstatements, restatements and {{corporate}} governance We investigate the corporate governance characteristics of firms that restate previously-reported accounting data. Unlike other studies {{that focus on}} either the misstatement or the restatement only, we examine changes in the governance characteristics of restating firms from the initial misstatement to the restatement. While the other studies {{are concerned with the}} causes of financial misreporting, we endeavor to obtain insights into the changes that lead to the detection and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> such misreporting. We find that prior to the misstatement, misstating firms {{are more likely to have}} CEOs who sit on nominating committees, less independent boards of directors, and less independent audit committees, relative to control firms. Our results indicate that pre-misstatement agency conflicts are not resolved prior to restatements. Boards and audit committees of restating firms continue to be relatively less independent at the time of the restatement. We also find that restating firms are more likely to experience CFO turnover than control firms. Based on the results, we conclude that the restatements, which constitute an admission and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> accounting <b>irregularities,</b> are not attributable to governance improvements in firms...|$|R

40|$|Gender-reassignment therapy, {{especially}} for reshaping of the forehead, {{can be an}} effective treatment to improve self-esteem. Contouring of the cranial vault, especially of the forehead, still is a rarely performed surgical procedure for gender reassignment. In addition to surgical bone remodeling, several materials have been used for remodeling and refinement of the frontal bone. But due to shortcomings of autogenous bone material and the disadvantages of polyethylene or methylmethacrylate, hydroxyapatite cement (HAC) composed of tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate seems to be an alternative. This study aimed to analyze the clinical outcome after frontal bone remodeling with HAC for gender male-to-female reassignment. The 21 patients in the study were treated for gender reassignment of the male frontal bone using HAC. The average age of these patients was 33. 4  years (range, 21 – 42  years). The average volume of HAC used per patient was 3. 83  g. The authors’ clinical series demonstrated a satisfactory result. The surgery was easy to perform, and HAC was easy to apply and shape to suit individual needs. Overall satisfaction was very high. Therefore, HAC is a welcome alternative to the traditional use of autogenous bone graft for <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> cranial vault <b>irregularities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the amount and}} pattern of relapse of maxillary front teeth previously retained with a bonded retainer for two to four years. Which teeth {{are more prone to}} relapse? Is there any difference in behavior between contact point displacement and rotation? What is the magnitude of the relapse in short-term and long-term? Materials and Methods: The study group originally consisted of 45 patients, and 27 patients on recall for the second study. Recordings from study models before treatment (T 1), at debonding (T 2), one year after removal of the retainer (T 3) and seven years postretention (T 4) were present. All patients had been treated with fixed edgewise appliances by the same operator. The <b>irregularity</b> index (sum <b>of</b> contact point displacement [CPD]), and rotations of front teeth in relation to the Raphe line and intercanine distance, were calculated at T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4. Statistical analysis: Paired t-test, Pearson’s product-moment correlation and Pearson’s productmoment correlation coefficient were applied. For all statistical analyses, the statistical significance level was set to 5 %. Results: Before treatment (T 1), the mean irregularity index was 10. 1 (range 3. 0 – 29. 9). The largest displacements were recorded between laterals and centrals followed by the displacement between laterals and canines. The smallest deviations were found between the centrals. After treatment (T 2), the mean irregularity index was 0. 7 (range 0. 0 – 2. 1). There was {{a significant difference in the}} index between T 1 and T 2 (P <. 0001). One year postretention (T 3), the mean irregularity index was 1. 4 (range 0 – 5. 1). There was a significant difference in the index between T 2 and T 3 (P <. 0001). Results from the second study showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the change in mean CPDs for the contacts canines/laterals, laterals/centrals, or centrals/centrals. The mean irregularity 9 index for the 27 patients examined in the second study was 10. 3 (range 3. 7 - 29. 9) at T 1, 0. 9 (range 0. 0 - 2. 1) at T 2, 1. 3 (range 0. 0 - 3. 5) at T 3 and 2. 0 (range 0. 0 - 5. 8) at T 4. No correlations were found between the pretreatment and postretention irregularity T 1 /T 3 and T 1 /T 4. There was a significant association between the irregularity index at T 3 and T 4 (R = 0. 938, P <. 0001). The <b>irregularity</b> index <b>of</b> the maxillary front teeth changed very little or not at all during the first year postretention. Further changes long-term resulted in an <b>irregularity</b> index <b>of</b> mean 2. 0 mm (range 0. 0 – 5. 8). The contact relationship between the laterals and centrals seems to be the most critical. Forty rotated teeth in 21 patients were corrected more than 20 o. Mean relapse during the first year postretention was 6. 7 degrees (range 0. 0 - 14. 7). Mean changes during seven years were 8. 2 degrees (range 0. 0 - 19. 3). Conclusions: Minor or no relapse in short-term follow-up (one year) was noted in the maxillary front after <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> and a two to four year period of bonded retention. Further, small relapses occurred long-term i. e. at mean seven years postretention. No significant relation was found between the amount <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> contact point displacement and magnitude of relapse neither in one nor seven years postretention. There was a strong correlation between irregularity one and seven years postretention. Stable cases one year postretention are stable in the longterm and cases with small changes one year postretention tend to deteriorate with time. Most of the rotational relapse was seen one year postretention with small changes long-term. There was a significant positive correlation between the amount <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> incisor rotation and the magnitude of relapse. Of the over corrected contacts, only 50 percent returned to perfect alignment. Laterals are more prone to relapse. If, after a three year period of retention, a decision is made to use permanent retention of the maxillary front teeth, a retainer bonded to only the incisors seems to be a relevant choice...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to {{determine the influence of}} Representative Volume Element (RVE) size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> polymer foam microstructure on its compressive mechanical properties, including stiffness, plateau stress and onset strain of densification. Periodic two-dimensional RVEs have been generated using a Voronoi-based numerical algorithm and compressed. Importantly, self-contact of the foam’s internal microstructure has been incorporated through the use of shell elements, allowing simulation of the foam well into the densification stage of compression; strains of up to 80 percent are applied. Results suggest that the stiffness of the foam RVE is relatively insensitive to RVE size but tends to soften as the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> increases. Both the shape of the plateau stress and the onset strain of densification are sensitive to both the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity.</b> Increasing the RVE size and decreasing the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to result in a decrease of the gradient of the plateau region, while increasing the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to decrease the onset strain of densification.

40|$|Purpose. State of {{railway track}} {{must meet the}} {{conditions}} of safety, comfort and smooth ride. The presence <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> deteriorates the dynamics of interaction of track and rolling stock, causes speed limiting, creates the possibility of movement safety violation. This brings up the question concerning {{the study of the}} factors leading to the possibility <b>of</b> track <b>irregularities</b> and the process of their development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the processes of emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the area of unequal vertical elasticity of railway track using mathematical modelling. Methodology. Railroad under the trains works as the system of elastic bodies, so the emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> can be represented as the transition from elastic to permanent strain. Irregularity development will affect the dynamics of interaction between track and rolling stock not only at the wheel location directly in the area <b>of</b> <b>irregularity,</b> but also at a certain distance beyond. Therefore, to study the development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> including those along the track, it is necessary to model the process of wheel load movement along the area. The adopted model consists of a wheel set moving on inertia-free beam and resting on individual supports. It is described by Lagrange differential equations. The work introduced the hypothesis that the level of permanent strain is distributed in proportion to the dynamic deflection derivative. Findings. Location <b>of</b> vertical longwise <b>irregularity</b> does not necessarily reproduce the location of the problem area. While in operation the vertical irregularity extends not only in depth but also along the track, herewith the increase in length is accompanied by the displacement of local maxima and the emergence of new ones. This leads to the development of so-called «pits» when approaching unequal-elastic areas. Originality. The work provides further development of tasks for track and rolling stock interaction modelling, in particular aimed to take into account the unequal elasticity areas and their influence on the formation <b>of</b> the track <b>irregularities.</b> The paper proposes new approaches to modelling the transition from elastic to permanent strain that allows predicting the development <b>of</b> track <b>irregularity</b> sizes depending on the area characteristics. Practical value. The results obtained by the author can be used to determine the schedule for track equal elasticity renovation works, as well as to analyse the measures aimed at the prevention <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in areas with variable elasticity of railway track...|$|R
