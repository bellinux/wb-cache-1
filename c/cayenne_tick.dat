50|$|Amblyomma {{species are}} {{widespread}} on domestic animals throughout tropical and subtropical regions. Typical Amblyomma species are: Amblyomma americanum, {{the lone star}} tick of southern and eastern USA; Am. cajennense, the <b>Cayenne</b> <b>tick</b> of South America and southern USA; Am. variegatum, the bont tick of Africa and the Caribbean. A typical Rhipicephalus species is Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the tropical dog tick, specialized to feed only on dogs. It is distributed globally throughout the warm countries, wherever humans with their dogs live. Typical Rhipicephalus species that feed on cattle in Africa are R. appendiculatus, the brown ear-tick, and R. evertsi evertsi, the red-legged tick. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus {{is the most important}} tick of cattle in many tropical and subtropical countries to where it spread from Southeast Asia on transported cattle.|$|E
40|$|Serum {{specimens}} {{from patients}} at 4 sites in Peru were tested {{for evidence of}} spotted fever group rickettsial infection. Results showed that 30 (18 %) of 170 patients had spotted fever group rickettsial infections, which likely caused their illnesses. These findings document laboratoryconfirmed spotted fever from diverse areas of Peru. Rickettsial spotted fever was first described in South America in 1931 in Sao Paulo, Brazil (1). The etiologic agent, Rickettsia rickettsii, and the tick vector, Amblyomma cajenennse (the <b>Cayenne</b> <b>tick),</b> were subsequently identified.

Immunohistochemical staining of tissues confirmed spotted fever group rickettsial infection {{in a patient}} with fatal disease, and testing of serum of a patient convalescing from the illness by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) demonstrated antibodies reactive with spotted fever group rickettsiae. A serosurvey was conducted among 16 households in proximity to the index case. Of 105 healthy subjects evaluated by IFA, 19 (18 %) demonstrated antibodies reactive with rickettsiae or ehrlichiae: 4 had antibodies reactive with Rickettsia rickettsii, 15 with Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 1 with R. typhi. Amblyomma cajen-nense, a known vector of R. rickettsii in South America, was collected from pets and horses in the area. These results {{are the first to}} document rickettsial spotted fever and ehrlichial infections in Argentina. Rickettsial spotted fever in South America was initially described in 1931 in SaÌƒo Paulo, Brazil. 1 The etiologic agent, Rickettsia rickettsii, and the tick vector, Amblyomma cajen-nense (the <b>Cayenne</b> <b>tick),</b> were subsequently identified. Se-rologic evidence of R. rickettsii infections has been docu-mented in six other states of Brazil, 2 as well as other coun...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to tick feeding {{has been}} {{previously}} shown to be an acquired, immunologically mediated phenomenon in goats, associated with cutaneous basophilia to nymphs of Amblyomma cajennense, the <b>Cayenne</b> <b>tick,</b> after repeated infestations. On the other hand, {{it is well known}} that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play an important role in the host immune reaction to tick infestations. The most able APCs for Th cells are the well defined dendritic cells, mononuclear phagocytes and B-lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of draining lymph nodes of goats repeatedly infested with nymphs of the ixodid tick A. cajennense to search for APCs was done. Pre-scapular lymph nodes draining the tick attachment sites were collected 15 days after both the first and third infestations. Tick infestations resulted in increased number of CD 21 (+) B lymphocytes in lymph nodes after the tertiary infestation. However, the number of CD 11 b(+) and CD 11 c(+) cells were not altered after the successive infestations. Lower numbers of CD 11 c(+) cells had infiltrated lymph nodes responsible for draining the tick infested skin. These findings suggest that acquired immunity of goats against nymphs of A. cajennense is possibly established by B lymphocytes during the first infestation and that APCs may play a key role in this mechanism.
