40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} of the paradigmatic Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model of identical coupled phase oscilla- tors with various kinds of time-dependent connectivity using Eulerian discretization. We first explore the parameter spaces for various types of collective states using the phase plots of the two statistical quantities, namely the strength of incoherence and the discontinity measure. In the quasi-static limit of the changing of <b>coupling</b> <b>range,</b> we have observed how the system relaxes from one state to another and have identified a few interesting collective dynamical states along the way. Under a sinusoidal change of the <b>coupling</b> <b>range,</b> the global order parameter characterizing the degree of synchronization in the system is shown to undergo a hysteresis with the <b>coupling</b> <b>range.</b> Finally, we study the low-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics of the local order parameter in the continuum limit using the recently-developed Ott-Antonsen ansatz and justify some of our numerical results. In particular, we identify an intrinsic time-scale of the Kuramoto system and show that the simulations exhibit two distinct kinds of qualitative behavior in two cases when the time-scale associated with the switching of the coupling radius is very large compared to the intrinsic time-scale and when it is comparable with the intrinsic time-scale.

40|$|A debated {{issue in}} the physics of the BCS-BEC {{crossover}} with trapped Fermi atoms is to identify characteristic properties of the superfluid phase. Recently, a condensate fraction was measured on the BCS side of the crossover by sweeping the system in a fast (nonadiabatic) way from the BCS to the BEC sides, thus ``projecting'' the initial many-body state onto a molecular condensate. We analyze here the theoretical implications of these projection experiments, by identifying the appropriate quantum-mechanical operator associated with the measured quantities and relating them to the many-body correlations occurring in the BCS-BEC crossover. Calculations are presented over wide temperature and <b>coupling</b> <b>ranges,</b> by including pairing fluctuations on top of mean field. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

This behaviour is investigated through a linear stability analysis of the spatially homogeneous steady states and numerical investigations of the full nonlinear equations in dependence upon the nonlocal coupling strength and the ratio of the excitatory and inhibitory <b>coupling</b> <b>ranges.</b> Comment: Accepted in EP...|$|R
40|$|Plasmonic systems {{based on}} metal {{nanoparticles}} {{on a metal}} film have generated great interest for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) chemical sensors. In this study, we describe the fabrication of ultrasensitive SERS substrates based on high-density gold nanostar assemblies on silver films with tailored surface plasmons, where multiple field enhancements from particle-film and interparticle plasmon couplings and lightening rod effects of sharp tips of nanostars contribute to the enormous Raman enhancements. We show that the interplay between interparticle and particle-film plasmon couplings of high-density gold nanostars (GNSs) on metal and dielectric films {{as a function of}} interparticle separation can be tailored to provide maximum SERS effects. We observe that the SERS enhancement factor (EF) of GNSs on a metal film as a function of interparticle separation follows a broken power law function, where the EF increases with the interparticle separation for the strong interparticle <b>coupling</b> <b>range</b> below an interparticle separation of ∼ 0. 8 times the GNS size, but decreases for the weak interparticle <b>coupling</b> <b>range</b> (for an interparticle separation of > 0. 8 times the GNS size).

40|$|A multi-grid {{formulation}} of Green’s {{functions in the}} spatial domain {{based on the idea}} of partitioning overall electromagnetic simulation domain into macro-pixels is proposed. The concept of macro-pixel is introduced, based on physical considerations, as extension of the notion of pixel with possible spatial variations within its sub-domain, to capture both lower and higher order variations. Interactions between macro-pixels are derived to evaluate higher order and lower order modal couplings as function of normalized separation distances. The interactions between macro-pixels are efficiently computed using an original NUFFT (Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform) which renders possible systematic use of multi-grid space stepping.
