The separate condenser, located external to the cylinder, <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> without cooling the piston and cylinder walls as did the internal spray in Newcomen's engine.

25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply. The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|E

25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power station, the {{pressurized}} steam is fed through a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator connected to the electric grid for transmission. After passing through the turbine the secondary coolant (water-steam mixture) is cooled down and condensed in a condenser. The condenser converts the steam to a liquid {{so that it can}} be pumped back into the steam generator, and maintains a vacuum at the turbine outlet so that the pressure drop across the turbine, and hence the energy extracted from the steam, is maximized. Before being fed into the steam generator, the <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> (referred to as feedwater) is sometimes preheated in order to minimize thermal shock.|$|E

The condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder. The volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam, and was determined as seven times the volume of [...] the <b>condensed</b> <b>steam.</b> The condensate and the injected water was then removed by the air pump, and the surrounding cold water served to absorb the remaining thermal energy to retain a condenser temperature of 30°C to 45°C and the equivalent pressure of 0.04 to 0.1 bar ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{water used}} is fresh water added {{separately}} to the vessel. It is not <b>condensed</b> <b>steam,</b> {{nor does the}} steam mix with it. Boiler steam is contaminated with lubricants, sometimes with chemicals for feedwater treatment, and is definitely not potable.|$|E
50|$|Type EW2 tenders were rebuilt from Type CZ tenders {{which had}} entered service between 1953 and 1955 as <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> tenders to the Class 25 4-8-4 Northern type <b>condensing</b> <b>steam</b> locomotives.

50|$|Most of {{the heat}} energy in the <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> is {{returned}} to the boiler, increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. Injectors are therefore typically over 98% energy-efficient overall; they are also simple compared to the many moving parts in a feed pump.|$|E
50|$|Carbonate and {{bicarbonate}} alkalinities are decomposed by heat in {{boiler water}} releasing carbon dioxide into the steam. This gas combines with the <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> in process equipment and return lines to form carbonic acid.

50|$|The water {{resulting}} from this condensation of steam was suctioned by the extraction pumps and sent {{once again to}} the boilers’ steam drums, passing first through the water heaters, feed tanks and pumps, and finally to the economiser.

50|$|Many large boilers {{including}} {{those used in}} thermal power stations recycle <b>condensed</b> <b>steam</b> for re-use within the boiler. Steam condensate is distilled water, but it may contain dissolved gases.
