5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt.</b> Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
25|$|Ammunition allotments {{provided}} 100 carbine rounds per trooper, {{carried on}} a <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> and in saddlebags on their mounts. An additional 50 carbine rounds per man were reserved on the pack train that accompanied the regiment to the battlefield. Each trooper had 24 rounds for his Colt handgun.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} do not call those {{concealed}} weapons," [...] was Major Morris's comment, as Ben came over to him with the knives and the <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts.</b> The rascals' guns stood back of the door behind {{the commander of the}} first battalion.|$|R
5000|$|Between 40 and 60 <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts,</b> each of 250 rounds (a {{total of}} [...] ), were carried; {{as well as}} 180 shells for the main gun, split 90:54:36 between canister, antitank, and explosive. These were the {{official}} figures — up to 300 rounds for the main gun were stowed for combat.|$|R
25|$|When Geronimo surrendered, {{he had in}} his {{possession}} a Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle with a silver-washed barrel and receiver, bearing Serial Number 109450. It is on display at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. Additionally, he had a Colt Single Action Army revolver with a nickel finish and ivory stocks bearing the serial number 89524, and a Sheffield Bowie knife with a dagger type blade and a stag handle made by George Wostenholm in an elaborate silver-studded holster and <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt.</b> The revolver, rig, and knife are on display at the Fort Sill museum.|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Falling Soldier {{appears to}} capture a Republican soldier {{at the very moment}} of death.

50|$|Two buses {{of special}} forces {{had arrived at}} the scene. According to Ehsan Zahidov, a {{spokesman}} for Interior Ministry, the special troops conducted an operation while people reportedly having been held hostage were released. Three <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> with capacity of forty and seventy one bullets along with two magazines were taken from Gadirov's body.|$|R
50|$|It was fed from a {{disintegrating}} metal belt using Stoner's proprietary S-63 BRW links. The S-63 BRW was a scaled-down 5.56mm NATO {{version of}} the M-60's M13 metal links for the 7.62mm NATO <b>cartridge.</b> <b>Belted</b> ammo was contained in a 150-round Stoner green or black plastic drum that mounted on the left-hand side of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|Arizmundi {{was both}} revered for her philanthropy and disliked for her leadership, {{at a time}} when women were {{expected}} to be docile and submissive. There were attacks to her leadership of the White Cross, such as when she had a photograph taken as a joke with the revolutionary crossed <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> of male soldiers and soldaderas and was accused of violating the neutrality of the health organization.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{advantage}} to the 6mm cartridge was in the reduced weight of the ammunition: 220 6mm cartridges weighed approximately the same as 160 cartridges in [...]30 Army caliber. [...] The basic combat ammunition load of an 1898 naval bluejacket or marine was 180 rounds of 6mm ammunition packed five-round chargers (clips), and carried in black leather ammunition pouches. [...] Outfitted in this manner, a navy bluejacket or marine could carry considerably more ammunition {{than that of the}} typical Army trooper of the day, who usually carried 100 rounds of [...]30 Army ammunition in individual cartridge loops on his Mills canvas <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Cowboys fired {{a number}} of shots at the Earp party, but the only {{casualty}} was Vermillion's horse, which was killed. Wyatt's long coat was punctured by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. Firing his pistol, Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. [...] Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> had slipped down around his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMaster was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses.|$|E
2500|$|Buddecke scored his {{and the new}} unit's {{first victory}} on 19 September 1915; a B.E.2c of No 8 Squadron RFC, crewed by pilot Lt WH Nixon and {{observer}} Capt JNS Stott. Opening fire from 200 meters he disabled the observer's machine gun, although Captain Stott then returned fire with a pocket pistol. It was shot {{out of his hands}} at a range of ten meters and Nixon was hit. Buddecke's gun then jammed when its <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> tore in the slipstream. As Buddecke struggled with the jammed gun, Stott clambered atop the shoulders of his dying pilot, set his heels on the pilot's knees to operate the rudder and bent forward to grab the controls. Buddecke cleared his gun and aimed at the British observer's yellow leather coat. The BE.2c crash landed near Saint Quentin. Buddecke drove to the wreck after landing, where the uninjured captive Stott showed him the bullet holes in his coat. Buddecke followed this up with confirmed claims on 23 October (a B.E.2 of No. 13 Squadron RFC, with Capt CH Marks ...|$|E
60|$|Old Von der Tann, {{the light}} of a new hope firing his eyes, threw aside his cloak and leaped to the chancel steps beside Butzow and the others who were {{mounting}} them. Behind him a hundred cloaks dropped from the shoulders of his fighting men, exposing not silks and satins and fine velvet, but the coarse tan of khaki, and grim <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> well filled, and stern revolvers slung to well-worn service belts.|$|R
2500|$|The [...]300 RUM {{features}} a rebated rim {{much like the}} [...]300 Canadian Magnum so as to allow the cartridge to function in the Remington M700 action without having to increase the bolt and bolt face diameter of the action. Unlike the belted Magnum cases based on the [...]375 H Magnum cartridge, the [...]300 RUM {{does not have a}} belt. All things being equal, a beltless cartridge would feed more reliably and more smoothly than a <b>belted</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Furthermore, as this is a beltless cartridge headspacing is designed to take place on the shoulder, which is considered beneficial by some as it is thought to promote accuracy and prolong case life of the <b>cartridge.</b> As modern <b>belted</b> magnums such as 7mm Remington Magnum and [...]300 Winchester Magnum actually headspace on the shoulder despite retaining the belt found on their parent <b>cartridge,</b> <b>belted</b> or unbelted is basically irrelevant in discussions of modern cartridges, and particularly so in discussions of unbelted cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Between Schleswig Limits" [...] {{museum in}} Bylderup-Bov was {{approached}} by Nordisk Film {{in the autumn of}} 2013 with regards to assisting with uniforms and weapons. In March 2014 the film company collected 120 Danish steel helmets, 100 gas-mask canisters, 50 pairs of wool pants, 24 dummy-rifles, 32 <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts,</b> and a khaki officer coat. Moreover, the museum loaned two old Nimbus motorcycles with side-cars. All equipment was initially transported to Budapest in Hungary, where part of the movie was shot.|$|R
2500|$|In 1876, Jack {{spent the}} first six months of the nation's centennial year {{canvassing}} the gold camps as a correspondent for the Omaha Daily Bee. [...] After George Armstrong Custer's death on the Little Bighorn, Crawford joined Brig. Gen. George Crook's command as a civilian scout with the Fifth Cavalry on July 22, 1876. On July 24, 1876, Jack boarded a train for Cheyenne en route to Ft. Laramie and friends presented him with appropriate gifts: a new Winchester repeating rifle, <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt,</b> holster, hunting knife and sheath and a buckskin suit. [...] "The management of the Omaha Daily Bee contributed ‘liberally to his outfit’ and paid tribute to its intrepid correspondent with these words: [...] Captain Jack is a right good fellow, and we hope to see him distinguish himself alongside of his old friend Buffalo Bill. [...] Jack has done some good in advancing the interests of the Black Hills, and it was on this account that his Omaha friends took occasion to give him a handsome testimonial of their appreciation of his labors." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> got {{tight and}} Jimmy, using its support, reached the trunk. His jacket felt slack, as if {{something}} were gone, {{but this was not}} important and he heard Deering's labored breath.|$|E

5000|$|On February 23, 1991 Tetkowski did a performance, titled “Ground War” {{with a video}} {{documented}} head-shaving. Having smeared {{himself with}} a blood-like substance, he worked at an oversized potter's wheel surrounded by performing jazz musicians. A 3-foot [...] "disk" [...] was ceremoniously thrown, lowered to the floor. Marks and impressions were made by individual bullets, <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> and full rifle clips being dragged across/ impressed in the clay. The work was later cast in bronze and is on public display in Hiroshima, Japan.|$|R
50|$|According to {{testimony}} {{after the}} shootout, the outlaw Cowboys who fought the Earps and Doc Holliday went from Dexter's Livery Stable, {{where they had}} left their horses, to Spangenberg's gun shop on Fourth Street. Wyatt Earp saw them inside and later said {{he thought they were}} filling their <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> with bullets. The Cowboys then walked over to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. Citizens reported the threats and the armed Cowboys' movements to Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, the Reed {{family also}} moved to Scyene and May Shirley married Jim Reed in 1866, after having had an earlier crush {{on him as}} a teen. Two years later, {{she gave birth to}} her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which would feed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride sidesaddle while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and a plumed hat, {{carrying}} two pistols, with <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> across her hips. Jim turned to crime and was wanted for murder in Arkansas, which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.|$|R
60|$|Alvina {{adjusted}} the maidenly Mr. May. Louis arose, a brave like Ciccio, in war-paint even more hideous. Max slipped on a tattered hunting-shirt and <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt.</b> His {{face was a}} little darkened. He was the white prisoner.|$|E
60|$|He turned, for Juan the mate, {{who wore}} spectacles, {{and the captain}} came on deck. Don Erminio carried an old pinfire gun, hung round his {{shoulders}} by a strap; he wore a big <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> and black leggings, and looked like a brigand.|$|E

6000|$|Will Morrison was doubtless {{a mighty}} hunter {{and an expert}} fisherman, for the [...] "den" [...] {{at the rear of}} the Lodge was a regular museum of trophies of the chase. Stag and doe heads, {{enormous}} trout mounted on boards, antlers of wild mountain sheep, rods, guns, revolvers and hunting-knives fairly lined the wails, while a cabinet contained reels, books of flies, <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts,</b> creels and many similar articles.

50|$|The {{traditional}} Laz men's costume {{consists of}} a peculiar bandanalike kerchief covering the entire head above the eyes, knotted {{on the side and}} hanging down to the shoulder and the upper back; a snug-fitting jacket of coarse brown homespun with loose sleeves; and baggy dark brown woolen trousers tucked into slim, knee-high leather boots. The women's costume was similar to the wide-skirted princess gown found throughout Georgia but worn with a similar kerchief to that of the men and with a rich scarf tied around the hips. Laz men crafted excellent homemade rifles and even while at the plow were usually seen bristling with arms: rifle, pistol, powder horn, <b>cartridge</b> <b>belts</b> across the chest, a dagger at the hip, and a coil of rope for trussing captives.|$|R

60|$|And then {{a sudden}} {{resolution}} possessed him. He threw the blankets {{from him and}} rose to his feet. Pulling on his boots and buckling his <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> and revolver about his hips he stepped to the flap of his tent and looked out. There was no sentry before {{the entrance to the}} prisoner's tent! What could it mean? Fate was indeed playing into his hands.|$|E
60|$|Byrne, {{apparently}} unmoved by {{the seriousness}} of Theriere's condition, removed the man's <b>cartridge</b> <b>belt</b> and buckled it about his own waist, replacing the six empty shells in the revolver with six fresh ones. Presently he noticed the bound and gagged Oda Iseka lying in the brush behind them where he and Theriere had left him. The samurai were now sneaking cautiously toward their refuge. A sudden inspiration came to the mucker.|$|E

The rangers and Thorne selected a deep depression, out of which led several ruts deep enough for cover.
