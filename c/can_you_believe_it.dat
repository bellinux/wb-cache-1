40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the Transdisciplinary Journal of EmergenceIn Kate Woods’ Looking for Alibrandi (2000), Serafina (Leanne Carlow), is telling the heroine, Josie (Pia Miranda) and Anna (Diane Viduka) about her new boyfriend – dark roots emerging from her bottle-blonde hair:His name’s Massimo and his family’s from the north of Italy and his mum’s like, ‘you know, that’s why we have blonde hair’. I mean, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> ? So I said, ‘Excuse me, Signora, I mean, look at my hair and my parents are from Calabria. This is a joke, and partly a self deception, but on one level this anecdote communicates the way the Looking for Alibrandi represents ethnicity {{and the importance of}} self- definition to its notion of ethnicity. Like categories of gender and sexuality in postmodern multicultural society, ethnicity and ethnic identity are exposed in Looking for Alibrandi as, in part, cultural constructions which shun fixed and established ethnic categories. My concern here is the way notions of cultural heritage and self-definition compete in Looking for Alibrandi and how the film problematises traditional representations of Italian-Australian ethnicity in Australian cinema. Considering Looking for Alibrandi as the most recent, and perhaps the most widely known film of Italian-Australian cinema, I want to demonstrate how Looking for Alibrandi engages with some key themes common to Italian-Australian cinema since the 1950 s. Drawing upon Julia Kristeva’s writings on cultural alienation and estrangement in Strangers to Ourselves as well as the work of sociologists Maria Palotta-Chiarolli and Zlatko Skribis, I consider the way Looking for Alibrandi responds to established tropes of class, sexuality and film genre as set out in two films about second generation Italian-Australian experience, Moving Out (1983) and Fistful of Flies (1997), and in Italian-Australian cinema generally.

During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly."
