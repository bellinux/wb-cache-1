5|$|Metformin {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} to counteract the weight gain caused by antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and <b>clozapine.</b> Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics <b>clozapine</b> may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially <b>clozapine,</b> olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|When {{carbamazepine}} is concurrently {{used with}} <b>clozapine,</b> {{it has been}} shown to decrease plasma levels of <b>clozapine</b> significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of <b>clozapine.</b> Patients should be monitored for “decreased therapeutic effects of <b>clozapine</b> if carbamazepine” is started or increased. If carbamazepine is discontinued or the dose of carbamazepine is decreased, therapeutic effects of <b>clozapine</b> should be monitored. The study recommends carbamazepine to not be used concurrently with <b>clozapine</b> due to increased risk of agranulocytosis.|$|E
25|$|Ciprofloxacin is an {{inhibitor}} of CYP1A2 and <b>clozapine</b> {{is a major}} CYP1A2 substrate. Randomized {{study reported}} elevation in <b>clozapine</b> concentration in schizophrenia subjects concurrently taking ciprofloxacin. Thus, the prescribing information for <b>clozapine</b> recommends “reducing the dose of <b>clozapine</b> by one-third of original dose” when ciprofloxacin and other CYP1A2 inhibitors are added to therapy, but once ciprofloxacin is removed from therapy, it is recommended to return <b>clozapine</b> to original dose.|$|E
25|$|Fluvoxamine {{inhibits}} the metabolism of <b>clozapine</b> {{leading to}} significantly increased {{blood levels of}} <b>clozapine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. <b>Clozapine</b> (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an adverse event monitoring system, <b>clozapine</b> re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are <b>clozapine,</b> risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that <b>clozapine</b> is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. <b>Clozapine</b> can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of <b>clozapine</b> for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites {{suitable for}} elimination {{in the urine}} and feces. The major metabolite, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for <b>clozapine</b> metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well. Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of <b>clozapine.</b> For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of <b>clozapine</b> compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of <b>clozapine</b> is almost complete, but the oral bioavailability is only 60 to 70% due to first-pass metabolism. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food {{does not appear}} to affect the bioavailability of <b>clozapine.</b>|$|E
25|$|While <b>clozapine</b> is a muscarinic {{antagonist}} at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, <b>clozapine</b> is a {{full agonist}} at the M4 subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the salivary gland, its M4 agonist activity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the hypersalivation.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenia: {{antipsychotics}} such as haloperidol, <b>clozapine,</b> olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>clozapine,</b> however, is, at least, {{in the short}} term, not {{reflected}} in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The relapse rate is lower and patient acceptability is better. There is some evidence <b>clozapine</b> may reduce propensity for substance abuse in schizophrenic patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> and norclozapine plasma {{levels may}} also be monitored, though they show a {{significant}} degree of variation and are higher in women and increase with age. Monitoring of plasma levels of <b>clozapine</b> and norclozapine {{has been shown to}} be useful in assessment of compliance, metabolic status, prevention of toxicity, and in dose optimization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> induces {{the release}} of {{glutamate}} and D-serine, an agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, from astrocytes, and reduces the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters. These are direct effects that are also present in astrocyte cell cultures not containing neurons. <b>Clozapine</b> prevents impaired NMDA receptor expression caused by NMDA receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with <b>clozapine.</b> Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity {{have been shown}} to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that <b>clozapine</b> may be more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. A study has established that olanzapine and <b>clozapine</b> disturb the metabolism by making the body take preferentially its energy from fat (instead of privileging carbohydrates). Levels of carbohydrates remaining high, the body develops insulin resistance (causing diabetes).|$|E
25|$|Abrupt {{withdrawal}} {{may lead}} to cholinergic rebound effects, severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers {{are aware of the}} symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of <b>clozapine.</b> When discontinuing <b>clozapine,</b> gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> {{is linked}} to urinary incontinence, though its {{appearance}} may be under-recognized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> was {{synthesized}} in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, {{based on}} the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 {{as well as a}} trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when <b>clozapine</b> was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, after reports of agranulocytosis leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, <b>clozapine</b> was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer. <b>Clozapine</b> fell out of favor {{for more than a decade}} despite unclear reasons for the agranulocytosis which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that <b>clozapine</b> was more effective against treatment-resistant schizophrenia than other antipsychotics, the FDA and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular hematological monitoring to detect granulocytopenia, before agranulocytosis develops. In December 2002, <b>clozapine</b> was approved in the US for reducing the risk of suicide in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005 FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} behavior problems in older adults with dementia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> {{may cause}} side effects. Some are serious and {{potentially}} fatal. Common side effects include constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. The {{risk of developing}} extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; {{this may be due}} to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to <b>clozapine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} half-life of <b>clozapine</b> {{is about}} 14 hours at steady state conditions (varying with daily dose).|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is {{classified}} as an atypical antipsychotic drug because it binds to serotonin as well as dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is {{sold under}} many brands {{worldwide}} including Alemoxan, Azaleptine, Azaleptol, Cloment, Clonex, Clopin, Clopine, Clopsine, Cloril, Clorilex, Clozamed, Clozapex, Clozapin, Clozapina, <b>Clozapine,</b> Clozapinum, Clozapyl, Clozarem, Clozaril, Denzapine, Dicomex, Elcrit, Excloza, FazaClo, Froidir, Ihope, Klozapol, Lanolept, Lapenax, Leponex, Lodux, Lozapine, Lozatric, Luften, Medazepine, Mezapin, Nemea, Nirva, Ozadep, Ozapim, Refract, Refraxol, Schizonex, Sensipin, Sequax, Sicozapina, Sizoril, Syclop, Syzopin, Tanyl, Uspen, Versacloz, Xenopal, Zaclo, Zapenia, Zapine, Zaponex, Zaporil, Ziproc, and Zopin.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>clozapine</b> (Clozaril) represents {{a breakthrough in}} the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other atypical antipsychotics useful in treatment include quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and paliperidone (Invega). <b>Clozapine</b> is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of extrapyramidal side effect.|$|E
25|$|Myocarditis is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} <b>clozapine,</b> which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after <b>clozapine</b> initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of <b>clozapine</b> dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is an {{antagonist}} at the 5-HT2A subunit of the serotonin receptor, putatively improving depression, anxiety, and {{the negative}} cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the {{individual}} manufacturer Patient Registries were consolidated by FDA request {{into a single}} shared Patient Registry Called The <b>Clozapine</b> REMS Registry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> {{carries a}} black box warning for drug-induced {{agranulocytosis}}. Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% {{of people who}} take <b>clozapine</b> {{during the first few}} months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.|$|E
25|$|Many male {{patients}} have experienced cessation of ejaculation during orgasm {{as a side}} effect of <b>clozapine,</b> though this is not documented in official drug guides.|$|E
25|$|Published {{case reports}} {{have stated that}} the use of benzodiazepines and <b>clozapine</b> {{concomitantly}} can result in severe adverse reaction such as respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest and sudden death.|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed <b>clozapine</b> when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by <b>clozapine</b> and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} {{drugs like}} <b>clozapine,</b> olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and asenapine are relatively potent antagonists of 5-HT2A as {{are some of}} the lower potency old generation/typical antipsychotics. Other antagonists are MDL-100,907 (prototype of another new series of 5-HT2A antagonists) and cyproheptadine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clozapine</b> is a dibenzodiazepine that is {{structurally}} {{related to}} loxapine. It is slightly soluble in water, soluble in acetone, and highly soluble in chloroform. Its {{solubility in water}} is 188.9mg/L (25°C). Its manufacturer, Novartis, claims a solubility of <0.01% in water (<100nbsp&mg/L).|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. <b>Clozapine,</b> olanzapine, or low-potency phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|Risperidone is {{effective}} in treating the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. A 2013 study compared 15 antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia. Risperidone was ranked fourth, 11% more effective than paliperidone (5th), 20-23% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 36% less effective than <b>clozapine</b> (1st).|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, <b>clozapine</b> was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than amisulpride (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
