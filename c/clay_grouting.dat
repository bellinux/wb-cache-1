40|$|It is very {{important}} to note in bearing capacity of soil in development of multi-storey buildings. There are some geotechnical investigation can do to determine the value of bearing capacity of soil. One of them is cone penetration test. The location of three-storey building site SMK Teuku Umar, Karangrejo, Semarang has soils that dominated by clay. Soil located in the research area is quarry with low soil strength. The purpose of this research was determine the type of soil and the bearing capacity of soil in the areas of research, to know grouting method used to increase the strength of soil, to determine the bearing capacity of soil before and after grouting, and to know increasing the bearing capacity of soil from the work of grouting. The method used in this research is conducting geotechnical investigations in the form cone penetration test. This cone penetration test calculate the value of conus resistance on the subsurface with a certain depth, then the results of the testing is done processing data to determine the value of bearing capacity of soil contained in the three-storey building site SMK Teuku Umar, Semarang, Central Java. The type of soil in research location is burial land which is dominated by clay to sandy silt. The value of bearing capacity of soil permits at cone penetration test’s point 1 before grouting > 100 ton/m 2 obtained at a depth of 6, 4 m. After installing grouting, it found at a depth of 3, 6 m. At cone penetration test’s point 2, bearing capacity of soil permits before grouting > 100 ton/m 2 recently recovered at a depth of 6, 6 m. After installing grouting, has been found at a depth of 3, 8 m. At cone penetration test’s point 3, value of bearing capacity of soil permits is increased very high, at depth of 1, 6 m has had bearing capacity of soil permits > 100 ton/m 2. Method of grouting has increased the value of bearing capacity of soil. Keyword : <b>clay,</b> <b>grouting,</b> increasing the value of bearing capacity of soil...|$|E
40|$|Compensation {{grouting}} is {{a multiple}} injection {{process in which}} large numbers of grout injections are carried out in a designated grouting zone. Each injection alters the in-situ stress state {{at the site of}} neighbouring injections, influencing the grout behaviour as well as the deforma-tion of the surrounding soil. In this study, multiple grout injection tests were performed in the laboratory on clay specimens prepared at different overconsolidation ratios ranging from 1 to 10. Two types of grouting mode for compensation grouting were examined: (a) facture grout-ing by injecting epoxy resin, and (b) compaction grouting by expanding a latex balloon placed inside the soil speci-men. The sequence of multiple injections was also varied by injecting either simultaneously or sequentially with different waiting periods. For highly overconsolidated <b>clay</b> the <b>grout</b> efficiency, defined as the ratio of the volume of heave achieved to the injected grout volume, was close to 1 irrespective of grout spacing and injection sequence. For normally consolidated and lightly overcon-solidated <b>clays</b> the <b>grout</b> efficiency increased when the separation in space and time between the injections was reduced. A better grout efficiency was obtained in com-paction grouting than in fracture grouting. The results from finite element analyses of the laboratory tests show that the magnitude and extent of excess pore pressure reduce when many closely spaced simultaneous injections are performed. A few non-simultaneous injections create large stress concentrations around the injection points, leading to larger soil consolidation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soil {{grouting}} {{has become}} a popular method for soil improvement in recent years. Grouting is generally intended to increase a soil’s strength, increase its liquefaction resistance, or reduce its hydraulic conductivity. Soil grouting involves the injection, permeation, or me-chanical mixing of cementitious, silica, or <b>clay</b> <b>grout</b> into a soil deposit. With the increase in popularity of these methods comes the issue of testing grouted soils to verify the expected soil improvement. While some of the methods and materials mentioned result in soils that are sufficiently cemented to produce trimmable specimens that can stand under their own weight, other methods produce softer materials that {{are very difficult to}} sample or even to recreate and test in the lab. Preparing such soft samples in the laboratory poses two challenges: 1) if the specimen is prepared in the triaxial cell directly, the grouting process might not be feasible because of the porous stones and small diameter tubing in the triaxial cell; and 2) if the specimens are prepared outside the triaxial cell, soft specimens {{might not be able to}} stand under their own weight without significant strains and damage to the soil structure. This paper will thoroughly describe a three-way split mold specifically designed to accommodate the per-meation and testing of soils that are too soft or too weak to be easily sampled or tested in the lab. A simple procedure outlining the use of this three-way split mold will also be described. Finally, the results from a series of consolidated undrained, monotonically loaded triaxial tests will be presented as an example of the split mold application. These tests utilized the new three-way split mold for sample preparation of loose Ottawa sand permeated with a thixotropic bentonite suspension...|$|R
40|$|More than 20 years ago, Rostov-based Promstroyniiproekt Institute (Research and Development Institute for Industrial Engineering), {{backed by}} Geotechnika group of {{companies}} and other organizations, commenced using cement grouting to stabilize soil as part of foundation soils of buildings. It has turned out that consolidation of water saturated by <b>clay</b> accelerates <b>grouting</b> and assures higher strength than the silicification method. The article describes a new method of grouting and {{a case study of}} grouting stabilization of the foundation soil of a five-storey residential house, made by subsiding soils and subjacent fluid-plastic clay loams. The work was {{complicated by the fact that}} clay was displaced by the cement-sand mortar injected at the pressure insufficient for formation of discontinuous cavities. In these circumstances, the team of researchers developed and implemented an integrated solution to avoid clay clustering under the influence of the injected grout. The authors consider problems arising in the course of operation of buildings in the above geotechnical environment and describe the sequence of grouting operations. The article includes the work performance pattern and patterns of building control.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a groundwater modeling study of waste disposal concepts using grouted waste forms. The {{focus of the}} study is on the effects of clay caps and concrete vaults on contaminant migration. The authors modeled three waste disposal scenarios: (1) Grouted waste was solidified in an earthen trench and covered with soil, there was no vault and no cap; (2) grouted waste was solidified in an earthen trench, the entire waste disposal facility was then closed under a <b>clay</b> cap; (3) <b>grouted</b> waste was solidified in a concrete vault and protected by the same closure as in 2. Because of the huge contrast in hydraulic conductivities and highly non-linear multi-phase flow characteristics, these waste disposal concepts presented a difficult problem for numerical simulation. Advanced fluid flow and contaminant transport codes were used to solve the problem. Among the codes tested, ECLIPSE out-performed other codes in speed, accuracy (smaller material balance errors) and capability in handling sophisticated scenarios. The authors used nitrate as a tracer for the simulation. Nitrate does not absorb in the solid phase and does not decay. As a result, predicted release rate based on nitrate is conservative. They also assumed that the facility is intact for 10, 000 years. In other words, properties of the materials used for this study do not change with time. Predicted peak flux for the no vault and no closure case was 5. 8 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } per year at 12 years. If a clay cap was installed, predicted peak flux was 8. 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 5 } per year at 110 years. If the grout was disposed in a concrete vault and covered by a clay cap, predicted peak flux became 4. 4 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 6 } per year at 8, 000 years. Both concrete liner and clay cap can reduce the rate of contaminant release to the water table and delay the peak time...|$|R
