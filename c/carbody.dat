5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was {{more powerful than the}} P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of the}} <b>carbody.</b> Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the <b>carbody</b> was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|Troop {{hospital}} cars, {{also based}} on the troop sleeper <b>carbody,</b> transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths {{which could be used}} for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice air-conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 <b>Carbodies</b> {{bought the}} FX4 chassis {{assembly}} line from British Leyland's Adderley Park, Birmingham factory {{and moved it}} to Coventry, making them complete manufacturers of the FX4, in actuality if not in name. Two years later, <b>Carbodies</b> was bought, along with parent company BSA by Manganese Bronze Holdings.|$|R
50|$|The classic Austin FX3 black taxicab of 1948 {{was built}} by car body builder <b>Carbodies</b> in {{partnership}} with Mann & Overton and Austin. More than 7,000, mainly destined for London, were produced over 10 years. <b>Carbodies</b> concentrated on producing complete taxis, starting with the Austin FX4 in 1958-59; this is the classic cab still common today. They were taken over by Manganese Bronze in 1973. In 1982 <b>Carbodies</b> took over the intellectual rights to the FX4 from British Leyland (which had by then absorbed Austin). Latterly, developed FX4 models {{became known as the}} LTI Fairway.|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each <b>carbody</b> rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
25|$|The <b>carbody</b> {{design was}} the basis of one-off {{locomotive}} GML10 built by Clyde Engineering in 1990.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbody</b> styles have {{generally}} remained consistent {{since the middle}} of the 20th century. While new car types have not made much of an impact, the existing car types have been further enhanced with new technology.|$|E

25|$|The first {{accident}} involving R62As {{happened in}} the summer of 1985 when 1687's <b>carbody</b> was badly damaged at the Bombardier plant prior to delivery; this car was repaired with a new body shell, and entered service on December 1, 1987, on the 6 train.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the <b>carbody</b> and the front redesigned to suit current crashworthiness standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the main transformer was also changed from ester to water. The <b>carbody</b> design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The bogie frame was strengthened, to allow an increase of axle loads to 22 tons. This generation of the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, various {{possibilities}} {{were explored}} (including one early design for fixed carriages with tilting seats). A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an automotrice (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668 diesel car and provided with tilting seats. The first working prototype using a tilting <b>carbody</b> was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by FIAT in 1969. This {{was the first}} to be christened Pendolino.|$|E
50|$|Manganese Bronze Holdings {{purchased}} Mann & Overton from Lloyds & Scottish in 1984. <b>Carbodies</b> {{had built}} Mann & Overton's Austin taxis since 1948. Manganese Bronze Holdings had absorbed <b>Carbodies</b> Limited with {{portions of the}} former Birmingham Small Arms Company in 1973. Taxis became Manganese Bronze's core business carried out under the name The London Taxi Company.|$|R

50|$|Under BSA, {{manufacturing}} facilities were extended and more plant installed. In 1958, <b>Carbodies</b> began manufacturing {{the body and}} carrying out the assembly, finishing and delivery {{of the most important}} vehicle in their history, the Austin FX4 taxi. <b>Carbodies</b> also supplied prototype bodies and tooling, projects including the Jaguar E-type bonnet and panels for Triumph, Ariel and BSA motorcycles and scooters.|$|R
25|$|After {{rebuilding}} the locomotives did not retain their numbers, {{for example the}} first locomotive converted was CL2 which emerged as CLF1. All were back in service {{by the end of}} 1993. The CLFs appeared in the standard Australian National green with yellow data panel, strip and B-end. The CLPs received a unique livery, with a lighter green nose, silver <b>carbody,</b> and a yellow stripe running from the nose to the rear.|$|E
25|$|The {{first five}} units were fitted with <b>carbody</b> pressurisation, as fitted {{to many other}} Australian National {{locomotives}} for operation in the dusty outback areas they operated in. Differences in the subsequent units included the fitting of double blade windscreen wipers, lowering of the multiple-unit jumper receptacle, and {{the changing of the}} marker light orientation from vertical to horizontal. Recent years have seen many of the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the SCT Logistics service.|$|E
25|$|The 567D's {{turbocharger}} {{is perhaps}} the least maintainable part of such an engine, and the 567D turbo has many more maintenance issues than 645E and later turbos. A common choice is conversion of a 567D turbo engine to Roots-blown, thereby abandoning the turbo and its many issues. Installation of 645 power assemblies will still allow Roots-converted 4-axle locomotives (GP20s) to produce , as does a Roots-blown 16-645E, thereby becoming the functional equivalent of a GP38, although with older electrical equipment and controls, and, of course, the older <b>carbody.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1982, <b>Carbodies</b> (who {{had been}} {{producing}} the FX4 for Austin and Mann & Overton) {{took over the}} cab's intellectual property rights when BL (Austin's parent company) lost interest in it; <b>Carbodies</b> thereafter produced it under their own name. The old Austin engine was no longer available because, during Michael Edwardes' reconstruction of British Leyland, the plant had been sold to India. <b>Carbodies</b> selected the Land Rover 2286 cc diesel engine in its place and also offered the similar-sized Land Rover petrol engine as an option. The new model was branded the FX4R, with R standing for Rover. The FX4R had some improvements over the previous FX4 models, including power steering and full servo brakes, but its performance and reliability were poor and the cab gained a bad reputation.|$|R
25|$|Externally, the FA-1/FB-1 {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from the FA-2/FB-2 (FPA-2/FPB-2) by {{the position of the}} radiator shutters – the FA-1/FB-1's shutters were {{at the far end of}} the <b>carbody,</b> whereas on the FA-2/FB-2 they were further forward, the design having been modified to allow the installation of a steam generator behind the radiator. The FPA-4/FPB-4 were visually different due to the additional radiator space that was positioned below the shutters. These Canadian variants were intended and used for high-speed passenger service, and remained in use into the 1990s on Via Rail Canada.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{railroads and}} carbuilders were debuting <b>carbody</b> and {{interior}} styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes—that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.|$|E
25|$|The narrow <b>carbody</b> {{provides}} for a catwalk along each side between the cabs, with fold back body panels for maintenance access. The cab {{is similar to that}} of the contemporary G class, with an anti-climber beam to prevent upward movement should a collision occur. Twin high impact windscreens are provided, with dual blade wipers. Each cab has room for a two-person crew, as well as an instructor if required. Air conditioning is provided, as well as an air-operated retention toilet at one end accessible from the catwalk. The locos were initially provided with automatic staff exchange equipment, but this was removed in the 1990s when the use of Electric Staff ended. The space remains in the cab side today.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, Bobby Jones sold <b>Carbodies</b> to the BSA group, who put {{it under}} the control of their {{prestige}} car company, Daimler. Although it was intended for <b>Carbodies</b> to become the manufacturing plant for Daimler steel bodies, this was never fulfilled. They did, however convert the Conquest saloon into a drophead, using the same methods they used on Fords and Austin and also made a drophead coupe body for the Daimler Conquest Roadster and made bodies for the Daimler Majestic and Majestic Major saloons.|$|R
5000|$|A closed Airline coupé made by <b>Carbodies,</b> as {{fitted to}} the P type, was also offered {{but only one}} or two is thought to have been made.|$|R

25|$|The TRAXX <b>carbody</b> {{design and}} {{internal}} configuration was modified again in 2006 {{when the first}} actual Diesel-electric version was built, to provide the same layout for Diesel and electric versions. In the electric versions, the central location of the diesel engine {{was used for the}} AC transformer or the DC chokes. The weight of the component at the central location is supported on a horizontal mounting plate that fits onto the main frame using the same fixtures. This generation of the family is also referred to as the TRAXX2E platform, the type designations themselves didn't change. The TRAXX2E generation also included the first actual deliveries of the DC versions of the TRAXX platform. The AC version of the TRAXX2 remained in production in parallel with the 2E versions of other types.|$|E
500|$|The train's {{engineer}} {{sat in a}} small compartment in {{the nose}} of the train, {{directly in front of the}} prime mover. Behind the engine in the first <b>carbody</b> was a [...] long railway post office section. The second <b>carbody</b> consisted of a small baggage section and a short buffet and 20-passenger coach section. The third and final <b>carbody</b> in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half observation car (12 passenger seats). As built, the train had 72 seats and could carry 50,000 pounds (22.7 tonnes) of baggage and express freight. This train's official christening occurred on April 18, 1934, at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|The {{designation}} [...] "F40PH" [...] {{stood for}} the following: [...] "F" [...] for the full-width cowl <b>carbody,</b> [...] "40" [...] as the locomotive {{is part of}} EMD's 40-series (based on the GP40-2 freight locomotive), [...] "P" [...] for passenger service, and [...] "H" [...] for head-end power.|$|E
2500|$|With the 1930s {{came the}} {{widespread}} use of stainless steel for <b>carbodies.</b> [...] The typical passenger car was now much lighter than its wood cousins of old. [...] The new [...] "lightweight" [...] and streamlined cars carried passengers in speed and comfort to an extent that had not been experienced to date. [...] Aluminum and Cor-Ten steel were also used in lightweight car construction, but stainless steel was the preferred material for <b>carbodies.</b> [...] Stainless steel cars could be, and often were, left unpainted except for the car's reporting marks that were required by law.|$|R
5000|$|The Rover Nizam {{was a small}} {{light-weight}} two seater sports bodied {{version of}} the 1931/32 Rover 10/25. [...] The chassis was produced by Rover and the body came from <b>Carbodies</b> of Coventry.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, <b>Carbodies</b> {{tried to}} make a new taxi of their own, the FX5, but it was {{abandoned}} in 1979 because the development costs were too high. 1982 saw <b>Carbodies</b> take responsibility for the complete manufacture of the FX4 taxicab, when British Leyland had finally lost interest in it. By this time, the FX4 was the company's only product, despite attempts to introduce new lines, such as a Ford Cortina MkV convertible and the Range Rover Unitruck. A new model of taxi, the CR6, based on a Range Rover bodyshell was abandoned after almost five years of development.|$|R
