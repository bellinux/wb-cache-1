Aim of the workTo study the prevalence of nailfold <b>capillaroscopy</b> (NFC) changes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), find out the patterns of these changes and to correlate these findings with different clinical and laboratory parameters. Patients and methodsForty patients with SLE, all fulfilling the 1997 revised criteria for the classification of SLE were included. All patients {{included in this study}} were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination, laboratory investigations as well as nailfold <b>capillaroscopy</b> (NFC) examination. ResultsThe prevalence of nailfold capilloroscopic (NFC) changes in SLE patients was 75 %. Nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities were significantly more frequent in SLE patients than in controls (P< 0. 05). Different abnormal NFC changes were seen with the meandering pattern more frequently seen. The afferent and efferent capillary loops diameters were significantly increased in the SLE patients than in the control group (P< 0. 05). Some of the NFC abnormalities showed statistical significant correlations with different clinical and laboratory parameters. Capillary loop afferent and efferent diameters were significantly correlated with disease duration (P< 0. 05) as well as the occurrence of digital gangrene (P< 0. 05). Also the capillary loop afferent diameter was found to be correlated with the intake of cyclophosphamide (P< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} whether in vivo capillary microscopy {{of the lower}} lip mucosa {{can be used to}} assess microvascular disease in systemic sclerosis. METHODS [...] Thirteen patients with systemic sclerosis and 11 healthy control subjects were studied by conventional nailfold capillary microscopy and labial <b>capillaroscopy.</b> The following parameters were analysed: loop length; loop width (maximum distance between the arteriolar and venular limbs); loop density (number of capillaries/mm 2); venular plexus visibility; megacapillaries; and the architectural arrangement of the capillary network. RESULTS [...] A typical 'scleroderma pattern' at the nailfold was observed in 12 of 13 (92 %) patients with systemic sclerosis. Labial <b>capillaroscopy</b> showed a different morphological pattern of microangiopathy. A diffuse architectural derangement of the capillary network was the most striking abnormality in 12 (92 %) patients. Labial capillaries in the patients with systemic sclerosis were shorter (mean (SD) loop length 133 (32. 2) microns) than in healthy controls (211 (48. 4) microns) and showed an increased loop width (41. 7 (13. 1) v 27. 6 (5. 5) microns in controls.

With an ANOVA analysis we found a significant difference between the three groups in terms of Ad-SOS (Group II 1750 ± 140; Group I 1890 ± 132; Group 0 1990 ± 167, p< 0. 001), UBPI (Group II 0. 21 ± 0. 17; Group I 0. 36 ± 0. 21; Group 0 0. 51 ± 0. 24, p< 0. 001), UBI (Group II 1. 2 ± 0. 43; Group I 1. 4 ± 0. 32; Group 0 1. 5 ± 0. 41, p< 0. 001), Z-scores (Group II - 2. 8 ± 1. 45; Group I - 1. 85 ± 1. 27; Group 0 - 1. 1 ± 1. 39, p< 0. 001) and T-scores (Group II - 4. 8 ± 2. 1; Group I - 3. 2 ± 1. 8; Group 0 - 1. 8 ± 2. 4, p< 0. 001). A standard linear regression analysis revealed an association between the <b>capillaroscopy</b> findings and QUS (R 0. 47 ± 0. 8, p< 0. 01). In our study patients with <b>capillaroscopy</b> alterations showed reduced phalangeal quantitative ultrasound parameters, more markedly in patients with scleroderma pattern or other major <b>capillaroscopy</b> alterations, independently from confounding variables...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the frequency, extent, {{and nature of}} microvascular lesions in patients with scleroderma by means of <b>capillaroscopy</b> and capillaroscopically guided nail fold biopsy, and to determine the diagnostic value of the two methods and the pathophysiological significance of the lesions described. METHODS: A cohort study was made of 24 consecutive patients with scleroderma and 10 healthy controls, using standardised clinical, serological, capillaroscopic, and histological (nail fold biopsy) techniques. RESULTS: All patients with scleroderma had distinct lesions of the microvascular system. <b>Capillaroscopy</b> revealed more than 90 % of the patients to have the typical scleroderma pattern. Histologically, these changes most frequently consisted of splitting of the basal lamina, broadening of the perivascular connective tissue, perivascular round cell infiltrations, and immunoglobulin deposits (each in 60 - 75 % of the patients). Electron microscopy was the most sensitive method of histological examination, detecting abnormalities in 87. 5 % of patients; with light microscopy and immunohistochemical techniques, abnormalities were revealed less frequently (83. 3 % and 75 %, respectively). In contrast, normal findings were observed {{in most of the}} healthy controls: <b>capillaroscopy</b> = 90 %; histology = 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular lesions are a predominant feature in scleroderma and seem to have a central pathogenetic role in the disease. <b>Capillaroscopy</b> is able to identify this microangiopathy noninvasively, and capillaroscopically guided nail fold biopsy can detect the frequency and nature of the underlying ultrastructural changes. This may therefore be a useful tool in describing the pathogenetic role of the microvascular system in scleroderma...|$|E

Patients referring to our Rheumatology Unit with RP were enrolled and studied for <b>capillaroscopy</b> alterations; bone quality profile was measured by QUS of the phalanxes: AD-SoS (Amplitude Dependent Speed of Sound) UBPI (Ultrasound Bone Profile Index), UBI (ultrasound Bone Index), Z score and T score were collected. One hundred thirty six females with RP had investigated for age, height, weight, Body Mass Index, previous diseases and therapies, menopausal age were enrolled. Nailfold <b>capillaroscopy</b> revealed minor alterations (borderline capillary dilatation, no capillary loss) in 36. 8 % (Group I), major alterations (capillaries definitely dilated, avascular areas, microbleeding) in 37. 5 % (Group II) and no significative alterations in 25. 7 % of patients (Group 0). A higher frequency of low QUS parameters in phalanxes was observed in group II when compared to group I or 0 (72. 5 % vs 54 % vs 18 %; p< 0. 01).

40|$|E-selectin is {{expressed}} by the activated endothelium and its plasma levels are increased in patients with systemic sclerosis. Eighteen patients fulfilling the American Rheumatism Association criteria for systemic sclerosis, 15 females and 3 males, 42 - 70 years old, 9 with diffuse and 9 with limited forms, were sequentially recruited for this study. Serum E-selectin levels were determined by commercially available ELISA and their association with nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities was investigated. Nailfold capillaries were analyzed by 16 X magnification wide-field <b>capillaroscopy.</b> Two parameters on <b>capillaroscopy</b> were used to correlate to serum E-selectin: deletion and ectasia. Data were analyzed statistically by the Student t-test and Spearman correlation. Two-tailed P values below 0. 05 were considered significant. E-selectin range was 38 to 200 ng/ml (80 ± 39. 94). There was a correlation between serum E-selectin levels and the deletion capillaroscopic score (r = 0. 50, P < 0. 035). This correlation was even stronger within the first 48 months of diagnosis (r = 0. 63, P < 0. 048). On the other hand, no association was observed between selectin and ectasia. Patients with diffuse disease presented higher serum E-selectin levels than patients with limited disease, although {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (96. 44 ± 48. 04 vs 63. 56 ± 21. 77 ng/dl; P = 0. 08). The present study is the first showing a correlation between soluble serum E-selectin levels and alterations in <b>capillaroscopy.</b> The stronger correlation of deletion score in <b>capillaroscopy</b> in early disease suggests that serum E-selectin levels might be a useful biochemical marker of disease activity in systemic sclerosis.
