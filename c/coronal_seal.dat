Materials and Methods: 30 extracted human teeth were divided into three experimental groups of 10 teeth each. The teeth in group I are obturated without <b>coronal</b> <b>seal,</b> teeth in group II are obturated with light cure GIC (3 M ESPE VITREMER) as <b>coronal</b> <b>seal</b> and teeth in group III are obturated with light cure composite(3 M ESPE filtek z 250) as <b>coronal</b> <b>seal,</b> after removing 2 mm of coronal gutta percha. These teeth (crown portion) are then suspended in methylene blue, sealed and kept for 72 hours, to observe the amount of dye penetration. After 72 hours teeth were removed, washed under running water, dried and sectioned longitudinally, separating buccal and lingual halves. The linear extent of dye penetration was measured from cavosurface margin of the access cavity to the most apical extent of dye penetration point. The length from the cavosurface margin to {{the apex of the}} tooth was also measured and percentage linear micro leakage was estimated. Statistical Analysis: Data was statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Post-Hoc Multiple comparison (Bonferroni).

Materials and Methods: Seventy single-rooted mandibular premolars were instrumented and obturated by cold lateral compaction technique. The teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups according to used material: CEM, MTA, amalgam and composite resin (n= 15) and two control groups (n= 5). In experimental groups, 2 mm of coronal gutta-percha was removed and replaced with the study material. All the teeth were mounted in a two-chamber apparatus and the coronal portion was exposed to human saliva. The day the turbidity occurred was recorded for each sample. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Results: The negative control group showed no leakage while the average microleakage time in the positive control group was 3. 5 days. The average bacterial leakage times for amalgam, composite resin, MTA, and CEM groups were 27. 42 ± 3. 6, 29. 35 ± 3. 15, 52. 57 ± 2. 87, and 50. 42 ± 2. 73 days, respectively.

40|$|Background: It is {{necessary}} to seal the dental access cavity which is under root canal treatment with temporary restorative materials. For this purpose, the main attention in selecting the temporary restorative material during endodontic treatments is drawn to the sealing ability. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the <b>coronal</b> <b>sealing</b> ability of 3 temporary filling materials, Cavizol, Coltosol, and Zonalin through DPI (Dye Penetrant Inspection). Materials and Methods: In this study, 98 extracted with no decay mandibular and maxillary molar teeth were used. The teeth were divided into 3 experimental groups of 30 teeth and two positive and negative control groups of 4 teeth. In the experimental group, 4 × 4 mm endodontic access cavity was created on the occlusal surface and in each experimental group the teeth were filled with Cavizol, Coltosol, and Zonalin. In the positive control group, access cavity was created but restorative material was not used. In the negative control group, access cavity was not created. Experimental groups (teeth) were placed in normal saline for 2 hours. Then, the first, second and third groups were immersed in methylene blue dye for 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks, respectively. Results: Zonalin showed significantly more (micro) leakage than Coltosol and Cavizol. Cavizol also showed more leakage than Coltosol, but there was no significant difference between them.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that hybridization of intraradicular dentin eliminates interfacial gaps, thereby improving the <b>coronal</b> <b>seal</b> and retention of teeth restored with fiber posts.

Longitudinal sections of the interfaces were examined for dentin hybridization in the coronal- and middle-thirds of the root canals. Resin replicas of these sections were evaluated for interfacial gap formation. Although intraradicular dentin hybridization was not compromised irrespective of whether the adhesives were light-cured before cementation, the universal oc-currence of interfacial gaps along the hybrid layer sur-face or the post-cement interface reflects the challenge in bonding to post spaces with low compliance and high C-factors.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the {{accuracy and reliability}} of conventional (Kodak Ektaspeed Plus (TM) film) and digitized radiographic images to detect the presence as well to estimate the size as measured by an image analysis programme, of periapical radiolucencies induced in dog teeth {{in comparison with the}} histomorphometric data obtained from the same lesions by conventional and fluorescence microscopy. Method: After the removal of pulp, the root canals of five premolars from the same animal were left exposed for 7 days after which they were sealed for 60 days. At day 53, three more premolars were opened and left exposed to the oral cavity for 7 days. Intact premolars were used as control. Conventional radiographs were taken at day 0, day 7, day 30, day 45 and day 60. Morphometry in digitized radiographic images and histological sections were compared at day 7 and day 60 after setting the experimental series. Results: Radiographically, periapical lesions were only detected 30 days after <b>coronal</b> <b>sealing.</b> A progressively increasing radiolucent lesion area was observed at day 45 and day 60. Histopathologically, 7 days after pulp removal dense inflammatory infiltrate and root resorption in the periapical region was observed. At day 7 and day 60, the lesion sizes were similar when evaluated by both conventional and fluorescence microscopy. Lesion size was about 20 % larger in digitized radiographs in comparison with histological measurements. Conclusions: Although image digitization could not improve the detection of the early stages of periapical lesions, it provides a valuable quantitative assessment of extensive periapical lesions. In addition, fluorescence light microscopy enhances the visualization of the apical and periapical structures and seems to be a highly useful tool for histological evaluation, valuable for both qualitative and quantitative studies of periapical disease...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare endodontic and implant {{treatments}} and to evaluate their predictability over an 8 -year period on the basis of an analysis of survival data and a retrospective clinical study. Materials and Methods: A group of 40 partially edentulous patients were selected for this study. Their teeth had been endodontically treated and rehabilitated using gold alloy and ceramic restorations. In these patients, 65 osseointegrated implants were restored with single gold alloyceramic crowns and monitored on a yearly basis for 8 years with standardized periapical radiographs, using a polivynilsiloxane occlusal key as a positioner. A total of nine patients who did not attend the yearly follow-up were excluded from the study. The Melloning and Triplett criteria were used to evaluate the clinical results obtained in the implant sites. The clinical results of the 56 endodontically treated teeth, restored with the fixed prosthesis of 40 patients, were analyzed according to probing depth as well as an assessment of the correct apical and <b>coronal</b> <b>seals.</b> The survival rate was calculated using the KaplanMeier method and the statistical significance was calculated using the chi-square test. Results: During the follow-up of the endodontically treated elements, seven failures were detected (83. 34 %) and the success rate of implants inserted in the same patients was equal to 80. 8 %, with nine implants lost in 8 years. The survival analysis of the elements treated with both therapies was not statistically significant (p =. 757) and the confidence interval was between 0. 2455 and 2. 777. Conclusion: In view of the superimposable results between the two therapies, it should be noted that the endodontically treated teeth could be interested by different pathologies while the restoration of the atrophic edentulous ridge with an implant support is predictable when patients comply with correct oral hygiene and when the occlusal loads are axially distributed in implant-protected occlusion...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} treatment {{provision in}} {{primary and secondary}} dental care following complicated crown fracture of permanent teeth. DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective observational survey of dental records of all patients attending a dental hospital trauma clinic during a 2 -year period with complicated crown fracture. RESULTS: Eighty children (70 % male) aged 6 - 16 years (mean age 10. 3 years) with 98 complicated crown fractures were identified. Of these children, 54 % were seen for emergency treatment {{on the day of}} their injury, 75 % within 48 h. Of the 98 injured teeth, 60 % were seen initially in general dental practice but only 56 % of these 59 cases were provided with emergency treatment in practice, the others being referred immediately to the trauma clinic for treatment. The main cause of fractures was transport, in particular, bicycles. Radiographs were available for 96 teeth; for the 43 open apex teeth, the definitive treatment was pulp capping (44 % of cases) and pulpotomy (30 %), with vitality maintained in five cases up to 4. 8 years after trauma. The 53 closed apex cases were treated definitively with pulp capping (38 %) and pulpectomy (36 %) and six teeth had maintained their vitality up to 4. 3 years after trauma. Sixty-seven per cent of the pulp caps and 47 % of the 19 pulpotomies provided relied on a doubtful <b>coronal</b> <b>seal.</b> This was primarily due to the extensive use of a conventional glass ionomer cement as an emergency bandage.

About 10 mm of the coronal gutta-percha was removed with either Peeso-reamer or a hot plugger. The roots were divided into three experimental groups of 10 roots and a control group. Each experimental group was subdivided equally into two groups of 15 each according to the method of post space preparation. Cavit, IRM, and Temp-Bond were used to seal the access opening. Each root was fixed in a cuvette containing Tryptic Soya Broth which, covered 2 mm of the root apex. Bacterial suspension was introduced through pipette. Fresh bacterial suspension was added every week, and the system was monitored daily for the growth of microorganisms for a period of one month. The results showed there was no significant difference in terms of coronal leakage between the three coronal materials used (P= 0. 478), but the methods of gutta-percha removal did have an impact on the apical leakage (P= 0. 047). The mean value showed the Peeso-reamer provided less leakage compared to using a hot plugger during the 30 -day experimental time period. It was concluded the temporary type of <b>coronal</b> <b>seal</b> of endodontically treated teeth will not prevent coronal leakage if left for a long period of time. In addition, permanent cementation of the post with the coronal restoration should be carried out as soon as possible to prevent recontamination of the root canal. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{functional}} {{recovery of}} a tooth with open-apex already endodontically treated is possible {{thanks to the}} materials, such as the MTA, able to produce an effective seal of the apex which can induce a restitutio-ad-integrum. A direct composite resin restoration may then provide a <b>coronal</b> <b>seal</b> immediate and effective in time, able to ensure a complete healing of the endodontic pathology. Materials and methods: The hereby-clinical case describes a combined approach (endodontic and conservative) for the aesthetic-functional recovery of a severely fractured upper incisor of a child of 11 years. Results and conclusions: At the control visit, after 12 months from {{the completion of the}} coronal restoration, a complete healing of periradicular bone tissue is observed through Rx. Clinical examination showed gingival tissue without inflammation and the probing depth is not increased, despite the presence of a cavity margin placed below the gingival margin...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical preparation of flattened root canals using the following systems: Endo-Eze AET stainless steel oscillatory instruments (Ultradent) and RaCe rotary NiTi instruments (FKG Dentaire). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty extracted human mandibular incisors were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 - Instrumentation with oscillatory Endo-Eze AET files (oscillatory technique); Group 2 - Instrumentation with rotary NiTi RaCe files (rotary technique). The teeth were decoronated, had their apices and <b>coronal</b> openings <b>sealed</b> with sticky wax and were embedded in crystal-clear orthophtalic polyester resin. The roots were sectioned transversally with diamond discs at 10 mm (middle third) and 5 mm (apical third) from the apex and the segments were reassembled for instrumentation. The sections were photographed before and after root canal instrumentation and evaluated with respect to whether the original root canal shape was modified by instrumentation. To evaluate the differences in the root canal shape before and after biomechanical preparation, scores were given regarding the instruments touch on the intracanal walls. RESULTS: In middle third of the root canals instrumented with the rotary system, there was a change in the original canal anatomy (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Under the tested conditions, Endo-Eze oscillatory system yielded the instrumentation of all flattened root canal walls, maintaining the canal original shape throughout the biomechanical preparation, and was more effective than RaCe rotary system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the microbial distribution in the root canal system after periapical lesion induction in dogs' teeth using different methods. Fifty-two root canals were assigned to 4 groups (n= 13). Groups I and II: root canals were exposed to the oral cavity for 180 days; groups III and IV: root canals were exposed for 7 days and then the <b>coronal</b> openings were <b>sealed</b> for 53 days. The root apices of groups I and III were perforated, while those of groups II and IV remained intact. After the experimental periods, the animals were euthanized and the anatomic pieces containing the roots were processed and stained with the Brown & Brenn method to assess the presence and distribution of microorganisms. The incidence of microorganisms at different sites of the roots and periapical lesions was analyzed statistically by the chi-square test at 5 % significance level. All groups presented microorganisms in the entire root canal system. A larger number of microorganisms was observed on the root canal walls, apical delta and dentinal tubules (p 0, 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the pH and calcium ion release of calcium hydroxide pastes associated with different substances. Methods: Forty acrylic teeth with simulated root canals were divided into 4 groups according to the substance associated to the calcium hydroxide paste: chlorhexidine (CHX) in 2 formulations (1 % solution and 2 % gel), Casearia sylvestris Sw extract, and propylene glycol (control). The teeth with pastes and <b>sealed</b> <b>coronal</b> accesses were immersed in 10 mL deionized water. After 10 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7, 15, and 30 days, the teeth were removed to another container, and the liquid was analyzed. Calcium ion release was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and pH readings were made with a pH meter. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Calcium analysis revealed significant differences (P. 05) were observed among groups in the other periods. Regarding the pH, there were significant differences (P. 05) were observed among groups. Conclusions: All pastes behaved similarly in terms of pH and calcium ion release in the studied periods.
