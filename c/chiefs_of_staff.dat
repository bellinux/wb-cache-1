5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E

In June, the Joint <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> decided that it was unnecessary to capture Rabaul as the Japanese base there could be neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment.
