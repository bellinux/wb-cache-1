For the Moon, he used a deferent and epicycle model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.|$|E

500|$|Collins saw the 1840 {{campaign}} as [...] "perhaps {{the last in}} which the parties focused on converting the newcomers rather than turning out the base and trying to tack on added support from the uncertain middle". Holt concurred that 1840 marked such a transition, [...] "After 1840 political leaders <b>could</b> <b>predict</b> how most men would vote. The question was whether they voted at all." [...] To ensure that they did, politicians began to stress {{the conflict between the}} parties, trying to ensure that voters would come to the polls even if they did not greatly care about the issues or candidates, so that they could inflict a defeat on the other party. The coalition that elected Harrison remained the foundation of the Whig Party until it dissolved amid sectional tensions over slavery in the 1850s.|$|E

500|$|Naruto's {{character}} has received mostly positive critical response in printed and online publications. Praise {{was given by}} Joseph Szadkowski of The Washington Times who noted that Naruto [...] "has become a pop-culture sensation". Naruto's character was analyzed by GameSpot's Joe Dodson who noted that despite having an [...] "ideal" [...] life, he still suffered from severe isolation, although he was praised for his optimistic personality by Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network (ANN). Writers for Mania Entertainment labeled him a [...] "good lead character" [...] with good overall development despite certain problems at the beginning. Christina Carpenter of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews disagreed with other writers, noting that while Naruto is a [...] "likable enough scamp", his type of {{character has}} been done before in many anime and manga series. [...] Yukari Fujimoto, a professor at Meiji University, sees Naruto himself as the manga's weakness.

500|$|Manga, anime, {{and video}} game {{publications}} {{and other related}} media have both praised and criticised Sasuke's character. GameSpot's Joe Donson extolled Sasuke's abilities as [...] "badass" [...] but echoed IGN's comments about his [...] "emo" [...] personality. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews noted that Sasuke fell into the stereotypical [...] "rival" [...] mold of shōnen manga and found him unlikable. On the other hand, Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure praised the fact that Naruto and Sasuke are forced to work together despite their rivalry. Moure liked that, despite their constant competition, [...] "the group [...] come together when they need to". A study which examined whether readers <b>could</b> <b>predict</b> character types based on physical cues found Sasuke to be a ISTJ (Myers-Briggs) character type, making him a foil for Naruto's personality. Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that {{the contrast between the}} two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: [...] "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge." [...] Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto are intended to add additional layers to the story, including Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that {{he has the ability to}} [...] "blow away" [...] the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox creature sealed inside Naruto.|$|E
500|$|Hobbs' {{technique}} {{was based on}} strong forearms and good foot movement. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that [...] "his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body." [...] He played every type of shot—he {{did not have a}} [...] "signature" [...] shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he <b>could</b> <b>predict</b> what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that [...] "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them." [...] This was the period in which he became known as [...] "The Master", and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; [...] 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.|$|E
