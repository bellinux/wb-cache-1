50|$|Fibre bundles were {{originally}} developed {{for use in}} flexible endoscopes. and have since been adapted for use in endomicroscopy. They consist {{of a large number}} (up to tens of thousands) of fibre cores inside a single shared cladding, are flexible, and have diameters on the order of a millimetre. In a <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> bundle the relative positions of the cores are maintained along the fibre, meaning that an image projected onto one end of the bundle will be transferred to the other end without scrambling. Therefore, if one end of the bundle is placed at the focus of a table-top confocal microscope, the bundle will act as a flexible extension and allow endoscopic operation.Since only the cores, and not the cladding, transmit light, image processing must be applied to remove the resulting honeycomb-like appearance of the images. Each core essentially acts as an image pixel, and so the spacing between fibre cores limits the resolution. The addition of micro-optics at the distal tip of the bundle allows for magnification and hence higher resolution imaging, but at the cost of reducing the field-of-view.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>Fibre</b> OpticsIf {{a bundle}} of fibres could be {{arranged}} such that {{the ends of the}} fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image {{on one end of the}} bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude coherent bundle in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of-eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required coherent bundle. Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955. However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of cladding each fibre to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for cladding fibres with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised.|$|E

Nevertheless real progress was not made until the idea of surrounding the light guiding core by a protective cladding was introduced in 1958.

40|$|An OCT system {{incorporating}} a <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> imaging bundle is described. Fibres are accessed sequentially by a beam focused onto the input {{face of the}} bundle, allowing 2 D or 3 D images to be acquired using point detection. A Fizeau interferometer configuration is used, in which light from the distal end of a fibre in the bundle (forming the reference arm) mixes with light reflected by the sample itself (forming the sample arm). The use of coherent imaging bundles for OCT beam delivery allows mechanical scanning parts {{to be removed from}} the sample arm, resulting in a passive probe. Such a configuration can form a compact, robust and "downlead insensitive" OCT system. In the common-path configuration used, an inherent path-length difference is present in the Fizeau sample interferometer, so an additional processing interferometer is required to ensure path-length matching.

The Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO) has prototyped a {{compact and lightweight}} Shack-Hartmann wavefront-sensor that fits into a standard Starbug parallel fibre positioning robot. Each device makes use of a polymer <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> imaging bundle to relay an image produced by a microlens array placed at the telescope focal plane to a re-imaging camera mounted elsewhere. The advantages of the polymer fibre bundle are its high-fill factor, high-throughput, low weight, and relatively low cost. Multiple devices can also be multiplexed to a single low-noise camera for cost efficiencies per wavefront sensor. The use of fibre bundles also opens the possibility of applications such as telescope field acquisition, guiding, and seeing monitors to be positioned by Starbugs.

40|$|Optical fibres {{with their}} unique ability to {{transport}} light {{even in a}} <b>coherent</b> way (<b>fibre</b> bundles) and the possibility to build small volume optical pieces (Graded Index Fibres, GRIN) have a dominant role in the assembly of probes and objectives for microscopy applications requiring noninvasive and flexible operation in small and crowded spaces (in vivo microscopy, endoscopy, inspection). Nowadays, even complex observing procedures like confocal, two-photon and optical coherence tomography can be approached with fibres, making possible in vivo applications and also in place decision and processing. We present here a series of analytical simulations and practical tests made on an experimental GRIN fibre objective light fed through an adaptive optics system aimed to verify the practical possibility to correct a focalized beam of light.

40|$|We {{address the}} two {{dominant}} dilemmas encountered {{in attempting to}} demonstrate real-time hyperspectral imaging: how to record a three-dimensional spectral data cube with a conventional two-dimensional detector array and how to most efficiently transmit the spectral data cube through the information bottleneck constituted by the detector’s limited space–bandwidth product. We have demonstrated a new, biologically inspired approach in which a compact hyperspectral fovea is embedded within a conventional panchromatic periphery. Combined with an intelligent scanning system this will enable hyperspectral imaging to be applied only to small regions of interest previously identified using the panchromatic periphery, thus improving the efficiency with which hyperspectral imaging {{can be used to}} recognize objects in a scene.

40|$|Currently several {{medical imaging}} {{techniques}} are in operation in clinical environments {{that help the}} doctors to diagnose diseases before proceeding to treatment. This research investigated and implemented configurations for a medical imaging technique called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The Michelson interferometer has been the principal configuration for OCT systems. For endoscopic OCT applications though such a configuration is susceptible to polarisation induced signal fading due to environmental changes within the sample arm, like fibre bending and temperature fluctuations. The development and testing of a Fizeau interferometer based OCT system demonstrate the elimination of this polarisation induced signal fading as the sample and reference arm of the interferometer experience the same environmental changes. The Fizeau interferometer is formed {{between the end of}} the fibre and the sample itself. A secondary processing interferometer is used in this configuration, to compensate the path difference inherent to the Fizeau configuration. Longitudinal resolution is about 19 m in air, and lateral resolution about 23 m. A signal-to-noise ratio of about 80 dB was achieved with this system and several sets of image data were collected from laboratory and biological samples. An OCT system based on a Fizeau interferometer incorporating a <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> imaging bundle was also investigated. Fibres in the bundle are accessed sequentially by a beam focused onto the input face of the bundle, allowing 2 D information to be acquired using point detection. Incorporating a fibre optic imaging bundle in Fizeau based interferometer OCT allows mechanical scanning parts to be removed from the sample arm, resulting in a passive probe. Such a configuration can form a compact, robust and “downlead insensitive” OCT system and is a strong candidate for in vivo applications. The performance of leached and wound <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> optic bundles was accessed and an analysis is presented. The longitudinal resolution of the system developed was about 10 m in air, and lateral resolution about 9 m. This thesis demonstrates several sets of image data that were collected from various samples using a Fizeau interferometer based OCT incorporating coherent imaging bundles. 2 D image data captured by such a configuration are presented and reported {{for the first time in}} this thesis.

40|$|Endoscopic OCT probes deliver {{light to}} the {{measurement}} region via a single optical fibre mounted in a probe head. The output beam is focused onto the sample, providing a single point measurement. The beam is translated, using mechanical scanning at the probe tip, to address a line or area of sampling points and produce an image. We are investigating a swept-source OCT system incorporating <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles, to allow many measurement points to be addressed, within {{an area of the}} sample, without the need for mechanical motion within the endoscope probe. Scanning components are still present at the input of our system, but are no longer required within the flexible ndoscope section. This allows a small-diameter, electrically passive probe to be engineered using off-the-shelf scanning components. A common-path probe design is proposed, in which the bundle is external to the OCT interferometer. This eliminates contrast variations caused by non-controllable differences in the state of polarisation between fibres. Imaging bundle fibres are typically few-moded, which can lead to ghost features and reduced SNR in OCT images, but the common-path configuration also removes cross-mode interference problems, and reduces dispersion artefacts. OCT images of a microscope cover-slip and a sample of spring onion, acquired using the swept-source, bundle-based OCT system are presented. Features peculiar to the inclusion of the fibre bundle are discussed, and directions for future development of the system are outlined...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} wide-field {{fluorescence lifetime}} imaging (FLIM) endoscope is developed for clinical applications. For remote imaging, a <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> optic bundle was used which required techniques and protocols {{to be developed}} to minimise artefacts associated with dispersion and recover accurate lifetime estimates. Potentially gain switched pulsed laser diodes are better suited for the clinic than light sources used conventionally for FLIM endoscopy {{because they are more}} compact and lower in cost. By imaging ex vivo human tissue samples, it was demonstrated that gain-switched pulsed laser diodes are a viable alternative excitation light source. The system was able to acquire ∼mm-scale spatial FLIM images from fresh ex vivo diseased human larynx biopsies. For wide-field FLIM with the fastest update rates, gated optical intensifiers (GOIs) are used as detectors. This thesis documents the characterisation of next generation GOI technology that can achieve larger than existing standard GOI standard gate-widths for improved light efficiency and that use a magnetic field to enhance spatial resolution beyond that of proximity focusing alone. For intra vital microscopy, access to tissue surfaces deep inside hollow or solid organs is challenging for microscopes. This thesis applies a commercially available confocal laser scanning endomicroscope (CLSE) adapted for time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) FLIM to study protein interactions using based on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins. Protocols to minimise artefacts associated with dispersion in the CLSE’s fibre probe to recover accurate lifetime estimates are presented. To validate the design, the CLSE was used for a time-lapse study of live cancer cells in vitro to monitor their response to an inhibitor of the ERK intracellular signalling pathway by FLIM FRET of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) biosensor.

40|$|A {{modified}} Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) technique, two frequency PDV (2 v-PDV), {{is described}} that allows {{measurements of the}} velocity field over a plane defined by a laser light sheet using sequential illumination of the flow with two closely separated (&IGHz) frequencies of laser light. This allows a common-path imaging head to be used containing a single CCD camera {{instead of the usual}} camera pair. The problem of image misalignment is now avoided and the polarisation sensitivity of the beam splitter used in two camera imaging heads is also removed. Cost efficiency is improved by the simplification of the system. This paper describes the development of a 2 v-PDV system using a continuous wave argon ion laser capable of making time-averaged velocity measurements. Initially a single velocity component system was constructed using acousto-optic modulators to produce the two illumination frequencies required. The system was then expanded to make 3 D velocity measurements using a single CCD camera and multiple <b>coherent</b> imaging <b>fibre</b> bundles. Measurements were made on the rotating disc, in order to assess error level in the measurements, and on a seeded axisymmetric air jet. A method of improving the sensitivity of the 2 v-PDV system is demonstrated by using both the rising and falling slopes of the iodine absorption line. Reductions in the error levels of velocity measurements of approximately 40 % can be achieved using this increased sensitivity method...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the two-frequency Planar Doppler Velocimetry (2 n-PDV) flow measurement technique. This is modification of the Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) technique that allows the measurement of up to three components of the flow velocity across a plane defined by a laser light sheet. The 2 n-PDV technique reduces the number of components required to a single CCD camera and iodine cell from the two CCDs in conventional PDV. This removes the error sources associated with the misalignment of the two camera images and polarisation effects due to the beam splitters used in conventional PDV. The construction of a single velocity component 2 n-PDV system is described and measurements made on the velocity field of a rotating disc and an axisymmetric air jet. The system was then modified to make 3 D velocity measurements using <b>coherent</b> imaging <b>fibre</b> bundles to port multiple views to a single detector head. A method of approximately doubling the sensitivity of the technique was demonstrated using the measurements made on the velocity field of the rotating disc and was shown to reduce the error level in the final orthogonal velocity components by ~ 40 to 50 %. Error levels of between 1. 5 ms- 1 and 3. 1 ms- 1 depending upon observation direction are demonstrated for a velocity field of ± 34 ms- 1. The factors that will influence the selection of a viewing configuration when making 3 D PDV measurements are then investigated {{with the aid of a}} computer model. The influence of the observation direction, the magnitude of the flow velocity, and the transformation to orthogonal velocity components are discussed. A new method using additional data in this transformation is presented and experimental results calculated using four-measured velocity components are compared to those found conventionally, using only three components. The inclusion of additional data is shown to reduce the final error levels by up to 25 %. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis comprises a proposed robust diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) pipeline, each chapter detailing a step designed to ultimately transform raw DW-MRI data into segmented bundles of <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> ready for more complex analysis or manipulation. In addition to this pipeline we will also demonstrate, where appropriate, ways in which each step could be optimized for the maxillofacial region, setting {{the groundwork for a}} wider maxillofacial modelling project intended to aid surgical planning. Our contribution begins with RESDORE, an algorithm designed to automatically identify corrupt DW-MRI signal elements. While slower than the closest alternative, RESDORE is also far more robust to localised changes in SNR and pervasive image corruptions. The second step in the pipeline concerns the retrieval of accurate fibre orientation distribution functions (fODFs) from the DW-MRI signal. Chapter 4 comprises a simulation study exploring the application of spherical deconvolution methods to `generic' fibre; finding that the commonly used constrained spherical harmonic deconvolution (CSHD) is extremely sensitive to calibration but, if handled correctly, might be able to resolve muscle fODFs in vivo. Building upon this information, Chapter 5 conducts further simulations and in vivo image experimentation demonstrating that this is indeed the case, allowing us to demonstrate, for the first time, anatomically plausible reconstructions of several maxillofacial muscles. To complete the proposed pipeline, Chapter 6 then introduces a method for segmenting whole volume streamline tractographies into anatomically valid bundles. In addition to providing an accurate segmentation, this shape-based method does not require computationally expensive inter-streamline comparisons employed by other approaches, allowing the algorithm to scale linearly with respect to the number of streamlines within the dataset. This is not often true for comparison based methods which in the best case scale in higher linear time but more often by O(N 2) complexity...|$|E
40|$|The future {{broadband}} {{information network}} will undoubtedly integrate the mobility and flexibility of wireless access systems {{with the huge}} bandwidth capacity of photonics solutions to enable a communication system capable of handling the anticipated demand for interactive services. Towards wide coverage and low cost implementations of such broadband wireless photonics communication networks, {{various aspects of the}} enabling technologies are continuingly generating intense research interest. Among the core technologies, the optical generation and distribution of radio frequency signals over fibres, and the fibre optic signal processing of optical and radio frequency signals, have been the subjects for study in this thesis. Based on the intrinsic properties of single-mode optical fibres, and in conjunction with the concepts of optical fibre delay line filters and fibre Bragg gratings, a number of novel fibre-based devices, potentially suitable for applications in the future wireless photonics communication systems, have been realised. Special single-mode fibres, namely, the high birefringence (Hi-Bi) fibre and the Er/Yb doped fibre have been employed so as to exploit their merits to achieve practical and cost-effective all-fibre architectures. A number of fibre-based complex signal processors for optical and radio frequencies using novel Hi-Bi fibre delay line filter architectures have been illustrated. In particular, operations such as multichannel flattop bandpass filtering, simultaneous complementary outputs and bidirectional nonreciprocal wavelength interleaving, have been demonstrated. The proposed configurations featured greatly reduced environmental sensitivity typical of <b>coherent</b> <b>fibre</b> delay line filter schemes, reconfigurable transfer functions, negligible chromatic dispersions, and ease of implementation, not easily achievable based on other techniques. A number of unique fibre grating devices for signal filtering and fibre laser applications have been realised. The concept of the superimposed fibre Bragg gratings has been extended to non-uniform grating structures and into Hi-Bi fibres to achieve highly useful grating devices such as overwritten phase-shifted fibre grating structure and widely/narrowly spaced polarization-discriminating filters that are not limited by the intrinsic fibre properties. In terms of the-fibre-based optical millimetre wave transmitters, unique approaches based on fibre laser configurations have been proposed and demonstrated. The ability of the dual-mode distributed feedback (DFB) fibre lasers to generate high spectral purity, narrow linewidth heterodyne signals without complex feedback mechanisms has been illustrated. A novel co-located dual DFB fibre laser configuration, based on the proposed superimposed phase-shifted fibre grating structure, has been further realised with highly desired operation characteristics without the need for costly high frequency synthesizers and complex feedback controls. Lastly, a novel cavity mode condition monitoring and optimisation scheme for short length, linear-cavity fibre lasers has been proposed and achieved. Based on the concept and simplicity of the superimposed fibre laser cavities structure, in conjunction with feedback controls, enhanced output performances from the fibre lasers have been achieved. The importance of such cavity mode assessment and feedback control for optimised fibre laser output performance has been illustrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|MicroPET II is a second-generation animal PET scanner {{designed}} for high-resolution imaging of small laboratory rodents. The system consists of 90 scintillation detector modules arranged in three contiguous axial rings with a ring diameter of 16. 0 cm and an axial length of 4. 9 cm. Each detector module {{consists of a}} 14 x 14 array of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals coupled to a multi-channel photomultiplier tube (MC-PMT) through a <b>coherent</b> optical <b>fibre</b> bundle. Each LSO crystal element measures 0. 975 mm x 0. 975 mm in cross section by 12. 5 mm in length. A barium sulphate reflector material was used between LSO elements leading to a detector pitch of 1. 15 mm in both axial and transverse directions. Fused optical fibre bundles were made from 90 mum diameter glass fibres with a numerical aperture of 0. 56. Interstitial extramural absorber was added between the fibres to reduce optical cross talk. A charge-division readout circuit was implemented on printed circuit boards to decode the 196 crystals in each array from the outputs of the 64 anode signals of the MC-PMT. Electronics from Concorde Microsystems Inc. (Knoxville, TN) were used for signal amplification, digitization, event qualification, coincidence processing and data capture. Coincidence data were passed to a host PC that recorded events in list mode. Following acquisition, data were sorted into sinograms and reconstructed using Fourier rebinning and filtered backprojection algorithms. Basic evaluation of the system has been completed. The absolute sensitivity of the microPET II scanner was 2. 26 % at {{the centre of the}} field of view (CFOV) for an energy window of 250 - 750 keV and a timing window of 10 ns. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the detectors in the system averaged 1. 21 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) when measured with a Na- 22 point source 0. 5 mm in diameter. Reconstructed image resolution ranged from 0. 83 mm FWHM at the CFOV to 1. 47 mm FWHM in the radial direction, 1. 17 mm FWHM in the tangential direction and 1. 42 mm FWHM in the axial direction at 1 cm offset from the CFOV. These values represent highly significant improvements over our earlier microPET scanner (approximately fourfold sensitivity increase and 25 - 35 % improvement in linear spatial resolution under equivalent operating conditions) and are expected to be further improved when the system is fully optimized...|$|R
