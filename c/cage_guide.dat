40|$|In coal mines, bolt {{loosening}} in the <b>cage</b> <b>guide</b> {{is affected}} by the harsh environmental factors and cage hoist vibration, leading to significant threats to work safety. It is crucial, to this effect, to successfully detect the status of multipoint bolts of guide structures. This paper proposes a system to monitor bolt status in harsh environments established based on the RFID technique. A proof-of-concept model was demonstrated consisting of a bolt gearing system, passive UHF RFID tags, a reader, and monitoring software. A tinfoil metal film is fixed on the retaining plate and an RFID tag bonded to a large gear, with the bolt to be detected fixed {{in the center of a}} smaller gear. The radio-frequency signal cannot be received by the reader if the tag is completely obscured by the tinfoil, and if the bolt is loose, the tag’s antenna is exposed when the gear revolves. A radio-frequency signal that carries corresponding bolt’s information is transmitted by the RFID tag to the RFID reader due to coil coupling, identifying loose bolt location and reporting them in the software. Confirmatory test results revealed that the system indeed successfully detects bolt loosening and comparative test results (based on a reed switch multipoint bolt loosening monitor system) provided valuable information regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed system...|$|E

Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations reveal a distribution of cooperatively moving fractal events below the temperature Ta at which dynamics become <b>caged.</b> <b>Guided</b> by these results, four straightforward methods emerge to recognize Ta in experimental data and quantify the length scale that grows on cooling below Ta.

40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with 35 mm bore, angular contact ball bearings with either a single or double outer and <b>guided</b> <b>cage.</b> The bearings were either lubricated by oil jets or employed inner ring lubrication. Outer ring cooling was added in selected tests. Lubricant flow to the bearing ranged from 300 to 1900 cc/min. All bearings were successfully run at speeds to 2. 5 million DN. Increasing the lubricant flow decreased bearing ring temperatures but increased bearing power lines. The power loss and race temperatures of a jet lubricated with double outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage</b> were always {{higher than those of}} the single land guided design at similar test conditions. The lowest bearing operating temperatures were achieved when inner ring lubrication and outer ring cooling were combined. It is found that cage slip of a double outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage</b> is approximately twice that of a single outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage...</b>|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with a 35 mm bore {{angular contact ball bearing}} with a double outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage.</b> Provisions were made for jet lubrication and outer-ring cooling of the bearing. Test conditions included a combined thrust and radial load at nominal shaft speeds of 48, 000 rpm, and an oil-in temperature of 394 K (250 F). Successful operation of the test bearing was accomplished up to 2. 5 million DN. Test results were compared with those obtained with similar bearing having a single outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage.</b> Higher temperatures were generated with the double outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage</b> bearing, and bearing power loss and cage slip were greater.

40|$|Background: Hip surface {{replacement}} arthroplasty (SRA) can be {{an alternative}} for total hip arthroplasty. The short and long-term outcome of hip surface replacement arthroplasty mainly relies on the optimal size and position of the femoral component. This can be defined before surgery with pre-operative templating. Reproducing the optimal, templated femoral implant position during surgery relies on guide wire positioning devices in combination with visual inspection and experience of the surgeon. Another method of transferring the templated position into surgery is by navigation or Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS). Though CAS is documented to increase accurate placement particularly in case of normal hip anatomy, it requires bulky equipment that is not readily available in each centre. Methods: A custom made neck jig device is presented {{as well as the}} results of a pilot study. The device is produced based on data pre-operatively acquired with CT-scan. The position of the guide wire is chosen as the anatomical axis of the femoral neck. Adjustments to the design of the jig are made based on the orthopedic surgeon's recommendations for the drill direction. The SRA jig is designed as a slightly more-than-hemispherical cage to fit the anterior part of the femoral head. The cage is connected to an anterior neck support.

30|$|For {{the human}} kidney, {{concrete}} data are lacking, {{but in the}} neonatal rabbit kidney, approaching of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells is prescribed by microfibers that link the inner side of the organ capsule {{with the tip of}} the CD ampullae (Fig. 2 b). In its basal lamina, laminin ɣ 1 and the proteoglycan agrin are contained. At this site also microfibers labeled by anti-collagen types I, II, III respectively soybean agglutinin (SBA) originate [10]. They span through the two layers of nephrogenic mesenchymal stem cells for mounting on the inner side of the capsule. This mechanic construction demonstrates that epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells do not meet by accident but are integral part of a <b>guiding</b> <b>cage.</b> It coordinates positioning at a distinct site and keeps contained cells close to the capsule.|$|R
40|$|Radial load is {{of great}} {{significant}} influence on friction characteristic and fatigue life of rolling bearings. A frictional torque analysis {{was performed on the}} radially loaded SKF- 6205 deep-groove ball bearings. The frictional torque formula was proposed as the sum of the frictional torques caused by elastic hysteresis, elastic hydrodynamic lubrication, differential slip, spinning friction of balls, friction between the balls and the cage pockets, and friction between the <b>cages</b> and the <b>guiding</b> lands. The experiments were carried out with the bearing with lubrication and the other one without lubrication under different radial loads and rotational speeds. In order to avoid the frictional torque measurement errors caused by the unequal length of arms, a positive–negative test method is employed to test bearing frictional torque. The experimental results showed that the frictional torque caused by radial loads played a leading role in all the frictional torque components of the bearing. Ultimately, a special theoretical model of frictional torque for deep-groove ball bearings was verified through comparing with the experimental results and SKF torque model. A reasonable correlation exists between the experiment results and the theoretical model...|$|R

The SRA jig is designed as a slightly more-than-hemispherical cage to fit the anterior part of the femoral head. The cage is connected to an anterior neck support. Four knifes are attached on the central arch of the <b>cage.</b> A drill <b>guide</b> cylinder is attached to the <b>cage,</b> thus allowing <b>guide</b> wire positioning as pre-operatively planned. Custom made devices were tested in 5 patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty. The orthopedic surgeons reported the practical aspects of the use of the neck-jig device. The retrieved femoral heads were analyzed to assess the achieved drill place in mm deviation from the predefined location and orientation compared to the predefined orientation. Results The orthopedic surgeons rated the passive stability, full contact with neck portion of the jig and knife contact with femoral head, positive. There were no guide failures. The jig unique position and the number of steps required to put the guide in place were rated 1, while the complexity to put the guide into place was rated 1 - 2. In all five cases the guide wire was accurately positioned. Maximum angular deviation was 2. 9 ° and maximum distance between insertion points was 2. 1 mm. Conclusions Pilot testing of a custom made jig for use during SRA indicated that the device was (1) successfully applied and user friendly and (2) allowed for accurate guide wire placement according to the preoperative plan. </p...|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with a 35 millimeter bore, {{angular contact ball bearing}} having a single outer land <b>guided</b> <b>cage.</b> Lubrication was achieved by flowing oil through axial grooves and radial holes machined in the inner ring of the bearing. Test conditions were a thrust load of 667 N (150 lb), shaft speeds from 48, 000 to 72, 000 rpm, and an oil inlet temperature of 394 K (250 F). Data from tests where the distribution of the total oil supplied to the inner ring was 50 percent for bearing lubrication and 50 percent for bearing inner ring cooling were compared with those where the distribution pattern was 25 percent lubrication and 75 percent cooling. Successful operation was experienced with both the 50 - 50 and 25 - 75 percent flow distribution patterns to 2. 5 million DN. The 50 - 50 percent flow pattern provided the cooler bearing operation of the two inner ring lubricated bearings. The jet lubricated bearing had lower outer ring and higher inner ring temperatures than the inner ring lubricated bearings. Maximum power loss of 2. 8 kW (3. 7 hp) was experienced with the 25 - 75 percent flow distribution, and maximum percent cage slip of 7. 0 occurred at 72, 300 rpm with the 50 - 50 percent flow distribution...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} alcohol use disorders and at risk-drinking among outpatients admitted to the Division of Psychiatry, University of Cagliari, Italy, for schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaires used. Methods: Fifty patients affected by schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders answered questions made by the (a) NIAAA Guide for identification of at risk-drinking, (b) AUDIT questionnaire, (c) CAGE questionnaire, and (d) SCID-I application forms for schizophrenia-spectrum and alcohol use disorders. Results: According to SCID-I, 12 / 50 (24 %) subjects met criteria for alcohol use disorders, 7 / 50 (14 %) subjects met criteria for other substance use disorders, and 14 / 50 (28 %) subjects met criteria for any alcohol or other substance use disorder. Eleven/ 50 (22 %) and 7 / 50 (14 %) subjects achieved a score ≥ 1 and ≥ 2, respectively, in the CAGE questionnaire. Nine/ 50 (18 %) and 7 / 50 (14 %) subjects scored ≥ 5 and ≥ 8, respectively, in the AUDIT questionnaire. Five/ 50 (10 %) subjects provided positive answers to the NIAAA <b>Guide.</b> <b>CAGE</b> questionnaire achieved the highest values of sensitivity and specificity in detecting alcohol use disorders tested against SCID-I. Approximately half all alcohol use disorders were not listed on patients’ medical records.
