Universally accepted, the character's status as Disney's first Arabic princess [...] "won over hearts" [...] upon the film's 1992 release, according to Andre Tartar of Vulture.com. However, while the fact that the princess is Middle Eastern is considered to be [...] "a breakthrough", {{at the same time the}} characteristics of both Jasmine and Aladdin have been met with controversy; observers widely criticized the characters for being Westernized and Anglicized. In her book Thinking Class: Sketches from a <b>Cultural</b> <b>Worker,</b> author Joanna Kadi joked that Jasmine is [...] "as Arab as baseball and apple pie." [...] The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee was particularly disgruntled by the treatment of the leads characters, with Don Bustany accusing Disney of teaching [...] "that anyone with an accent is bad." [...] The Arabian Nights Reader author Ulrich Marzloph observed that the character speaks [...] "perfect American English" [...] despite her [...] "ostensibly Middle Eastern features", and have American accents in spite of their [...] "alleged Arab ethnicity". In his book The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence, author Henry A. Giroux accused [...] "the anglicized Jasmine and Aladdin" [...] of communicating in American English, while the film's villains have strong foreign accents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to enhance our {{understanding}} of career management practices in the cultural and creative industries (CCI). Current research evidences that reputation and social capital are crucial for cultural workers’ careers. However, there is little empirical insight on how <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> attempt to manage their careers, through the accumulation of social capital and reputation or other practices. This paper addresses this empirical gap drawing on a qualitative study into the career management practices of <b>cultural</b> <b>workers.</b> In-depth interviews using critical incident technique were carried out with thirty-six <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> in Scotland. Through thematic analysis we have identified nine typical career management practices and six career management strategies. Our study shows that although <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> do not recognise themselves as managing their careers, they deploy career management practices as well as strategies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{insights on}} career {{management in the}} creative and cultural industries in Scotland with detailed exploration into practices and strategies employed by <b>cultural</b> <b>workers.</b> Following a phenomenological approach, the study has used subjective data of individual career experiences and interpreted them into objective patterns of career management. Using qualitative research interviews and thematic analysis, the doctoral study explored the career management experiences of thirty six <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> and identified particular strategies adopted in the self-management of precarious and unpredictable careers. Employment in the creative and cultural industries is with precarious which constitutes a specific environment for career management and career progression. Not enough {{is known about the}} ways in which <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> manage their careers in these circumstances. The aim of this study was to understand the realities of contemporary career management in the creative and cultural industries and to identify particular practices and strategies in which creative careers might be managed. Beyond the scholars in this field, this research is of interest to <b>cultural</b> <b>workers,</b> policy makers in the creative and cultural industries more broadly and higher education institutions preparing graduates for work in the creative and cultural industries. The empirical evidence gathered can better inform <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> of effective career management strategies and propose policy interventions that would facilitate effective career management and career management education. Key findings focus on the use of online / social media within creative careers and how such activity takes place; the development of a new harmony between art and economic logics and the application of development based career strategies in creative careers, with <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> being more managerial than they even recognise themselves. The findings from this study offers confirmation to what is already known about careers in the creative and cultural industries, greater depth and detail to what is already known and extend understanding about the relationship disconnect between individual career Career Management in the Creative and Cultural Industries Abstract management strategies and the policies designed to support <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> – policies which focus on growth and development of the industry but not those individuals who make up the industry. Exploration of the phenomenon of career management in the creative and cultural industries requires further research, which could include: alternative methodologies to elicit perceptions based on the findings from this study, deeper exploration into both the difference in career management within the creative and cultural industries and the emerging relationship between art and economic logic...|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} explores artists' and {{cultural}} workers' activism {{in the context}} of urban social movements opposing creative city policy, focusing in particular on the meanings and images of creativity that emerge from this confrontation. Today this theme is important because it reveals a glaring contradiction in many culturally based urban policies currently being implemented, which have the explicit objective of fostering creativity but leave <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> out of their development. <b>Cultural</b> <b>workers</b> have begun to contest those policies nowadays as several authors have already been able to document (Borèn and Young, 2013; Novy & Colomb, 2013), which this special issue will also contribute to. This contestation is the best proof of the paradoxical divorce between <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> and policy makers in charge of creative city policy.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} agency and positioning of <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> in the restructuring of contemporary cities. This positioning is ambiguous. <b>Cultural</b> <b>workers</b> often lead precarious professional lives, yet their significant symbolic and cultural capital is widely mobilised {{in the service of}} neoliberal urban restructuring, including ‘creative city’ flagship developments and gentrification. But cultural workers’ actual agency, their reactions to urban processes that exploit their presence, and their relations to other urban social groups, are poorly understood and hard to decipher. This thesis addresses these issues through three articles. Paper I examines a process of artist-led gentrification ongoing in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. It shows that artists, gallerists {{and other members of the}} local art scene contribute to sustaining gentrification through their everyday practices and discourses. The gentrification frontier is constructed on an everyday level as a transitional space and time in the scene members’ lives. Gentrification is de-politicised by discursively underplaying its conflictual components of class and racial struggle. Forms of resistance to gentrification amongst scene members are found, but they appear to be sector-specific and exclusive. Finally, scene members tend to fail at establishing meaningful relationships with long-time residents. Paper II brings the perspectives of long-time residents in Bushwick to the forefront. Examination of the emotional and affectual components of displacement reveals that these aspects are as important as material re-location to understanding displacement and gentrification. The encounter with newcomers’ bodies in neighbourhood spaces triggers a deep sense of displacement for long-time residents, evoking deep-rooted structural inequalities of which gentrification is one spatial expression. Paper III examines the case of Macao, a collective mobilisation of <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> in Milan, Italy. There, <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> have mobilised against neoliberal urbanism, top-down gentrification, corruption, growing labour precarity and other regressive urban and social issues. The paper considers the distinctive resources, aesthetic tactics and inaugurative practices mobilised and enacted in the urban space by Macao and it argues that by deploying their cultural and symbolic capital, <b>cultural</b> <b>workers</b> can reframe the relations between bodies, space and time, and hence challenge power structures. <b>Cultural</b> <b>workers</b> might not have the power to determine the structural boundaries and hierarchies that organize urban society, including their own positioning in it. Nonetheless, through their actions and discourses and subjectification processes, they can reinforce or challenge those borders. ...|$|R
