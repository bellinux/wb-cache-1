40|$|Abrupt {{temperature}} change (freeze-thaw cycles) {{is one of}} the most damaging actions affecting concrete, inasmuch as it induces microcracking. The formation of this crack reduces the mechanical behaviour of the material, moreover increase the penetration of aggressive substances into the concrete matrix, reducing its durability and possibly leading to structural collapse. The present study explored the durability of concrete made with aggregate containing 20 – 25 % <b>ceramic</b> <b>sanitary</b> ware industry waste, analysing the scaled surface, exploring aggregate/paste de-bonding and measuring the mean and maximum crack widths in both the paste and at the interfacial transition zone between paste-aggregate after 56 freeze-thaw cycles. The findings showed that concrete freeze-thaw resistance rose with rising recycled aggregate content. This better performance was due to the high mechanical quality of recycled concrete and the intrinsic properties of the new aggregate. Use of this waste as a construction material would yield substantial technical, economic and environmental benefits, in particular from the perspective of sustainable development. Peer reviewe...|$|R

To improve the homogeneity of batches received by final users and to detect manufacturing defaults, a visual control stage is integrated into production line before the packing operation.

40|$|Background: Washbasin {{and sink}} U-bends are {{ubiquitous}} {{in virtually all}} buildings including hospitals and smaller healthcare premises. They {{have been used for}} over a century and their principal purpose is to prevent foul odours emanating from wastewater pipes from entering buildings. U-bends are designed to retain a small volume of water, which acts as the seal preventing the passage of sewer gas from wastewater pipework. The water retained in U-bends is frequently stagnant, which encourages the growth and proliferation of microbial biofilms, populated predominantly by Gram-negative bacterial species and especially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Over the past two decades there have been numerous reports of nosocomial outbreaks of infection related directly or indirectly to contaminated U-bends. Three different approaches at addressing this problem have been used previously including the application of chemical disinfectants such as bleach, the replacement of <b>sanitary</b> <b>fixtures</b> and/or U-bends and the use of a U-bend heating element together with vibrational cleaning. The first two approaches worked well in several studies reducing contamination and infection risks in the short term, but failed to provide a long-term solution due to recolonisation of U-bends and the associated pipework with biofilm. The use of U-bend heating elements together with vibrational cleaning was shown to be effective, but the approach is expensive as the heating elements are in constant operation. Electrochemically activated (ECA) solution generators produce two solutions through activation of dilute brine. These include a metastable oxidant solution termed ?anolyte? (predominantly hypochlorous acid (HOCl)) and a second solution termed ?catholyte? with detergent properties (predominantly sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) The solutions are generated by passing a brine solution through a flow-through electrolytic cell. Anolyte is highly microbiocidal and capable of penetrating biofilms. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that treatment of water supplied to dental units and washbasins with residual anolyte consistently eliminates biofilm and provides output water virtually free of contamination. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether periodic treatment of washbasin U-bends and associated pipework with catholyte solution as a cleaning agent followed by anolyte solution as a disinfectant could minimise biofilm contamination of U-bends. Achieving this objective would require developing an approach to seal the wastewater outflow pipework from washbasins so that U-bends and associated pipework could be completely filled with ECA solutions for specified periods of time for maximum efficacy. A second objective was to automate U-bend decontamination with ECA solutions. Methods: Initially three identical washbasin U-bends were manually filled with catholyte solution followed by anolyte solution for five min each once weekly for five weeks. Three additional identical washbasin U-bends were used as controls. A programmable system was then developed with one washbasin that automated this process using an actuator-controlled ball valve to seal the wastewater outlet pipe and chemical-resistant dosing pumps to dose ECA solutions into the U-bend and associated pipework. A Programmable Logic Controller was used to coordinate the sequence of operation of the actuator and dosing pumps. This U-bend had three cycles of five min catholyte followed by five min anolyte treatment a week for three months. Quantitative bacterial counts from treated and control U-bends were determined following each round of ECA treatment on blood agar (CBA), R 2 A, PAS and PA agars following automated treatment and on CBA and R 2 A following manual treatment. Bacterial identification was determined by comparing small ribosomal subunit rRNA gene sequences with consensus sequences for individual bacterial species in the EMBL/GenBank databases. Results: The average bacterial density from untreated U-bends throughout the study was > 1 x 105 CFU/swab on all media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for approximately 50 % of bacterial counts. Manual treatment of U-bends with ECAs reduced counts significantly (< 100 CFU/swab) (P < 0. 01 for CBA; P < 0. 005 for R 2 A). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was eliminated from the U-bend subjected to automated ECA-treatment, with average bacterial counts over 35 cycles on CBA, R 2 A, PAS and PA of 2. 1 (? 4. 5) (P< 0. 0001), 13. 1 (? 30. 1) (P< 0. 05), 0. 7 (2. 8) (P< 0. 001) and 0 (? 0) (P< 0. 05) CFU/swab, respectively. Following the three-month study period, the ECA-treated and control U-bends were removed and cut in cross-section and segments examined by electron microscopy, which revealed the virtual elimination of biofilm from the ECA-treated U-bend. In contrast, the control U-bend was heavily fouled with dense pigmented biofilm. Conclusion: Microbial contamination of washbasin U-bends can be consistently minimised by automated decontamination with ECA solutions. Future Developments: Work is in progress to develop a large-scale system for simultaneous automated decontamination of multiple washbasin U-bends...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the three}} {{commonly}} occurring phases (anatase, rutile, and brookite) of TiO 2, the anatase form {{is reported to}} be the best photocatalyst due to the improved charge-carrier mobility and the greater number of surface hydroxyl groups. The anatase to rutile transition in titania photocatalysts usually occurs at a temperature between 500 °C to 700 °C. Development of a high temperature stable (above 1000 °C) anatase phase is important for various environmental applications (e. g. self-cleaning <b>ceramic</b> tiles, anti-microbial <b>sanitary</b> wares, etc.). In this study, the use of ammonium hexafluorophosphate as a single source dopant (method A) and urea, trifluoroacetic acid and phosphoric acid as multiple sources (method B) was undertaken to improving its high temperature stability. Method A was seen to produce a more stable anatase phase, with 68 % anatase present at 1100 °C, compared to method B which showed 100 % rutile at 900 °C. Kinetic analysis shows a marked increase in the photocatalytic degradation of a model dye using materials calcined at 1100 °C for method A (0. 042 min- 1) compared to that for method B (0. 005 min- 1) and the commercial photocatalyst Evonik- Degussa AEROXIDE® (0. 031 min- 1) at 1100 °C. XPS results showed that, the only dopant detected at high temperatures is phosphorus in its P 5 + form. The incorporation of phosphorus has proved to be an effective method in stabilising the anatase phase at high temperature. The current investigation also showed that a single source precursor is more favourable to obtain high temperature stable anatase phase photocatalysts...|$|R
