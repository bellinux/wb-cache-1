5000|$|Wood County {{underwent}} a regular overhaul at Newport News, Virginia, from June to August, 1962 before she stood {{out to sea}} for trials and refresher training. The tank landing ship deployed to the Caribbean {{to take part in}} amphibious brigade exercises and then {{to become part of the}} [...] "Caribbean Ready Squadron." [...] In the autumn of 1962, after American aerial reconnaissance disclosed the presence of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba, President Kennedy insisted that the missiles be withdrawn and imposed a [...] "quarantine" [...] on <b>Cuba.</b> <b>Wood</b> County participated in that operation off the Cuban coast which ended after the Soviet Union removed the missiles.|$|E
25|$|July 17 - Siege of Santiago: Spanish General Toral {{offers the}} {{surrender}} of the 12,000 men at Santiago de Cuba, the 12,000 men at Guantánamo, and six other small Spanish Army garrisons throughout <b>Cuba.</b> Leonard <b>Wood,</b> promoted to Brigadier General, accepts the surrender and is named military governor of Santiago de Cuba.

50|$|Wood {{has been}} {{recognized}} for her exhibition the Continuous Garbage Project: 1998-2003, exhibited at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery and Catriona Jeffries Gallery. The project included photographs of transparent garbage bags taken {{over the course of}} five years. Through the exhibition Wood explored labour, craft, and photography, with photographs “reminiscent of Man Ray’s photographs of the ‘dust breeding.’” Wood has written articles for Border Crossings, including a review of Stan Douglas’ work entitled “Still Supplementation: Stan Douglas’s <b>Cuba</b> Photographs.” <b>Woods</b> is currently a professor at Western University in London, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|In 1898 she {{was sold}} to the United States Government, and renamed Sedgwick, serving as a U.S. Army {{transport}} ship during the Spanish-American War. In early March 1900, the Secretary of War Elihu Root sailed aboard the Sedgwick to Havana for discussions with the Military Governor of <b>Cuba,</b> General Leonard <b>Wood.</b>|$|R
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in 1898, he was assigned a brigade and was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in May of that year, and in July after the victory at El Caney, to major general of volunteers. From late 1898 to May 1900, he served as the chief of staff to the military governor of <b>Cuba,</b> General Leonard <b>Wood,</b> being promoted to colonel of regulars in May 1899. [...] He was a member of Society of the Army of Santiago, a military society for officers who had served in Cuba.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S. Senate, Senator Boies Penrose led the {{opposition}} to the Isle of Pines treaty on behalf of U.S. business interests, including some large investors and a friend who had built a large mansion. He claimed they had received assurances of U.S. sovereignty from the Military Governor of <b>Cuba</b> General Leonard <b>Wood.</b> When the United States Senate ratified only the lease treaty and failed to act on Isle of Pines treaty within the time the treaty allowed, Hay and de Quesada signed a second version addressing the status of Isle of Pines on March 2, 1904. It avoided specifying a time within which it needed to be ratified.|$|R
50|$|Woods studied {{architecture}} at the University of Illinois {{and engineering}} at Purdue University. While Woods called himself an architect he never received {{a degree in}} architecture nor was he ever licensed to practice architecture. He first worked {{in the offices of}} Eero Saarinen as a field representative on the Ford Foundation building designed by Saarinen in New York City. After leaving Saarinen's office he worked for a short period for the Champaign, Illinois firm of Richardson, Severns Scheeler & Associates. He also produced paintings for the Indianapolis Art Museum during that period. In 1976 he turned exclusively to theory and experimental projects. He was reported to have designed a light pavilion in Chengdu, China with Steven Holl and buildings in Havana, <b>Cuba.</b> In 1988, <b>Woods</b> co-founded the Research Institute for Experimental Architecture, a nonprofit institution devoted to the advancement of experimental architectural thought and practice while promoting the concept and perception of architecture itself.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, {{there were several}} serious {{barriers}} for foreign businesses attempting to operate in Cuba. Three separate pieces of legislation—the Joint Resolution of 1898, the Teller Amendment, and the Foraker Amendment—threatened foreign investment. The Joint Resolution of 1898 stated that the Cuban people are by right free and independent, while the Teller Amendment further declared that the United States could not annex Cuba. These two pieces of legislation were crucial in appeasing anti-imperialists as the United States intervened {{in the war in}} Cuba. Similarly, the Foraker Amendment, which prohibited the U.S. military government from granting concessions to American companies, was passed to appease anti-imperialists during the occupational period. Although these three statutes enabled the United States to gain a foothold in Cuba, they presented obstacles for American businesses to acquire land and permits. Eventually, Cornelius Van Horne of the Cuba Company, an early railroad company in Cuba, found a loophole in [...] "revocable permits" [...] justified by preexisting Spanish legislation that effectively allowed railroads to be built in <b>Cuba.</b> General Leonard <b>Wood,</b> the governor of Cuba and a noted annexationist, used this loophole to grant hundreds of franchises, permits, and other concessions to American businesses.|$|R
40|$|Many {{historians of}} the first American {{occupation}} of Cuba (1898 - 1902) assert that the military government of the island began and ended with a single strategic objective in mind: annexation. This assertion, however, ignores critical aspects {{of the first}} year of American operations under the direction of Major General Brooke that pursued more limited goals. To fill this historical void, this thesis examines two questions about the American Army of Occupation in Cuba. First, was the occupation government of Major General Brooke pursuing a strategy designed to lead to annexation? Second, how did the U. S. military government in Cuba exercise power in pursuit of Brooke?s strategic vision? This thesis combines traditional sources like the manuscript collections of James H. Wilson, Leonard Wood, Elihu Root, and William McKinley found in the Library of Congress in Washington D. C. as well previously unexamined reports and correspondence of individual post and garrison commanders found in Record Group 395 in the National Archives in Washington D. C. to answer these questions. The American Army of Occupation pursued political stability during its first year, not annexation. Brooke and his subordinates practiced cooperation with, not control of, Cuban leaders and institutions. Furthermore, the direction of American policy was not always a top-down process. Commanders at the post and district levels innovated solutions to problems that the central administration in Havana, while slow to recognize, eventually adopted as their own. By December of 1899, when Brooke turned over command to General <b>Wood,</b> <b>Cuba</b> possessed a functioning civil government at both the national and local level...|$|R
