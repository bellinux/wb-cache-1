25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a <b>chain,</b> <b>belt,</b> or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E

The first API separator was installed in 1933 at the Atlantic Refining Company (ARCO) refinery in Philadelphia. Since that time, virtually all of the refineries worldwide have installed API separators as a first primary stage of their oily wastewater treatment plants. The majority of those refineries installed the API separators using the original design based on the specific gravity difference between oil and water. However, many refineries now use plastic parallel plate packing to enhance the gravity separation.|$|E
50|$|Camshafts must actuate {{the valves}} at the {{appropriate}} time in the combustion cycle. In order to accomplish this the camshaft is linked to and kept in synchronisation with the crankshaft (the main shaft upon which the pistons act) {{through the use of a}} metal <b>chain,</b> rubber <b>belt,</b> or geartrain. Because these mechanisms are essential to the proper timing of valve actuation they are named timing <b>chains,</b> timing <b>belts,</b> and timing gears, respectively.|$|R
