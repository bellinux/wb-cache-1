5|$|As well as {{causing the}} {{destruction}} of lands, foods and belongings, fire <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to divert manpower. 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass fires and fire settlements as diversions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, David Stirling, {{an injured}} British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre, {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} small airborne special forces units to operate behind enemy lines.

5|$|In New Zealand, Maori {{have raised}} the martial art {{associated}} with the taiaha and mere {{to the level of}} a weapon dance.

5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal heating, {{the interior of}} Europa <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends.

50|$|War or Combat dances imitate combat, or help {{train the}} warrior. It {{could be argued}} that men from the zurkhaneh (a {{traditional}} Persian style gymnasium) called the “House of Strength” and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> seen as a martial art.|$|R

5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors.

5000|$|This <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{seen as a}} {{reference}} to the conflicted relationship between Tony and Christopher. During this episode, Christopher expresses his frustration with Tony's application of Omertà which he perceives to be [...] "hypocritical" [...] after Tony denies him the approval to kill Jackie Jr. even though Jackie shot Furio, a made man.|$|R

5|$|The {{order of}} a liquid crystal <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{characterized}} by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages {{are more difficult to}} measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.|$|E
5|$|The transit circle {{was capable}} of {{determining}} both right ascension and declination of a star, unlike the more simple and common transit instrument that can only determine the right ascension. Such an instrument <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to set the Observatory’s clocks by observing standard stars whose position was precisely known.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure.

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{the above}} metals are very {{abundant}} in nature in soils compared to trace elements. Therefore, their variation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> large from lands to lands. The use of fertilizers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> {{a source for}} these metals.|$|R
