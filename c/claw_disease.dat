40|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} is a {{very painful}} multifactorial <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> which can cause major economic loss and welfare problems. Therefore, it is of great importance there are treatments available which are low in costs and high in efficacy. In view of the resistance to antibiotics and any residues in milk or meat, non-antibiotic treatment is preferred. In this article a clinical trial is described {{with the aim of}} testing non-antibiotic spray to cure bovine digital dermatitis lesions. The trial is preformed at seven Dutch dairy farms between October and December 2013. Repiderma-spray® (Copper, zinc, aloe vera, alcohol, IntraCare BV, Netherlands) was used as non-antibiotic spray and chlortetracycline-spray, CTC® (chlorinetetracyclinehydrochloride®, Eurovet Animal Health BV, Netherlands), which is officially registered, as positive control. Claws were alternately treated with Repiderma® or CTC® following the manufacturer’s protocol and photographed and scored at day 0 and day 10. If there was no longer an M 2 lesion at day 10, the claw was defined cured. The average cure rate of claws treated with Repiderma®-spray at day 10 was 89. 15...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands is a densely {{populated}} country with an ever-increasing urbanisation. That {{is why it}} is important to preserve the natural values of the remaining rural area {{and at the same time}} create recreational areas for the urban population and regional and national infrastructure. The Dutch government is able to create a multipurpose rural area by applying an active land development program. The Land Consolidation Act is the legal basis of this program. All kinds of problems in the rural area can be solved by land consolidation. Recent examples are the reallocation in a rural area because of a new high speed railroad, the reorganisation of farms as a result of farming diseases like BSE and foot and <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> and the allocation of water basins to prevent floodings. A special division of the Dutch Cadastre takes part in land consolidation projects, mainly by designing reallocation plans. Such a plan must contribute to the realisation of the public goals in a project like railroad construction etcetera. Within these public constraints the reallocation plan must lead to a fair distribution of parcels among the private land users...|$|E
40|$|Symmetrical onychomadesis (SO), {{also called}} {{symmetrical}} lupoid onychodystrophy, is a severe <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> frequently {{seen in the}} Gordon Setter (GS) and English Setter (ES). Affected dogs will initially show sudden onset of lameness and licking of paws, progressing during some months to sloughing of all claws. The disease is painful and affects the dog’s quality of life. Hypothyroidism (HT) {{is one of the}} most common endocrine diseases reported in dogs. In most cases, the disease is considered to be the result of an autoimmune attack of the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones are involved in several energy demanding processes in the body and subnormal hormone levels in dogs may cause a variety of clinical signs such as dullness, weight gain, lethargy, and skin changes. Both SO and HT are suspected to be complex diseases where several genes and environmental factors affect disease development. Epidemiologic studies of the two diseases in GS and ES could reveal triggering factors for disease development. The main aims of this thesis were to describe epidemiology, clinical pathology, treatment, prognosis and genetic risk factors for SO and HT in the GS and ES. Additionally, we wanted to investigate whether there were any clinical or genetic associations between SO and HT...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of surgical diseases of 2081 cattle was studied from different free-ranging (Bathan) and stall-feeding systems. The overall {{prevalence of}} surgical disease of cattle was higher (53. 2 %) in Bathan {{than in the}} stall-feeding (37. 5 %) system. In Bathan, the most prevalent surgical diseases were myiasis (13. 4 %) followed by navel ill (12. 5 %), trauma (10. 8 %), <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> (7. 6 %), arthritis (6. 1 %), horn diseases (3. 4 %) and teat obstruction (2. 6 %).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of claw disorders on claw formation, production and reproduction performance of Holstein and Slovak Simmental dairy cows. Claw formation after functional trimming was evaluated by measurement of claw angle, claw length, heel index, claw height, diagonal and claw width. Incidence of interdigital dermatitis and heel erosion, digital dermatitis were observed. Separately was observed the incidence of sole ulcers with the progress of diseases. Measurements were carried out in spring and in autumn. Holstein dairy cows (n = 101) with production 11874. 77 kg of milk, 3. 94 % of fat and 3. 34 % of protein and Slovak Simmental cows (n = 101) with production 5834. 25 kg of milk, 4. 44 % of fat and 3. 59 % of protein were included into study.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{management}} {{and environmental factors}} are known as contributory causes of clinical mastitis in dairy herd. The study objectives were to describe the structure of herd-specific mastitis {{management and}} environmental factors and to assess the relevance of these herd-specific indicators to mastitis incidence rate. Methods Disease reports from the Danish Cattle Data Base and a management questionnaire from 2, 146 herds in three Danish regions were analyzed to identify and characterize risk factors of clinical mastitis. A total of 94 (18 continuous and 76 discrete) management and production variables were screened in separate bivariate regression models. Variables associated with mastitis incidence rate at a p-value Results Three latent factors (quality of labor, region of Denmark and claw trimming, and quality of outdoor holding area) were identified from 14 variables. Daily milk production per cow, <b>claw</b> <b>disease,</b> quality of labor and region of Denmark {{were found to be}} significantly associated with mastitis incidence rate. A common multiple regression analysis with backward and forward selection procedures indicated there were 9 herd-specific risk factors. Conclusion Though risk factors ascertained by farmer-completed surveys explained {{a small percentage of the}} among-herd variability in crude herd-specific mastitis rates, the study suggested that farmer attitudes toward mastitis and lameness treatment were important determinants for mastitis incidence rate. Our factor analysis identified one significant latent factor, which was related to labor quality on the farm. </p...|$|E
40|$|Foot rot is {{a severe}} <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> which occurs among {{sheep and goats}} {{in most parts of}} the world, with {{outbreaks}} in hot and humid weather. It is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Dichelobacter nodosus in association with Fusobacterium necrophorum. Foot rot has a negative impact on both animal welfare and economy. This thesis presents how Australia, Nepal, Norway, Switzerland, Great Britain, Sweden and Uruguay handle foot rot. In the selection of countries the focus was on countries that have control- or eradication programs against foot rot. There are differences in the climate, animal husbandry practices, animal welfare and economic resources in the countries that are presented. This means countries have different conditions in which to conduct control- or eradication programs. Australia, Nepal, Switzerland and Uruguay have or have had some form of control- or eradication program. Norway and Sweden carry out sanitation on the herd level, but aims to develop a control- or eradication program. Great Britain is an example of how serious the consequences become, if the sheep industry does not take foot rot very seriously. Control and eradication of foot rot is carried out by various combinations of treatment and preventive measures such as footbaths, general antibiotic therapy, foot-paring, vaccinations, culling chronically infected individuals, moving to new pastures and new bedding, purchase of stock from herds free from foot rot and quarantine...|$|E
40|$|Digital Dermatitis (DD) is an {{infectious}} <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> of cattle, reported {{as having a}} high prevalence in several countries. Currently, some different types of topical treatments {{are available on the}} market, but not all as effective. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of DD before and after intensive use of the topical treatments with four different products for DD in the milking parlor on 10 farms in Alberta, Canada. Subsequently, the effect of the treatments was determined on the distribution of each M-stage on every of the 10 farms. To achieve this all the hind feet were scored weekly in the milking parlor. In the first week if a DD lesion was present it was randomly assigned to one of the four different topical treatments: HealMaxTM, Hoof-Sol, negative control (saline with green food coloring), and positive control (oxytetracycline spray). All lesions were examined for 8 weeks, and if not cured re-treated with the same treatment as in the first week. There was no difference in overall DD prevalence after eight weeks of topical treatments over the 10 farms (P= 0. 13). However, the prevalence of chronic lesions (M 4) increased on every farm, whereas the prevalence of active lesions (M 2 and M 4. 1) decreased (P< 0. 05). Eight weeks of topical treatments under field conditions did decrease the prevalence of active lesions in a herd, but did not decrease the overall DD prevalence on a farm...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate claw health in four dairy herds (sizes between 50 and 150 cows) in the north-west of Lower Saxony (Germany) over a period of one year following the introduction of functional claw trimming. Additional to parameters suitable for evaluation of the claw health status (prevalence of <b>claw</b> <b>diseases,</b> severity of lameness), distinct risk indikators concerning the individual animal, the herd and the environment were examined using a modified protocol developed by Nordlund et al. (2004). To this end, the <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> that were diagnosed at claw trimming on three different occasions were assigned to, either the complex “infectious diseases”, “laminitis-associated diseases” or “miscellaneous diseases”. Initially, the suitability of the environment was evaluated by using a system to quantify cow-comfort, the Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200. Lameness scores were documented in two-week intervals as well as the following risk indicators: Stall Standing Index (SSI), standing time during milking, cud chewing activity, scoring of rumen fill, Body Condition Scoring (BCS). Milkfat-to protein ratio was calculated from the data obtained from the monthly milk recordings. On all four farms the results with respect to the selected risk indicators differed, partially considerably, from the guidelines given in literature. The proportion of lame cows and the severity of lameness as observed in the beginning of the study justified the assignment of the included herds to “herds with a serious lameness problem”. The Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200 differed from the guidelines as well as the daily standing time (SSI, standing time at milking) and the rumination activity. With respect to the TGI 200, the main deficits were found in the space allowance and the cubicle comfort, factors that were shown to lead to increased standing times. On all four farms the findings concerning the development of BCS and milk production data did correspond with the nominal values. The introduction of functional claw trimming on all four farms led to a partially significant decrease in the number of cows affected by severe lameness (grade 3 and 4), indicating the benefit of the latter procedure for animal welfare. The prevalence of <b>claw</b> <b>diseases,</b> however, did not change. Improvement of environment on these farms should aim at increasing the room for movement and the cubicle comfort. It is likely that improving cow-comfort in such way that standing times decrease would have a positive effect on claw health by increasing blood circulation in the distal limb. Special attention should be drawed to the heifer management, especially the introduction of highly-pregnant animals into the herd. On the four farms risk indicators which were reported to be related to the ocurrence of claw disorders before differed to a large extent from the given guidelines. This fact demonstrates that these parameters should be taken into consideration for the approach of claw health disorders on dairy farms. However, further research is necessary to develop and improve the employed methods and to establish a suitable system for monotoring claw health which can be used in practice by farmer, clawtrimmer and veterinarian in cooperation. To get generally accepted results the methods have to be tested in case control studies or on farms were the effect of different housing systems can be studied at the same time. The different scoring methods are time-consuming and still do not find the farmers` appreciation. Thus, there is need for further research on the use of innovative measurement technologies and data analysis that aim at automation of the monitoring procedures (e. g. gait analysis by pattern recognition) ...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{were taken}} in the {{metacarpal}} and metatarsal bones in 42 calves and 10 dairy cows post-mortem {{to determine whether there}} are anatomical differences in bone length. Manual and digital measurements of various bone length parameters were taken. There was {{a significant difference in the}} mean length of the condyles of the metacarpal and the metatarsal bones in calves and cows, the lateral condyle being longer than the medial. In all but one metatarsal bone (98. 8 %), the lateral condyle was longer than the medial. In the metacarpal bones, the lateral condyle was longer in only 52. 4 % of the bones, in 21. 2 %, they had the same length and in 27. 4 % the medial condyle was longer. These intrinsic anatomical differences can help distinguish between the left and right metacarpal and metatarsal bones, for instance, in anatomical and archaeological studies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{pharmacokinetics}} of tetracycline in plasma, synovial fluid, and milk following either a single systemic intravenous (i. v.) injection or a single i. v. regional antibiosis (IVRA) administration of tetracycline hydrochloride to dairy cattle with papillomatous digital dermatitis (PDD). To this end, plasma and synovial fluid tetracycline concentrations were compared with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the major bacteria, which are known to cause digital diseases and thus assess its efficacy in PDD. Residual tetracycline concentrations in milk from cows treated by both methods were also determined. Twelve Holstein cows with various stages of PDD were randomly assigned to two groups of six animals. Group 1 received a single systemic i. v. injection of 10 mg/kg of tetracycline hydrochloride. Group 2 received 1000 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride by IVRA of the affected limb. Blood, synovial fluid and milk samples were taken prior to tetracycline administration (time 0 control), and then at 22, 45 and 82 min, and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h following drug administration. Tetracycline concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Mean tetracycline plasma and milk concentrations in Group 1 were higher than Group 2. The opposite was observed for synovial fluid concentrations. Group 2 synovial fluid concentrations were higher than the MIC value over 24 h for the bacteria most frequently responsible for <b>claw</b> <b>disease.</b> Compared with i. v. administration, IVRA administration of tetracycline produced very high synovial fluid and low plasma and milk concentrations.

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of claw diseases requires detailed examination by use of diagnostic techniques, especially when they become complicated and spread the infection to the internal structures of the digits. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the morphological features of the digits of lame cattle, classifying and quantifying theoccurrence of macroscopic and histopathological changes, and to establish correlations between macroscopymicroscopy, macroscopy-lameness and lamenessmicroscopy variables. A total of 18 crossbred, male cattle were used. The animals, managed in intensive systemduring 112 days, were divided into three groups: (GI) lameness score 2, (GII) lameness score 3, and (GIII) lameness score 4, resulting in 72 evaluated distal limbs. Clinical and histopathological examinations were carried out at the ends of the limbs, and dorsal and palmar/plantar regions were sampled to perform the histopathological test, totaling 144 samples. Out of studied 18 animals, 15 (83. 3 %) showed the association of macroscopic and microscopic lesions, being six animals from GIII, four from GII and five from GI. The heel erosion was found in 16. 6 % of the left forelimbs, being the only macroscopic lesion in this limb. Dermismicroscopic evaluation revealed absence of lesions in 68. 7 % of samples and mononuclear cell infiltration in 31. 3 %. The multifocal mononuclear cell infiltrate was predominant (43. 1 %) compared to the diffuse (15. 2 %) and focal (4. 2 %) infiltration. Three types of focalinflammatory infiltrates were light and 11 were diffuse and severe. In conclusion, locomotion score, associated with the characterization of lesions and the histopathology examination supported the diagnosis of lameness showing a relationship between lameness, macroscopic lesions and histopathological changes; however, it was not possible torelate types of microscopic lesions to the different manifestations of <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> in the studied animals...|$|E
40|$|Digital Dermatitis (DD) is a <b>claw</b> <b>disease</b> mainly {{affecting}} the hind feet of dairy cattle. Digital Dermatitis is an infectious disease, transmitted via the environment, where the infectious "agent" {{is a combination}} of bacteria. The standardized classification for DD lesions developed by Döpfer et al. (1997) and extended by Berry et al. (2012) has six distinct classes: healthy (M 0), an active granulomatous area of 0 - 2 cm (M 1), an ulcerative lesion of > 2 cm (M 2), an ulcerative lesion covered by a scab (M 3), alteration of the skin (M 4), and a combination of M 4 and M 1 (M 4. 1). We hypothesize that classes M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4, and M 4. 1 are the potentially infectious classes that can contribute to the basic reproduction ratio (R 0), the average number of new infections caused by a typical infected individual. Here, we determine differences in infectivity between the classes, the sojourn time in each of the classes, and the contribution of each class to R 0. The analysis is based on data from twelve farms in the Netherlands that were visited every two weeks, eleven times. We found that 93. 89 % of the transitions from M 0 was observed as a transition to class M 4, and feet with another class-at-infection rapidly transitioned to class M 4. As a consequence, about 70 % of the infectious time was spent in class M 4. Transmission rate parameters of class-at-infection M 1, M 2, M 3, and M 4 were not significantly different from each other, but differed from class-at-infection M 4. 1. However, due to the relative large amount of time spend in class M 4, regardless of the class-at-infection, R 0 was almost completely determined by this class. The R 0 was 2. 36, to which class-at-infection M 4 alone contributed 88. 5 %. Thus, M 4 lesions should be prevented to lower R 0 to a value below one, while painful M 2 lesions should be prevented for animal welfare reasons...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} pattern of pressure over the bovine claw was investigated {{to test the}} hypothesis that the ground reaction force is unevenly distributed and makes some regions of the claw more prone to overloading and injury than others. In eight recently trimmed Holstein Friesian cows, the distribution of vertical pressure was measured during square standing with a spatial resolution of 2. 6 sensors/cm 2 and a temporal resolution of 313 measurements/s. In each animal, the localization of maximum pressure per foot and per claw was determined during five trials. In the front limb, maximum pressures were normally found on the medial claw; in the hindlimb they were located on the lateral claw. In both claws, the highest pressures were found on the sole of the foot and not on the wall. In the front limbs, maximum pressures were located in the posterior portion of the sole; in the hind limb in the anterior portion. There was no difference in the location of the maximum pressure between the medial and lateral claw in either limb. The regions in which these maximum pressures occur are known to be relatively susceptible to injuries. This could indicate a causal relation between the location of pressure concentrations and <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> found in clinical observations...|$|R

Body condition score (BCS), causes of lameness and milk yield were collected from a 600 -cow herd over 44 -months. Mixed effect binomial models and a continuous outcome model were used to investigate the associations between lameness, BCS and milk yield. In total, 14, 320 risk periods were obtained from 1137 cows. There were 1510 lameness treatments: the most common causes of lameness were sole ulcer (SU) (39 %), sole haemorrhage (SH) (13 %), digital dermatitis (DD) (10 %) and white line disease (WLD) (8 %). These varied by year and year quarter. Body condition was scored at 60 -day intervals. BCS ranged from 1 to 5 {{with a mean of}} 2. 5, scores were higher in very early lactation but varied widely throughout lactation; approximately 45 % of scores were 2 – 4 months for all causes of lameness and also specifically for SU/WLD lameness. BCS 2 – 4 months. There was no such association with DD. All lameness, SU/WLD, SH and DD {{were significantly more likely to}} occur in cows that had been lame previously, but the effect of BCS was present even when all repeat cases of lameness were excluded from the analysis. Milk yield was significantly higher and fell in the month before treatment in cows lame with SU/WLD but it was not significantly higher for cows that were treated for DD compared with non-lame cows. These findings support the hypothesis that low BCS contributes to the development of horn related claw lameness but not infectious <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> in dairy cows. One link between low BCS and lameness is a thin digital cushion which has been proposed as a trigger for <b>claw</b> horn <b>disease.</b> Cows with BCS 2 produced more milk than cows with BCS 2. 5, however, this was only approximately 100 kg difference in yield over a 305 -day lactation.

The associations were studied using the χ 2 test. Data on 2197 lactations of 1074 cows originated from 10 commercial herds participating for 2 to 5 years (from 1990 to 1996) in the programme. The herds had 48 dairy cows on average, milk yield of 8137 kg and mean parity of 2. 9. We tested eight clinically identifiable health disorder complexes reaching the following lactational incidence risks: parturient paresis (7. 0 %), retained placenta (8. 9 %), displaced abomasum (1. 1 %), metritis (23. 6 %), clinical ketosis (1. 7 %), clinical mastitis (21. 6 %), ovarian cysts (11. 7 %) and <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> (19. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract Digital {{dermatitis}} (DD) is a {{contagious disease}} of cattle affecting the skin {{adjacent to the}} <b>claws.</b> <b>Disease</b> dynamics of DD have been described to some extend, but {{we still need to}} quantify the duration of lesions and look into non-treatment factors affecting this. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the duration of lesions due to DD and to evaluate parity and lactation stage as potential risk factors for longer duration of such lesions. An estimate of the duration of lesions will be a valuable parameter in the evaluation of the economic impact of the disease and will additionally allow estimates of incidence based on prevalence figures. From May 2007 until November 2008, lesions associated with DD in the hind legs of 151 Danish Holstein cows at the Danish Cattle Research Centre were clinically scored on fifteen occasions. The mean interval between recordings was 39 days. Onset and end of each new case were estimated as midway between recordings prior to a change in the presence or absence of a lesion. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed to estimate the duration and analyse differences in the duration of lesions between primi- and multiparous cows and between different stages in lactation at onset of the lesion. The median duration of lesions were estimated to be 42 days, less than most previous published estimates. The relatively aggressive regime of topical treatment in the study herd might have shortened the duration of the lesions. Furthermore the comparatively long interval between recordings introduced an element of uncertainty in this estimate. No significant effects of parity or days in milk at lesion onset on the duration of DD were found using these data though lesions developed earlier in the lactation may have a longer duration. Further data would be needed to confirm the latter. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{dairy cattle}} {{breeding}}, breeding goals (BG) are developed and subsequently a selection index that farmers want to use. Therefore {{it is important}} to take their preferences for BG traits into account. Two production systems that are expected to influence farmer preferences for BG traits are organic and conventional systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize preferences of organic and conventional Danish dairy farmers for improvements in BG traits for Holstein cattle. A survey was established to characterize preferences for improvements in ten traits, by means of pairwise rankings using the online software 1000 Minds. These pairwise rankings were based on equal economic worth of trait improvements. The survey was filled in by 106 organic and 290 conventional farmers. The most preferred trait improvement for both production systems was in cow fertility, and the least preferred improvement was in calving difficulty. Organic farmers ranked milk production and feed efficiency higher than conventional farmers. The reason for this may be that the average milk yield is lower and the milk price is higher in organic herds compared to conventional herds. Organic farmers also ranked calf mortality higher. Conventional farmers ranked mastitis, leg and <b>claw</b> <b>diseases,</b> other diseases and cow mortality higher compared to organic farmers. By means of a cluster analysis distinct clusters of farmers were identified and named according to the trait improvements that were the most preferred per cluster. The cluster analysis for organic farmers identified two production-based clusters ('Production & Fertility' and 'Production & Mastitis') and one robustness-based cluster, whereas a cluster analysis for conventional farmers found one production-based cluster, one health-based cluster and one survival-based cluster. This study shows that organic and conventional farmers differ in their preferences for improvements in BG traits, and the results can be used to set up specific breeding goals for organic and conventional farming systems...|$|R
40|$|Claw lesions are an {{important}} reason for compromised dairy cow welfare, culling and financial losses. Farmers are not always aware of the prevalence and impact of claw problems on their dairy. This study investigated whether Flemish farmers could estimate the prevalence of claw lesions in their dairy. Therefore, all Flemish dairy farmers were invited to complete an online survey involving the management and housing practices they apply. They were asked to estimate the prevalence of interdigital dermatitis (ID), digital dermatitis (DD), sole haemorrhages (SoH), white line disease (WLD), sole ulcer (SU), interdigital phlegmon (IP), swollen heels (SH) and footrot (FR) among their lactating animals. Forty dairies (17. 6 % of 227 complete surveys) were selected to be visited to assess claw health on their farm. Selection of farms was based on access to pasture, number of lactating cows, herd production level and estimate of ID and DD. These 40 dairies are representative for all respondents of the survey. Between 13 and 40 animals per farm were examined. Selection was based on parity, lactation stage and milk production corrected for age, calving season and lactation stage. ID was scored according to Berry et al. (Vet. J. 193 (3), 2012). Other lesions were scored on a 4 -point scale. Mobility, body condition, leg condition, hygiene, claw hook and length were determined. About 31. 7 (14. 2) % of the examined animals per farm were clinically lame, but percentages varied between 0 and 66. 7 %. ID (heel horn erosion), DD and SoH were the most common <b>claw</b> <b>diseases,</b> with respectively 55. 0 %, 27. 9 % and 31. 8 % of the animals affected. Farmers could best estimate the presence of FR, WLD and SU, but underestimated ID, SoH and DD strongly. thus farmers could estimate the obviously visible lesions, but had difficulties estimating lesions for which detailed inspection of the claw was necessary. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 160 dairy cows with {{no signs of}} {{systemic}} disease that were treated for an uncomplicated claw lesion with exposed corium were included in this study. The clinical findings of the orthopedic examination were compared with the biochemical profile. The cows {{with a mean age}} of 7. 4 ± 2. 6 years had an average milk yield of 6188 ± 1174 litres (data from previous lactation). Cows with the same or a higher milk yield than the herd average were over-represented (72 %). Almost half (45 %) of the cows were in the second half of their lactation when examined (5. 9 ± 4. 1 months). A total of 236 lesions were recorded. Twelve (7. 5 %) of the 160 cows had 3 or more lesions, 49 (30. 6 %) cows 2 lesions and 99 (61. 9 %) cows one lesion. The most common localisation of ulceration were at the outer hind claw at the typical site in the sole (62 %) and in the wall (17 %). The alterations of the exposed corium were either classified as slight (63 %), moderate (22 %) or severe (15 %). Changes attributed to laminitis were observed in two thirds of all animals (subclinical 36 %; clinical 30 %). The concentration of glucose, cholesterin, LDH and urea was increased in one third of the animals. Phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were lower than the reference values in 43 %, and 23 % of the animals, respectively. Cows with a history of former claw lesions in a previous lactation, with laminitis, with more than one moderate to severe claw lesions and cows with acute lesions had higher urea concentrations than the respective control group. Blood levels for AST, bilirubin, creatin-kinase were higher and iron lower, respectively, in cows with moderate to severe claw lesions than in cows with mild lesions in only one claw. The fact that cows with more than one chronic claw lesion had a higher incidence of alterations in the blood chemical profile than cows with mild claw lesions in only one claw indicates that severe <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> occur concurrently with metabolic disorders or vice vers...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{compared the}} effects of sand and straw bedding in free stalls on resting time, cleanliness, hock injuries, and hoof health of dairy cows and tested whether cow preferences for a bedding material depended on the familiarity with the material. A total of 52 dairy cows were kept either on straw bedded concrete stalls or sand stalls for at least 21 wk. The lying behavior was observed, and hock lesions, hoof health, and cleanliness of the cows and stalls were measured. A 5 -d preference test between sand and straw stalls was conducted {{at the end of}} the experiment. The total daily duration of lying was longer for cows on straw bedding than on sand bedding (straw 749 +/- 16 vs. sand 678 +/- 19 min). During the preference test, cows that had been kept on straw bedding preferred lying in straw stalls [straw 218. 7 (133. 4 to 239. 7) vs. sand 9. 0 min (2. 8 to 44. 8) ]; however, cows that had been kept on sand showed no preference [straw 101. 3 (51. 7 to 205. 9) vs. sand 94. 3 min (54. 1 to 156. 1, median and interquartile range) ]. Although there were no differences in the dirtiness of stalls, the cows using straw stalls were dirtier than cows using sand stalls [straw 6. 04 (5. 39 to 6. 28) vs. sand 4. 19 (3. 62 to 5. 16) ]. At the end of experiment the severity of hock lesions was lower for cows on sand than for cows on straw [sand 0. 5 (0. 0 to 1. 0) vs. straw 1. 0 (1. 0 to 2. 0) ]. The improvement in overall hoof health over the observation period was greater for cows kept on sand compared with cows kept on straw [sand - 2. 00 (- 3. 75 to - 0. 25) vs. straw 0. 00 (- 2. 00 to 2. 00) ]. Straw bedding increased the time that cows spend lying, and cows preferred straw stalls to sand stalls. However, previous experience with sand reduces avoidance of sand stalls. Sand stalls were advantageous for cow cleanliness and health; hock lesions and <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> healed more quickly for cows using sand stalls compared with straw. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this cross-sectional study was to reevaluate the prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD) and associated risk factors in The Netherlands. Between May 2002 and December 2003, information about {{the presence or absence}} of DD lesions and other claw disorders on the hind claws of dairy cows in The Netherlands was collected by 20 hoof trimmers during trimming of all dairy cows in 383 herds. A questionnaire was used to acquire information regarding management and housing. Additional information, such as parity, breed, and stage of lactation of the cows, was provided by the Dutch Herd Book Organization. Digital dermatitis was present in 21. 2 % (SE = 0. 3) of the study population (n = 22, 454 cows). The herd prevalence varied from 0 % (9. 1 % of the herds) to 83. 0 %. Most common was herd prevalence between 5 and 10 %. The Holstein-Friesian breed was at higher risk for DD [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 7] than was the Meuse Rhine IJssel breed (dual purpose breed). The risk for DD decreased with increasing parity. Cows at the peak of their lactation (30 to 60 d in milk) and in the third parity had higher odds for DD in comparison with cows that were later than 60 DIM. The presence of other claw disorders, such as interdigital dermatitis/heel horn erosion (IDHE), interdigital hyperplasia (HYP), and interdigital phlegmon, appeared to be predisposing for DD. Based on estimation of the population-attributable fraction, it was concluded that if IDHE, HYP, and interdigital phlegmon were not present among the study population, respectively, 32. 2, 9. 0, and 1. 1 % of the DD cases could have been prevented. The risk for DD slightly decreased when cows affected by IDHE had access to pasture. Because of the interrelation between infectious claw disorders, an effective intervention strategy against DD should focus on an integrated approach to the control of all infectious <b>claw</b> <b>diseases.</b> Cows trimmed > 12 mo before the study (during regular trimming of the entire herd) were at lower risk for DD than were cows that were trimmed at shorter intervals. Animals that had > 8 h of access to pasture were at higher risk for DD (OR = 1. 6) compared with no access to pasture. Finally, cows in small-sized herds...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{milk yield}} is mostly {{considered}} {{as a reason for}} increasing problems in animal health. Especially breeding for high yield is subject to criticism. However, the heritability of most diseases is low making management and feeding more important. Organic farming regulations considerably limit management aspects including ratio of concentrates in the feeding ration, as well as allowable feedstuffs and medication. These restrictions limit feeding according to dairy cow requirement and might increase the risk for development of diseases. The regulations of the National Organic Programme (NOP) in North America are mainly characterised by the total ban of antibiotics. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of genetics on health and clinical laboratory parameters in an organic dairy herd. Between October 2007 and October 2008 blood and urine samples were collected and backfat thickness was measured weekly from peripartal cows in an organically managed dairy herd (EU Directive, Biopark, NOP). Additionally information regarding milk yield, reproduction, diseases and feeding was recorded. According to their pedigree and current predicted transmitting ability the animals were divided in groups of cows with low, medium and high genetic merit and the measured parameters were compared between those groups. The mean herd milk yield was 7576 kg with a protein and fat content of 3. 94 % and 3. 15 % respectively. The reproductive performance was comparable to conventionally managed herds. Udder and <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> were the main health problems. Metabolic diseases were less important. The analyses of the feeding ration indicated a lack of crude protein supply which was reflected in the low urea concentration in blood and milk and in the low milk protein content. Due to the results of clinical laboratory parameters no higher susceptibility to diseases in organic herds could be assumed. Cows with high genetic merit for milk yield produced on average about 1991 kg more milk over 305 days than cows with a low genetic merit. Coincidentally, the calving interval was prolonged, however the number of inseminations was not increased. However, there was no negative effect of a high genetic merit on health or adaptability of metabolism. It was demonstrated in an organic herd that under adequate farming conditions there is no indication for an elevated susceptibility for diseases or instability of metabolism in cows with a high genetic merit for milk yield. Cows with a high genetic potential for milk yield show an economically relevant increase in milk yield. Coincidentally the time to conception was delayed but without impaired overall reproductive performance. A high potential for milk yield is not inevitably associated with a high susceptibility for diseases...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years, dairy cow {{breeding}} {{has led to}} very high yielding cows (more than doubled average annual milk yields in most dairying countries), but also to a deterioration in cow health, fertility and longevity (Pryce et al. (1999)). Consequently, many breeding organizations {{all over the world}} are seeking to include functional traits in their breeding programmes (Groen et al. (1997), Christensen et al. (1998)). A great amount of research is done on potential index traits for indirect selection for health traits (Groen et al. (1997)). The whole constitution of the animals is to some extent considered in Scandinavian breeding programmes using the epidemiological data of all herd book animals (Philipsson et al. (2000)) and in breeding for life time dairy performance (Haiger (2000)). Our working hypothesis is that animal constitution has to do with the intensity of their species-specific character and expression. We propose to develop an evaluation model by comparing the vertebrates’ early embryonic states and their embryonic development: All vertebrates exhibit quite similar early embryonic states. Species-specific differentiation appears during later embryonic development. The specialization of the organ systems occurs with different intensities for each species resulting in different “morphologic valencies” (Portmann (1983)). The “morphologic valency” derives from the degree of differentiation of the organs (Portmann (1983)). It is possible to group the organ systems in a metabolic-limb-system, a rhythmic system (blood circulation and respiration) and a nerve-senses-system (after Schad (1971) and Steiner (1917)). Most animal species develop one of those three organ systems to a great extent. Ruminants develop highly specialized limbs and a highly differentiated digestion system: their four stomachs and their intestinal organs are more complex than those of all other mammals. Their life is dominated by these organs: dairy cows spend at least two thirds of a day eating and ruminating. Animal welfare is strongly influenced by the state of health of those specialized organs. Many cow diseases correlate with imbalances in the digestion system (Lotthammer (1992), Spranger (1998)). To assess animal constitution we propose giving special attention to physiology and behaviour with respect to these highly specialized organs and to the corresponding temperament (most animals with a highly specialized digestion and metabolic system tend to have a calm disposition (Marek et al. (1956)). We are thus looking for links between health, ruminating behaviour, metabolic and digestion parameters and temperament of dairy cows. Such observations need to be done under appropriate animal husbandry conditions. 60 dairy cows on a biodynamic farm in Switzerland were observed in terms of ruminating behaviour (ruminating time per day and per ruminating period, frequency of ruminating periods per day, jaw movements per bolus, chewing time per bolus, ruminating speed), body condition score (BCS after Ferguson et al. (1994)), manure consistency and temperament (nervousness / calmness while being brushed by an unknown person). Most methods for these observations had to be developed (Schneider (2002)). The records thus gained were correlated to the health parameters of the same cows (disease incidence, somatic cell score; methods for this were developed by Silvia Ivemeyer). The cows exhibited individual differences in all parameters. Multiparous cows chewed less and slower than primiparous cows. High yielding multiparous cows chewed less than lower yielding multiparous cows. Chewing time per bolus correlated negatively with mastitis incidence. Nervous cows exhibited higher somatic cell scores and a tendency to higher disease incidences than calm cows. Standard deviations in BCS correlated with metabolic <b>diseases,</b> <b>claw</b> <b>diseases</b> and reproduction problems. Evaluations are ongoing...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of ecological husbandry grows for some years. Nowadays 4 % of all farms in Germany are running under ecological managing. The milk production has a substantial {{meaning in the}} income of ecological farms. EU-regulations for ecological production are valid on all farms under ecological management in Europe since 1999. The guidelines of private agricultural associations match with these regulations or go beyond that. Important restrictions in the ecological dairy husbandry exist with the ban of several animal food and their additions like whole meal extraction from soy and rape as well as propyleneglycole, rumen protected fats and restricted use of concentrated food (40 %) in the ratio regarding to the dry matter. The use of performance and growth stimulants is also forbidden {{as well as the}} preventive use of chemical-synthetic medicine and antibiotics. The restriction of using chemical-synthetic allopathic medicine or antibiotics up to three treatments per animal and year and the doubling of the withdrawal period regulated by law need to be respected by the veterinarian. Using chemical-synthetic medicine without a legal withdrawal period on an ecologically managed farm, a withdrawal period of 48 hours is generally given. A great challenge after conversion to organic farming is meeting the nutrition requirements of cows with high milk yields and maintaining a good health status. An optimum in husbandry and adjusted stocking rates are important management actions to prevent diseases. From June 2003 to May 2004 regular measures of metabolism (blood/urine) and bag fat thickness were made in a dairy herd in Brandenburg, which changes to ecological farming since July 2002. The results of the monthly milk yield test and fertility measures of the herd were also analyzed. The performance of milk yield, fertility, animal health and parameters of metabolism should be obtained during the change to ecological management. On the farm 280 cows with an average milk yield of about 9000 kg milk and 250 young cows from own breeding were stapled. Food growing as well as feeding and husbandry proceeded within the ecological guidelines. Treatment of ill animals and marketing of milk and beef happened conventionally. The converting herd showed a significant decrease of milk yield and fertility. On the basis of metabolic examinations and concentrations of milk urea and protein, a lack of energy and protein supply is perceptible. The supply with ß-carotene and trace elements is not sufficient, either. The low values of heamatocrit and haemoglobin especially with the cows in early and high lactation are indications of lactation stress. The assessment of the body conditions by ultrasonographical measurement of back fat thickness shows a white spread of back fat thickness in the herd with underconditioned cows as well as a tendency of adiposis in the dry period. Because of regular measurement of the back fat thickness the tendency of adiposis lowers with the dry and older cows {{at the end of the}} examination period. A better adaptation to the recommended reference values is detectable. Problems in animal health occur mostly in the fields of udder health and fertility. The increased occurrence of mastitis and placental retentions and puerperal disorders on the farm lead to a high number of treated cows. <b>Claw</b> <b>diseases</b> are important in this changing herd as well. Reasons for the decrease of milk yield and problems of fertility and animal health can be the incorrect body condition and the insufficient supply of the cows. The fundament for a strong metabolism, good yield and health is a sufficient feeding correlating to the performance of the herd. But within the ecological conditions, it is difficult to manage in herds with high milk yield. An optimally designed feeding management is the precondition for high intakes of dry matter and therefore a higher performance from basic feeding. Food analysis is important to prevent misjudgements of ecological animal food compared to conventional animal food because of the different contents of minerals and nutrients in the food...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} (DD) is a {{contagious disease}} of cattle affecting {{the skin of}} the <b>claw.</b> The <b>disease</b> presents with a range of severities and can be associated with lameness. Information about the disease dynamics of DD is scarce. Parity and lactation stage have been identified as risk factors for DD and studies have also indicated that not all cows are equal regarding their risk of recurrent disease and prospects for cure from DD. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate host heterogeneity to DD and to identify disease patterns of DD and factors associated with the development and resolution of lesions. In three commercial dairy herds, 742 lactating cows were observed for DD lesions weekly for 11 or 12 weeks. The effects of parity, lactation stage and duration of preceding episode on the hazard of transitions between healthy and lesion states were analysed using a multilevel multistate discrete-time model. One or more DD lesions were observed in 460 cows and lesions were observed in 2426 out of 10585 observations. In total, 1755 uncensored episodes with DD lesions were observed. Early lactation was associated with a reduced risk of developing lesions compared with mid and late lactation. Lesions that developed in late lactation had a greater likelihood of resolution compared with lesions that developed during early lactation. There was a reduced risk of lesions developing in parity 3 compared with parity 1 cows, but an increased risk of lesions developing in parity 2 compared with parity 1 cows. In the present study, the mean duration of uncensored DD episodes was 1. 7 weeks indicating that the duration of the majority of DD lesions might be shorter than the 42 days reported previously. The transitions between disease states suggest that DD is a dynamic disease, and that the early stage lesions are more transient than expected from previous studies. We conclude that studies with shorter observation intervals than one week are needed to fully understand and describe the individual and group dynamics of DD...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis three direct in vitro co-culture models of endothelial cells and keratinocytes were developed and established. These models enable studies of cellular interactions between these two cell types. The work focused on identification of the cell types present in culture and a detailed morphological characterization. The cellular interaction between keratinocytes and endothelial cells is of particular relevance for the tissue homeostasis in the bovine claw. Cellular interactions {{play a key role}} during the pathogenesis of <b>claw</b> <b>diseases.</b> The direct co-cultures were assembled using three different technical approaches but under identical standardized culture conditions. The three different approaches are identified as coculture system 1 (E+K), co-culture system 2 (K+E) and co-culture system 3 (suspension). In the co-culture system 1 (E+K) initially a sub-confluent monolayer of keratinocytes was established on culture dishes coated with collagen type I. This monolayer served as a kind of “feeder-layer” for the endothelial cells seeded subsequently on top of the keratinocytes. The hypothesis tested with this model was that keratinocytes which adhere to the dish as monolayer already have an influence on adhesion and subsequent differentiation of endothelial cells seeded on top. On the other hand the experiments carried out with the co-culture system 2 (K+E) examined if keratinocytes during their migration and adhesion have an influence on endothelial cells that have established a sub-confluent layer already. The aim of the experiments done with the coculture system 3 (suspension) was to study the mutual influence of endothelial cells and keratinocytes regarding their adhesion and differentiation, when cultured simultaneously. Cell seeding in the co-culture system 3 was done in suspension. Therefore a random distribution of the different cell types {{on the bottom of the}} culture dish was accomplished. The co-cultures were grown for extended periods of time (long term model) on coated glass plates or Millicell®-PCF-inserts respectively. Cells were examined using phase contrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A maintenance medium DMEM+ was used for cultivating all co-culture systems. According to the experimental setup of the co-culture systems 1 (K+E) and 2 (E+K), keratinocytes and endothelial cells were incubated in monoculture in the corresponding selective medium for a duration of 24 hours (s. 3. 2). Endothelial cells and keratinocytes were successfully cultured in all three direct co-culture systems. In all systems the endothelial cells displayed angiogenic structures with characteristic features of angiogenesis such as sprouting, linear arrangement, and formation of capillary like structures in vitro (stages according to Bahramsoltani, 2003; Kässmeyer, 2006). The incomplete differentiated keratinocytes showed a stable adhesion to the glass plates and Millicell®-PCFinserts, which were coated with collagen type I, a component of the interstitial matrix. Characteristic for the keratinocytes in co-culture system 1 to 3 (K+E, E+K, suspension) was the creation of a stratified layer. After 4 week long term cultivation a multilayered co-culture of endothelial cells and keratinocytes developed in all three systems. The immunocytochemical reaction with an antibody to cytokeratin 14 (CK 14) identified epidermal keratinocytes in the co-culture system 2 (E+K). An antibody to cytokeratin 19 (CK 19) was used as marker for microvascular endothelial cells in the co-culture systems 1 (K+E) and 3 (suspension). Endothelial cells and keratinocytes were identified by electron microscopic examination in the early stage of cultivation using their localization corresponding to the sequence of seeding in the respective co-culture system as a criterion. During the late stages of cultivation specific morphological criteria enabled the identification and differentiation of these two cell types. Within the endothelial cell colonies in the co-culture systems 1 (E+K) and 3 (suspension) capillary like structures consisting of endothelial cells which enclosed a lumen were detected. The overlapping cell processes of neighbouring endothelial cells surrounded cavities which were either filled with cell fragments resp. fibrous material or were electron lucent. In co-culture system 2 (E+K) the endothelial cells form a multilayered cell cluster, which is characterized by a network of abundant branching cells. Furthermore signs of an intussusceptional remodeling of the cavities were revealed. The keratinocytes build up a stratified layer of cells covered by endothelial cells in all three systems (E+K, K+E, suspension). A stable adhesion on the coated membranes was characteristic for the keratinocytes. Transmission electron microscopic examination clearly showed formation of compartment between endothelial cells and keratinocytes by a dilated intercellular space filled, with fibrillar material. The results presented here support a central regulatory influence of keratinocytes on the endothelial morphogenesis. Consequently these co-culture systems are suitable for further investigation into the endothelial–epidermal interactions. The use of the developed co-culture systems in future studies of the pathogenesis and pathomechanisms of bovine and equine laminitis has the potential to shed light on the cellular interactions occurring during its initial stages...|$|R
40|$|This thesis used hoof-health records {{obtained}} at claw trimming in 102 Swedish dairy herds during 2 years to study {{different aspects of}} hoof health. Most (72 %) of the 4, 899 trimmed cows {{had at least one}} hoof-lesion whereas 5. 1 % were lame. Hoof lesions and lameness were associated with both individual- and herd-level risk factors. Individual (cow) level risk factors were of greater importance for explaining variation associated with claw-capsule defects than for skin lesions. Except for claw-horn haemorrhages, hoof lesions were more common in multiparous than in primiparous cows. Moreover, the risk of lameness and hoof lesions (except dermatitis) further increased with parity. Swedish Holsteins were at an increased risk of haemorrhages and sole ulcers compared to other breeds. Cows at 61 - 150 days in milk were at increased risk of haemorrhages and sole ulcers. Heifers that had calved at a relatively low age were at a decreased risk of hoof lesions. Cows with dirty hooves were at an increased risk of lesions and lameness. The risk of dermatitis or heel horn erosion was three times higher in cows housed in loose-housing systems than in tie-stalls. There was a negative effect of lameness on longevity (increased risk of culling within the same lactation) and of hoof lesions on reproductive performance. Significant negative associations were found between sole ulcer and first-service conception rate, calving interval, and treatment for anoestrus. Cows with sole ulcers had a higher milk yield than cows without, indicating that high-producing cows are more prone to develop the <b>disease.</b> <b>Claw</b> trimming in autumn reduced both the risk of lameness and hoof lesions in the following spring (~ 4. 5 months later) and the need for acute hoof treatments between trimmings.
