5|$|Wills' unmarked gravesite was {{restored}} in 1980 with a headstone erected by the MCC and by public subscription. He {{was inducted into}} the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989 and was made an inaugural member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

25|$|Dido and Aeneas {{opened at}} the Hampstead Conservatoire on May 17, 1900, to {{critical}} success but a financial loss of £180 for the three performance run. Friends made up the shortfall, and the company staged the work again the following year at the Coronet Theatre in Notting Hill. It ran there from March 25 to March 30, 1901, along with the Society's new production of The Masque of Love from Purcell's semi-opera, Dioclesian. To help pull in audiences, Ellen Terry, Craig's mother, also performed Charles Reade's one-act play Nance Oldfield as a <b>curtain</b> <b>raiser.</b> However, reviews criticised {{the addition of the}} play which had no obvious connection with the other two works and made the evening very long. Much of the audience had left before The Masque of Love even started. Despite the criticism, Craig approached Lillie Langtry to provide a similar <b>curtain</b> <b>raiser</b> for their next production, but after showing initial interest in the proposal, she declined.|$|E
