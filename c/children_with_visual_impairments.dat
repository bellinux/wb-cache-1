As much humour is <b>visual,</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are particularly vulnerable to missing out on this type of development.

METHOD: 26 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (mean age: 3 years 7 months (SD 3 months); 17 boys) and 28 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> normal vision (mean age: 3 years 7 months (SD 4 months); 14 boys) participated in the study. The ManuVis age band for 3 -year-old children comprised two one-handed tasks, two two-handed tasks, and a pre-writing task. RESULTS: <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> needed more time on all tasks (p <. 01) and performed the pre-writing task less accurately than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> normal vision (p <. 001). Children aged 42 - 47 months performed significantly faster on two tasks and had better total scores than children aged 36 - 41 months (p <. 05). Inter-rater reliability was excellent (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient = 0. 96 - 0. 99). CONCLUSIONS: The ManuVis age band for 3 -year-old children is appropriate to assess fine motor skills, and is sensitive to differences between <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and normal vision and between half-year age groups.

40|$|This Master thesis aims at {{developing}} {{knowledge on}} what music therapy can afford for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers {{in terms of}} bonding and early interaction. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers, due to their vulnerable situation and their different perception style, often experience challenges in interaction, communication and bonding. The focus in this article-based Master thesis is on how musical interaction can contribute to bonding and early interaction. The study aims to give answers to the following research question: “What can joint music making afford <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their caregivers in terms of bonding and social interaction?” A qualitative, exploratory study in which <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (aged 1 to 4) and their caregivers participated in music therapy sessions over 10 weeks was conducted in a pedagogical institution for people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Data has been collected by participant observation, field notes, video recordings and interviews. Moments of positive interactions in music were selected and analyzed and the selections were triangulated by interviews with caregivers. The data-material indicates that music therapy promotes positive bonding patterns and enhances early interaction by providing experiences of togetherness, joint attention and happiness. Musical interaction seems to facilitate elements of early interaction that can be challenging for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their sighted caregivers. This thesis discusses the findings in the broader perspective of disability studies and community music therapy and argues that music therapy promotes positive interactions and empowerment of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their caregivers. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{researched}} {{the connection between}} the development of speech and language on one hand and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> on the other. I focused primarily on the development of speech and language of preschool <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (aged from 0 to 6 years). <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> influences significantly the child’s development from his/her birth on. Sighted children make eye contact from the very beginning; this is, however, impossible or only possible to a lesser degree in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The differences in development already start in the prelinguistic period. In the theoretical part of my study I presented in detail the development of speech and language of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> from their birth to the age of 6 years. I concentrated mostly on the prelinguistic period, the articulation of individual voices, the occurrence of first words, the development of concepts and vocabulary, the occurrence of echolalia, and non-verbal communication. I introduced the translated and rearranged part of Oregon project which refers to development of speech and language in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Finally, I defined the role of the speech and language therapist in the development of speech and language in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The empirical part of the study is based on a case study of speech and language of two preschool <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> I evaluated their spontaneous speech and narration of a known story. In my research I focused on the most commonly used parts of speech and the mean length of utterance (MLU).

The general objective set for the theoretical part of this bachelor thesis is to map specific features of socialization of older school-aged <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in respect to choice of their future profession. The objective of the practical part was to use qualitative research to reflect the current situation in career consulting for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in selected school and consulting establishments and to find out about notions that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future professions and the world of labor. A qualitative method of research, specifically a structured interview technique, was used to meet the objective of the practical part, which was divided into two partial objectives. The interviews were conducted with 6 respondents in total, which included 1 worker of a school establishment, 1 worker of a consulting establishment and 4 schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> aged 13 - 15 years. Questions for the schoolchildren were prepared based on materials used in the theoretical part and they were divided into two sections. The first section of questions concerned basic case history data of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their notions about their future profession, while the other section was in form of a didactic test which consisted of questions from the world of labor and its results were supposed to illustrate how well the children understand the world of labor. To meet the other partial objective I have also used a structured interview with a worker of a school establishment and with a teacher with a specific training from a special teaching establishment. The obtained information was processed and it has enabled brief mapping of the current situation in the career consulting for schoolchildren <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in the South Bohemian region. The qualitative research of adequacy of notions that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have of their future career has brought quite surprising conclusions. The research has shown that, despite severity of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and the related limitations, the notions of the respondents seemed acceptable and adequate. In respect to career consulting and professional training of those children it is obvious that they are treated in a standard manner and {{in the same way as}} healthy children, that no integrated policy is available for them and that the concerned educational establishment does not take into account specific aspects associated <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|R
40|$|The two {{experiments}} {{reported here}} investigated {{the ability of}} sighted <b>children</b> and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> to comprehend text and, in particular, to draw inferences both while reading and while listening. Children were assigned into `comprehension skill' groups, depending on {{the degree to which}} their reading comprehension skill was in line with that predicted by their decoding skill. They then read (either print or Braille) and listened to a series of novel short stories. These were followed by a series of questions, which required either the generation of inferences, or an answer that could be taken literally from the text. The results suggest that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> and without sight are comparable in their ability to draw inferences, and that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> show an advantage for literal questions under auditory presentation...|$|R
40|$|Functional vision {{refers to}} the use of vision to perform day-day tasks and is {{assessed}} by the ability to perform these tasks. Assessment of functional vision is an integral component of the management of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The results of the assessment help in designing appropriate educational and rehabilitation intervention strategies. The L V Prasad-Functional Vision Questionnaire (LVP-FVQ) is a reliable and valid tool for assessing self-reported functional vision performance (FVP) in children. Self-reports are obviously the child's perception of his or her ability to perform certain tasks but they may not reflect actual performance. Various studies of FVP in adults have used actual performance measures of everyday tasks, but very few studies, even in adults <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> have compared self-reports and performance measures and none have included identical tasks on the 2 methods of assessment. To date, no study has assessed FVP using performance measures of daily tasks in the paediatric population. Therefore, the aims of the current study were: (1) To develop performance measures of FVP and compare them with self-reports of FVP from the LVP-FVQ in a prospective cohort of Indian school-going <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> (2) To investigate the effect of a psychological attribute, self-concept, on self-reports, performance measures and the relationships between the 2 measures. (3) To investigate the relationship between clinical measures of vision and FVP. Performance measures of FVP for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> were developed for 17 day to day tasks for comparison with self-reports of the same tasks for the LVP-FVQ. The LVP-FVQ was verbally administered by the researcher to 178 Indian school-going children aged between 8 and 17 years <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Similarly, the performance of each of the tasks by these children was measured by the researcher. The performance measures for most of these tasks were recorded on continuous scales and later categorized to match the ordinal ratings from the LVP-FVQ. The self-report and performance measure ratings for the 17 tasks were then converted into the same metric using a Rasch model allowing an accurate picture of whether and how these two measures of FVP compared with each other. Rasch analysis was used to estimate the person ability and item difficulty for FVP from the 2 methods of assessment. Self-reports showed stronger correlations with performance measures of FVP than were hypothesized. Similar to some studies in adults, binocular high-contrast visual acuity was found to be the single most significant predictor of a child's functional vision performance. Contrary to expectations, self-concept did not {{have a significant effect on}} the relationship between the 2 measures. A few reasons for the stronger than expected relationship between the 2 methods of assessment of FVP in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are suggested. Firstly, the use of identical tasks for self-reports and performance measures of FVP is likely to improve the relationship. Secondly, the LVP-FVQ was developed using focus groups of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> their parents, low vision specialists and rehabilitation professionals leading to good content validity. Since children were included in the development of the LVP-FVQ, the tasks were representative of a child's typical daily life. Thus, the performance measures were also suited to the day-day tasks of school-going children but were not tapping any social and psychological issues relating to <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Thirdly, the use of Rasch analysis which addresses many of the issues of unequal measurement and defines a hierarchy of items for self-reports and performance measures could have led to higher correlations in the present study. Finally, the high reliability and validity of self-reports and performance measures of FVP in the present study may have contributed to the higher than expected correlations. None of the demographic variables or self-concept affected the relationship between self-reports and performance measures of FVP, but self-concept had a weak significant association with self-reports. This result is unique to this study and warrants further investigation. Binocular high-contrast visual acuity alone, the most common visual function measured in ophthalmic clinics, explained between one-third and two-thirds of the variance in functional vision performance. This confirms the expected trend that <b>with</b> worse <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> FVP is lower. The addition of the variable, self-concept, resulted in a very small increase in the variability explained for self-reported FVP. Similarly, the addition of other clinical measures of vision such as binocular low contrast visual acuity and colour vision resulted in a small increase in the variability explained for performance measures of FVP. The correlation between binocular high-contrast visual acuity and performance measures of FVP was statistically significantly higher than that between binocular high-contrast visual acuity and self-reports of FVP. There are a few possible reasons for this higher correlation. Firstly, performance measures are considered to be a more "objective" form of assessment, while self-reports are a child's perception of his or her ability and therefore lack a context, which may result in either over-estimation or under-estimation of actual ability. Furthermore, performance measures include dimensions such as the time taken to perform a task or other criteria specific to a task, while self-reports do not use such qualifiers. Secondly, the higher correlation may be the result of the visual complexity of some of the tasks. While self-concepts of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> played a small but significant role in the self-reported FVP, studies in adults <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have suggested that other psychological factors such as mood, anxiety, motivation etc. are associated with an individual's perception of visual performance. Future studies are required to explore the possible role of these and other factors in FVP in Indian school-going <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> This thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of paediatric low vision rehabilitation by providing performance measures of FVP and relating them to self-reports in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and their relationship with common measures of <b>visual</b> function. <b>With</b> self-reports, the <b>child</b> is reporting his or her perception of ability to complete a task, where performance measures examine the child's ability to complete a task by observing his or her performance. Thus, although the two methods are comparable, it is because of the different yields from each of these measures that they are not considered interchangeable. A combination of the 2 measures where practical would perhaps provide a richer depiction of the FVP of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> As developing countries such as India have limited resources allocated for eye care services where less than seven percent of the gross national product is spent on health care, self-reports can be utilized together with clinical measures of vision (mainly visual acuity) to assess the FVP in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in a community setting. However, both methods of assessment of FVP together with clinical measures of vision are essential if a comprehensive assessment of FVP is to be carried out in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Information from these assessments can help clinicians better understand the functioning of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and incorporate them in the management of low vision in school-going <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in India...|$|R
