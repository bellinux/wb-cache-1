25|$|Data is {{generally}} written to floppy disks in sectors (angular blocks) and tracks (concentric rings {{at a constant}} radius). For example, the HD format of 3½-inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side and two sides, {{for a total of}} 1,474,560 bytes per disk. Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user's request, increasing storage on the disk, although {{they may not be able}} to be read on machines with other controllers. For example, Microsoft applications were often distributed on 3½-inch 1.68 MB DMF disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18; they could still be recognized by a standard controller. On the IBM PC, MSX and most other microcomputer platforms, disks were written using a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (CAV) format, with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location.|$|E

25|$|Because the sectors have {{constant}} angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more {{near the}} disk's center. A more space-efficient technique {{would be to}} increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is zone bit recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 160 KB on a double-sided disk. This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} vestibular stimulation with different <b>angular</b> accelerations and <b>velocities</b> on the perception of visual motion direction. Constant accelerations resulting in different <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> and <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> obtained at different accelerations were combined in twenty healthy subjects.

40|$|Ring Rolling is an {{advanced}} local incremental forming technology to fabricate directly precise seamless ring-shape parts with various dimensions and materials. To produce a high-quality ring different speed laws should be defined: the speed {{laws of the}} Idle and Axial rolls must be set to control the ring cross section and the Driver roll <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> must be chosen to avoid too high localized deformation on the ring cross section. Usually, in industrial environment, a constant rotation is set for the Driver roll, but this approach does not guarantee a <b>constant</b> ring <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> because of its diameter expansion. In particular, the higher is the ring diameter the lower is its <b>angular</b> <b>velocity.</b> The main risk due to this constrain is the generation of a non-uniform ring geometry.

40|$|Taylor-Couette flow, {{the flow}} between two coaxial co- or {{counter-rotating}} cylinders, {{is one of}} the paradigmatic systems in the physics of fluids. The (dimensionless) control parameters are the Reynolds numbers of the inner and outer cylinders, the ratio of the cylinder radii, and the aspect ratio. One key response of the system is the torque required to retain <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> which can be connected to the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> transport through the gap. Whereas the low–Reynolds number regime was well explored in the 1980 s and 1990 s of the past century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity developed only in the past decade.

We focus on the parameter dependence of the global torque and on the local flow organization, including velocity profiles and boundary layers.

40|$|We used a {{dynamically}} scaled model insect {{to measure}} the rotational forces produced by a flapping insect wing. A steadily translating wing was rotated at a range of <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> and the resulting aerodynamic forces were measured using a sensor attached {{to the base of}} the wing. These instantaneous forces were compared with quasi-steady estimates based on translational force coefficients. Because translational and rotational velocities were constant, the wing inertia was negligible, and any difference between measured forces and estimates based on translational force coefficients could be attributed to the aerodynamic effects of wing rotation. By factoring out the geometry and kinematics of the wings from the rotational forces, we determined rotational force coefficients for a range of <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> and different axes of rotation. The measured coefficients were compared with a mathematical model developed for two-dimensional motions in inviscid fluids, which we adapted to the three-dimensional case using blade element theory. As predicted by theory, the rotational coefficient varied linearly with the position of the rotational axis for all <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> measured. The coefficient also, however, varied with <b>angular</b> <b>velocity,</b> in contrast to theoretical predictions. Using the measured rotational coefficients, we modified a standard quasi-steady model of insect flight to include rotational forces, translational forces and the added mass inertia. The revised model predicts the time course of force generation for several different patterns of flapping kinematics more accurately than a model based solely on translational force coefficients. By subtracting the improved quasi-steady estimates from the measured forces, we isolated the aerodynamic forces due to wake capture...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} transient motion of a system consisting of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid in an annulus between two concentric, rotating, rigid spheres. The primary purpose of the research was to study the use of a numerical method for analyzing the transient motion which results from the interaction between the fluid in the annulus and the spheres which are started suddenly due to the action of prescribed torques. The problems considered in this research included cases where: (a) one or both spheres rotate with prescribed <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> and (b) one sphere rotates due to the action of an applied constant or impulsive torque. In this research the coupled solid and fluid equations were solved numerically by employing the finite difference technique.

The steady state problem was also solved as a separate problem (for verification purposes) and the results were compared to those obtained from the solution of the transient problem.

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for a viscous incompressible fluid in a rotating spherical annulus, subject to case study boundary conditions were developed. The specific boundary conditions studied were: (1) one or both spheres rotates with prescribed <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> and (2) one sphere rotates under the action of an applied constant or impulsive torque. The solution of the stream and circumferential functions were obtained {{in the form of}} a series in powers of the Reynolds Number. The number of independent variables in the perturbation equations were reduced (from three to two) by specifying the meridional dependence with Gegenbauer functions and then employing the concept of orthogonality. The zeroth order perturbation solution for the resulting partial differential equation subject to nonhomogeneous boundary conditions were obtained by employing the Laplace Transform in conjunction with Cauchy 2 ̆ 7 s Residual Theorem. The higher order perturbation solutions were obtained by applying the method of Separation of Variables. Results were obtained for a fifth order solution. Time dependent fluid flow for radius ratios (R 2 /R 1) equal to 0. 2, 0. 5, and 0. 9 were studied. Accurate results for the perturbation solution were obtained for smaller values of Re as the gap size was increased.
