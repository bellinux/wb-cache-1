50|$|On September 8, 2013, {{bus stop}} {{standardization}} was implemented on routes 1, 3, 5, and 25 {{to help with}} on-time performance. The process removed and relocated numerous bus stops along those routes, changing the distance between stops to be about 1300 feet (estimated from every 2 blocks to almost every 4 blocks). A new transfer station was built two blocks north of the <b>Chapel</b> <b>Hills</b> Mall on Voyager Pkwy, and buses that terminated at <b>Chapel</b> <b>Hills</b> Mall now terminate here instead. The change was made to prevent buses from having to enter the <b>Chapel</b> <b>Hills</b> Mall parking lot to service the mall, which can get crowded during the holiday shopping season.|$|R
