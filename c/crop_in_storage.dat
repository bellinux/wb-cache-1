40|$|India's {{agricultural}} {{system has been}} facing a severe problem of crop wastage. A key contributing factor to this problem is that many small farmers lack access to reliable cold storage that extends crop shelf-life. To avoid having leftover crops that spoil, these farmers often sell their crops at unfavorable low prices. Inevitably, not all crops are sold before spoilage. Even if the farmers have access to cold storage, the farmers may not know how long to hold different <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>storage</b> for, which hinges on strategizing over when and where to sell their harvest. In this note, we present progress toward a simultaneous hardware and software solution that aims to help farmers reduce crop spoilage and increase their profits. The hardware is a cost-effective solar-powered refrigerator and control unit. The software refers to a produce price forecasting system, for which we have tested a number of machine learning methods.

40|$|Maize is {{the second}} most widely grown cereal <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia. <b>In</b> <b>storage,</b> maize is {{severely}} destroyed by storage insect pests, mainly maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais). In an effort to develop a non-synthetic pesticide control approach, a study was conducted to determine the efficacy of two cooking oils, Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), to control S. zeamais under laboratory conditions. The oils were applied at the rate of 0. 2 to 0. 5 ml per 250 g of grain and compared with untreated control and malathion super dust as standard check. The study was laid-out in completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications for each treatment. The efficacy of the oils was assessed on the basis of total insect mortality, median lethal time (LT 50), weevil progeny emergence, seed hole’s number, weight loss and germination rate. The results showed that the oils caused 25 to 100 % mortality at the different concentrations used. Both oils had LT 50 of 0. 5 day when applied at the concentration of 0. 5 ml. At concentration of 0. 3 to 0. 5 ml, both oils caused zero weevil progeny emergence, minimum seed damage, zero grain weight loss and 89. 2 to 95. 5 % seed germination rate which were similar to those of malathion (Diethyl succinate) and significantly {{different from those of the}} untreated control.

Review of relevant research shows significant variability in parameter estimates for almost every unit process through both supply chain and conversion process.

The analysis is based on a generalized input-output style model of ethanol production, with uncertainty introduced through a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework. In the initial study, uncertainties <b>in</b> <b>crop</b> yield, <b>storage</b> loss, sugar yield, and fermentation yield are considered.

40|$|Stratigraphical investigations, geomorphological mapping, and diatom, plant macrofossil and pollen {{analyses}} were undertaken {{in and around}} two lakes in central Ireland to establish correlations between changes in lake conditions and catchment vegetation throughout the Holocene. Similar investigations of an adjacent mire reveal early Holocene changes in lake level and area. The palaeoecological data show high correlations related to variations in lake depth and area, catchment vegetation type, organic inputs and trophic status. Catchment-scale deforestation is gradual and occurs through the Bronze and the Iron Ages, {{and the construction of}} a crannog in the early Medieval period (seventh century AD) appears to be associated with a widespread increase in deforestation and mixed agriculture in the catchment. Both pollen and plant macrofossils suggest that one of the crannogs was used for <b>crop</b> <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> addition to domestic and any other activities. In the early to middle Holocene similarities in the proxy-data appear to be climatically driven through changing lake levels and areal extent whereas the later Holocene record is clearly dominated by anthropogenic changes within the catchment and the construction of crannogs in the lakes.

40|$|Carrying out proteomic {{analyses}} {{in plant}} tissues involves {{dealing with a}} number of specialized challenges that can make protein extraction and quantification significantly more difficult than in other organisms. In addition to having relatively low protein concentrations, plant tissues are often rich in proteases, protease inhibitors and other materials that impede protein analysis. These compounds include lipids, tannins, polysaccharides, and a large variety of secondary metabolites. The extent of the problems encountered is dependent on tissue type studied. Two major research thrusts in our lab involve detailed developmental and time-course studies on staple crops and fruits. An understanding of the proteins involved in the development of fruits, seeds, tubers and other plant organs will enhance our ability to control the agronomically-important traits of these <b>crops</b> including stability <b>in</b> <b>storage,</b> disease resistance, and vitamin and mineral content. Two recent studies that have posed unique challenges for proteome analysis include 1) comparing protein expression in red ripe tomato fruit to that in mature green tomato fruit and 2) studying the effects of storage on potato tubers. This talk will focus on the problems encountered in these recalcitrant tissue types and our efforts to provide plant scientists with a broader array of extraction and chemical modification protocols than is represented by those that constitute the existing paradigm.
