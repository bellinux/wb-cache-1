Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} walls and <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the hall were richly decorated, {{in some cases}} with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the Pantheons, religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Their {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{consisted of}} fourteen 10.5cm C/33 L/65 guns, sixteen 3.7cm L/83 guns, and between ten and twenty 2cm guns. The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 rounds per minute, and had an effective <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 6,800m (22,310ft), though tracers were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft). They had a rate of fire of 30rounds per minute.|$|E

5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, it was {{claimed that}} as many as 10,000 {{visitors}} passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the Sistine Chapel is the biggest attraction. The Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to}} be repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E

However, {{on a hot day}} where temperatures are 70°F (21°C), its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1,595 fpm (486 m/min), and service ceiling is reduced to 19,400 feet (5,900 m) due to less dense air.|$|E

5|$|Some {{minor works}} {{took place during}} the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and <b>ceiling,</b> <b>of</b> such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E

5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back to the ship. The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down or forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E

It is natural to refine this enumeration by considering floors and <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> dominant regions. A conjecture of Arm-strong states that counting dominant regions by their number of floors of a certain height gives the same distribution as counting dominant regions by their number <b>of</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> the same height. We prove this conjecture using a bijection that provides even more refined enumerative information. 1...|$|R
