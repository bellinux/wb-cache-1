40|$|Spices are {{commonly}} used in most Nigerian dishes as flavour and <b>colour</b> <b>enhancer,</b> nutrient supplements or to serve as preservatives, medicine {{and as part of}} cultural inclinations. They are naturally of plant parts and in recent times, certain synthetic creations of flavorists have found use in food as flavour and colour enhancers. The upsurge in quest for dishes of other cultures, and for food containing plant products deemed to have antioxidant properties have resulted in large import of different spices into the Nigerian market. This study was conducted to determine the microbial profile, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of some imported spices in Nigerian market. Fifteen each, of five different brands of imported spices packaged in polyethylene containers were purchased from supermarkets in different regions of Nigeria. The mean (cfu/g) total aerobic plate counts in the samples range from 1. 8 x 103 to 7. 0 x 104, Coliform count was 1. 1 x 102 to 4. 1 x 103 and mean fungi count was 1. 0 x 101 to 2. 9 x 103. Microorganisms isolated from some of the spices include spp of Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Proteus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Rhizopus and Fusarium. Some of the spices had antimicrobial effects on the clinical isolates tested with MIC ranging from 6. 25 to 25. 0 mg/ml. The spices contain Phenolics and flavonoids and have DPPH, Hydrogen peroxide and Nitric oxide scavenging activities. Adequate HACCP evaluation and GMP in the processing of spices is advanced, further studies are necessary to harness the full antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of these spices for therapeutic purpose...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of various types of wax-coatings, and container liners on the physicochemical characters of Pakistani mandarins (Feutrellt's Early-and Kinnows) during postharvest storage at ordinary room conditions. Changes in citrus volatiles and free amino acids were studied to test their suitability as chemical quality/senescence indices and correlations between physico chemical and organoleptic characters of mandarins were also computed. Literature pertaining to fresh citrus fruits external (rots, physiological disorders, blemishes) and internal (total soluble solids (TSS), acid, TSS/acid, juice content, volatiles, free amino acids) quality characters was surveyed. Preharvest and harvest factors (rootstock, tree condition, soil, climate, weather, production area, harvesting season, garden treatments (water management, fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, growth regulators, <b>colour</b> <b>enhancer,</b> internal quality modifier),picking methods and postharvest treatments(washing, grading, degreening, precooling, curing, conditioning, decay control techniques (fungicides, fumigation, growth regulators, heat treatment, irradiation, citrus volatiles), controlled atmosphere storage, waxing, packaging, container lining, packing, containerization) affecting the postharvest quality and storage behaviour of citrus fruits have been reviewed. Effect of various postharvest treatments was studied in five citrus crops (1976 - 77, 1977 - 78, 1979 - 80, 1982 - 83, 1983 - 84) in early, mid and late season harvests. Feutrell's were picked in November, December and January whereas kinnows were procured in January, February, March and April. The salient features of these findings are summarized below: Polyethylene (PE) lining (0. 030 mm) was the most effective treatment followed by waxing (with Fruitex, Britex 561 and Seal Britex- 56) and cellophane lining (0. 030 mm) for reducing weight loss of both the mandarins during storage at room conditions as compared to newspaper lining (0. 093 mm), but waxpaper lining (0. 024 mm) had no such effect. Even in severe storage conditions (23 - 360 C, 47. 0 - 76. 5...|$|E
40|$|Use of commercially {{prepared}} stains as {{a source}} of glaze and pigment colour leads to less individuality and subtlety. This thesis is about enhancing quality in stoneware glazes and pigments studying the effect of secondary fluxes fired in a reduction atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on establishing an accurate analysis of locally obtainable materials, which cumulatively form the main materials database utilized in this research, necessary in investigating the advantages of using actual analysis as opposed to theoretical analysis when performing glaze calculations. In order to carry out the numerous calculations associated with this research {{it is clear that the}} most logical way to do this was through the use of computer applications. This leads to the investigation of established software programs used for glaze calculation. Two main programs Insight™ (1986) and HyperGiaze™ (1988) have been reviewed, determining whether computer software glaze calculation programs assist in producing glazes which have a better fit, surface quality, and brightness of colour. Subsequently a glaze calculation program GLAZECALC has been written using a spreading sheet application incorporating the local materials database. This research has focused on traditional based stoneware glazes derivative of those originally used in the Song dynasty - 'Celadons and Chuns' and the Ming dynasty - 'Copper Reds', examining "flux substitution" as a means of enhancing the brightness of these glazes. It is noted that the incorporation of additional fluxes into a recipe as a <b>colour</b> <b>enhancer,</b> also has the effect in some cases of improving the surface quality of a glaze. As a consequence, considerable investigations have gone into researching Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, looking at a dual role in the substitution of fluxes i. e. colour enhancement and improved body fit. Recognising the importance of the purity of materials and the colour response to specific oxides, further investigations have been undertaken studying the interaction between secondary fluxes utilized in laminations for specific effects i. e. body, engobe/ slip, glaze and overglaze pigments. An exhibition of work is incorporated into this presentation, the subsequent pieces exhibited being vehicles on which the glaze research outcomes are illustrated...|$|E
5000|$|Treatments for saltillo include: coating {{them with}} a surface sealant prior to {{grouting}} (as mentioned earlier), applying an admixture of linseed oil and paint thinner, applying natural stone <b>colour</b> <b>enhancers,</b> applying floor hardeners, applying shine, painting {{them with a}} water-based paint, coating them with wood stain, etc. As the tile is incredibly porous it will readily absorb just about any liquid. Please note any of these treatments may be used on the tile, however some of them such as penetrating sealeant, enhancers or linseed oil treatments penetrate into the tile and may affect the ability of later coatings {{to adhere to the}} tile. Ultra-durable, water-based polyurethane makes an excellent coating for adding slip resistance, beautiful appearance and protection from penetrating stains. Look for a polyurethane coating that has no VOCs for maximum environmental friendliness.|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of anthocyanins in red grapes and wines {{has been of}} increasing interest in the last years, as they {{play an important role}} in colour quality of red wines revealing also many human health beneficial effects. They contribute e. g. to the reduction of coronary heart disease, but exhibit also antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties. In this doctoral thesis, the complex study of grape skin alcoholic and water extracts, prepared from Alibernet and St. Laurent wine grape varieties is presented. Extracts were prepared from three different amounts (0, 5; 1, 0 and 1, 5 g) of lyophilized grape skin powder using the Pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) and the Pressurized Hot Water Extraction (PHWE) at different temperatures ranging from 40 up to 120 °C and pressure of 15 MPa. Methanol, ethanol and water were used as a solvents. Total phenolic compound content (TPC) of individual extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau assay and their tristimulus color values (CIE Lab) were estimated, using the UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The identification and quantification of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was performed. In addition, pH values of all extracts were also measured using the combinated glass electrode. Antioxidant activity of extracts was tested by EPR spectroscopy in Fenton system (H 2 O 2 /Fe 2 +) generating reactive radicals (•OH, O 2 -•, •CH 3) followed by spin trapping technique, using 5, 5 -dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as spin trap. In addition, radical scavenging activity of extracts was assessed applying 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (•DPPH) free radical and 2, 2 '-azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) cation radical (ABTS•+) assays. All the experimental data were processed with principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) to specify the optimum extraction conditions for extract preparation from the perspective of the potential further application of the extracts as food supplements or food <b>colour</b> <b>enhancers.</b> The results indicated that grape skins of both varieties are a promising source of anthocyanins with prospective application in food industry...|$|R
