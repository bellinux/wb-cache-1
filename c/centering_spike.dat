Delineation of the regions of convergence of this multimodal algorithm has remained as an unresolved problem {{in spite of its}} significance with regard to CMA initialization strategies.

We characterize the location and volume of the convergence regions of local minima, and associate the volume of the convergence regions with their MSE performance. The convergence regions of the local minima with low noise gain expand near origin, while those of the local minima with high noise gain shrink. This explains partly the robustness of FS-CMA.

Comparison of the maps shows that some features of the discharge RFs depended strongly on those of the synaptic RFs, whereas others were less dependent. Spiking RF duration depended poorly and spiking RF amplitude depended moderately on those of the underlying synaptic RFs. At the other extreme, the optimal spatial frequency and phase of the discharge RFs in simple cells were almost entirely inherited from those of the synaptic RFs. Subfield width, in both simple and complex cells, was less for spiking responses compared with synaptic responses, but synaptic to discharge width ratio was relatively variable from cell to cell.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging is routinely used to localize brain function, with multiple brain scans averaged together to reveal activation volumes. In this study, we examine the seldom-studied effect of multiple scan averaging {{on the extent of}} activation volume. Using restricted visual field stimulation, we obtained a large number of scan repetitions and analyzed changes in activation volume with progressively increased averaging and across single scans. Activation volume increased monotonically with averaging and failed to asymptote when as many as 22 scans were averaged together. Expansions in the spatial extent of activation were not random; rather, they were centered about activation loci that appear with little or no averaging. Using empirical and simulated data, changes with averaging in activation volumes and cross correlation coefficient distributions revealed the presence of considerably more activated voxels than commonly surmised. Many voxels have low SNR and remain undetected without extensive averaging. The primary source of such voxels was not downstream venous drainage since there was no significant and consistent delay difference between voxels activated at different averaging levels. Voxels with low SNR may reflect a diffuse subthreshold activity <b>centered</b> about <b>spiking</b> neurons, dephasing gradients from distal veins, or simply a blood flow response extending beyond the locus of neuronal firing.

Optimized KDEs with the width of the Gaussians (bandwidth) determined through cross-validation or bootstrapping reflect more accurately the underlying spiking activity and also allow for single trial resolution. We found that optimized bandwidth estimates obtained through unbiased cross-validation (UCV) are an information rich measure, which is applicable to more problems than firing rate estimation, by analyzing both simulations and multiple single-unit recordings from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of behaving rats. Optimized bandwidth estimates provide a characteristic value for the temporal spiking structure of single units and can be modeled {{as a function of the}} temporal precision within spiking patterns accounting for the signal-to-noise ratio in simulated data. The distribution of optimized bandwidth estimates of PFC units and their joint distribution with further spike train metrics allows to segregate groups of cells with distinct spiking properties. Additionally, optimized KDEs obtained with UCV-based bandwidths perform reliable or superior compared to non-optimized KDEs when decoding behavioral events during the task.

Adopting these <b>spiked</b> <b>centering</b> priors readily accommodates sharp null hypotheses and allows for the estimation of the posterior probabilities of such hypotheses. Dirichlet process mixture models naturally borrow information across objects through model-based clustering while inference on single hypotheses averages over clustering uncertainty.

While our modeling framework is general, here we present an application in the context of gene expression from microarray experiments. In our application, the modeling framework allows simultaneous inference on the parameters governing differential expression and inference on the clustering of genes.

40|$|Summary: Source {{localization}} using single current dipoles esti-mates equivalent <b>centers</b> of the <b>spiking</b> gray matter. The {{extent of}} the active cortex, however, is difficult to assess from scalp EEG because of the unknown individual volume conduction. The spatial scatter of dipole localizations of single spikes has been proposed {{as a measure of}} extent. Single spike localization, however, is strongly dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, the ratio of spike and background EEG amplitudes. On the other hand, averag-ing of all spikes yields only the localization of equivalent centers of activity. We investigated the influence of SNR and multiple subav-erages on the estimation of spatial extent by comparing the local-ization scatter of 100 single spikes in 27 spike types of 25 epilepsy patients with 1000 different subaverages computed by random sampling and bootstrapping. Averaging increased SNR and there-fore allowed for localization not only at the spike peak but also during spike onset when less cortex is active. In several subjects with known cortical lesions, the single spike scatter considerably exceeded the lesion. Single dipole scatter was highly correlated with SNR (r 0. 83, P 0. 0001) and was greatly reduced when analyzing multiple subaverages of 10, 25, 50, and 100 spikes. Thus, we found a dominant role of the SNR on the estimated extent and improvement by scatterplots based on the dipole localization of randomly sampled subaverages...|$|R

However, an LGN cell responds typically to {{less than half of}} the spikes it receives from the RGC that drives it, and without retinal drive the LGN is silent (Kaplan and Shapley, 1984). Recent studies, which used stimuli restricted to the receptive field (RF) center, show that despite the great loss of spikes, more than half of the information carried by the RGC discharge is typically preserved in the LGN discharge (Sincich et al., 2009), suggesting that the retinal spikes that are deleted by the LGN carry less information than those that are transmitted to the cortex. To determine how LGN relay neurons decide which retinal spikes to respond to, we recorded extracellularly from the cat LGN relay cell spikes together with the slow synaptic (‘S’) potentials that signal the firing of retinal spikes. We investigated the influence of the inhibitory surround of the LGN RF by stimulating the eyes with spots of various sizes, the largest of which covered the center and surround of the LGN relay cell's RF. We found that for stimuli that activated mostly the RF <b>center,</b> each LGN <b>spike</b> delivered more information than the retinal spike, but this difference was reduced as stimulus size increased to cover the RF surround.

Laboratory investigations were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of permanganate concentrations and temperature on RDX destruction kinetics as well as to determine the Permanganate Soil Oxidant Demand (PSOD) and permanganate (Mn 04 -) transport properties. Batch and column experiments showed that the Todd Valley aquifer sands contained a low PSOD indicating that permanganate mass consumption by the aquifer would be minimal. PSOD experiments also showed that the PSOD of the aquifer increased as the permanganate concentration increased. Batch experiments showed that the presence of Todd Valley aquifer media had little effect on RDX destruction kinetics and that RDX destruction kinetics and RDX mineralization increased with increasing permanganate concentrations. Batch experiments were conducted using RDX contaminated groundwater from the permanganate injection site (Co = 210 μg/L) where there where no appreciable changes in RDX degradation kinetics. Additional batch studies were conducted to observe temperature effects on RDX degradation kinetics where it was shown that lower temperatures slow down RDX degradation.

To better understand the role of SNIa heating, we also considered a “pure ” cooling flow model without supernovae; in this case the amplitude of the LX fluctuations due to the tidal interaction is substantially reduced. We conclude that, if SNIa significantly contribute to the energetics of the gas flows in ellipticals, then the observed spread in the LX − LB diagram at any fixed optical galaxy luminosity LB ∼> 3 × 10 10 L ⊙ may be caused, at least in part, by this mechanism. On the contrary, tidal interactions cannot be responsible for the observed spread if the pure cooling flow scenario applies...|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{differences}} between the spumaviruses and the other retroviruses come from the life cycle. Some of the main differences are that FV buds from the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the plasma membrane; this difference gives FV a unique morphology. FV is characterized by an immature looking core with an electron lucent <b>center</b> with glycoprotein <b>spikes</b> on the surface. [...] FV replication more closely resembles the Hepadnaviridae, which are another family of reverse transcriptase encoding viruses. Reverse transcription of the genome occurs at a later step in the replication cycle, which results in the infectious particles having DNA rather than RNA, this also leads to less integration in the host genome. The DNA found is linear and the length of the genome. [...] The genome encodes the usual retroviral genes pol, gag, and env as well as two additional genes tas or bel-1 and bet. The role for bet is not quite clear, research has shown that it is dispensable for replication of the virus in tissue culture. The tas gene, however, is required for replication. It encodes a protein that functions in transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. [...] FV has a second promoter, the internal promoter (IP) which is located in the env gene. The IP drives expression of the tas and bet genes. The IP is also unique in that the virus has the capacity to transcribe mRNAs from it; usually the complex retroviruses exclusively express transcripts from the LTR. [...] The structural genes of FV are another one of its unique features. The Gag protein is not efficiently cleaved into the mature virus which lends to the immature morphology. The Pol precursor protein is only partially cleaved; the integrase domain is removed by viral protease. As in other retroviruses, the Env protein is cleaved into surface and transmembrane domains but the FV Env protein also contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal which is part of why the virus buds from the endoplasmic reticulum. Another area of difference between FV and other retroviruses is the possibility of recycling the core once the virus is in the cell.|$|R
