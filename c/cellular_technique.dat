5000|$|Poulenc {{uses the}} {{orchestra}} {{to connect the}} soprano's fragmented vocal lines, unifying the piece as a whole. [...] Unlike his treatment of the soprano voice, Poulenc gives the orchestra many lyrical motifs, writing in the preface his score, [...] "L'œuvre entière doit baigner dans la plus grande sensualité orchestrale" [...] ("The entire work must bathe in the largest orchestral sensuality"). [...] He unifies the opera through these motifs, of which Denis Waleckx identifies fourteen. [...] These motifs relate to Elle's state of mind, such as those representing her [...] "exasperated waiting," [...] and to situations out of her control, such as her [...] "happy memory." [...] The first of these motifs is shown in Example 3. [...] Daniel, however, suggests that only nine of Waleckx's examples are true motifs, while the remaining one- or two-bar phrases employ a <b>cellular</b> <b>technique</b> in which a short phrase is presented, then repeated once or twice. [...] What Waleckx cites as the [...] "Endurance" [...] motif (see Example 4), Daniel uses to illustrate Poulenc's <b>cellular</b> <b>technique.</b> Despite their different interpretations, both authors agree that the primary function of the orchestra is to unify the opera into a cohesive work. As Daniel explains, [...] "If La voix humaine succeeds as a drama, {{it is because of}} the vocal writing; but if it succeeds as a piece of music, as an opera, it is because of the orchestra." ...|$|E

In addition to this role, MLCK contributes to Ca(2 +) flux regulation in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and in non-muscle cells, where cytoskeleton has been suggested to help Ca(2 +) channels trafficking. This conclusion is based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors of MLCK and molecular and <b>cellular</b> <b>techniques</b> developed to down-regulate the enzyme. Dissimilarities have been observed between cells and whole tissues, as well as between large conductance and small resistance arteries.

40|$|This review explores {{various aspects}} of the {{interaction}} between microtubule targeting agents and tubulin, including binding site, affinity, and drug resistance. Starting with the basics of tubulin polymerization and microtubule targeting agent binding, we then highlight how the three-dimensional structures of drug-tubulin complexes obtained on stabilized tubulin are seeded by precise biological and biophysical data. New avenues opened by thermodynamics analysis, high throughput screening, and proteomics for the molecular pharmacology of these drugs are presented. The amount of data generated by biophysical, proteomic and <b>cellular</b> <b>techniques</b> shed more light onto the microtubule-tubulin equilibrium and tubulin-drug interaction. Combining these approaches provides new insight into the mechanism of action of known microtubule interacting agents and rapid in-depth characterization of next generation molecules targeting the interaction between microtubules and associated modulators of their dynamics.

Although {{previous studies have}} reported responses to thrombin in non-human megakaryocytes, through studies of single cell calcium responses and protein tyrosine-phosphorylation we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that both isolated human megakaryocytes and CD 41 / 61 -positive megakaryocytes derived in culture from CD 34 + cells share responses to the platelet agonists collagen, collagen-related peptide and thrombin. The responses to either collagen or CRP were seen only in the most mature megakaryocytes and not in megakaryocyte-like cell lines, suggesting that the response to collagen is a characteristic developed late during megakaryocyte differentiation.

40|$|Type III {{secretion}} systems (TTSSs) {{utilized by}} enteropathogenic bacteria require {{the presence of}} small, acidic virulence-associated chaperones for effective host cell infection. We adopted a combination of biochemical and <b>cellular</b> <b>techniques</b> to define the chaperone binding domains (CBDs) in the translocators IpaB and IpaC associated with the chaperone IpgC from Shigella flexneri. We identified a novel CBD in IpaB and furthermore precisely mapped {{the boundaries of the}} CBDs in both translocator proteins. In IpaC a single binding domain associates with IpgC. In IpaB, we show that the binding of the newly characterized CBD is essential in maintaining the ternary arrangement of chaperone-translocator complex. This hitherto unknown function is reflected in the co-crystal structure as well, with an IpgC dimer bound to an IpaB fragment comprising both CBDs. Moreover, in the absence of this novel CBD the IpaB/IpgC complex aggregates. This dual-recognition of a domain in the protein by the chaperone in facilitating the correct chaperone-substrate organization describes a new function for the TTSS associated chaperone-substrate complexes...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has intensified efforts to discover novel drugs for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Targeting the persistent state of Mtb, {{a condition in}} which Mtb is resistant to conventional drug therapies, is of particular interest. Persistent bacteria rely on metabolic pathways that are distinct from active infection Mtb as the environmental conditions of the persistent state are different (e. g., low nutrient). Because persistent Mtb are forced to survive in a low nutrient environment, a short, two enzyme pathway that becomes heavily utilized and upregulated is the glyoxylate shunt. Since the glyoxylate shunt enzymes are not present in mammals, they make attractive drug targets. We are studying malate synthase (MS), one of the enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt. We used computational, biochemical, and <b>cellular</b> <b>techniques</b> to identify potential inhibitors of MS. Crystal structures of MS in complex with inhibitors were used to rationally design better MS inhibitors.

Although the effector cell mechanisms underlying both events are not completely understood, it can be anticipated that the ultimate effect of T lymphocytes directed against mH antigens depends on the tissue distribution of these molecules. One ofthe most extensively studied mH antigens is the male-specific antigen H-Y, which was first discovered as a transplantation barrier in a murine skin graft model by Eichwald and Slimser (2). In the mouse as well as in man the immune response to theHY antigen appears to be mainly, though not exclusively, mediated by MHCrestricted T cells (3 - 5).

By using scanning transmission electron tomography, with small probe convergence angles, high spatial resolution is maintained over large depths of field and across the tilt range. Moreover, the application of compressed sensing methods to the needle data demonstrates how high fidelity reconstructions may be achieved with far fewer images (and thus greatly reduced dose) than needed by conventional methods.

Although {{the formation of}} a β-sheet structure is usual required to form aggregates, the relationship between neurotoxicity and the Aβ sequence remains unclear. To explore the correlation between Aβ sequence, secondary structure, aggregative ability, and neurotoxicity, we utilized both full-length and fragment-truncated Aβ peptides. Using a combination of spectroscopic and <b>cellular</b> <b>techniques,</b> we demonstrated that neurotoxicity and aggregative ability are correlated while the relationship between these characteristics and secondary structure is not significant. The hydrophobic C-terminus, particularly the amino acids of 17 – 21, 25 – 35, and 41 – 42, is the main region responsible for neurotoxicity and aggregation. Deleting residues 17 – 21, 25 – 35 or 41 – 42 significantly reduced the toxicity. On the other hand, truncation of the peptides at either residues 22 – 24 or residues 36 – 40 had little effect on toxicity and aggregative ability. While the N-terminal residues 1 – 16 may not {{play a major role in}} neurotoxicity and aggregation, a lack of N-terminal fragment Aβ peptide, (e. g.
