40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the generation of}} the minimum length <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> for FSM-based protocol conformance testing. The discussion focuses on finding the minimal length of resulting <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> for an FSM under different conditions. Without interleaving state identification and transition verification sequences, four methods (D-method, W-method, Wp-method and UIOv-method) of generating minimum length test sequences for FSMs with reliable reset feature are reviewed and provided to construct <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> These four methods are then improved to generate minimum length <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> for FSMs without reliable reset feature and provided to construct <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> Moreover, the effects of interleaving the state identification and transition verification sequences {{on the length of}} the <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> are studied. An algorithm for interleaving the state identification and transition verification sequences generated by the above four methods with reliable reset feature is proposed. It is observed that the reduction in the length of <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> due to interleaving is significant. Finally, the two general models for constructing minimal length <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> using distinguishing sequences with interleaved state identification and transition verification sequences are proposed. The proof for the first model to find a minimum length <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> in polynomial time is provided. The sequences generated by using both models are proved to be <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> Examples are provided as applications of all the proposed methods and models...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{generating}} <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> for FSMs with distinguishing sequence has been attracting interest of researchers for several decades. In this paper, a solution is proposed for partial reduced FSMs with distinguishing sets, and either {{with or without}} reset feature. Sufficient conditions for a sequence to be a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> for such FSMs are formulated. Based on these conditions, a method to generate <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> is elaborated. The results of an experimental comparison indicate that the proposed method produces shorter <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> than existing methods in most cases.

40|$|Given {{a finite}} state machine M, a <b>checking</b> <b>{{sequence}}</b> is an input sequence that is guaranteed {{to lead to a}} failure if the implementation under test is faulty and has no more states than M. There has been much interest in the automated generation of a short <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> from a {{finite state machine}}. However, such sequences can contain reset transitions whose use can adversely affect both the cost of applying the <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> and the effectiveness of the <b>checking</b> <b>sequence.</b> Thus, we sometimes want a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> with a minimum number of reset transitions rather than a shortest <b>checking</b> <b>sequence.</b> This paper describes a new algorithm for generating a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence,</b> based on a distinguishing sequence, that minimises the number of reset transitions used.

40|$|Abstract. There are {{two main}} {{shortcomings}} in the existing models for generating <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> based on distinguishing sequences. First, these models require a priori selection of state recognition sequences (called α-sequences) {{which may not be}} the best selection for yielding substantial reduction in the length of <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> Second, they do not take advantage of overlapping to further reduce the length of <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> This paper proposes an optimization model that tackles these shortcomings to reduce the lengths of <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> beyond what is achieved by the existing models by replacing the state recognition sequences with a set of basic sequences called α-elements and by making use of overlapping. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{constructing}} a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> for {{finite state machine}} (FSM) based testing is introduced. It {{is based on a}} recently suggested method which uses quite a different approach than almost all the methods developed since the introduction of the <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> generation problem around half a century ago. Unlike its predecessor which aggressively tries to recognize the states by applying identification sequences, our approach relies on yet to be generated parts of the sequence for this. The method may terminate without producing a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence.</b> We also suggest a method to <b>check</b> if a <b>sequence</b> is a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> for this purpose. If it turns out not be a <b>checking</b> a <b>sequence,</b> a post processing phase extends the sequence further. We present the results of an experimental study showing that our two phase approach produces shorter <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> than the previously published methods. This experimental study is performed on FSMs that are randomly generated by using a tool implemented within this work to support this and other FSM based testing studies...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{software}} testing based on Finite State Machines (FSMs) have been researched {{since the early}} 60 ’s. Many of these methods are about generating a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> from a given FSM which is an input sequence that determines whether an implementation of the FSM is faulty or correct. In this paper, we consider one of these methods, which constructs a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> by reducing the problem of generating a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> to finding a Chinese rural postman tour on a graph induced by the FSM; we re-formulate the constraints used in this method {{as a set of}} Boolean formulas; and use a SAT solver to generate a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> of minimal length...|$|R

40|$|Context: Given a Finite State Machine (FSM), a <b>checking</b> <b>{{sequence}}</b> is a {{test sequence}} that determines whether the system under test is correct as long as certain standard assumptions hold. Many <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> generation methods use an adaptive distinguishing sequence (ADS), which is an experiment that distinguishes {{the states of the}} specification machine.

However, there has been no study on the actual effect of using adaptive distinguishing sequences on the length of <b>checking</b> <b>sequences.</b> This paper describes experiments that show that <b>checking</b> <b>sequences</b> constructed using adaptive distinguishing sequences are almost consistently shorter than those based on preset distinguishing sequences.

40|$|A <b>checking</b> <b>sequence,</b> {{generated}} from a finite state machine, {{is a test}} sequence that is guaranteed {{to lead to a}} failure if the system under test is faulty and has no more states than the specification. The problem of generating a <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> for a finite state machine M is simplified if M has a distinguishing sequence: an input sequence ¯D with the property that the output sequence produced by M in response to ¯ D is different for the different states of M. Previous work has shown that, where a distinguishing sequence is known, an efficient <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> can be produced from the elements of a set A of sequences that verify the distinguishing sequence used and the elements of a set Υ of subsequences that test the individual transitions by following each transition t by the distinguishing sequence that verifies the final state of t. In this previous work A is a predefined set and Υ is defined in terms of A. The <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> is produced by connecting the elements of Υ and A, to form a single sequence, using a predefined acyclic set Ec of transitions. An optimization algorithm is used in order to produce the shortest such <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> that can be generated {{on the basis of the}} given A and Ec. However, this previous work did not state how the sets A and Ec should be chosen. This paper investigates the problem of finding appropriate A and Ec to be used in <b>checking</b> <b>sequence</b> generation.
