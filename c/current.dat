5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil <b>Current</b> from the north and the Malvinas <b>Current</b> from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar <b>Current).</b> The Brazil <b>Current</b> transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas <b>Current</b> transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas <b>Current</b> cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the <b>current</b> is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas <b>Current.</b> As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas <b>Current</b> rather than the warm North Atlantic <b>Current.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, <b>current</b> {{is often}} described as being either direct <b>current</b> (DC) or alternating <b>current</b> (AC). These terms refer to how the <b>current</b> varies in time. Direct <b>current,</b> as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating <b>current</b> is any <b>current</b> that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating <b>current</b> thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating <b>current</b> is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating <b>current</b> is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct <b>current,</b> such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
50|$|Ocean <b>currents.</b> Certain ocean <b>currents</b> have {{different}} temperatures. Warm ocean <b>currents</b> warm {{the air above}} it, which warms the coast. Cold ocean <b>currents</b> cool the air above it, which cools the coast. This helps keep the coast a consistent temperature.|$|R

Interacting electrons at half filling induce "diamagnetic" spin <b>currents</b> at lower AC fluxes whereas charge <b>currents</b> display paramagnetic responses for noninteracting electrons. We find that for systems away from half filling the characteristic roles of spin and charge <b>currents</b> are interchanged, that is, the charge <b>currents</b> exhibit a change from paramagnetic to diamagnetic <b>currents,</b> while the spin <b>currents</b> remain "paramagnetic" states...|$|R

This decomposition is applied to surface <b>currents</b> observed by high-frequency (HF) radars. The observation was conducted from April to May 1998 east of Oki nawa Island, Japan. The spectral analysis of decomposed <b>currents</b> reveals that the A/ 2 tidal peak for rotational components is much smaller than that for divergent components, which suggests that the barotropic tidal components are mainly included in divergent <b>currents.</b> The real-vector empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis ofdecomposed <b>currents</b> reveals an embedded eddy, which is related with the convergence of <b>currents.</b> Index Terms—Helmholtz decomposition, high-frequency (HF) radar, surface <b>currents.</b> I...|$|R
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct <b>current</b> models a rectifier, which converts alternating <b>current</b> into direct <b>current.</b> Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating <b>current,</b> the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the <b>current.</b> As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding <b>current.</b> The multiple coil type adjusts the <b>current</b> by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the <b>current</b> characteristics.|$|E

5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} <b>current</b> {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. <b>Current</b> defined in this manner is called conventional <b>current.</b> The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of <b>current,</b> is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons.
