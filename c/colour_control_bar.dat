5000|$|The <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{solid metal}} or {{composite}} bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this <b>bar</b> and <b>controls</b> the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a chicken loop from the <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> {{is attached to a}} latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's angle of attack. While kite <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> are made intentionally light, they must also be very strong, and so are usually heavier than water; [...] "bar floats" [...] made of foam are generally fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. <b>Control</b> <b>bars</b> are usually specific to a particular kite type and size and are not usually suitable for use with different kite types.|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposed}} {{to determine the}} most appropriate place to measure variability in dot gain and solid ink density on a form using color <b>control</b> <b>bars.</b> The study developed a form that entailed three GATF/SWOP, 133 line color <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> placed strategically at the lead, middle and trail edges of the sheet. The test set specific density standards to control to, and while these densities were being controlled, samples were obtained that represented a typical press run. Each of the <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> set-ups {{was treated as a}} separate press run, allowing the press operator to change the set densities to the next <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> once the samples were pulled. Five samples were averaged to obtain one sample for that particular sample set. That sample represented one of thirty for one entire press run. Every sample 2 ̆ 7 s average density and dot gain was determined, as well as its accuracy, precision, and range. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine difference between <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> data. Through the statistical tools listed above, the variability in each position of the <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> was determined. The results revealed that both the density and dot gain positions at the trail edge for cyan, black, magenta, and yellow were the most consistent, most precise, most accurate, as well as containing the smallest range of data. In conclusion, based on this study, the trail edge may be the most appropriate position on a form to consistently control a web offset press. The data that were obtained when the middle was being controlled also showed this to be a good location for the control of the press...|$|R

5000|$|Marionettes, or [...] "string puppets," [...] are {{suspended}} {{and controlled by}} a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> held from above by the puppeteer. The <b>control</b> <b>bar</b> can be either horizontal or vertical. Basic strings for operation are usually attached to the head, back, hands (to control the arms) and just above the knee (to control the legs). This form of puppetry is complex and sophisticated to operate, requiring greater manipulative control than a finger, glove or rod puppet. The puppet play performed by the Von Trapp children with Maria in The Sound of Music is a marionette show.|$|R

50|$|Both C and CX {{models are}} {{equipped}} with six pinwheels.

The C model had a fixed stepping system with a large wheel cycle due to the prime numbers of the six wheels. The CX-52 version has 6 pinwheels with 47 pins each and a flexible wheel movement system. The lug cage of both models contains 32 movable bars: 27 of the bars are used for encryption and the remaining 5 <b>bars</b> <b>control</b> the stepping of the pinwheels. The early CX models used the <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> also for encryption but due to complications in creating acceptable lug settings later CX models used these <b>bars</b> only for <b>controlling</b> of the wheel stepping.
