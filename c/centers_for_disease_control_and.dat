5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E

5|$|Rotavirus {{vaccines}} are licensed in over 100 countries, {{and more}} than 80 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination, almost half {{with the support of}} Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To make rotavirus vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur PATH, the WHO, the U.S. <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.|$|E
5|$|The US <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention and the World Health Organization {{state that}} a {{blood lead level}} of 10μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair {{development}} and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, {{and there is no}} known safe exposure level.

5|$|The storm {{affected}} a large {{region of}} the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds. The <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks. The National Climatic Data Center reported 19deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $12billion (1992USD), mostly in New England.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout the Department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The last {{cases of}} {{smallpox}} {{in the world}} occurred in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in Birmingham, UK in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978, after which Professor Henry Bedson, the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the university, committed suicide. All known stocks of smallpox were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities—the United States' <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention and Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|As {{attention}} {{to the role of}} sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.|$|E
