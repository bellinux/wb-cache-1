The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with liquid nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally discernible.|$|E
5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can. However, members of Portia have vision about as acute as {{the best of the}} jumping spiders, for example: the salticine Mogrus neglectus <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> prey and conspecifics up to 320millimetres away (42times its own body length), while P. fimbriata <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> these up to 280millimetres (47times its own body length). The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its own body length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E

5|$|Termites <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> nestmates and non-nestmates through {{chemical}} communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons {{released from the}} cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E

5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects UV {{light and}} this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
5|$|Five males {{collected}} from an M. vindex nest are {{presumed to be}} M. inquilina, but {{the similarities between the}} two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are darker, and two specimens show a reddish-brown colour {{at the base of the}} first gastric segment, a characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The genitalia is similar, but a more detailed study <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> these features among the two ants.|$|E
5|$|In one experiment, when offered live {{fruit flies}} (Drosophila virilis), {{salamanders}} choose {{the larger of}} 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3.

5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing and {{catching}} insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, they <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> the {{polarisation}} of light. Colour vision {{appears to}} vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E
5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that <b>can</b> <b>distinguish</b> between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E
