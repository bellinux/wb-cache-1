5|$|The {{proportional}} representation {{system for the}} House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, {{was the first major}} electoral reform under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals, as had previously been the case, voters <b>cast</b> <b>ballots</b> for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are {{selected on the basis of}} the parties' proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, that this new system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to <b>cast</b> <b>ballots</b> until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A.

The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} setting up the {{transitional}} government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors—persons who <b>cast</b> <b>ballots</b> for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based {{on the size of}} its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and <b>cast</b> <b>ballots,</b> to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates— according to allotted numbers assigned to each district.

25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the short ballot in the early 20th century, as {{described}} above, the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the general ticket. The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters <b>cast</b> <b>ballots</b> for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters <b>cast</b> <b>ballots</b> for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932. Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 {{and was one of the}} last states to switch to the short ballot.|$|E
