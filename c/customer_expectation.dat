These new gaps reflect the differences in the understanding of <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> by manager and front-line service providers and in <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and service providers' perception of such expectations. Using room service as the object for investigation, the present study provides empirical evidence indicating the existence of these gaps which have negative impact on overall service quality. The findings also disclose that the gap between <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and managers' perception of such expectations is much larger than the gap between <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and service providers' understanding of such expectations.

40|$|A good {{understanding}} of <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> {{is very important to}} service providers. Since the Chinese first came to South Africa and started their restaurant businesses. Chinese fine-dining restaurants have become more and more popular. Identifying the <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and Chinese fine-dining restaurant owner perceptions will help Chinese service providers to understand better the restaurant businesses. To ensure the development of the Chinese restaurant business in South Africa, {{it is very important to}} understand what South African customers want, whether there are differences between the Chinese restaurant owner perceptions of the service quality and South African <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> of the service quality. This would depend on the customers’ preferences, and provide a positive contribution to customer decision-making. Therefore, it is essential to understand and identify what is <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> are, what the management perceptions are and the differences between them. 5 In order to achieve the objectives of the research, the following approach was followed: Factors that influence the <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and management perceptions are explained. Five factors used to measure the service quality of Chinese fine-dining restaurants are identified, namely reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, tangibility. The responses to the questionnaire were collected and analysed to determine the extent to which factors are both important to <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and management perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this article is to discuss the {{dynamics}} of formatting <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> in financial services-under two models for assessing cumulative learning in <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b> The first model is a classical Bayesian one, the second model is an entirely new application of the Repetitive Stochastic Guesstimation (RSG) algorithm. The traditional assumption of postulating that empirical data have been generated from an underlying probability has been questioned even by orthodox theorists. Our research strategy is to cast this problem in the form of an optimization problem and show that RSG algorithm will produce a relevant solution for the original economic problem.

40|$|In {{a product}} {{category}} based on dynamic technology, new products enter {{the market in}} rapid succession, and the competitive situation changes almost daily. Because technological features of available products tend to improve while prices tend to decline, <b>customers</b> develop <b>expectations</b> that may influence their purchase decisions. We model the impact of <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> regarding and on product market share in the personal computer industry, finding significant nonlinear effects of both. These effects are observed when actual product price and/or technology differ from expectations by a threshold amount. Our results suggest implementable implications for high-tech product managers: in particular, price and technology should meet, but not exceed, <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b> This {{does not mean that}} managers should strive for mediocrity; rather, continuous improvement should be implemented so that product development efforts lead <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b> competitive strategy, pricing research, product policy...|$|R

In order to meet customers' needs, the core product is an important element that attracts people to buy the firm's product. In an international marketing research conducted by University of Southern California, it has been founded that customers and professionals usually emphasize on service characteristics such as heterogeneous products (variation in standards among providers, frequently even among different locations of the same firm) and inseparability from consumption. This can show how important of having a core product is to a firm, {{in order to meet}} <b>customer</b> <b>expectation.</b> And this has to be done only by injecting money to do R&D.|$|E

The railway network as measured by track km remained more or less the same, the increase in traffic and <b>customer</b> <b>expectation</b> put severe constraints on all the resources like track, rolling stock sheds, and workshops.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore {{whether there is a}} “fulfilment gap” between <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and fashion retail {{strategies}} over the purchase journey. Specifically this study focuses on two small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME) retail firms in Iceland. Design/methodology/approach – An on-going case study is still being conducted. We present here our initial findings from interviews with two Icelandic fashion retailers and a customer survey of 237 female customers. The work is designed to explore the strategies being applied by these retailers. Our aim is to determine if they are actually fulfilling <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> over the purchase journey. In the first research phase we developed an “Integrated Omni Channel Purchase Journey” framework. We sought to advance this through the second phase – interviews and a survey linked to an on-going case study. From the interplay of theory and data we aim in this paper to report our preliminary advancement of the framework and provide initial answers to three research questions. Findings –The initial findings indicate a “fulfilment” gap between <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> and retail strategy. For instance, while customers expect cross-channel fulfilment and customized solutions, Icelandic fashion retailers are currently only applying a multi-channel strategy. This lacks both integration and customized solutions. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited with respect to its generalizability. It focuses on the relationship between two fashion retailers and female fashion customers. However the findings provide SME fashion retailers with a starting point for retail strategy development in omni-channel environments. This will enable them to begin to identify {{the extent to which they}} are currently meeting their target <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> (throughout the purchase journey). Future research will collect more rigorous case data to fully test the framework. Practical implications – Fashion retailers need to build their capabilities to meet the technology- driven <b>expectations</b> of their <b>customers.</b> They are applying social pressure for new distribution channels and customized solutions. It is therefore recommended that fashion retailers analyse target <b>customer’s</b> <b>expectations</b> throughout the fashion purchase journey and adapt their retail strategies accordingly. Originality/value – To this date there is no research available on the retail strategies’ being applied by the fashion sector in Iceland and how they meet fashion <b>customer</b> <b>expectations.</b> The findings indicate that retailers have an opportunity to meet target <b>customer</b> <b>expectations</b> better by providing cross channel fulfilment and customized solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of service economy is naturally the front liner for the {{emergence of}} services marketing. The unique features of services such as intangibility, inseparability and heterogeneity make the assessment of <b>customer</b> <b>expectation</b> very pertinent.

Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were employed for the test of the hypotheses. The findings revealed that <b>customer</b> <b>expectation</b> has significant effect on both customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. In addition, descriptive statistic revealed that augmented services such as baby sitter and internet reserving system are highly expected by customers.
