The campus was orientated on a north–south axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own <b>concrete</b> <b>form,</b> some with pilotis, others with shells.|$|E

The topics of interest fall short of the logical rigor that is found in formal computational semantics, attempting to identify and characterize the kinds of issues relevant to human understanding of language.

25|$|Human {{beings have}} often sought to give <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> to our {{powerful}} collective longing for peace. After World War I, that longing {{led to the}} League of Nations and numerous rules and taboos designed to govern warfare itself. Of these, the most important was the proscription against attacking and killing civilian non-combatants even in times of war. However, {{the second half of}} the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica was the point of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol. We must find ways to communicate to future generations the history of horror that began with Guernica....|$|E

The project has an efficient thermal envelope constructed with insulated <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> (ICF) walls, geothermal water source heat pumps, low-flow fixtures, and features daylighting extensively throughout. It is also the first truly wireless school in Kentucky.|$|E

For those who find the piece less successful, however, Rockwell's desire to give <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> to an ideal produces a strained result.

According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> {{that can be easily}} grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will. She described her own approach to literature as [...] "romantic realism".|$|E

500|$|In 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie {{applied for}} a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched {{property}} owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would {{find it hard to}} understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game {{became one of the first}} board games to use a [...] "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of [...] "ownership" [...] of a place on a game board, such that something would happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives. This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.|$|E

Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira.

2500|$|The Cardinals were in {{no hurry}} to begin the scrutinies, since the French {{cardinals}} had not yet arrived. [...] They occupied their time with the Electoral Capitulations (a sort of party platform, to which they all could and would subscribe) until 5 October. [...] These discussions helped to reveal and give <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> to the agreements and disagreements among the cardinals. The French arrived on the morning of 6 October, and voting began {{on the morning of the}} 8th. [...] Two cardinals, Numai and Cybo, were confined to bed. [...] Cardinal Carvajal (called Santa Croce), the Dean of the College of Cardinals, received ten votes on the first scrutiny, and managed ultimately to get as many as twelve. [...] It was immediately apparent that Cardinal Pompeo Colonna could not attract votes. [...] He therefore turned his attention to frustrating Cardinal de' Medici's ambitions and to promoting an Imperial candidate. His choice was Cardinal Domenico Giacobazzi.|$|E

2500|$|Von Eckardt's {{views on}} the FBI {{building}} changed radically between his initial assessment in 1964 and the structure's completion in 1975. At its dedication, he called the building Orwellian, [...] "alien {{to the spirit of}} the capital", and an [...] "overly dramatic and utterly miscarried play of forms". He criticized the interior as [...] "a drab factory with harsh light, endless corridors, hard floors and no visual relief". Von Eckardt did not blame the architects for the building's design, but rather the CFA. Paul Goldberger, writing for the New York Times, echoed Von Eckardt's harsh assessment. He felt the design banal and dull, [...] "an arrogant, overbearing <b>concrete</b> <b>form</b> that dares the visitor to come close." [...] He noted that the high, strong massing on E Street was reminiscent of a similar rear massing on Le Courbousier's Priory at Sainte Marie de La Tourette, but lacked the dramatic hill behind it to give the massing a counterpoint. [...] "This building," [...] he concluded, [...] "turns its back on the city and substitutes for responsible architecture a pompous, empty monumentality that is, in the end, not so much a symbol as a symptom—a symptom of something wrong in government and just as wrong in architecture." ...|$|E
