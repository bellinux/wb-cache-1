25|$|In {{the fusion}} process, the lipid head group {{is not only}} {{involved}} in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent {{of the effects of}} ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close apposition more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly curved bridge must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted micelle phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a <b>curved</b> <b>structure</b> present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{important}} archaeological application of exploring cultural heritage objects, {{in this paper}} we study the challenging problem of automatically segmenting <b>curve</b> <b>structures</b> that are very weakly stamped or carved on an object surface {{in the form of a}} highly noisy depth map. Different from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly learn and utilize more curve geometry and pattern information for addressing this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of <b>curve</b> <b>structures</b> and at each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of <b>curve</b> <b>structures.</b> In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of depth images scanned from unearthed pottery sherds dating to the Woodland period of Southeastern North America.

40|$|Curved {{beams and}} panels {{can often be}} found as {{structural}} components in aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering systems. When <b>curved</b> <b>structures</b> are subjected to dynamic loads, they are susceptible to dynamic instabilities especially dynamic snap-through buckling. The identification of the dynamic stability boundary that separate the non-snap and post-snap responses is hence necessary for the safe design of such structures, but typically requires extensive transient simulations {{that may lead to}} high computation cost. This paper proposes a scaling approach that reveals the similarities between dynamic snap-through boundaries of different structures. Such identified features can be directly used for fast approximations of dynamic stability boundaries of slender <b>curved</b> <b>structures</b> when their geometric parameters or boundary conditions are varied.
