40|$|We are {{grateful}} to Prof. P. Tordo, Dr. O. Ouari and Dr. G. Casano (Aix-Marseille Universite, France) for providing the biradicals used in the DNP NMR experiments. International audienceWe show how dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy {{can be used to}} characterize polymorphs and solvates of organic solids. We applied DNP to three polymorphs and one hydrated form of the asthma drug molecule theophylline. For some forms of theophylline, sample grinding and impregnation with the radical-containing solution, which are necessary to prepare the samples for DNP, were found to induce polymorphic transitions or desolvation between some forms. We present protocols for sample preparation for solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) DNP experiments that avoid the polymorphic phase transitions in theophylline. These protocols include <b>cryogrinding,</b> grinding under inert atmosphere, and the appropriate choice of the impregnating liquid. By applying these procedures, we subsequently demonstrate that two-dimensional correlation experiments, such as H- 1 -C- 13 and H- 1 -N- 15 HETCOR or C- 13 -C- 13 INADEQUATE, can be obtained at natural isotopic abundance in reasonable times, thus enabling more advanced structural characterization of polymorphs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>cryogrinding</b> on chemical stability of the diuretic agent furosemide and its mixtures with selected excipients. Methods Furosemide was ground at liquid nitrogen temperature for 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Mixtures of furosemide-PVP and furosemide-inulin (1 : 1) were milled under cryogenic conditions. Materials were analyzed by XRD, UPLC, MS and NMR. Results Upon increasing the milling time, a significant build-up of an unidentified impurity 1, probably the main degradation product, was noticed. Cogrinding of furosemide with PVP and inulin worsened chemical stabilization of the pharmaceutical. The main degradation product formed upon cryomilling was subsequently identified as 4 -chloro- 5 -sulfamoylanthranilic acid (CSA). Based on some theoretical considerations involving specific milling conditions, the milling intensity and an expected specific milling dose have been calculated. Results indicate that cryogenic grinding is capable to initiate mechanically induced decomposition of furosemide. Conclusions Cryogenic grinding can activate and accelerate not only structural changes (solid state amorphization) but also chemical decomposition of pharmaceuticals. A cryogenic milling device {{should be considered as}} a chemical reactor, where under favourable conditions chemical reactions could be mechanically initiated...|$|E
40|$|Two {{techniques}} of extraction of essential oils (Steam distillation assisted by microwave (SDAM) and hydrodistillation assisted by microwave (HDAM)) are respectively advanced steam distillation (SD) and hydrodistillation techniques (HD), {{in which a}} microwave oven {{is used in the}} extraction process. They are considered as accelerated techniques extraction performed at atmospheric pressure. The <b>cryogrinding</b> (CG) showed a difference on the yields and aromatic profile comparing to the sample grinding. Isolation and concentration of volatile compounds are performed by a single stage for the extraction of volatile oil from Algerian (Sahara) Cuminum cyminum seeds (CCS). The chemical composition of the essential oil of this plant as a function of extraction time was also studied. The major components and family classes showed a significant variation with the extraction time. Gas chromatography (GC), GCxGC-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) ] were utilised for qualitative and quantitative analysis of essential oils extracted by these two methods. The major compounds are cumin aldehyde (HDAM-CG: 20. 50 - 53. 35 %, SDAM-CG: 21. 68 66. 6 %), p-cymene (HDAM-CG: 14. 1 - 37. 54 %, SDAM-CG: 6. 06 - 20. 18 %), β-pinene (HDAM-CG: 4. 53 - 14. 74 %, SDAM-CG: 4. 3 - 32. 65 %) and γ-terpinene (HDAM-CG: 1. 26 - 14. 70 %, SDAM-CG: 5. 13 - 18. 23 %).

40|$|Hydrodistillation {{assisted}} by microwave (HDAM) and steam distillation {{assisted by}} microwave (SDAM) of Curcuma longa L. rhizome (CL) and Carum carvi fruits (CC) were investigated. The {{effect of the}} <b>cryogrinding</b> (CG) showed differences in yields and composition of volatile oils compared with classical grinding. HDAM–CG (CL: 1. 20 %, CC: 1. 25 %) and SDAM–CG (CL: 1. 45 %, CC: 1. 75 %) allowed extraction of substantial amounts of volatile oils in less time compared with HDAM (CL: 0. 6 %, CC: 1. 00 %) and SDAM (CL: 0. 90 %, CC: 1. 00 %). In addition, the major amounts of volatile oils were globally obtained during the first 5 and 10 minutes of extraction for CL and CC, respectively. A kinetic study of essential oils extraction from CL and CC was quantitatively performed. The composition of the major components and family classes present a significant variation with the extraction time. Essential oils extracted by these two methods were quantitatively (yield) and qualitatively [aromatic profile by gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) ] analyzed. There were differences, especially in the major compounds ar-turmerone (HDAM: 46. 00 – 57. 96 %, HDAM–CG: 30. 85 – 60. 32 %) and β-turmerone (HDAM: 14. 43 – 16. 74 %, HDAM–CG: 10. 46 – 15. 77 %) for CL, and limonene (HDAM: 23. 61 – 56. 97 %, HDAM–CG: 38. 04 – 43. 00 %) and carvone (HDAM: 36. 19 – 64. 54 %, CC–CG: 53. 65 – 56. 31 %) for CC.
