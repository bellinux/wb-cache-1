500|$|Among {{the comic}} themes during the Chicago years {{was that of}} {{courtship}} and marriage, with much humor made from the supposed aversion of many Irish males to the altar. The local plumber, Dacey, does not fall to matrimony until he enters the wrong city building and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a marriage license rather than one for a dog. The fireman Hannigan's courting of Dolan's daughter is broken off after fifteen years when he is embarrassed by her giving him a wig as a Christmas present to cover his bald head; but for {{that she would be}} courted still.

[...] Tom Shippey writes that [...] "Saruman talks like a politician ... No other character in Middle-earth has Saruman's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved, and none <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> words as empty as 'deploring', 'ultimate', worst of all, 'real'.

[...] Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King Dáin, which Shippey believes represent Tolkien's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf.|$|E

Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys {{is the way he}} is". He added that there would be [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While they wonder who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> that.

But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E

Sify's critic stated that Murugadoss [...] "has made a complete entertainer that blends with Vijay's mass image, thanks to his racy script", calling it a [...] "perfect Diwali entertainer". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu commented: [...] "One of the first promos of the film, with snapshots of Mumbai, lurking terror, the antagonist threatening Vijay to which he responds 'I am waiting' went viral on social networks.

For the same newspaper, Karthik Subrmaniam wrote, [...] "One can only wonder just how much better Thuppakki would have been if it had done away with the song-and-dance-and-romance and such trappings." [...] Haricharan Pudipeddi of The New Indian Express said, [...] "Most of the characters are made to look dumb as Vijay steals all the attention.

500|$|According to the Birmingham Mail end-of-season review, [...] "for most of {{the season}} no other midfielder could {{challenge}} [...] in terms of energy, tackles, clearances or blocks", and he was a close second to 16-goal striker Clayton Donaldson as their player of the season. Nevertheless, he lost his starting spot to new signing Maikel Kieftenbeld, and Rowett thought that his anxiety to regain his place in the team made him try too hard when coming on as a substitute. After a strong performance in the League Cup against Premier League Aston Villa, Davis started and played well in two consecutive away wins, but his next start did not come until mid-March. Away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, he came close to scoring the winning goal and, according to Rowett, [...] "controlled the match with his physicality. He gets about the place, he holds people off and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the ball. He does that really, really well." [...] The club promptly took up their option for a further year on his contract, and Rowett said they were considering an extension until 2018. Davis scored his first goal of the season in the penultimate match, a [...] "brilliant half-volley {{from the edge of the}} area" [...] after the ball was not fully cleared by the defence, to secure a draw at home to Middlesbrough. Although he started a third fewer Championship matches than in 2014–15, he established himself in the team towards the end of the season because of what the Birmingham Mail viewed as the stability he gave to the side.|$|E

[...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out."

2500|$|To the Manor Born {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} village of Grantleigh, in Somerset near the fictional town of Marlbury. The series begins with the funeral of Marton (sic) fforbes-Hamilton, the Lord of the Manor [...] of Grantleigh. Audrey, his widow (and {{apparently}} also his cousin), is far from distraught, as she now has control of the Grantleigh estate, which her family the fforbes-Hamiltons have controlled for 400 years. Her joy is short-lived though, as her solicitor Arnold Plunkett informs her that Marton was bankrupt and that the manor will have to be sold to pay off the debts. Audrey tries to buy back the manor at auction, but is outbid. The new Lord of the Manor is Richard DeVere, a recently widowed self-made millionaire who started his career on an East End fruit barrow and founded the [...] "Cavendish Foods" [...] supermarket chain, who to Audrey is simply a [...] "grocer". DeVere brings his domineering mother, who is soon nicknamed by Audrey 'Mrs. Poo', her full name being Maria Jaroslava Vladimira Martinka Polouvicka. She reveals to Audrey, who does not like foreigners, that she and her son came to Britain in 1939 from Czechoslovakia, and that Richard, whose real name is Bedrich Polouvicka, is half-Polish (on his late father Lazlo's side) and half-Czechoslovakian. Mrs. Polouvicka tries hard to fit into British country life, but her accent often leads to many mispronunciations and she frequently <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> sayings from her [...] "old Czechoslovakia" [...] (even though Czechoslovakia is not so old for her; she was 15 years old when the country was created in 1919).

2500|$|After {{performing}} Camelot for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger {{who asked}} him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film. The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname [...] "Le Scandale") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the [...] "Most Talked About Movie Ever Made". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40million. During filming, Burton met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, [...] "Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?" [...] Taylor later recalled, [...] "I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a line like that." [...] Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her [...] "Miss Tits" [...] and opined to Mankiewicz, [...] "I expect she shaves"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first for Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: [...] "Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?". Burton replied [...] "Both".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1965 election, he very briefly served as {{parliamentary}} secretary (junior minister) to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1965, {{but the two}} fell out when Chrétien advised him against seeking an election in 1965, predicating (correctly) that Pearson would not win the majority he was seeking. When Pearson recruited his [...] "Three Wise Men" [...] consisting of Jean Marchand, Gérard Pelletier and Pierre Trudeau into the cabinet, Chrétien was offended at {{the way he was}} by-passed, telling Pearson he deserved to be promoted to the cabinet. Starting in 1966 served for a more substantial period of time as the parliamentary secretary to Minister of Finance, Mitchell Sharp. Sharp was to serve as Chrétien's mentor and patron, and it was largely through Sharp's influence that Chrétien rose up the ranks. Like his mentor Sharp, Chrétien was identified with {{the right wing of the}} Liberal Party in the 1960s, and it was not until the 1970s that Chrétien first started to become identified with the left-wing of the Liberals. Sharp was quoted as saying about his protégé in an interview with Peter C. Newman: Jean is not accustomed to reading as much as I am or you are, and therefore we tend to judge him on that sort of basis. We read all sorts of things; Chrétien doesn't. Chrétien's reading is limited. He has an instinctive approach, and faced with a problem, he's always <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> sensible answers, and that's why I say he never has to eat his words. In 1967, Chrétien visited western Canada for the first time, which he was curious to see. In Vancouver he declared in a speech about the demands for more powers for Quebec being made by Union Nationale Premier Daniel Johnson that [...] "whose who are in favor of a special status [...] are often separatists who don't want to admit they are separatists", which caused an uproar in la belle province with Johnson saying he just wanted more powers for Quebec, not independence. When the French President Charles de Gaulle in a speech during his visit to Montreal said [...] "vive le Québec libre!" [...] ("Long Live A Free Quebec!") and compared English-Canadians to the Nazis, Chrétien in a cabinet meeting demanded that Pearson have de Gaulle formally declared persona non grata and expelled, instead of politely asking him to leave Canada, which was the course that Pearson followed.|$|E
