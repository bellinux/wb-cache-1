The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the effects of surface roughness in normalized steel and the effects of abnormal surface layer in <b>carburized</b> steel on the fatigue strength that is considered as the limit of no crack initiation. Normalized and <b>Carburized</b> test pieces with crowned round notches were used in the fatigue tests, the normalized test pieces have different surface roughnesses and the <b>carburized</b> test pieces have different surface microstructures on the notch surface. The changes in fatigue strength due to the differences in the notch surface roughness and surface microstructure were investigated. As the conclusions, fatigue strength will be certainly increased by decreasing the surface maximum height, and removing the abnormal surface layer formed during <b>carburized</b> treatment leads to a marked increase in fatigue strength...|$|R

25|$|The carbon {{can come}} from a solid, liquid or gaseous source; if {{it comes from a}} solid source the process is called pack <b>carburizing.</b> Packing low carbon steel parts with a {{carbonaceous}} material and heating for some time diffuses carbon into the outer layers.

Test pieces for the tests were <b>carburized</b> till the different depth {{in order to examine}} influence of depth of carburization on the deformation of steel during heat treatment operation. Carburization was performed on the one surface of test pieces seeking to analyze extent of acted normal stresses to autodeformation of steel. Different bending loads were applied for analyzed steel from 5  MPa to 100  MPa. Deflection of test pieces was analyzed. The obtained results proved that size and direction of deflection were affected by depth of carburization. Particular results of stretched and compressed surface examination showed different behavior of test pieces during tempering process. Test pieces, which undergo deformation at the beginning of martensitic transformation, after unloading bend further. When tempered test pieces with assimetrically <b>carburized</b> layer bend during hardening, its direction and extent of autodeformation depend on depth of carburization and tempering temperature. Kinetics of autodeformation (during tempering) is affected by difference of volume changes in the <b>carburized</b> part and in the unaffected low carbon part of specimen, and similarly by decomposition of retained austenite in the <b>carburized</b> part.

25|$|<b>Carburizing</b> is {{a process}} used to case-harden steel with a carbon content between 0.1 and 0.3 wt% C. In this process steel is {{introduced}} to a carbon rich environment and elevated temperatures for {{a certain amount of}} time, and then quenched so that the carbon is locked in the structure; one of the simpler procedures is repeatedly to heat a part with an acetylene torch set with a fuel-rich flame and quench it in a carbon-rich fluid such as oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This <b>carburizing</b> package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Variations in case {{hardness}} of <b>carburized</b> steels can occur, especially due to {{the high}} content of carbon giving rise to retained austenite formation. This paper studies the residual stresses and surface roughness variations after shot peening applied to <b>carburized</b> and quenched AISI P 20 tool steel. In order to analyze the effect of carbon content, and consequently the hardness of pieces, specimens were <b>carburized</b> in the same batch, followed by different grinding operations, resulting on the removal of 0. 3 and 1. 0 mm of the original <b>carburized</b> case. The surface roughness was analyzed using the Rz parameter. The residual stresses were measured by X-ray diffraction. The variation of hardness from 650 to 850 HV was barely significant, for both compressive residual stresses as to the Rz values. These findings have implications in the quality control requirements for case hardened components and they {{are discussed in the}} light of technological applications...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of <b>carburized</b> components such as automotive transmission gears is very complex due to hardness and microstructure difference, residual stresses and multi-axial stress states developed between {{the case and}} the core.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the fatigue strength of <b>carburized</b> gear steel chemically vapor deposited with titanium carbide, and to clarify the main effect of <b>carburized</b> gear steel coated with titanium carbide on fatigue strength, including comparison with noncoated steel.

Smooth specimen, that is, flat plates and spur gear, module 4 with number of teeth 55, were supplied to fatigue test. Residual stress in TiC surface layer and substrate was detected by X-ray diffraction method. It is concluded that main effect on fatigue strength of chemically coated steel on <b>carburized</b> steel is substrate hardness near surface layer, and residual stress in titanium carbide layer doesn't effect prominently on fatigue strength.

2500|$|The term {{case-hardening}} {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the carburization process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel work piece is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based case-hardening compound. This is collectively known as a <b>carburizing</b> pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into solid steel, and a typical depth of surface hardening with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern <b>carburizing,</b> such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E

This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the wear behavior of <b>carburized</b> JIS SNCM 415 Ni-Cr-Mo steel being cryotreated and followed by carbide spray coating for achieving improvement in wear resistance.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, ironworkers in Western Europe had {{developed}} the cementation process for <b>carburizing</b> wrought iron.

[...] During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing cement steel or blister steelalso known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source. [...] The earliest place where this process was used in England was at Coalbrookdale from 1819, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavatedin 20012005).
