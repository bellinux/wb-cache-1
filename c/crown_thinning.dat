50|$|There {{are three}} {{other species of}} Australian babbler which are similar in appearance; The white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus), the chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) and the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis). The white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is {{considered}} most similar because of its size; however it can be distinguished by its thinner eyebrows {{and the lack of}} a sharp demarcation between the white breast and brown belly (which is diagnostic of Hall's Babbler). The chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) has a distinctive chestnut <b>crown,</b> <b>thinner</b> eyebrows, and white tips to the wing coverts; it also lacks a sharp demarcation between the breast and belly. The considerably larger grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) also has thick white eyebrows, but has a distinctive grey crown and a large rufous patch in the spread wing.|$|R

'Discovery' {{performed}} {{very poorly}} in government trials http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/opp4055?opendocument in Alberta, Canada, failing completely at {{five out of}} six sites. Moreover, the survivors developed a very poor branching pattern requiring pruning to strengthen crotches. 'Discovery' fared better in trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, which considered it [...] "quite hardy", but the tree was criticized for its comparatively slow growth and need for continued <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> when young, the latter factor largely disqualifying it as a street tree. Nonetheless, a number of trees have been established in the Minneapolis Parks system. The species does not sucker from roots.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of canopy fuel characteristics in five different forest types provided a unique dataset for simulating the effects of various stand manipulation treatments on canopy fuels. Low thinning, low thinning with commercial dbh limit, and <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> had similar effects on canopy bulk density (CBD) and canopy fuel load (CFL), but only the strict low thinning significantly affected canopy base height (CBH). In four of five sampled stands, CBD and CFL responded linearly to increasing treatment intensity in those three thinning treatments. The ponderosa-pine/Douglas-fir stand, with its significant understory component, showed little change in CBD with the commercial limit and <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> treatments. The diameterlimit harvest exhibited little consistency among sites and, hence, {{it is not a}} good silvicultural tool for creating canopy fuel reduction prescriptions. Due to fire-induced mortality, crown scorch (from prescribed fire) was more effective than mechanical pruning (to an equivalent height) at modifying canopy fuel characteristics. At achievable scorch and pruning heights, neither treatment had a significant effect on CBD or CFL...|$|E

30|$|Although {{the cause}} for forest {{disturbance}} was not known, <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> (induced by disturbance) seemed to change ant community. This slight disturbance led {{to an increase in}} abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, but a decrease in that of disturbance-intolerant species; as a result, the disturbance decreased richness and changed functional structure of ant community. Ants in forests forage in soils, ground, and vegetation. Their main foraging layers and favorable environments for dwelling vary among species, so the vertical niche differentiation among ant species leads to the bifurcated responses (decrease or increase) of ant species to forest disturbance, which is deeply linked to environmental changes (i.e., increase of light intensity, wind, understory vegetation, decrease of soil humidity, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Root {{diseases}} {{were evaluated}} on the Reuben's Reserve, Nez Perce Indian Reservation, Idaho. Nineteen trees adjacent to two suspected root disease centers were pushed with a D- 6 tractor to expose their root systems.

40|$|Widespread forest decline {{has been}} {{documented}} in Europe and NE-U. S. A. (Johnson, 1987; Woodman, 1987). This decline increases with increasing altitude (Mc-Laughlin, 1985). One hypothesis to explain the decline and its altitude dependence is that excessive proton input has a deleterious effect upon tree growth. Acid input to the foliage and soil via wet and dry deposition may be {{a major factor in}} causing decline directly or indirectly by predisposing the tree to additional biotic and/or abiotic stress factors. The maintenance of a favorable water status is a priority for continued growth and survival, and many of the symptoms associated with forest decline (<b>crown</b> <b>thinning,</b> root necroses) may be expected to influence plant water status. This paper presents some of the results of a detailed study of the influence of acid mist on the water relations of red spruce seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Defoliation (<b>crown</b> <b>thinning)</b> {{is widely}} used as a rapid method of tree {{condition}} assessment. As a method {{that is based on}} subjective visual observation it might be influenced by statistically significant observer bias. Significant observer bias has been discovere in some countries. We analyzed the significance of observer bias occurring in the Finland's forest condition monitoring system. We analysed the data of three training courses held to the field personnel (2006, 2007, 2008). Our results indicate that some inconsistencies occur between observers, but these are still not systematic in nature. In conclusion, the detected observer biases are independent incidents, caused mainly by the observer perception during the single events. Therefore {{there is no need to}} make any systematic corrections for Finnish national visual tree defoliation assessments. We suggest that the best way to improve field assessments is the proper education and guidance of field personnel...|$|E
40|$|Grey alder (Alnus incana) can {{be found}} in the Alpine region as a coloniser of {{alluvial}} lands along mountain brooks and streams or in dense thickets above the forest line. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, a leaf rust with high disease incidence and severity was recorded on this species in the Campelle valley, a narrow Alpine valley in the mountain range of Lagorai, in Trentino Alto-Adige, Italy.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{girdling}} were analysed in a sessile oak (Quercus petraea Matts. Leibl.) forest with an 80 -year-old coppice with standard structure in northern Spain. The study evaluated {{the viability of}} girdling {{as an alternative to}} felling trees during <b>crown</b> <b>thinning.</b> Eighty-four direct competitors of selected future crop trees were girdled by double notching and peeling. Three years after girdling, 100 % of the treated trees had died. Approximately half of the girdled trees did not resprout. The occurrence of basal sprouting was very low, and more than 35 % of the sprouts had very low vigour. No correlation was found between sprouting and the diameter of the girdled trees or the distance to their nearest neighbour. A negative relationship between the diameter of the girdled tree and the stage of decline was recognized. Girdling is an economic alternative to non-commercial thinning in oak stands and can be seen as an effective structural enrichment treatment...|$|E
40|$|Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) {{plantations}} {{have been}} established in Michigan with expectations of mixed final product goals: pulpwood, boltwood and possibly sawlogs. The effects of alternative treatments on tree and stand attributes were examined in: the Atlantic Mine trial, thinned in spring 2006 with three alternatives: (1) every fifth row removal plus <b>crown</b> <b>thinning,</b> (2) every third row removal plus <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> and (3) every third row removal plus thinning from below; the Crane Lake trial, thinned in fall 2004 with two alternatives: (1) every third row removal and (2) every third row removal plus thinning from above; the Middle Branch East trial, thinned in fall 2004 with two alternatives: (1) every third row removal plus one in three remaining trees and (2) every third row removal plus one in five remaining trees. All trials included control plots where no thinning was applied. The trials were established in the field as a randomized complete block experiments, in which individual trees were measured in 3 - 4 fixed-area plots located within each treatment unit. Growth responses of diameter at breast height, height, live crown length, stand basal area and stand volume were examined along with their increments. The Tukey multiple comparison {{test was used to}} detect significant differences between treatments in their effect on tree growth response. The results showed that diameter increment increased with increasing thinning intensity and was significantly larger in thinned plots compared to unthinned. Treatments did not substantially affect average tree height increment. Stand basal area increment was significantly larger in the control plot only the year after the harvest. Volume increment was significantly larger in controls, but did not differ considerably among remaining treatments. However, the ratio of volume increment to standing volume was significantly smaller in unthinned plots compared to thinned. Since thinning treatments in all trials hardly ever differed significantly in their effect on stand growth response, mainly due to the relatively short time of the evaluation, heavier thinnings should be favored due to higher volume increment rates and shorter time needed to reach desirable diameters. Nevertheless, economic evaluation based on obtained results will be conducted in the future in order to make final decisions about the most profitable treatment...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{physiological}} and economical {{impacts of the}} roadside trees pruning. The management of the roadside trees requires special care. Several factors interact with their growth and development, many trees presenting decay. In addition of aesthetic impact, this decay leads to high pruning costs, or even costs of replacing trees, and serious risk of tree fall. Although the situations {{are more and more}} complicated, an increasing lack in trees monitoring is observed. Due to neglected plantations, overpruning is very often adopted, although researchers have demonstrated for several years the damage of this practice. An economic study is here proposed and concerns a walkway of common limes (Tilia X europaea L.). It constituted a landscape reference mark of high patrimonial value. Trees were topped and their crowns were overpruned. The comparison of costs between <b>crown</b> <b>thinning</b> at regular intervals and topping shows a ratio of one to two or more and a patrimonial value loss of trees of nearly 85 /.

40|$|Fossils of the Early Cretaceous dinosaur, Nigersaurus taqueti, {{document}} for {{the first}} time the cranial anatomy of a rebbachisaurid sauropod. Its extreme adaptations for herbivory at ground-level challenge current hypotheses regarding feeding function and feeding strategy among diplodocoids, the larger clade of sauropods that includes Nigersaurus. We used high resolution computed tomography, stereolithography, and standard molding and casting techniques to reassemble the extremely fragile skull. Computed tomography also allowed us to render the first endocast for a sauropod preserving portions of the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum and inner ear, the latter permitting us to establish habitual head posture. To elucidate evidence of tooth wear and tooth replacement rate, we used photographic-casting techniques and <b>crown</b> <b>thin</b> sections, respectively. To reconstruct its 9 -meter postcranial skeleton, we combined and size-adjusted multiple partial skeletons. Finally, we used maximum parsimony algorithms on character data to obtain the best estimate of phylogenetic relationships among diplodocoid sauropods. Nigersaurus taqueti shows extreme adaptations for a dinosaurian herbivore including a skull of extremely light construction, tooth batteries located at the distal end of the jaws, tooth replacement as fast as one per month, an expanded muzzle that faces directly toward the ground, and hollow presacral vertebral centra with more air sac space than bone by volume. A cranial endocast provides the first reasonably complete view of a sauropod brain including its small olfactory bulbs and cerebrum.

40|$|Air pollution, principally in {{the form}} of {{photochemical}} ozone and deposition of nitrogen compounds, has significantly affected mixed conifer forests in the mountains of southern California. Foliar injury, premature needle abscission, <b>crown</b> <b>thinning,</b> and reduced growth and vigor have been well documented, particularly for ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and Jeffrey (P. jeffreyi Grev. and Balf.) pines on the western side of the pollution deposition gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains. Tree mortality of the more ozone-susceptible ponderosa and Jeffrey pines has led to alterations in stand composition, in favor of increased dominance by more ozone-resistant species such as incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens [Torr. ] Florin), white fir (Abies concolor [Gord. & Glend. ] Lindl.), and sugar pine (P. lambertiana Doug.). Increased rates of litter deposition, alterations in C/N ratios in litter and soil, and reductions in fine root biomass of trees have also altered the dynamics of biogeochemical processing in stands impacted by ozone and excess N deposition.

40|$|Hydrochemical budgets {{have been}} {{obtained}} for the 3 -yr period 1986 – 89 at Strengbach, a small granitic basin in the Vosges mountains (north-eastern France). Here, the spruce forest shows both yellowing and <b>crown</b> <b>thinning,</b> symptoms of forest decline. Water amount and surface water chemistry were monitored in each ecosystem compartment. Bulk precipitation is acidic. Some pollution episodes occur in winter and early spring, but the annual bulk deposition acidity is rather low. Throughfall however, is much more concentrated, particularly for H+ and associated strong acid anions. These inputs come as occult deposits which comprise major ecosystem inputs, as confirmed by the chloride balance for the catchment. Input-output budgets for the catchment indicate a net deficit of base cations, especially calcium. Sulfate also shows a net loss while N budget is well balanced. As the soil exchange capacity is nearly exhausted for base cations, and dominated by H+ and Al, the neutralization of incident acid inputs occurs mainly in the weathered bedrock. Silicate weathering processes lead to high losses of cations and of silica. Aluminium hydroxide is precipitated; however, bicarbonate remains very low indicating poorly-buffered surface water...|$|E
40|$|Trembling aspen {{recently}} experienced extensive <b>crown</b> <b>thinning,</b> branch dieback, {{and mortality}} across North America. Most decline regions experienced exceptionally severe drought preceding these episodes. Decline tended {{to occur in}} marginally suitable habitat, and climatic suitability decreased markedly in the period leading up to decline in almost all decline regions. Other factors, notably multi-year defoliation by tent caterpillars and stem damage by fungi and insects, also play substantial roles in decline episodes. Many severely affected stands have poor regeneration potential, raising concerns that increasing aridity could ultimately lead to widespread loss of aspen forest cover. The analysis indicates that exceptional droughts were {{a major cause of}} the decline episodes, especially in the drier regions, and that aspen is sensitive to drought in much of its range. Models suggest that we should expect substantial loss of suitable habitat within the current distribution, especially in the USA and Mexico. Particularly in the interior western U.

Further, they suggest approaches for deciding where to invest in management under changing climates, taking advantage of the diversity offered by changes in elevation and aspect...|$|E
