40|$|According to the {{classical}} economics theory, consumers are sovereign economic entities motivated to maximise their wellbeing. One strategy used to rationalise credit choices is through <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> intermediaries. While the literature recognises the notion that financial information intermediaries are exogenous in form and substance, the distinct influence of each information intermediary on consumer financial rationalisation has not been examined a priori - an objective of this study. Using a sample drawn from Melbourne residents, a proposed theoretical model was empirically tested. The results were suggestive that financial information intermediaries significantly influenced consumers&# 039; vehicle finance rationalisation. Furthermore, different financial information intermediaries seemed to have distinct influence on borrowers&# 039; vehicle finance decisions.

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{complexity}} of technical solutions, which encompass knowledge from different scientific fields, makes necessary, also for multi-disciplinary working teams, the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> sources. Indeed, tacit knowledge is essential, but often {{not sufficient to}} achieve a proficient problem solving process. Besides, the most comprehensive tool of the TRIZ body of knowledge, i. e. ARIZ, requires, more or less explicitly, the retrieval of new knowledge in order to entirely exploit its potential to drive towards valuable solutions. A multitude of contributions from the literature support various common tasks encountered when using TRIZ and requiring additional information; most of them hold the objective of speeding up the generation of inventive solutions thanks to the capabilities of text mining techniques. Nevertheless, no global study has been conducted to fully disclose the effective knowledge requirements of ARIZ. With respect to this deficiency, the present paper illustrates {{an analysis of the}} algorithm with the specific objective of identifying the different types of information needs that can be satisfied by patents. The results of the investigation lay bare the most significant gaps of the research in the field. Further on, an initial proposal is advanced to structure the retrieval of relevant information from patent sources currently not supported by existing methodologies and software applications, so as to exploit the vast amount of technical knowledge contained in there. An illustrative experiment sheds light on the relevance of control parameters as input terms for the definition of search queries aimed at retrieving patents sharing the same physical contradiction of the problem to be treated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the analysis of}} the request for <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and data on industrial emissions made publicly available on the web site of the Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea on integrated pollution prevention and control from large industrial installations, the so called “AIA Portal”. As a matter of fact, a huge amount of information on national industrial plants is already available on internet, although it is usually proposed as textual documentation or images. Thus, {{it is not possible to}} access all the relevant information through interoperability systems and also to retrieval relevant information for decision making purposes as well as rising of awareness on environmental issue. Moreover, since in Italy the number of institutional and private subjects involved in the management of the public information on industrial emissions is substantial, the access to the information is provided on internet web sites according to different criteria; thus, at present it is not structurally homogeneous and comparable. To overcome the mentioned difficulties in the case of the Coordinating Committee for the implementation of the Agreement for the industrial area in Taranto and Statte, operating before the IPPC permit granting procedures of the relevant installation located in the area, a big effort was devoted to elaborate and to validate data and information on characterization of soil, ground water aquifer and coastal sea at disposal of different subjects to derive a global perspective for decision making purposes. Thus, the present paper also focuses on main outcomes matured during such experience. Keywords—Public information, emissions into atmosphere, IPPC permits, territorial information systems...|$|E

Also, important issues such as charging method, fee amount and legislation process scheme were not mentioned. Thus more discussion was needed for successful implementation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{interoperation}} <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{from various}} data sources, internet services and applications {{is a central}} topic in scientific research. Due {{to the fact that}} today interoperation requires a high degree of user knowledge and domain expertise in order to combine services in life science applications, we need a smarter mediator-based interoperation. In particular, biologists cannot answer questions by <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>information</b> source. In combining heterogeneous services we identify two different processes: an explicit user-defined biological business process and an implicit mediation process. In this context, mediators are subjects of the latter process, defining transformation steps in order to solve syntactic as well as semantic mismatches. Computational biology is a diverse and dynamic field. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} standardize data structures and working processes. Thus, one should simplify or standardize the mediation process. Based on an analysis of related mediator architectures we give a precise characterization of mediators in general. We identify several features a mediator has to provide. A major factor is the introspection mechanism in order to expose features of previously unknown mediators. This mechanism should be processable by users and machines, as far as possible. Introspection has to discover syntactic as well as semantic knowledge of the capabilities of a concrete mediator. We build an ontology-based mediator profile for this purpose. It is useful not only for generating concrete interface descriptions but also for specialized registries. Qualified mediator registries are a first step towards a smart mediation process. Keywords: mediator-based interoperation, web services composition, ontologie...|$|R
