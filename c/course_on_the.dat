5|$|Beyond the airport, Highway 82 turns due south. It {{bends to}} the {{southeast}} to cross the new Maroon Creek Bridge, with the original, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, immediately to its south. At this point, with a golf <b>course</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side, the Aspen city limit begins to follow the road, {{and by the time}} it goes through a roundabout and passes the Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of Aspen. Another stream crossing, Castle Creek, brings the highway into the developed portion of the city.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, I-94 {{traverses}} rural land on {{the north}} side of Marshall. The freeway runs north of, and parallel to, the Kalamazoo River through eastern Calhoun County. It angles southeasterly toward Albion before returning to an easterly <b>course</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of town. I-94 crosses into western Jackson County before intersecting M-99. From there, it runs generally due east with a jog around Parma. West of the county airport, the Jackson business loop follows M-60 southward, and I-94 travels through the north side of Jackson. North of downtown, US127 merges in from the north and runs concurrently with I-94 around the city. Southeast of the Michigan State Prison, US127 departs to the south, and I-94 continues eastward through the rest of the county.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1929, MSHD started {{updating}} the route that US23 followed through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing {{was moved to}} {{the east side of the}} Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former <b>course</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near Ida, US23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach <b>course</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
