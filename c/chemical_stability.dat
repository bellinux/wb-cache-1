However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications.

Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity.

The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and <b>chemical</b> <b>stability</b> is superior.
