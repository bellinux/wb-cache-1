25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a <b>colour</b> <b>filter</b> of one class, a tier again, a <b>colour</b> <b>filter</b> of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|E
