50|$|Some brazes come in {{the form}} of trifoils, {{laminated}} foils of a carrier metal clad with a layer of braze at each side. The center metal is often copper; its role is to act as a carrier for the alloy, to absorb mechanical stresses due to e.g. differential thermal expansion of dissimilar materials (e.g. a <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> and a steel holder), and to act as a diffusion barrier (e.g. to stop diffusion of aluminium from aluminium bronze to steel when brazing these two).|$|E

50|$|Brazed {{hard metal}} joints are {{typically}} two to seven mils thick. The braze alloy joins {{the materials and}} compensates for the difference in their expansion rates. It also provides a cushion between the hard <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> and the hard steel, which softens impact and prevents tip loss and damage—much as a vehicle's suspension helps prevent damage to the tires and the vehicle. Finally, the braze alloy joins the other two materials to create a composite structure, much as layers of wood and glue create plywood. The standard for braze joint strength in many industries is a joint that is stronger than either base material, so that when under stress, one or other of the base materials fails before the joint.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, the American Company, Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. in Rockford, Illinois, {{developed}} the first carbide plate saw {{that was used}} to cut steel plates with carbide tipped circular saw blades. The positive cutting angle of the teeth minimized the life of the tool.Between 1963 and 1969, professor Pahlitzsch and engineers Arno Willemeit and Horst Doepcke at the University of Braunschweig, developed new <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> geometry with a negative cutting angle and a pair of teeth which split the chip into three parts. With this development in tip geometry it became economical to saw alloy steel billets.In 1969, Advanced Machine & Engineering Co. (AME) of Rockford, Illinois {{developed the}} first Billet Saw which used carbide tipped saw blades incorporating the [...] "Braunschweig geometry". AME began to build these machines for the company Metalcut Inc., another Rockford based company.The machine was sold on the global market under the name Metalcut 12 and was exhibited at trade shows in Milan, Italy and Chicago. Its cutting efficiency was eight times faster than band saws and four times faster than HSS circular cold saws and revolutionized the production sawing market.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{tangentially}} impacted potential coal-cutter bit shank materials against sandstone {{to investigate}} {{the potential of the}} materials to ignite natural gas by a friction-generated hot streak. The shank material samples were mounted in a 24 -in, 550 -lb flywheel, which was rotated at surface speeds of 400 to 900 sfpm. The sandstone was advanced toward the rotating flywheel at feed rates of 1 mil per impact. The atmosphere mixture was 7 vol pct natural gas in air. Three grades of polycarbonate resin, an ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene, and a zinc alloy (ZA 27) were among the potential materials. None of these materials caused ignition of the methane at any of the three test speeds (400, 600, and 900 sfpm), but the above materials do not have sufficient strength to hold a <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> during coal cutting. Of the materials having sufficient strength to hold a <b>carbide</b> <b>tip,</b> three nickel-based alloys proved less likely to cause a natural gas ignition than did iron-based alloys such as 4340 (a commonly used shank material for coal cutters) ...|$|E

30|$|The {{strength}} of polyurethane coatings adhesion {{to the concrete}} substrates was studied by the pull-off method based on ASTM D 4541. In this method, tensile Dollies were glued to the coating, when the adhesive cured, the force required to pull the coating off the surface was measured. To evaluate the scratch resistance of the coatings, based on ISO 1518 standard, a pen hardness tester was utilized. In this method, a pen-like device with a tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> was drawn over the coating’s surface with a defined constant pressure. A pressure needed for creating a scratch on the coatings’ surface was reported as the coatings’ scratch resistance.|$|E

50|$|In 1926, Krupp, a German company, {{developed}} carbide, a {{very hard}} mixture of sintered carbides of various heavy metals, especially tungsten carbide, used for cutting edges and dies. This new material revolutionized metal-removal or “chip-cutting” in manufacturing. In the 1950s, carbide was used in all machining processes except for sawing.In 1942, German scientists further developed carbide into cermet. After World War II, American universities developed this material further and began to market it as a cutting material for machine tools under the brand name Cermet.Sawing non-ferrous material, such as aluminum, brass, plastic and wood with <b>carbide</b> <b>tipped</b> circular saw blades began in the 1930s. However, attempts to cut ferrous material with <b>carbide</b> <b>tips</b> failed because the existing saws lacked the speed, rigidity, and innovation required to transfer high force with low vibration. These attributes are all necessary for carbide sawing. Also, the existing tooth geometry with positive cutting angles caused cracking of the <b>carbide</b> <b>tips</b> which were harder and consequently, more brittle than the high-speed steel (HSS) circular blades.|$|R
40|$|Drill wear {{monitoring}} is {{a challenging}} task and sensing the wear of a deep-hole drill even more demanding. An economical tool life cannot be obtained without tool wear monitoring. Gundrilling is a deep-hole drilling process much used in mass production, e. g. in the automotive industry. It is gererally known that cutting forces indicate {{what is going}} on in the drill during the drilling process. This study concentrates on examining how the feed force and torque change when the gundrill wears. In the tests, feed force and torque signals were collected during the drilling and tool wear was measured regularly. Single flute gundrills with a solid <b>carbide</b> <b>tip</b> and standard grinding were used. The test material was microalloyed steel. Based on these tests, the wear of the gundrill and tool condition can be discovered from the feed force and moment behavior; changes in the curves and statistical parameters.

40|$|The {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} thin KCl films deposited onto clean iron in ultrahigh vacuum are measured using a tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>tip.</b> A rapid decrease {{is found in}} the friction coefficient from 2 for clean iron to 0 : 27 0 : 03 after the deposition of 40 A of KCl. Based on previous contact resistance measurements, this was proposed to be due to the completion of the first layer of KCl. The first-layer KCl coverage was measured by adsorbing deuterium onto an iron surface partially covered by KCl, where deuterium selectively adsorbs onto the iron. This revealed that the first monolayer is complete after the deposition of 40 A of KCl and that the first-layer KCl film coverage ð 1 Þ KCl is given by ð 1 Þ KCl 1 expð 0 : 39 0 : 02 tÞ, where t is the film thickness. XPS data suggest that heating a KCl film to 550 K causes it to wet the surface. This leads to decreases in the friction coefficients for thin KCl films in accord with the idea that friction is reduced by the first monolayer of KCl on iron. Temperature-programmed desorption data indicate that KCl in the first monolayer is 5 kJ/mol more stable than the multilayer consistent with the wetting behavior. Finally, the kinetic data are analyzed to suggest that the first-layer film is 2. 6 A thick...|$|E
40|$|Cathode tips inade from d {{number of}} {{different}} materials were tested in a modular arcjet thruster {{in order to examine}} cathode phenomena. Periodic disassembly and examination, along with the data collected during testing, indicated that all of the tungsten-based materials behaved similarly despite the fact that in one of these samples the percentage of thorium oxide was doubled and another was 25 % rhenium. The mass loss rate from a 2 % thoriated rhenium cathode was found to be an order of magnitude greater than that observed using 2 % thoriated tungsten. Detailed analysis of one of these cathode tips showed that the molten crater contained pure tungsten to a depth of about 150 microns. Problems with thermal stress cracking were encountered in the testing of a hafnium <b>carbide</b> <b>tip.</b> Post test analysis showed that the active area of the tip had chemically reacted with the propellant. A 100 hour continuous test was run at about 1 kW. Pclst test analysis revealed no dendrite formation, such as observed in a 30 kW arcjet lifetest, near the cathode crater. The cathodes from both this test and a previously run 1000 hour cycled test displayed nearly identical arc craters. Data and calculations indicate that the mass losses observed in testing can be explained by evaporation. An increase in the redeposition rate with cathode recession was postulated to explain the observed decrease in mass loss rate with time. From measurements of the cathode crater size, estimates of the emitting area were made. These were used with realistic bounds on the crater temperature, material work function, and the electric field at the cathode to study the cathode emission process,. From this, simple calculations Suggest that both field and thermionic emission are involved...|$|E

40|$|A stable {{transferred}} arc {{was produced}} with plasmagas containing up to 20 percent molar TiCl$ sb 4 $ in argon, helium and argon/hydrogen mixtures. This {{was achieved by}} replacing the commonly-used thoriated tungsten cathode tip with a tantalum <b>carbide</b> <b>tip.</b> Thus, corrosive reactions at the cathode surface, which were shown to {{be the cause of}} the observed instability, were prevented. This allowed the characteristics of stable titanium tetrachloride plasmas in a transferred arc reactor to be investigated. Furthermore, an investigation was conducted into the feasibility of collecting titanium metal from the dissociated TiCl$ sb 4 $ molecule in the plasmagas. The titanium metal was collected in a molten bath, which also served as the anode in the transferred arc system. Three anode bath compositions were used in this study. Two of them, namely titanium and zirconium, were not able to reduce recombined titanium subchlorides in the bath. The third aluminum, was a reducing bath. When aluminum was used, about 60 percent of all titanium fed into the reactor was collected. Finally, phenomena occurring on the surface of a thoriated tungsten cathode were studied in a transferred-arc reactor using argon or helium as the plasmagas. The effect of cathode geometry on the rate and mechanisms of cathode erosion were investigated. It was shown that the surface temperature of flat-tip cathodes operating in argon is near the melting point of tungsten. On the other hand, the surface temperature of flat-tip cathodes operating in helium and pointed-tip cathodes operating in either helium or argon are near the boiling point of tungsten. Some of the material vapourized from the cathode was redeposited on the cathode surface, forming crystals whose morphology and composition depended on their distance from the arc root and the plasmagas composition...|$|E
