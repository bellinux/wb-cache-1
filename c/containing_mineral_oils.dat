40|$|Introduction Lipoid {{pneumonia}} is {{a clinical}} condition {{that may be}} initially asymptomatic or confused with an infectious or malignant lung disease. Objectives We report four cases of this pathological condition. Methods The first case concerned an 85 -year old woman with bilateral confluent pulmonary opacities, ground-glass type. Diagnosis {{was based on the}} cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid followed by its ultrastructural examination. The second case was a 47 -year-old man with an isolated pulmonary nodule, which was surgically removed; the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia was formulated {{on the basis of the}} histological and electron microscopy examination. The third case concerned a 73 -year-old woman, with bilateral hypodense areas at the bases of the lungs where FDG PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. Diagnosis was formulated by BAL cytology and electron microscopy examination. The fourth case was a 69 -year-old man, who performed a virtual colonoscopy for diverticulosis putting in evidence a round mass (3 cm in diameter) with two small peripheral nodules, located in the pulmonary left lower lobe. The histopathological examination of transthoracic biopsy confirmed a lipoid pneumonia. Results and conclusion In all four cases, it was put in evidence a prolonged use of a nasal decongestant <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oils.</b> In literature, the most cases described are characterized by a subclinical evolution and were presented as ground glass opacities which evolve, in the later phases, in an interstitial involvement or in a peripheral mass, simulating a lung tumour.

40|$|Environmental {{factors are}} likely {{contributing}} {{factors in the}} development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, for which etiologic factors are still poorly known. Mineral oils are efficient adjuvants which increase immunological responses and are used in animal immunization and for induction of different experimental autoimmune diseases including arthritis. The relationship between environmental exposure to mineral oil and the risk of developing RA {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Both animal experimental studies and human epidemiological studies were performed in order to investigate the possible role of mineral oils {{in the development of}} arthritis. A special emphasis was devoted to investigations of whether exposure to cosmetics <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> was associated with arthritis in a similar way as exposure to the mineral oils themselves. Experimental studies using the Dark Agouti rat (DA rat) showed that five of the eight tested common, commercial cosmetic products containing mineral oil induced arthritis in DA rats after immunisation in the skin. One cosmetic product, so called baby oil, also induced a mild transient arthritis after percutaneous exposure. Two types of epidemiological studies were performed to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to mineral oil and the risk of developing RA. First, a register-based cohort study was used to compare the cumulative incidence of RA between individuals with different occupations. The study population comprised of subjects who in 1980 lived in one of 13 Swedish counties and were born 1905 - 1945, and stated the same occupation in the census of 1960 and 1970. The study population was followed concerning hospital care for RA in 1981 - 1983 by linkage to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. A small increased risk of RA was observed in farmers, upholsterers, lacquerers, concrete workers and hair-dressers and in several occupations such as toolmakers, machinery and engine repairmen. Many of these occupations are associated with exposure to organic solvents and mineral oil, and this register study triggered our interest in initiating a case-control study investigating the environmental risk factors for RA, including the risk confined by mineral oil exposure. The case-control study comprised 1419 incident RA cases and 1674 controls. Men occupationally exposed to mineral oil were observed to have an increased risk of developing RA (Relative risk (RR) = 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 0 - 1. 7). Mineral oil exposure was associated with a particularly high risk of developing rheumatoid factor positive RA (RR = 1. 4, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 2. 0) and anti-citrulline positive RA (anti-CCP+RA) (RR = 1. 6, 95 % CI= 1. 1 - 2. 2). The highest risk of developing anti- CCP+RA (RR= 1. 7, 95 % CI= 1. 1 - 2. 6) was observed after exposure to hydraulic oil. The number of women occupationally exposed to mineral oils was too few to allow meaningful analyses. Association between cosmetic usage and the risk of developing RA was also investigated in the casecontrol study. However, no increased risk through use of common skin care products such as body lotions and skin creams was observed. Conclusion This thesis demonstrates that environmental exposure to mineral oil by itself, as well as being a component of cosmetics, can induce experimental arthritis in rats with certain genetic characteristics, and that occupational exposure to mineral oils is associated with an increased risk of developing RA. Our epidemiological study gave no evidence that use of cosmetics <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> was associated with an increased risk for RA...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between exposure to cosmetics, often <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> and the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study was performed against the background that occupational exposure to <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> has recently been shown to be associated with an increased risk for RA in man, and that injection of or percutaneous exposure to mineral-oil-containing cosmetics can induce arthritis in certain rat strains. METHODS: A population-based case-control study of incident cases of RA was performed among the population aged 18 to 70 years in a defined area of Sweden during May 1996 to December 2003. A case was defined as an individual from the study base, who received for the first time a diagnosis of RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Controls were randomly selected from the study base with consideration taken for age, gender and residential area. Cases (n = 1, 419) and controls (n = 1, 674) answered an extensive questionnaire regarding environmental and lifestyle factors including habits of cosmetic usage. The relative risk of developing RA was calculated for subjects with different cosmetic usage compared with subjects with low or no usage. Analysis was also performed stratifying the cases for presence/absence of rheumatoid factor and antibodies to citrulline-containing peptides. RESULTS: The relative risks of developing RA associated with use of cosmetics were all close to one, both for women and men, for different exposure categories, and in relation to different subgroups of RA. CONCLUSION: This study does not support the hypothesis that ordinary usage of common cosmetics as body lotions, skin creams, and ointments, often <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> increase the risk for RA in the population in general. We cannot exclude, however, that these cosmetics can contribute to arthritis in individuals carrying certain genotypes or simultaneously being exposed to other arthritis-inducing environmental agents.

40|$|Many {{different}} agents, including <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and silicone, {{have the}} capacity to act as immunological adjuvants, i. e., they can contribute to the activation of the immune system. Some adjuvants, including <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> are known to induce arthritis in certain strains of rats after intradermal injection or percutaneous application. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if common commercial cosmetic products <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> could induce arthritis in the highly susceptible DA (Dark Agouti) rat. Intradermal injection of five out of eight assayed cosmetic products without further additives resulted in arthritis with synovitis. One of the products induced a very aggressive arthritis, which had declined after 5 - 9 weeks. When this product was also assayed for arthritogenicity upon percutaneous administration, it induced a mild and transient arthritis in 5 out of 10 DA rats, whereas control animals showed no clinical signs of joint involvement. No arthritic reaction was seen in rats after peroral feeding with the most arthritogenic product or by intravaginal application of Freund's adjuvants. Silicone gel implants in DA rats did not cause arthritis. We conclude that <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> included in common commercially available products retain their adjuvant properties and are arthritogenic in the presently investigated arthritis-prone rat strain. There is yet no evidence that <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> present in cosmetics may contribute to arthritis in humans, but we suggest that this question should be subject to further investigation...|$|R

40|$|A key {{trend in}} the PVC market is to replace or {{decrease}} the amount of phthalate plasticisers used due to increasing health concerns. Therefore, the demand for non-phthalate based plasticisers is growing rapidly. <b>Mineral</b> <b>oils</b> are used {{in a variety of}} rubber and polymer applications as plasticisers; however, due to the lower polarity their applicability in PVC compounds is limited. Therefore, these materials are typically used as secondary plasticiser along with a primary for the purpose of improved properties and cost reduction. Some of the non-phthalate based solutions are fast fusing plasticisers, which act like solvents and have too rapid and too high plasticizing effect. This makes the compounding difficult and could cause problems in production. These substances have good compatibility with <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> and using them together in PVC compounds can help the compounding issue by reducing the solvent power and increasing the fusion time to a level where the production parameters are similar to compounding with phthalates.   The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> as a secondary plasticiser in a non-phthalate system for PVC. Four different grades of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and three non-phthalate plasticisers were used in compounding and compression moulding of PVC sample films. Mechanical, physical and chemical testing were done to assess the properties in a comparative study with phthalate plasticized PVC.   Tensile testing and hardness measurements showed that the <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> did not contribute with any plasticizing effect for the non-phthalate plasticisers tested in the study. The hardness was instead slightly increased for all the sample films that <b>contained</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> This indicates that the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> either is less efficient than the primary plasticiser or that it affects the primary plasticisers intramolecular shielding between the PVC chains.        The shrinkage test showed that the migration of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> was acceptable, especially the thicker grades of <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> had low migration.

Pseudodynamic images were acquired over multiple series using four scanners such that the histogram of pixel intensities varied enough to provoke variable image scaling from series to series.

The resulting pseudodynamic images and ADC maps were analyzed by eight centers of the Quantitative Imaging Network using 16 different SW tools to measure compartment-specific region-of-interest intensity. RESULTS: Images generated {{by one of the}} scanners appeared to have additional intensity scaling that was not accounted for by the majority of tested quantitative image analysis SW tools.

Continuous injection of the emulsion caused steady trapping and accumulation of emulsion droplets, which occurred {{despite the fact that}} the bead sizes were 250 - 500 mu m, whereas the average droplet size was similar to 30 mu m, as indicated by particle size analysis. By alternately injecting small banks of emulsion (0. 1 pore volume (PV)) and water (0. 23 - 0. 1 PV), the extent of emulsion droplet trapping could be controlled while achieving oil recovery. The effects of salt addition and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) /nanoparticle concentration were also investigated in terms of emulsion stability and oil recovery. The salt addition (1 wt%) more efficiently stabilized the droplets without significant coalescence and contributed to approximately 4 % more oil recovery than achieved in the absence of an emulsion system. The PVA/nanoparticle concentration indicated that the emulsion with a low concentration (0. 05 wt%) of PVA and a high concentration (3 wt%) of nanoparticles had greater stability and enhanced oil recovery compared with the opposite (a high concentration (0. 2 wt%) of PVA and low concentration (1 wt%) of nanoparticles). These results indicated that the addition of salt and PVA/nanoparticle concentration influenced oil recovery and emulsion stability. Oil recovery was related to emulsion stability.

40|$|Today, {{international}} laws forbid {{the use of}} Poly Chlorinated Biphenils (PCB) in new electrical equipments {{and have}} introduced restrictions for those already in service, filled with <b>mineral</b> and syntetic <b>oil,</b> when containing only few ppm of PCS. In Italy, {{a large number of}} chemical analyses have shown [1] that about the 25 % of the distribution transformers, filled with <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>contain</b> a PCB amount over the limit imposed by the new standards. This is due by {{the fact that in the}} 70 's the transformers, <b>containing</b> both <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> or PCB, were built using the same construction factory equipment, without a preliminary complete cleaning. To overcome this situation, recently different physical and chemical treatments for PCB decontamination of such used <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> have been proposed. This paper presents the performances of a new process [2], based on the dechlorination reaction of a PCB, as a consequence of the intimate contact between a contaminated oils and a solution of KOH in PolyEthilenGlycols (PEG), in presence of an anionic surfactant as reactor promoter. The same treatment allows to speed up the decontamination reaction below the recommended limit of 25 ppm. The present paper reports also experimental data on the electrical properties of such oils, showing the effects of the different treatment of PCB decontamination, with particular regard to ac dielectric strength, impulse breakdown, tn delta and partial discharge tests...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel and environmentally friendly process which leads to high performance porous UHMWPE membrane structures. We have successfully shown that: firstly, the addition of a non-toxic solvent <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> to UHMWPE leads to enhanced chain mobility, particle inter-facial cohesion by the solvation effect, Secondly, we have developed a two-stage compression process which enables the formation of biaxially oriented porous films that are both stiff and ductile. In the first stage of the compression <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> acts as a solvent to dissolve chains at the particle boundaries at low temperature. A higher processing temperature was employed in the second stage compression which then results in samples with much higher toughness and retained ductility. Mechanical property measurements carried out on the two-stage compression prepared samples show that an optimum second stage preparation temperature was around 150 °C and first stage was 140 °C. All samples were drawable up to 9 times which were more than twice of the natural draw ratio for UHMWPE. The drawn film shows a high Young's modulus of 8 to 9 GPa, tensile strength of 350 MPa and ductility of 10. 5 %. Thermal and morphological analysis show that high chain orientation was achieved and a porous structure of lμm by 1 μm was apparent. Such structures may find uses for environmental applications in membranes and absorbents. Finally, attempts were also made to extract the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> using the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) technique. It was found by combining SFE and rinsing in volatile acetone, more than 98 % of the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> added may be removed. As the extraction was carried out on the final product which may <b>contain</b> less <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> than initially added, the removal can be considered 100 % effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to improve}} the biodegradation performance of a machine cutting oil employed in the processing of uranium at AWE. The machine cutting oil is chemically complex <b>containing</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> surfactants to improve emulsification and a phenolic biocide. Biodegradation was performed by a mixed culture of bacteria isolated from used cutting oil. Continuous, semi-batch and fed-batch systems were examined and stirred tanks and well-mixed biosupport reactors (immobilised cell systems) were compared. A continuous flow system was shown to provide {{a high rate of}} productivity with respect to COD removal. The extent of biodegradation would be important for a radioactive application and this ranged from 61 - 77 % for hydraulic residence times of 10 - 53 hours, however it was noted that the extent of biodegradation was greater in the batch start-up period. The application of a Tween 80 emulsified feed to increase the bioavailability of the oil phase inhibited rather than improved the biodegradation performance. The use of a biosupport reactor improved biodegradation at shorter residence times. Development of these observations led to the operation of semi-batch (SBR) and fed-batch reactor systems (FBR). Following acclimatisation of the culture, the semi-batch systems consistently yielded higher extents of biodegradation in the range of 86 - 94 % removal of COD for a bioprocess cycle of 5 days. The addition of n-hexadecane, as a readily metabolised co-substrate, to two semi-batch experiments did not noticeably increase biodegradation. A fed-batch configuration did not improve on the performance of the semi-batch configuration. GC-MS analysis of the extracted organics produced an unresolved complex mixture (UCM). Oxidation using chromium trioxide (CrO 3) of the UCM suggested that the remaining components were undegraded molecules from the base oil rather than excreted biodegradation intermediates. Phenotypic and genotypic assessment of the bacterial community showed that the overall diversity of the mixed culture was low. The bacterial population shifted throughout the batch period and diversity was further reduced as the cutting oil was degraded. Maximum diversity was observed {{at the start of the}} batch period and at steady state for the continuous system. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Long–Baseline Neutrino Experiment is to make {{measurements}} of neutrino oscillations. The stopped muon monitors are {{one part of the}} experiment, and are designed to measure absolute ﬂux and composition of the tertiary muon beam. The detectors operate by detecting µ+ decay in an interior water volume, and 12 B decay produced by µ− capture on a graphite shell. The design of the stopped muon monitors is simulated with a Monte Carlo software package called Geant 4. The detector’s response to µ+, µ−, 12 B, as well as fast and thermal neutron backgrounds are reviewed and analysed. The inability of the stopped muon monitor to detect most 12 B decays, as well as the overlap in signal of neutron interactions and 12 B decay, require design modiﬁcations. The graphite shell is removed and should be exchanged for a neutron shielding material, while the water volume should be replaced with <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> A scintillating veto is also included to identify events which originate, and are fully <b>contained</b> by the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> Follow-up simulations indicate that the 12 B signal is signiﬁcantly improved and the scintillating veto may be able to identify fully contained events...|$|R

In this paper key information from the international literature is reviewed that can underpin an Environmental Mining Management System which includes elements of Environmental Risk Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Planning. This paper focuses on four developing areas of seafloor mining activities presently being undertaken or planned in the New Zealand region: hydrocarbons (<b>oil</b> and gas), <b>minerals,</b> ironsands and phosphorite nodules. A number of issues with the implementation of environmental management systems are identified including the difficulty of assessing new marine activities or technologies and the need for standardised reporting metrics.
