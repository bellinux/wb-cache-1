50|$|Pre-war {{experiments}} with 18-pounder HE shells had been inconclusive {{in terms of}} their benefits. However, the first month of the war showed that they were worth having and the first HE rounds arrived in September 1914. This was a different shape to the existing shrapnel shell so a new Mark 2 shrapnel shell was introduced to ensure ballistic compatibility. The original shrapnel shells had a relatively blunt ogive - 1.5 <b>circular</b> <b>radius</b> head (crh), the newer ones were 2 crh.|$|E
50|$|During the 20th Century, shells became {{increasingly}} streamlined. In World War I, ogives were typically two <b>circular</b> <b>radius</b> head (crh) - the curve was {{a segment of}} a circle having a radius of twice the shell calibre. After that war, ogive shapes became more complex and elongated. From the 1960s, higher quality steels were introduced by some countries for their HE shells, this enabled thinner shell walls with less weight of metal and hence a greater weight of explosive. Ogives were further elongated to improve their ballistic performance.|$|E

50|$|The {{game is a}} {{vertical}} scrolling shooter where the player controls a helicopter taking on hordes of enemies which include tanks, battleships, and artillery. It {{is interesting to note}} that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles that travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large <b>circular</b> <b>radius.</b> These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.|$|E

Bumi Murau Coal aims to identify the coal spreading pattern based on geophysical log data and bore log; and also know about the amount of existing coal resource in research area, especially Seam Z. The research methods of this final project are survey method, descriptive method and extended with analyze method. Analyze method was done by several steps. The first steps is correlation construction between bore hole to determine subsurface lithology sequence also coal spreading and step of coal bed map construction. Continued with quantitative analyze method that is calculation of coal Seam Z resource by using the combination grid method and Circular USGS method. There are 16 bore holes in research area, divided to 5 drilling lines. Seam Z is not found at 2 bore holes. Seam Z has thickness about 23 – 37 meters. The pattern of coal Seam Z thickness is thicker to southwest side. The depth of Seam Z is about 18 – 77 meters above sea level.

40|$|Although rotary engines can {{potentially}} {{be used as}} hydrogen fuel engines, the contact condition between the casing and the apex seal on the triangular rotor impacts sealing performance, which then directly affects leakage problems.

For comparative convenience, assuming that the simulated gas is air, and then, using a set <b>circular</b> <b>radius</b> outside the casing, analyze three different cases with various geometric design parameters (the K factor) and their effects on the internal pressure, streamlining, and leakage. The {{results indicate that the}} K factor design produces different rotor profiles with different working chamber volumes: the lower the K factor, the larger the working chamber volume. Nevertheless, although this design can improve the combustion and compression efficiencies, it may lead to increased internal pressure variation and raised pressure. In addition, when the clearance is small, it may result in a larger leakage problem, negatively affecting rotary engine performance...|$|E

40|$|Calculated {{results for}} the flowfield {{structure}} and surface quantities are presented for an axisymmetric representation of an aeroassist flight experiment vehicle. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used to perform the calculations, since the flow is highly nonequilibrium about the vehicle during both the compression and expansion phases. The body configuration is an elliptically blunt nose followed by a skirt with a <b>circular</b> <b>radius</b> and an afterbody. Freestream conditions correspond to a single point along the entry trajectory {{at an altitude of}} 90 km and a velocity of 9. 9 km/s. The calculations account for nonequilibrium in the translational and internal modes, dissociation, ionization, and thermal radiation. The degree of dissociation is large, but the maximum ionization is only about 2 percent by mole fraction. The blunt forebody flow experiences a high degree of thermal nonequilibrium in which the translational temperature is generally greater than the internal temperature. However, as the flow expands about the aerobrake skirt and afterbody, the internal temperature is generally greater than the translational temperature...|$|E

The site is on the top and side of a small hill, approximately 60 metres high, is an ancient rock quarry. The surrounding countryside is extremely flat. Over the millennia aboriginals have mined the site primarily for extracting grinding stones. These were used to prepare seeds from grasses growing along from the nearby Darling River system into a flour-like substance for the production of a ‘damper ’ bread. The quarrying activities are evident today in the form of depressions up to 1. 5 metres deep and roughly <b>circular,</b> <b>radius</b> 2 to 5 metres. They resemble an old gold digging site where miners made small surface depressions in a large rock field. A survey of the site was carried out in 2002 and 3 D coordinates and a number of attributes (e. g. volume, area) were collected or derived. Spatial analyses have been performed on the data to determine if there are any spatial relationships. Our findings, given the data already to hand, indicate that there are few spatial relationships; moreover the holes seem to b...|$|E
40|$|This study {{introduces}} a change detection model based on Neighborhood Correlation Image (NCI) logic. It {{is based on}} the fact that the same geographic area (e. g., a 3 × 3 pixel window) on two dates of imagery will tend to be highly correlated if little change has occurred, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Computing the piecewise correlation between two data sets provides valuable information regarding the location and numeric change value derived using contextual information within the specified neighborhood. Various neighborhood configurations (i. e., multi-level NCIs) were explored in the study using high spatial resolution multispectral imagery: smaller neighborhood sizes provided some detailed change information (such as a new patios added to an existing building) at the cost of introducing some noise (such as changes in shadows). Larger neighborhood sizes were useful for removing this noise but introduced some inaccurate change information (such as removing some linear feature changes). When combined with image classification using a machine learning decision tree (C 5. 0), classifications based on multi-level NCIs yielded superior results (e. g., using a 3 -pixel <b>circular</b> <b>radius</b> neighborhood had a Kappa of 0. 94), compared to the classification that did not incorporate NCIs (Kappa = 0. 86). close 647...|$|E
