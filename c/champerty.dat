5|$|On September 10, Delegate C. Harrison Mann {{introduced}} 16 bills {{aimed at}} curbing the NAACP in Virginia. Five {{of the bills}} expanded the state's definitions of barratry, <b>champerty,</b> and maintenance. The eleven other bills collectively required the following groups to file a financial report and membership list annually with state: any group which promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at any race; any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race; or any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP {{then brought}} suit {{challenging}} all five laws in state court. A state circuit court held {{three of the}} laws unconstitutional, but upheld the barratry law and the law prohibiting advocacy of lawsuits against the state. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the barratry law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the barratry, <b>champerty,</b> and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five barratry, <b>champerty,</b> and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March 1377 he was {{appointed}} Justice of the Peace, and assigned on 29 April 1377 to raise troops in Herefordshire to repel an anticipated invasion. On 12 May 1377 Walter Devereux was assigned to make inquisitions by oath of {{the men of the}} lordships of Brecombe, Haye, Huntington and Caldecotes in Wales touching all seditions, oppressions, <b>champerties,</b> ambidextries, falsities and deceptions, damages, grievances and excesses perpetrated there; as well in forests, stews, waters, assarts and purprestures as elsewhere; and touching all wards, marriages, reliefs, escheats, lands and other profits and emoluments pertaining to the king which have been concealed, withdrawn or occupied; also to make due restitution of the later, and to hear and determine the premises at the suit of the king or others; and commission to them to be justices to take hearings in all personal pleas, as well of accounts, errors and attaints, as all others, and to correct what has been wrongly done therein and punish delinquents. Devereux was again appointed on 2 July 1377 as Justice of the Peace for Herefordshire., and on 20 July, following the death of Edward III and ascension of Richard II, he was also among those assigned as keepers of the city of Hereford. They were instructed to stay upon its sage custody and for conservation of the peace therein, with full power to see that all men of the city and suburbs, according to their condition and means, are suitably armed, arrayed, and kept ready to resist the king’s enemies, compelling them if need be, by distress or imprisonment.|$|R
25|$|In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict {{liability}} for the escape of fire; additionally, {{strict liability}} was imposed {{for the release}} of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against <b>champerty</b> and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strictness}} {{with which}} the courts interpreted the laws against maintenance was {{an expression of the}} censure of the common law. [...] But the censure, overall, proved to be ineffectual. By the Fifteenth Century, the law had become corrupted, and was only another weapon, along with physical violence, for the unscrupulous to achieve their ends. [...] In 1450, Cade proclaimed: [...] "The law serveth of nowght ellys in thes days, but for to do wrong, for nothying is sped almost but false maters by colour of the law for mede, drede and favor." [...] Perjury was not a crime in those days. [...] Maintenance, along with <b>champerty,</b> appearing armed before a justice of the law, giving of liveries, forgery of deeds, and other corrupting influences were banned under Edward III of England.|$|E
2500|$|As the Civil Rights Movement {{developed}} during the postwar era, Tucker came to have {{a central role in}} its legal battles in Virginia. He ultimately filed suits in nearly 50 counties, including Alexandria and neighboring Arlington and Fairfax. By the time Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954 and 1955, the NAACP state legal staff had grown to a dozen cooperating attorneys (including Tucker), and had filed fifteen petitions requesting desegregation with local school boards by the spring of 1956. However, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd had vowed Massive Resistance to school desegregation, and that fall a special session of the Virginia General Assembly adopted (and Governor Thomas B. Stanley signed) a package of new laws to maintain segregation and close desegregating schools, which {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Stanley plan." [...] That collection of bills also contained seven relating to NAACP activities, and expanded the definitions of the common law legal ethics offenses of barratry, <b>champerty</b> and maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distinction}} between trover and conversion. Trover resolved the old procedural problem of wager of law which had developed {{as a form of}} licensed perjury, which made detinue unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant. [...] Wager at law allowed testimony from many witnesses, who might {{have nothing to do with}} the actual litigation. In this sense, it was not much different from <b>champerty</b> and maintenance. Because trover sidestepped these old problems, there was an effort to expand it into many different forms. The legal device to accomplish this at first was to treat the allegation of losing the goods and then finding them as a fiction. This method was seen in several cases in the 17th century. [...] As a technical factor, the defendant was not permitted to deny losing and finding, so the only issues to be litigated were those of the plaintiff's right to possession and the conversion as an existent fact. [...] With losing and finding no longer essential, trover became the standard remedy for any form of interference with a chattel. It entirely replaced detinue, which fell into complete disuse. It replaced trespass to chattels to such an extent that the former was rarely seen. In 1756, Lord Mansfield stated in Cooper v Chitty : ...|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, <b>champerty</b> and {{maintenance}} as common law causes of action (as either a crime or a tort) have mostly been abolished by statute. In New South Wales, <b>champerty</b> {{and maintenance}} were abolished by the Maintenance, <b>Champerty</b> and Barratry Abolition Act 1993.

50|$|In Canada, {{the common}} law crimes of <b>champerty</b> and {{maintenance}} were abolished, alongside all remaining common law offenses except contempt of court, by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code.

5000|$|In modern idiom {{maintenance}} is {{the support of}} litigation by a stranger without just cause. <b>Champerty</b> is an aggravated form of maintenance.

The Reasons for Judgment, {{published on}} 23 February 2012, stated {{that there is}} a serious problem with the finding made and endorsed by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal respectively that Lo knew that there had been <b>champerty</b> involved. Although the judge found maintenance and <b>champerty</b> are constitutional, he questioned whether criminal liability for maintenance should be retained in Hong Kong as liability for both maintenance and <b>champerty</b> were abolished in places such as England and South Australia.|$|E

5000|$|This concept {{exists in}} American {{jurisprudence}} but disdained by [...] "fans of entrepreneurial lawyering {{in the academy}} and elsewhere". There has been recent common usage of the term in the media in Nevada and Ohio. NAACP v. Button found laws that overburdened free speech rights {{in the name of}} preventing <b>champerty</b> to be unconstitutional. Courts in Florida have found that the causes of action for maintenance and <b>champerty</b> are no longer viable in Florida, but have been superseded by laws related to abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and wrongful initiation of litigation. Florida courts have held that <b>champerty</b> and maintenance may continue to exist as affirmative defenses, but only as to the enforceability of the champertous contract itself.|$|E

50|$|Investment in {{sovereign}} debt {{with the intent}} to recover was also restricted due to the laws of <b>champerty</b> and maintenance and by the fact that most {{sovereign debt}} was syndicated. Under the Doctrines of <b>Champerty,</b> it was illegal in England and the United States to purchase a debt with the sole intent of litigating it. The distinction was made that if the debt was purchased to effect a recovery or facilitate investment, the doctrine was not a bar. Most jurisdictions have now eliminated the doctrine as archaic.|$|E
