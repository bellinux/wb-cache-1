5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon.

The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S.

In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim to much of the land in the Great Lakes region. In July 1778, <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> about 175men crossed the Ohio River and took control of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and several other villages in British Indiana. The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> hired Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been}} a {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E

In June 1776, these settlers selected <b>Clark</b> <b>and</b> John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2000, MDOT {{proposed}} several highway transfers in Detroit.
