5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a <b>circular</b> <b>groove,</b> the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a <b>circular</b> <b>groove</b> near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the <b>circular</b> <b>groove</b> on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

The outside of the base is curved and covered with two <b>circular</b> <b>grooves</b> and 47 tapered radial ridges. The collar has 7 projections corresponding to the rifling grooves. On firing, the powder gas pressure forces the copper gas-check into the undercut in the side of the protrusion, the two <b>circular</b> <b>grooves,</b> and the 47 gaps between the tapered radial ridges, permanently attaching the gas-check to the shell. The gas pressure also forces the collar outwards against the rifling, creating a gas seal. The radial ridges prevent rotation of the gas-check on the base of the projectile, forcing the projectile to rotate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract ─ An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} provide information about the effect of pressure reduction on heat loss from cylindrical fins of three different geometries. A literature review shows that much of work on radiating fins has been carried out analytically and numerically. In this research, a solid cylindrical fin and two other cylindrical fins with <b>circular</b> <b>grooves</b> and threads on their outside surface are investigated experimentally. A test facility with a pressure reduction chamber and instrumentation is fabricated. The heat input to the fin is varied such that the base temperature is maintained constant under steady state. Based on a study of effect of pressure reduction, using available resources, the chamber is designed for a vacuum of 680 mm Hg. The experimental result shows that for cylindrical fin with <b>circular</b> <b>grooves</b> (depth 3. 5 mm) heat loss is a maximum. The grooved cylindrical fin loses approximately 1. 23 times greater heat per unit area, compared to the threaded cylindrical fin, and 2. 17 times greater heat per unit area, respectively compared to the solid pin fin at a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. As pressure decreases heat loss reduces and contribution of radiation heat transfer on total heat loss increases...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} improving the spatial resolution of terahertz (THz) imaging. Using a sub-wavelength aperture in a metal ground plane {{is the most common}} way to improve the spatial resolution, but a sub-wavelength aperture has low radiation transmission. To increase the radiation transmission of a sub-wavelength aperture, periodic <b>circular</b> <b>grooves</b> were put in the metal around the aperture. The sub-wavelength circular aperture and the periodic <b>circular</b> <b>grooves</b> around it are known as the bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye structure. The bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye structure shows high radiation transmission at its design frequency, and it also has sub-wavelength spatial resolution. This research designed the bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye structure to perform at 3 mm wavelength in W band (75 - 110 GHz). Simulations were conducted on the 3 D model of the bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye structure to study its performance in the desired frequency range. Then a bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye structure was fabricated and tested by the knife-edge technique to measure its spatial resolution.
