This arrangement is thus well-suited to applications in which multiple parallel computations can take place independently, without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors. The high-end scalability of geographically dispersed grids is generally favorable, due to the low need for connectivity between nodes relative to the capacity of the public Internet.|$|E
40|$|Software defined {{networking}} implements {{the network}} control plane in an external entity, {{rather than in}} each individual device as in <b>conventional</b> <b>networks.</b> This architectural difference implies a different design for control functions necessary for essential network properties, e. g., loop prevention and link redundancy. We explore how such differences redefine the security weaknesses in the SDN control plane and {{provide a framework for}} comparative analysis which focuses on essential network properties required by typical production networks. This enables analysis of how these properties are delivered by the control planes of SDN and <b>conventional</b> <b>networks,</b> and to compare security risks and mitigations. Despite the architectural difference, we find similar, but not identical, exposures in control plane security if both network paradigms provide the same network properties and are analyzed under the same threat model. However, defenses vary; SDN cannot depend on edge based filtering to protect its control plane, while this is arguably the primary defense in <b>conventional</b> <b>networks.</b> Our concrete security analysis suggests that a distributed SDN architecture that supports fault tolerance and consistency checks is important for SDN control plane security. Our analysis methodology may be of independent interest for future security analysis of SDN and <b>conventional</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

In total four neural networks were proposed, namely: multi-layred perceptron, radial basis function, recurrent and a neural network ensemble consisting in ensemble of bagged networks. Forecasting reliability of the proposed neural networks {{was carried out in}} terms forecasting error performance basing on statistical and graphical methods. The experimental results showed that all the proposed networks achieved an acceptable forecasting accuracy. In term of comparison the neural network ensemble gives the highest precision forecasting comparing to the <b>conventional</b> <b>networks.</b> In fact, each network of the ensemble over-fits to some extent and leads to a diversity which enhances the noise tolerance and the forecasting generalization performance comparing to the <b>conventional</b> <b>networks.</b> Keywords—Neural network ensemble, Solar power generation, 24 hour forecasting, Comparative study.

Ion broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week (though only eighteen hours of its schedule each day consist of entertainment programming, with infomercials and religious programming making up the remainder of the schedule), making the Ion network the largest English-language commercial television network to be totally responsible for its affiliates' programming. Ion differs from other commercial networks in that the majority of its stations are owned-and-operated by its parent company with very few affiliates, and it is distributed exclusively via cable and satellite in markets where the network does not have a local station; Ion was the last of the seven conventional English language commercial broadcast networks to expand into distribution via digital multicasting, having relied entirely on cable and satellite distribution in markets where it otherwise could not maintain a primary affiliation until 2014, when it began accepting subchannel-only affiliates through deals with Telemundo Station Group and Media General.|$|E

In networks that employ such routers, fairness is ensured by the routers, thereby making responsiveness and smoothness the two main criteria for evaluating and selecting a binary adjustment algorithm. In this paper, we consider binary adjustment algorithms with four increase policies proposed in the literature: multiplicative increase (MI), additive increase (AI), inverse-square-root increase (ISI), and inverse increase (II). We analyze these algorithms in fair heterogeneous networks. We find that the multiplicative increase policy, which is considered inappropriate for <b>conventional</b> <b>networks</b> due to its fairness property, provides superior performance over the other policies in fair networks. ...|$|R
