40|$|Bustards {{are large}} {{terrestrial}} birds that inhabit open plains, deserts, and dry bush country. The helminth parasites of captive houbara bustards (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> macqueeni), rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista), and kori bustards (Ardeotis kori) {{have been investigated}} at the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) and the International Institute of Parasitology. The cestode species recovered include Hispaniolepis falsata, Ascometra vestita, Ascometra choriotidis, Otiditaenia conoideis, Otiditaenia macqueeni, Raillietina neyrai, and Idiogenes sp. The acanthocephalans Mediorhynchus taeniatus and Centrorhynchus lancea were also recovered. A host-parasite list is presented here. <b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> macqueeni is a new host for A. choriotidis, C. lancea, and R. neyrai, and E. ruficrista is a new host for O. macqueeni. Ascometra choriotidis, R. neyrai, O. macqueeni, H. falsata, M. taeniatus, and C. lancea records are new for the United Arab Emirates. Cestodes were recovered from 18 of 78 houbara bustards, two of three kori bustards, and four of 10 rufous-crested bustards. Pathologic findings in the intestinal tract associated with cestode infection included inflammation, mild atrophy, collapse, and fibrosis of the intestinal mucosa.

40|$|In {{order to}} define the {{features}} that determine breeding habitat suitability for the Houbara Bustard (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> macqueenii), a study of nest-site selection by this species {{was carried out in}} Mori, Xinjiang, China during the breeding seasons in April-June 1998 - 2000. Most habitats chosen for nest sites were open areas with short shrubs close to patches of tall shrubs. The nesting female Houbara Bustard clearly prefers areas with sparse vegetation and avoids densely covered sites with tall vegetation. The vegetative species richness, number of fruiting species, and density of fruiting species at nest sites were significantly lower than those at other randomly selected sites. Vegetation density, plant species richness, density of Anabasis salsa, distance to the nearest fox den, distance to shrubby patches, and vegetative cover are possibly the most important factors determining nest-site selection by the Houbara Bustard.

40|$|International audienceDo all traits {{within an}} {{organism}} age {{for the same}} reason? Evolutionary theories of aging share a common assumption: the strength of natural selection declines with age. A corollary is that additive genetic variance should increase with age. However, not all senescent traits display such increases suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play. Using longitudinal data collected from more than 5400 houbara bustards (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata)</b> with an exhaustive recorded pedigree, we investigated the genetics of aging in one female reproductive trait (egg production) and three male reproductive traits (courtship display rate, ejaculate size and sperm viability), that display senescence at the phenotypic level. Animal models revealed an increase in additive genetic variance with age for courtship display rate and egg production but an unexpected absence of increased additive genetic variance for ejaculate size and no additive genetic variance for sperm viability.

40|$|International audienceImplementation of {{conservation}} breeding programs {{is a key}} step to ensuring the sustainability of many endangered species. Infectious diseases can be serious threats {{for the success of}} such initiatives especially since knowledge on pathogens affecting those species is usually scarce. Houbara bustard species (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> and <b>Chlamydotis</b> macqueenii), whose populations have declined over the last decades, have been captive-bred for conservation purposes for more than 15 years. Avipoxviruses are of the highest concern for these species in captivity. Pox lesions were collected from breeding projects in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia for 6 years in order to study the diversity of avipoxviruses responsible for clinical infections in Houbara bustard. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of 113 and 75 DNA sequences for P 4 b and fpv 140 loci respectively, revealed an unexpected wide diversity of viruses affecting Houbara bustard even at a project scale: 17 genotypes equally distributed between fowlpox virus-like and canarypox virus-like have been identified in the present study. This suggests multiple and repeated introductions of virus and questions host specificity and control strategy of avipoxviruses. We also show that the observed high virus burden and co-evolution of diverse avipoxvirus strains at endemic levels may be responsible for the emergence of novel recombinant strains...|$|R

The morphology of the alimentary tract and the proportions of each region were similar in all 4 species. The length of the oesophagus, combined proventriculus and ventriculus, small intestine, and large intestine formed 24. 2 - 28. 4 %, 7. 3 - 9. 7 %, 40. 5 - 55. 1 % and 9. 1 - 14. 7 % of the total alimentary tract length respectively.

40|$|International audienceIn mating systems where sexual {{selection}} is intense, providing information on identity and quality to congeners may strongly influence reproductive success. In the lekking North African houbara bustard, <b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> undulata, males perform a spectacular courtship that includes highly visible displays and low-frequency vocalizations called booms. Booms are individualized and {{may play a}} role in individual recognition. However, this hypothesis is valid only if boom parameters are fixed phenotypes that do not change over time. It is also possible that they convey information about male quality. Using captive birds, we investigated whether the characteristics of booms vary over time, and whether they are related to physiological, physical and behavioural traits of the males. We showed that booming calls varied over the breeding season and that the males producing the lowest frequency booms were the heaviest and displayed the most. Using playback experiments in the field, we tested whether wild males use the frequency of rival booms as an indicator of their opponent's condition. We found that males' behavioural responses were significantly different according to the frequency of the signals played back. Males responded to booms simulating heavier intruders (lower frequency), which presumably represented a bigger threat, by increasing the duration of their running phase and by decreasing the duration of their booming phase, potentially bluffing on their own condition. Thus, booms convey information on male quality rather than identity, and are key acoustic signals in the agonistic relationships between lekking males...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The "good genes" {{theory of}} sexual {{selection}} postulates that females choose mates {{that will improve}} their offspring's fitness through the inheritance of paternal genes. In spite of the attention that this hypothesis has given rise to, the empirical evidence remains sparse, mostly because of the difficulties of controlling for the many environmental factors that may covary with both the paternal phenotype and offspring fitness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that offspring sired by males of a preferred phenotype should have better survival in an endangered bird, the houbara bustard (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata</b> undulata). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested if natural and experimentally-induced variation in courtship display (following an inflammatory challenge) predicts the survival of offspring. Chicks were produced by artificial insemination of females, ensuring that any effect on survival could only arise from the transfer of paternal genes. One hundred and twenty offspring were equipped with radio transmitters, and their survival monitored in the wild for a year. This allowed assessment of {{the potential benefits of}} paternal genes in a natural setting, where birds experience the whole range of environmental hazards. Although natural variation in sire courtship display did not predict offspring survival, sires that withstood the inflammatory insult and maintained their courtship activity sired offspring with the best survival upon release. CONCLUSIONS: This finding is relevant both to enlighten the debate on "good genes" sexual selection and the management of supportive breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Houbara bustard (<b>Chlamydotis</b> <b>undulata)</b> is a wild {{seasonal}} {{breeding bird}} populating arid sandy semidesert habitats in North Africa and the Middle East. Its population has declined drastically {{during the last}} two decades and it is classified as vulnerable. Captive breeding programmes have, hitherto, been unsuccessful in reviving population numbers and thus radical technological solutions are essential for the long term survival of this species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the use of primordial germ cell-mediated chimera technology to produce viable Houbara bustard offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Embryonic gonadal tissue was dissected from Houbara bustard embryos at eight days post-incubation. Subsequently, Houbara tissue containing gonadal primordial germ cells (gPGCs) was injected into White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) embryos, producing 83 / 138 surviving male chimeric embryos, of which 35 chimeric roosters reached sexual maturity after 5 months. The incorporation and differentiation of Houbara gPGCs in chimeric chicken testis were assessed by PCR with Houbara-specific primers and 31. 3 % (5 / 16) gonads collected from the injected chicken embryos showed the presence of donor Houbara cells. A total of 302 semen samples from 34 chimeric roosters were analyzed and eight were confirmed as germline chimeras. Semen samples from these eight roosters were used to artificially inseminate three female Houbara bustards. Subsequently, 45 Houbara eggs were obtained and incubated, two of which were fertile.

Despite the many studies demonstrating that BFDs reduce collision rates, we could fi nd no published information on malfunction rates of BFDs. In January 2013, we surveyed the physical function of 1, 200 BFDs (e. g. 600 fl appers and 600 spirals) in three sample areas on each of four lines of varying voltage and structure. Of the 600 fl appers examined, 123 had malfunctioned within nine months of installation, while the malfunction rate of the 600 spirals studied was zero. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we found that the rate of fl apper malfunction increased with decreasing fl apper size and power line diameter. Further, the fl apper malfunction rate increased as the distance between poles increased. The cost of replacing malfunctioning BFDs is very high as there are serious health and safety constraints related to working with live wires. Factors aff ecting diverter malfunctioning need to be considered for future powerline projects and our information can serve as basis for developing national standards or regulations for powerline mitigation in Mongolia...|$|R
