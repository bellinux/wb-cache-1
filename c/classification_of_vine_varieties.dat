Mississippi wineries cultivate the http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-1106-muscadine muscadine grape and its varieties due to its abundance throughout the region and resistance to humid conditions. Muscadine is the title given to a group <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> most common in the South-Eastern United States. The varieties of the muscadine grape can be either light or dark and have very thick skins which make them highly resistant to fungal and bacterial diseases that thrive in humid weather. As {{the health benefits of}} wine gain significance in the wine industry, so do muscadines, as it is known that their thick skins contain high levels of the compound Resveratrol, which is linked to heart health and cancer prevention. Also of great prevalence, is the muscadine’s opposition to Phylloxera, which plagued Europe’s vineyards in the late 19th century. This evolutionary trait has helped scientists in making noteworthy progress towards finding a solution for phylloxera.

After extensive surveys in vineyards, we showed that Cabernet Sauvignon is highly susceptible, with {{a high proportion of}} symptomatic branches and phytoplasma titers, in contrast to Merlot. Localized insect transmissions and grafting showed that phytoplasma circulate in the whole plant in the Cabernet-Sauvignon cultivar, but in Merlot they are restricted to the transmission point.

From {{the point of view}} of fertility varieties, Valeria and Valérien had the best behavior (over 80 % fertile shoots) and as productivity were noted the varieties Muscat de Pölöskei and Purpuriu with the absolute productivity index of 424, respectively 332 g.

Experimental plantations continued in Geisenheim until 1890, and in 1891 150 plants were shipped to Wädenswil where trials continued under Heinrich Schellenberg (1868−1967).

In particular, such applications have been used in viticulture aiming to improve the management of the upcoming harvest. The present study focuses on the analysis, regression and evaluation of hyperspectral and multispectral data collected for aplications in precision viticulture. Data collection was planed for 5 study areas (Nemea, Aminteo, Naousa, Atalanti, Trapeza) where vineyards are cultivated, and was dated just before the harvest period (July-August) during 3 campaigns (2012 - 2014). Three different types of data were processed including, ground radiance data using a field spectrometer (GER 1500, Spectra Vista Corporation, 350 - 1050 nm, 512 spectral bands), WorldView- 2 satellite data (DigitalGlobe, Inc. USA), and hyperspectral camera data (Micro-Hyperspec™ VNIR A 1 Series,Headwall photonics, Inc. USA). Spectroradiometer ground data, for each study area were radiometrically checked and classified in correspondence with irradiance data to enable the proper calculation of reflectance values. Using reflectance values, spectral signatures for <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> were calculated and analyzed to exctract information about spectral behavior for each <b>vine</b> <b>variety.</b> The process <b>of</b> WorldView- 2 satellite images included radiometric correction, atmospheric correction and spectral signatures calculation by sampling. Hyperspectral camera data were collected using an UAV (Unamanned Aerial vehicle) and were radiometrically and geometrically processed to calculate spectral signatures. Further analyzation <b>of</b> same <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> was made by comparing reflectance values, for all datasets. For this procedure simulated ground reflectance data, corresponding to WV- 2 and the hyperspcectral bands was computed by using spectral response information. Thus, it was made possible to evaluate the relationship between ground data and satellite, aerial data, through regression models. Using linear regression models, the spectral signatures computed from satellite data (WV- 2) and camera hyperspectral data, were correlated with the ones computed from the simulated ground data.

Although the country’s wine production {{dates back to}} the 16th century, the inclination of growth for consumption was essentially based on volume and not quality, so there was little significance placed on the art <b>of</b> planting <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> best suited to each location and its ecosystem. Argentina’s wine industry was transformed in the 1990s when international investors had the foresight to recognize the value and untapped resource of Argentina's wine producing potential. It has been estimated that over $1.5 billion in new vineyard investment occurred in the following decade, designed to strengthen and improve the industry's production quality. [...] Argentina wine regions have since undergone a radical transformation, and now rival the production quality of European wine-producing countries. The concept of creating tourism oriented enterprises has taken form over the past decade. Renowned architects are translating brand identity into built structures, and now numerous iconic wineries dot the landscape of Argentina’s wine regions. Many of these wineries feature tourist accommodations, restaurants, wine tasting & food matching seminars, pruning & harvesting tours, and other wine-related experiences. Wine industry associations and various universities have been encouraging this process by launching well-funded studies to analyze the future of enotourism, by mapping out wine routes, and by offering specialized training courses for wine industry personnel.|$|R

40|$|Dissipation of the {{fungicide}} spiroxamine in grapes <b>of</b> two <b>vine</b> <b>varieties,</b> Roditis and Cabernet Sauvignon, {{exposed to}} field treatments was evaluated. <b>Vines</b> <b>of</b> a grape vineyard located in central Greece were sprayed {{once or twice}} with a commercial formulation of the fungicide at 30 g a. i. /hL. Residues in grapes, must, and wine were determined by gas chromatography/IT-MS after extraction with cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 : 1), with a limit of quantitation 0. 02 mg/kg in grapes and 0. 012 mg/kg in wine. Under field conditions, spiroxamine dissipation on grapes was faster during the first 2 weeks and then slower to the sixth week. About 7 days after application, half of the initial spiroxamine concentration remained on the grapes; the respective proportion at 42 days was about 10 %. At 14 and 35 days, residues were lower than 0. 44 and 0. 22 mg/kg, respectively, values below the maximum residue levels set by the European Union (1 mg/kg). Spiroxamine residues transferred from grapes into the must and through the vinification process into the wine were also studied. Mean transfer factors of 0. 26 and 0. 55 were found from grapes into wine for the wines obtained without maceration and with maceration, respectively. Residues in wine, prepared from grapes with a spiroxamine content of 0. 11 - 0. 20 mg/kg, varied from < 0. 026 to 0. 09 mg/kg. Spiroxamine diastereomer B was found to dissipate slower than diastereomer A in the field as well as during the vinification process...|$|R
