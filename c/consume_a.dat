5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} {{free-living}} species that directly <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> {{large number of}} prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E

5|$|The plain maskray {{generally}} hunts at {{the surface}} of the bottom substrate, rather than digging for prey. Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms. Small bony fishes are also eaten, along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod. Larger rays <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays. This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi.|$|E
5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders and <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> {{range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part}} of the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The marsh rice rat, O.couesi, and O.gorgasi {{are known}} to be omnivores, eating both plant and animal material. They eat both seeds and green plant parts and <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> variety of animals, {{including}} insects, crustaceans, and many others. The barn owl (Tyto alba) is a major predator on the marsh rice rat and remains of O.antillarum, O.couesi, and O.gorgasi have been found in owl pellet deposits. Several other animals {{are known to}} prey on Oryzomys. A variety of parasites are known from O.couesi and the marsh rice rat and two parasitic nematodes have been found in O.gorgasi.|$|E
5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> {{significant proportion of the}} bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} by sex, {{with the}} males generally found {{deeper than the}} females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, croakers, jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also capable of taking young sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects what is most available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the croakers Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> wider variety of prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters <b>consume</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies {{the proportion of the}} diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise {{a large part of the}} diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E
