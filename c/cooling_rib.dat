The <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs</b> are located between two friction plates through which air flows in the positive radial direction, dissipating heat. It was observed that up to 77 % of the heat was dissipated by the <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs</b> in a drag brake scenario [4]. On the other hand, in an emergency stop scenario, this number is smaller, as the cooling area of the rib is heated up less due to there being too little time to conduct heat towards the <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs.</b> The dissipation percentage depends on the braking regime, since it is time- and temperature-dependent.|$|R

40|$|Gas {{turbines}} are {{extensively in}} use for aircraft propulsion, land-based power generations, and various industrial applications. Thermal efficiency {{and the power}} output of a gas turbine increases with increase in turbine rotor inlet temperature (RIT). The current RIT level in many advanced gas turbines is far above the melting point of the used blade material. Therefore, along with development in high temperature material, a more sophisticated cooling scheme must be developed for continuing the safe operation of gas turbines with high performances. Gas turbine blades can be cooled internally as well as externally. This paper {{is focused on the}} internal cooling of turbine blades and vanes of a gas turbine. Internal cooling can be achieved by passing coolant through various enhanced serpentine passages inside the blade and extracting heat from outside of the blades. Jet impingement, matrix <b>cooling,</b> <b>rib</b> turbulator, dimple and pin fin cooling are utilized as the methods of internal cooling, which are presented in various articles. Due to the different enhancement in heat transfer and in pressure drop, they are being used in specific part of the blades and the vanes on a gas turbine. The matrix cooling, also known as lattice-work or vortex cooling provides a good strength to blades by the layers of ribs which intersect each other from the opposite wall. A significant increase in the heat transfer is obtained due to an increase in heat transfer area, impinging and in swirling flows (which helps to promote turbulence), induced by the geometry of the matrix cooling channels...|$|E

The analysed brake disc is used in rail freight wagons and possesses a load capacity of 22.5 tons per axle. Two of the divided rail freight brake discs are mounted on each axle. With the aid of numerical analysis, the thermal dissipation properties of the brake disc were optimised and ventilation losses were reduced, and the numerical results were compared with experimental results. A one-way fluid–structure interaction analysis was performed. A computational fluid dynamic model of a divided rail freight brake disc, used to predict air flow properties and heat convection, was incorporated into a finite element model of the disc and {{used to evaluate the}} temperature of the disc. A numerical parametrical optimisation of <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs</b> of the brake disc was also performed, and novel optimised <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs</b> were developed. A transient thermal numerical analysis of the brake disc was validated using temperature measurements obtained during a braking test on a test bench. The ventilation losses of the brake disc were measured on a test bench specifically designed for the task, and the losses were compared to the simulation results. The experimentally obtained ventilation losses and temperature measurements compared favourably with the simulation results, confirming that this type of simulation process may be confidently applied in the future. Through systematic optimisation of the divided rail freight brake disc, ventilation losses were reduced by 37 % and the mass was reduced by 21 %, resulting in better thermal performance that will bring with it substantial energy savings.|$|R

5000|$|The Pecheneg medium {{machine gun}} can be {{considered}} as a modification of the PKM machine gun, but it is built for only one tactical role; that is, as a true general-purpose machine gun for mechanized infantry and Spetsnaz troops. Its key difference from the parent design is the barrel, which is not a [...] "quick-change" [...] barrel, meaning that it is not intended to be replaced in the field, although it can be removed for inspection and maintenance. The barrel is somewhat heavier than that of the PKM, and has radial <b>cooling</b> <b>ribs.</b> This is enclosed in a steel jacket, which runs up to the muzzle to provide forced air cooling, similar to the distinctive Lewis machine gun designed during the World War I era. Cooling air enters the jacket through oval windows {{at the rear of the}} jacket, and exits at the muzzle, propelled by the pressure differential created by the high-velocity gun gases escaping from the muzzle. Whereas early versions of the Pecheneg had a standard PKM-type flash suppressor, resulting in significant muzzle blast once the gun had warmed up, current production version guns have a special flash suppressor that eliminates the issue. The rear of the barrel-encasing steel jacket features a permanently attached carrying handle with a characteristic elongated profile, as it is also intended to protect the line of sight from mirages generated by convection of air heated up by the barrel.|$|R

Thermal transients during start up and shut down cause plastic straining through the ligaments. The primary bending stress superimposed on the alternate in-plane cyclic straining causes incremental bulging of the ligaments during each firing cycle. This basic mechanism of plastic ratcheting is analyzed and a method developed for determining ligament deformation and strain.

40|$|A {{first part}} of a ”Heat Transfer Handbook” about {{correlations}} for internal cooling of gas turbine vanes and blades has been created. The work {{is based on the}} cooling of vanes and blades 1 and 2 on different Siemens Gas Turbines. The cooling methods increase the heat transfer in the cooling channels by increasing the heat transfer coefficient and/or increasing the heat transfer surface area. The penalty paid for the increased heat transfer is higher pressure losses. Three <b>cooling</b> methods, called <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling,</b> matrix cooling and impingement <b>cooling</b> were investigated. <b>Rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling</b> and impingement cooling are typically used in the leading edge or mid region of the airfoil and matrix cooling is mostly applied in the trailing edge region. Literature studies for each cooling method, covering both open literature and internal reports, were carried out in order to find correlations developed from tests. The correlations were compared and analyzed with focus on suitability for use in turbine conditions. The analysis resulted in recommendations about what correlations to use for each <b>cooling</b> method. For <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling</b> in square or rectangular ducts, four correlations developed by Han and his co-workers [3. 5], [3. 8], [3. 9] and [3. 6] are recommended, each valid for different channel and rib geometries. For U-shaped channels, correlations of Nagoga [3. 4] are recommended. Matrix cooling is relatively unknown in west, but has been used for many years in the former Soviet Union. Therefore available information in open literature is limited. Only one source of correlations was found. The correlations were developed by Nagoga [4. 2] and are valid for closed matrixes. Siemens Gas Turbines are cooled with open matrixes, why further work with developing correlations is needed. For impingement cooling on a flat target plate, a correlation of Florschuetz et al.

The correlations for impingement on curved target plate gave very different results. The correlation of Nagoga is recommended, but it is also advised to consult the other correlations when calculating heat transfer for a specific case.

Three different geometrics (square, triangular and semi-circular cross-section) are studied. Each configuration is analyzed having full or half ribs. These are placed inside the cooling channels. The effects generated by the aspect ratio variation between rib pitch and rib height (P/e), for a constant aspect ratio given by ribs height and hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) are considered.

40|$|In gas turbines, the {{temperature}} behind the combustors is the highest, {{meaning that the}} blades {{in the first stage}} of the turbine require cooling air. This makes the structural blade model very detailed due to the presence of the cooling pattern. For aeromechanical design, one of the first steps is to perform a modal frequency check by using 3 d Finite Element models and the Campbell diagram to establish if the design is acceptable with respect to resonance margins. If the 3 d detailed geometry (including all the cooling details) is used the model becomes extremely large. In order to perform various loops between structural dynamics and aerodynamics in an early stage, the dynamic model of cooled blades should be simplified. The simplified model should be accurate enough in terms of predicting correct frequencies but much lighter in size.   The objective of this thesis is to perform parametric studies of different 3 d simplified cooled turbine blade models. Various models with different geometrical features are created from the history of the CAD software (NX). Different FE meshes are produced in the Hypermesh software and the modal analyses are solved in Abaqus. The results are compared with the fully detailed model. The influence of the cooling features for each test case is summarized and this will be useful for creating reduced order models.

According to this survey, a very small number of existing investigations consider the use of combination devices for internal passage heat transfer augmentation. Examples are rib turbulators, pin fins, and dimples together, a combination of pin fins and dimples, and rib turbulators and pin fins in combination. The results of such studies are compared with data obtained prior to 2003 without rotation influences. Those data are comprised of heat transfer augmentation results for internal <b>cooling</b> channels, with <b>rib</b> turbulators, pin fins, dimpled surfaces, surfaces with protrusions, swirl chambers, or surface roughness. This comparison reveals that all of the new data, obtained since 2003, collect within the distribution of globally averaged data obtained from investigations conducted prior to 2003 (without rotation influences). The same conclusion in regard to data distributions is also reached in regard to globally averaged thermal performance parameters as they vary with friction factor ratio. These comparisons, made on the basis of such judgment criteria, lead to the conclusion that improvements in our ability to provide better spatially-averaged thermal protection have been minimal since 2003. When rotation is present, existing investigations provide little evidence of overall increases or decreases in overall thermal performance characteristics with rotation, at any value of rotation number, buoyancy parameter, density ratio, or Reynolds number. Comparisons between existing rotating channel experimental data and the results obtained prior to 2003, without rotation influences, also show that rotation has little effect on overall spatially-averaged thermal performance as a function of friction factor...|$|R

Together with previously obtained stationary results, this data completes the investigation of the secondary flow field with rotational results acquired with a two-component PIV measuring technique with improved sequencer technique. The Two-Pass Cooling System was analyzed on the rotating test rig using two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 C PIV) a non-intrusive optical planar measurement technique. PIV is capable of obtaining complete flow maps of the instantaneous as well as averaged flow field even at high turbulence levels, which are typical for the narrow serpentine-shaped <b>ribbed</b> <b>cooling</b> systems. An in-house developed synchronization device enables very accurate control of the laser flashes and image acquisition with regard to the angular position of the measurement plane (light sheet) and thereby very accurately stabilizes the position of the channel within the image during PIV recording which then leads to very accurate mean velocities. The presented investigations were conducted in stationary and rotating mode. The results demonstrate the combined interaction of different vortices induced by several effects such as the inclination of ribs, Coriolis forces due to rotation and inertial forces within the bend. Additionally, a flow separation was observed at the divider wall downstream of the bend (in the second pass) that has a strong impact on the flow field depending on the rotational speed. The axial flow maps presented in this paper in combination with the secondary flow maps published previously are of sufficient high quality and spatial resolution to serve as a benchmark test case for the validation of flow solvers. The turbulent channel flow was investigated at a Reynolds number of 50, 000 and at rotation numbers of 0. 0 and 0. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} code is developed {{to calculate the}} temperature distributions {{on the surface of}} a gas turbine blade. This code is a tool for quick prediction of the temperatures by knowing the boundary conditions and the flow conditions, and doesn?t necessarily provide the most accurate results that could be obtained by performing an experiment or precise CFD simulations. Different systems of blade external and internal <b>cooling,</b> such as <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling,</b> impingement cooling, pin-fins, and injection holes for film cooling, are considered in the code by using the appropriate correlations or factors. When the code is run and the results are obtained a gas turbine blade designer can modify his blade terms and conditions such as mass flow rate, number of injection holes in each passage, even the blade material thickness to find an optimum design for cooling purposes. Code is first applied to an E? blade; the external heat transfer coefficients for this blade is inserted as a known boundary condition; Next, code is run for the same blade but this time using the flat plate and convectional correlations for predicting transition on suction side of the blade for external heat transfer coefficient. This code provides an easy way to get {{a better understanding of the}} cooling design and its ability to be modified for any gas turbine blade makes it more flexible to be developed as a commercial tool in future. In the next step, code is applied to a Samsung-Rotor 2 blade with different cooling design than an E? blade and results are presented. Another part is introduced to this project by running a CFD simulation using commercial software Fluent and Gambit, to capture heat transfer coefficient distributions around the surface of the blade and the obtained values is used back in the code. In the meanwhile some interesting observations made during the CFD simulation is discussed. The CFD simulation is performed for the cases where there are not any data available for external heat transfer coefficient distribution already. Two turbulence models, k-epsilon and SST-Transition were utilized for the 2 D CFD study; and for the 3 D CFD case, only k-epsilon model was applied. It was revealed that even though SST- Transition has a better prediction of Mach number, but in terms of heat transfer coefficient k-epsilon model provides closer values to the reference values from previous works. Finally, combining the code and the CFD results could act as a useful assistant to give a designer a general and quick idea of how his blade design will perform at the end...|$|R
40|$|Innovative gas cooled reactors, {{such as the}} {{pebble bed}} reactor (PBR) and the gas cooled fast reactor (GFR) offer higher {{efficiency}} and new application areas for nuclear energy. Numerical methods were applied and developed to analyse the specific features of these reactor types with fully three dimensional calculation models. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, discrete element method (DEM) was used for a physically realistic modelling of the packing of fuel pebbles in PBR geometries and methods were developed for utilising the DEM results in subsequent reactor physics and thermal-hydraulics calculations. In the second part, the flow and heat transfer for a single gas cooled fuel rod of a GFR were investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. An in-house DEM implementation was validated and used for packing simulations, in which the effect of several parameters on the resulting average packing density was investigated. The restitution coefficient was found out to have the most significant effect. The results can be utilised in further work to obtain a pebble bed with a specific packing density. The packing structures of selected pebble beds were also analysed in detail and local variations in the packing density were observed, which should be taken into account especially in the reactor core thermal-hydraulic analyses. Two open source DEM codes were used to produce stochastic pebble bed configurations to add realism and improve the accuracy of criticality calculations performed with the Monte Carlo reactor physics code Serpent. Russian ASTRA criticality experiments were calculated. Pebble beds corresponding to the experimental specifications within measurement uncertainties were produced in DEM simulations and successfully exported into the subsequent reactor physics analysis. With the developed approach, two typical issues in Monte Carlo reactor physics calculations of pebble bed geometries were avoided. A novel method was developed and implemented as a MATLAB code to calculate porosities in the cells of a CFD calculation mesh constructed over a pebble bed obtained from DEM simulations. The code was further developed to distribute power and temperature data accurately between discrete based reactor physics and continuum based thermal-hydraulics models to enable coupled reactor core calculations. The developed method was also found useful for analysing sphere packings in general. CFD calculations were performed to investigate the pressure losses and heat transfer in three dimensional air <b>cooled</b> smooth and <b>rib</b> roughened rod geometries, housed inside a hexagonal flow channel representing a sub-channel of a single fuel rod of a GFR. The CFD geometry represented the test section of the L-STAR experimental facility at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the calculation results were compared to the corresponding experimental results. Knowledge was gained of the adequacy of various turbulence models and of the modelling requirements and issues related to the specific application. The obtained pressure loss results were in a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Heat transfer in the smooth rod geometry was somewhat under predicted, which can partly be explained by unaccounted heat losses and uncertainties. In the rib roughened geometry heat transfer was severely under predicted by the used realisable k − epsilon turbulence model. An additional calculation with a v 2 − f turbulence model showed significant improvement in the heat transfer results, which is most likely due to the better performance of the model in separated flow problems. Further investigations are suggested before using CFD to make conclusions of the heat transfer performance of rib roughened GFR fuel rod geometries. It is suggested that the viewpoints of numerical modelling are included in the planning of experiments to ease the challenging model construction and simulations and to avoid introducing additional sources of uncertainties. To facilitate the use of advanced calculation approaches, multi-physical aspects in experiments should also be considered and documented in a reasonable detail...|$|R
