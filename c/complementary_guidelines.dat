40|$|This {{design study}} {{aimed to develop}} and test a {{coherent}} set of guidelines for teacher professional development. Based on literature we settled for five main principles, and translated these into guidelines for a teacher professional development program. To realize (1) feedback on classroom practice we incorporated video observation. The program was built around (2) collaborative professional learning within reciprocal peer coaching, with (3) teachers as inquirer focusing on student outcomes, (4) teachers' ownership of own learning goals, and (5) training for professional learning. The program was developed and executed in two groups. All <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines</b> appeared useful. Teachers need time to develop coaching skills, and find inquiring difficult. Video feedback stimulates teacher learning, especially when embedded in coaching. The program helped participants in learning through interaction and reflection focusing on classroom practice. While the voluntary group evaluated the program more positive, the non voluntary group showed more change...|$|E

Similarly, the Infants Feeding Practices II found that infants from mothers with a higher educational level breastfed longer (Grummer-Strawn et al. 2008). However, parent’s age or {{number of children in}} the family was not associated with breastfeeding duration, contrary to other studies (Sutherland et al. 2012). Also, we found that breastfeeding was associated with later introduction of water, formula, juice and cow’s milk but not of solid foods. When compared by type of feeding, exclusively breastfed infants are introduced water, formula and juice later than non-exclusively breastfed or never breastfed infants. Independently of type of feeding, juices were introduced considerably earlier in the sample compared with WIC <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which recommend starting juice at 12  months or later (WIC Program 2002). However, introduction of solids and cow’s milk was similar and according to recommendations (WIC Program 2002). Others have found that the introduction of solid foods before 4 – 6  months is associated with discontinuation of breastfeeding (Grummer-Strawn et al. 2008; González-Cossío et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|This 2012 {{update of}} a 2009 study {{provides}} an overview of current methods for measuring the contribution of cultural industries in today’s economy. Cultural industries are becoming important components of today’s economy, propelling innovation and development. Evidence suggests that cultural industries, which can encompass everything from the performing arts and museums to film production and video games, contribute to gross domestic product and employment, and can improve a country’s foreign trade position and competitiveness. In Germany, enterprise from cultural and creative industries represented 7. 4 % of the value added to the economy in 2009. In Mali the cultural sector contributed 2. 38 % to the GDP in 2006. However, there are few cross-nationally comparable statistics and methodologies to quantify the effect of these industries at the global level. The UIS is seeking to develop new as well as <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines</b> to measure the contribution of culture to economies, especially in the developing world where data and resources are limited. To this end, the study provides an exhaustive literature review of current methodologies. It compares several approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The report offers an important resource for governments interested in measuring the economic contribution of cultural industries in their countries. The material presented in the study will serve to support the development of a methodological handbook on measuring the contribution of the culture sector...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe German Highway Capacity Manual HBS (Handbuch fuer die Bemessung von Strassenverkehrsanlagen, FGSV 2015) {{like other}} Highway Capacity Manuals {{provides}} {{a collection of}} methods for evaluating the Level of Service for single road facilities, i. e. a particular network element like a road segment, a ramp, or an intersection. The Level of Service of single road facilities (LOS) {{is derived from the}} volume capacity ratio, the delay time or the traffic density. In addition to the HBS the German <b>guidelines</b> provide a <b>complementary</b> <b>Guideline</b> for Integrated Network Planning RIN (Richtlinien für die integrierte Netzgestaltung, FGSV 2008) which is used for categorising transport networks and for evaluating the service quality in multi-modal networks. Here the LOS refers to entire journeys, i. e. to origin-destination-pairs. The most important indicator for evaluating the service quality of a particular od-pair is the direct speed (= direct distance / journey time). Journey time and the resulting direct speed include not only the in-vehicle time but also access and egress times which can reduce the speed of the entire journey significantly, especially in public transport. Additional indictors evaluation the directness and the travel time ratio of competing modes complement the set of indicators for evaluating the service quality. For each indicator the guideline provides evaluations functions for the service levels A to F which depend on the direct distance between origin and destination. This reflects the fact that speeds typically increase with longer distances while detour factor and travel time ratio decreases. The paper summarizes the approach of the guideline for evaluating the service quality and presents experience with the evaluation scheme collected in various applications covering car and public transport networks. It shows how the evaluation results can be used to recognize shortcomings in the network not only on the level of od-pairs but also to identify critical network elements. Finally the paper explains how the two guidelines HBS and RIN are connected...|$|R

40|$|Research on provenance, {{which focuses}} on {{different}} ways to describe and record the history of changes and advances made throughout an analysis process, {{is an integral part}} of visual analytics. This paper focuses on providing the provenance of insight and rationale through visualizations while emphasizing, first, that this entails a profound understanding of human cognition and reasoning and that, second, the special nature of spatiotemporal data needs to be acknowledged in this process. A recently proposed human reasoning framework for spatiotemporal analysis, and four guidelines for the creation of visualizations that provide the provenance of insight and rationale published in relation to that framework, work as a starting point for this paper. While these guidelines are quite abstract, this paper set out to create a set of more concrete guidelines. On the basis of a review of available provenance solutions, this paper identifies a set of key features that are of relevance when providing the provenance of insight and rationale and, on the basis of these features, produces a new set of <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines</b> that are more practically oriented than the original ones. Together, these two sets of guidelines provide both a theoretical and practical approach to the problem of providing the provenance of insight and rationale.

40|$|Although until 1980 s {{scientific}} research on corruption was largely {{limited to the}} fields of sociology and criminal law, starting from that moment, {{there has been an}} increase in studies on the relationship between corruption and economic performance, with respect to both public and private sectors. In the public sector, corruption is supposed to reduce the efficiency of public services, to jeopardize citizens’ trust in institutions and to increase in transaction costs. In this framework, corruption, acting as a negative externalities, creates {{a situation in which the}} market fails, to allocate resources efficiently. With regard to the private sector, corruption has a relevant effect on the size of the informal economy, increasing the costs of creating new businesses and surviving in the market within the formal economy. Hence, higher costs are connected to a deterioration of the firms’ financial position and expose them to higher default risks. Lower firms’ performances and a decrease in the levels of governance effectiveness weaken financial institutions, amplifying the effect of local crises in an interconnected and globalised financial markets. 	According to these recent developments in Law and Economics literature, this double special issue of international Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance (IJMEF) includes nine papers about the relationship between corruption and economic performance in private or public sectors. 	Hence the special issue develops along two separate, but <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines,</b> analysing the relationship between corruption and economic and financial performances on both micro and macro perspectives.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mega construction projects are complex undertakings. The complexity is increased during a construction boom in a city such as Dubai where more than 80 % of material and labour resources are imported. The complexities inherent in mega construction projects include uncertainty and interdependencies, which affect project management performance at the operational level {{where most of the}} problems occur. Understanding these processes, how they interrelate and how to overcome the complexities is crucial for increasing the chances of project management success. This research contributed to construction project management theory and practice by using a highly inductive exploratory qualitative approach for capturing formal and informal processes in mega construction projects in Dubai. A dynamic model depicting the complementary formal and informal processes is developed showing formal and informal processes and how they interrelate to reduce complexity. Guidelines on how and when to use specific processes are provided as a framework for the model. This framework may be used to help develop communication processes in future complex projects to increase chances of project management success. The research was conducted by exploring two case study projects fitting the characteristics of mega construction projects. Both case study projects were of values above 1. 5 Billion US Dollars and were similar in scope with elements including amusement parks, retail areas, hotels, extensive infrastructure and large landscape areas. Both case study projects were of an experimental character, considered an engineering achievement, complex, and thereby, difficult to control. The research data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 83 project staff from both case study projects. Rich picture diagrams of the organization and processes were made from data collected during the interviews and case study project documents. The analysis was performed in three phases where the results from each phase were built upon cumulatively. The first phase examined what the most crucial critical success factors (CSFs) were in the case study projects. These were revealed to be communication, top management support and effective change management. In the second phase each CSF was analyzed where it was found it that the majority of important communication modes were informal and were was most effective in reducing complexity. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} characteristics of the client were crucial in both case study projects. The third phase involved development of the dynamic hybrid model from the rich picture diagrams created showing the interplay between formal and informal processes. It was found that informal processes are ad-hoc and chaotic in nature and controlled by individuals in the project. Development of guidelines for the positive use of informal processes was required. From the analysis it was found that the characteristics of client staff and individuals in the case study projects provided the main guidelines for effective use of the hybrid model. The research provides insights into the formal and informal processes and the reduction and management of complexity inherent in mega construction projects. Current research in managing complexity is from the perspective of the formal process where the informal processes are neglected, despite research and practice indicating their importance in construction projects. The research presents a systemic dynamic model of the processes for mega construction projects revealing that formal and informal processes are required and are <b>complementary.</b> <b>Guidelines</b> for the successful use of the model provide a framework for its application in practice. This shows how it can be used to inform understanding of processes in the context of the research. The model and guidelines were validated via discussions with practitioners experienced in construction of mega projects. Future work should expand the findings to applications of the model in practice for management of complex projects. The model may be used by practitioners to act as a guide in how to manage construction processes to consciously overcome the inherent complexities to achieve project management objectives. This tool may also be used to inform clients of the inherent complexities and the level of informality required to overcome them. IT/IS practitioners may use the model and framework to understand the complexities in construction, and thereby, develop systems that are practically applied in construction projects.

40|$|Whereas the {{influence}} of pregnancy diet and milk feeding on children’s health and development is well characterized, the role of early food intake and eating behaviors is largely unexplored. This study aimed {{to determine whether the}} degree of adherence to <b>complementary</b> feeding <b>guidelines</b> was associated with dietary, obesity, cardiovascular, and cognitive outcomes at 7 – 8 y of age. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age to calculate a Complementary Feeding Utility Index score. Regression analysis was used to explore associations between the index score and dietary patterns derived via principal component analysis (n = 4326), body mass index (BMI) (n = 4801), waist circumference (n = 4798), blood pressure (n = 4685), and lipids (n = 3232) measured at age 7 y; and intelligence quotient (IQ) measured at age 8 y (n = 4429) after adjustment for covariates. The index score was negatively associated with a ‘‘processed’’ dietary pattern (β = - 0. 16; 95 % CI: - 0. 20, - 0. 13; P < 0. 001) but positively associated with a ‘‘health conscious’’ dietary pattern [β = 0. 18 (95 %CI: 0. 14, 0. 21); P < 0. 001]. A higher index score was also positively associated with total, verbal, and performance IQ scores at 8 y of age [β = 1. 92 (95 %CI: 1. 38, 2. 47); P < 0. 001 for total IQ). The index score was weakly associated with waist circumference [β = - 0. 15 (95 %CI: - 0. 31, - 0. 002); P = 0. 046] and diastolic blood pressure [β = - 0. 24 (95 %CI: - 0. 47, - 0. 01); P = 0. 043] at 7 y of age but was not associated with BMI or other cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Currently, the {{barriers}} to appropriate infant feeding practices are largely unknown in the Central River Division of the Gambia. A questionnaire was developed and implemented by a local Non Governmental Organization (NGO), the Gambia Food and Nutrition Agency, {{in order to gain}} more information and ultimately to improve the child mortality rate of the country. There were two participant groups: 88 Doers who are women who had adopted the appropriate <b>complementary</b> feeding practice <b>guidelines</b> as defined by the World Health Organization and 87 Non Doers who are women who had in some way strayed from the appropriate <b>complementary</b> feeding practice <b>guidelines.</b> The questionnaire included aspects of the Health Belief Model which can be used {{in the development of a}} future intervention. The Yes/No questions were analyzed using the Chi-square statistical method and the open-ended questions used a descriptive analysis method of evaluation. The constructs for perceived susceptibility, perceived action efficacy, perceived self efficacy, cues for action and perception of divine showed significant differences between the Doers and the Non Doers (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The descriptive analysis revealed that both participant groups had a limited understanding of the preventative qualities of the adoption of appropriate complementary feeding practices. The women in both of groups also showed a strong perception of divine will. Women in the Central River Division perceive their husband and in-laws to be the most influential in the decision-making process regarding infant feeding practices. Recommendations for future interventions must acknowledge the importance and influence of the community surrounding the women in their adoption of the appropriate infant feeding practices. It would also be important to educate women about of the specific guidelines of the appropriate complementary feeding practices, specifically the delay in early initiation of complementary feeding. The results of this barrier analysis provide useful information to plan and implement an effective intervention to improve the child mortality rate in the Gambia. ...|$|R

40|$|O tema Gravitação Clássica faz parte do currículo vigente para o Ensino Médio, sendo ministrado na 1 a série desse nível de ensino. Esta dissertação apresenta uma pesquisa a respeito do tema Gravitação Clássica no Ensino Médio baseada em dois eixos norteadores e complementares de pesquisa e ação. O primeiro eixo apóia-se na análise de 21 livros didáticos de Física, que são mais comumente utilizados no Ensino Médio na cidade de Natal/RN. O segundo eixo, trabalhado após serem verificadas as deficiências mais comuns presentes nos livros didáticos, corresponde à elaboração, seguida da aplicação prática, de um curso sugerindo como abordar o tema em sala de aula. Os Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais para o Ensino Médio (PCNEM) advogam que esse tema é muito importante para a formação dos alunos e que o seu estudo auxilia na compreensão de diversos fenômenos da natureza. Considerando essa visão do tema pelos PCNEM, os 21 livros analisados foram separados em dois grupos: o primeiro grupo, com 10 livros, foi editado antes da divulgação dos PCNEM, e o segundo grupo, com 11 livros, após a sua divulgação. Independentemente de pertencer ao primeiro ou ao segundo grupo, a grande maioria dos livros didáticos relega o tema para um segundo plano; dois deles chegam ao extremo de sugerir, nas orientações aos professores, que o conteúdo Gravitação seja omitido, caso o tempo seja insuficiente. Essa constatação sinaliza no sentido de que os PCNEM não produziram nenhuma mudança na concepção dos autores dos livros a respeito do tema. Para a análise dos livros didáticos, utilizou-se como instrumento um roteiro que elaboramos, por meio do qual se procurou evidenciar a importância relativa da contextualização histórica e filosófica do tema, da experiência cotidiana dos alunos e da interdisciplinaridade, entre outros pontos. Constatou-se que os livros didáticos pouco enfatizam os aspectos históricos da construção do conhecimento, a relação com as questões do cotidiano e o caráter interdisciplinar do tema Gravitação. Chama a atenção a não concordância entre os autores a respeito do conhecimento {{anterior}} ou dos pré-requisitos necessários aos alunos para iniciarem o estudo da Gravitação. O curso que elaboramos foi ministrado tanto para professores como para alunos, sendo abordados aspectos teóricos e práticos, com ênfase em questões históricas e em questões relacionadas com o cotidiano das pessoas. O curso para professores foi realizado como uma atividade de extensão da UFRN e foi ministrado, pela autora desta dissertação, na Escola Estadual Francisco Ivo Cavalcanti (Natal/RN). Fizeram-se presentes a esse evento 23 professores de várias escolas da rede pública e de várias áreas do conhecimento. O orientador e os colegas mestrandos da autora desta dissertação atuaram como colaboradores, registrando opiniões e relatos dos participantes. O curso para alunos contou com a participação de 300 alunos regularmente matriculados em seis diferentes turmas do 1 º ano do Ensino Médio da Escola Marista de Natal/RN, onde a autora desta dissertação atua como professora de Física. Esse curso para alunos foi realizado como parte das atividades curriculares normais, ficando três turmas sob responsabilidade direta da autora desta dissertação e três outras a cargo de outro professor da escola, que atuou como colaborador. Tanto o curso para professores como o curso para alunos constou de duas etapas, cada uma de 5 horas. A primeira etapa foi desdobrada em dois momentos, sendo o primeiro centrado no levantamento das concepções espontâneas sobre Gravitação, trabalhando-se basicamente com os experimentos de lançamento livre e pêndulo; o segundo momento centrou-se em apresentações teóricas e discussões sobre os modelos de universo. A segunda etapa do curso foi um aprofundamento sobre as Leis de Kepler e a Lei da Gravitação Universal de Newton, sendo utilizadas, como instrumentos motivadores, práticas envolvendo construções do sistema solar em escala. Como instrumentos de avaliação de ambos os cursos, foram utilizados questionários e relatos de opiniões, além de avaliações usuais, na versão do curso para alunos. Os professores participantes demonstraram disponibilidade para realizar práticas interdisciplinares; todavia, segundo seus próprios relatos, eles freqüentemente esbarravam na dificuldade do como fazer. Da experiência vivida nos dois cursos, verificou-se que a abordagem aqui proposta para o tema Gravitação Clássica, apoiada no tripé teoria, prática e aspectos históricos e filosóficos, é viável e efetiva. Espera-se que essa pesquisa possa contribuir na formação de uma opinião, entre os professores, a respeito de como abordar o tema Gravitação Clássica, e possa fornecer subsídios para que os interessados desenvolvam práticas em sala de aula visando aprimorar o ensino desse tema, que é de importância ímpar na formação dos alunos do Ensino MédioThe {{subject of}} Classic Gravitation {{is part of}} the actual curriculum for High School in Brazil, and it is taught {{in the first year of}} that education level. This master thesis presents a research regarding the subject Classic Gravitation in High School. This research was based in two <b>complementary</b> <b>guidelines</b> of research and action. The first guideline was the analysis of 21 didactic books of physics which are the more frequently used in High School, in the city of Natal/RN. The second guideline, worked after being verified the most common deficiencies presents in the didactic books, was the elaboration, followed by a practical application, of a course suggesting how to approach that subject in the classroom. The Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais para o Ensino Médio (National Curricular Parameters for High School PCNEM) defend that Classic Gravitation is very important in the student s formation and that its study helps the comprehension of many nature s phenomena. Because of this vision of that subject by the PCNEM, the 21 analyzed books were separated in two groups: the first one, containing 10 books, was edited before the spreading of PCNEM, and the second, with 11 books, after that spreading. Whatever the group to which the didactic books belonged, the great majority of them let that subject in a second plan; two of them even suggesting, in the teacher s orientations, that the subject Gravitation can be suppressed in case of insufficient time. These analyses points that the PCNEM had produced no changes in the conception of the authors that wrote books regarding that subject. To analyze the didactic books, we elaborated a script which was used as an analysis tool, in which we put in evidence the relative importance of the historic and philosophic contextualization of the subject, the quotidian experience of the students and the interdisciplinary approach, among other aspects. It became evident that the didactic books give very little emphasis to historic aspects of the knowledge construction, to the relations with the day-by-day questions and to the interdisciplinary character of the subject Gravitation. It calls attention the non concordance among the authors opinions regarding the necessary previous knowledge or prerequisites the students should fulfill in order to begin to study Gravitation. The course we elaborated was given to a group of teachers as well as to students. In those courses we treated theoretical and practical aspects and emphasized historical questions and the ones which are related to people s daily life. The course for teachers was realized as an extra-mural activity of the UFRN and was given by the author of this thesis at the Escola Estadual Francisco Ivo Cavalcanti (a state public school in Natal/RN). There were 23 teachers present, from several public schools and several fields of knowledge. The thesis supervisor and the master degree s colleagues of the author acted as collaborators, reporting the participants opinions and speeches. The course to the students, on the other hand, had the participation of 300 regular students who belonged to 6 different 1 st year classes of the High School Escola Marista de Natal (RN), in which the author acts as a physics teacher. The student s course was realized as part of the regular curriculum activities, in which three classes stood under the responsibility of the author and other three classes in charge of another Marista s teacher, who participated as a collaborator. The teacher s course as well as the students one were given in two stages, with five hours each. The first stage was divided in two moments, the first one focused on the survey of the spontaneous conceptions about gravitation, in which we worked basically with experiments of free throwing and pendulum, and the second one focused in theoretical presentations and quarrels about universe s models. In the second stage of the course we improved the study of Kepler s laws and the Newton s Universal Gravitation law, and we used as motivating tools some practices involving the construction of the solar system in scale. As instruments for evaluating both courses we used questionnaires and reported the speeches with participants opinions, beyond usual written evaluations in the course for the students. The teachers who participated in the course showed very good wills in realizing interdisciplinary practices; nevertheless, according their own speeches, they frequently came across the difficulty of how to do. From the experience we had in both courses, we conclude that the approach we propose hear to the teaching of the subject Classic Gravitation, supported on the tripod theory, practice and historical and philosophical aspects, is viable and effective. One hopes that this research may contribute in the formation of a opinion, among the teachers, concerning how to approach the subject of Classic Gravitation, and may offer suggestions in order those who want to apply that approach may develop classroom practices aiming to improve the teaching of that subject, which has a singular importance in the formation of High School student...|$|E

Consensus statements outlining diagnostic criteria for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma and amyloidosis have been recently published. Understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of myeloma has accelerated in the last decade and provides the basis for improved prognostication and therapeutic interventions. Myeloma therapy has progressed with the introduction of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation and the recent introduction of the novel agents, thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib. Each of these therapeutic advances has contributed to the improved survival seen in this patient population. Similar treatment advances are occurring in AL amyloidosis. While serum and urine electrophoretic analysis remain the “gold standard” laboratory techniques for the accurate and cost-effective monitoring of the monoclonal gammopathies, new tests such as the free light chain assays have a <b>complementary</b> role.

The study aim was to develop an index reflecting the degree of adherence to <b>complementary</b> feeding <b>guidelines,</b> evaluate its convergent validity, and explore associations with socio-demographic factors and dietary pattern scores in childhood. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 6065) using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age, sociodemographic information, and dietary patterns derived by principal component analysis at age 3 y. The Complementary Feeding Utility Index (CFUI) consists of 14 components: breastfeeding duration, feeding to appetite, timing of introduction to solids, exposure to iron-rich cereals, fruit and vegetable intake, exposure to high-fat/-salt/-sugar foods including sugary drinks, food texture, and meal/snack frequency. Regression analyses were undertaken to investigate associations between index scores, socio-demographic factors, food and nutrient intakes, and dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. Milk and food intake at 6 mo and nutrient intake at 8 mo of age varied across quintiles of index score in largely the expected directions. Associations were found among index score, maternal age, education, social class, maternal smoking history, and prepregnancy BMI. After adjustment for socio-demographic factors, the index score was associated with “processed“ [b = 20. 234 (95 % CI = 20. 260, – 0. 209) ] and “healthy” [b = 0. 185 (95 % CI = 0. 155, 0. 215) ] dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. The CFUI is able to discriminate across food intake, nutrient intake, and socio-demographic factors and is associated with later dietary patterns. Rebecca K. Golley, Lisa G. Smithers, Murthy N.

These guidelines are not limited to HDGC and are therefore partially <b>complementary</b> to the <b>guidelines</b> on hereditary diffuse gastric cancer of the international gastric cancer linkage consortium (IGCLC 2010). In order to optimize the care and increase the knowledge on hereditary gastric cancer it is important to centralize medical care for these patients. National and international collaboration is warranted {{to improve the quality of}} research by increasing the size of study cohorts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{contribute}} {{in the discussion of}} internet-based internationalization. The focus is in examining and analyzing the alternatives of internet-based internationalization, specifically {{from the point of view}} of an SME. Fashion retail provides the context for this study. The research phenomenon is approached methodologically with a qualitative research. The empirical primary is collected through interviews of the case companies. After literature review, is formed theoretical framework based on previous academic literature. The empirical data for the thesis will be collected through interviews of SMEs doing internet-based operations and which are in diverse stages of internationalization. The goal is to address new viewpoints and concepts to add in the discussion of the topic and thus contribute in the theoretical field. The aim is to bring up also practical viewpoints as managerial contributions for managers to learn from and take into consideration in the strategic decisions of their own companies. Based on research and confirmed by empirical data, four alternatives for internet-based internationalization are pointed out: physical presence, co-operative actions, direct online sales and regional approach to online internationalization. These alternatives do not necessarily outline each other; they may be utilized as separate or <b>complementary</b> strategic <b>guidelines</b> or ways to internationalize an internet-based business. Each alternative contains essential features and aspects that differentiate them from each other. In this study, these alternatives are exclusively presented firstly in the theoretical framework and later in modified framework. As is pointed out in theoretical framework, and confirmed in three interviews, knowledge is the crucial concept in every aspect of internet-based internationalization. Knowledge guides strategic decisions and it is both the trigger and the result of different operations. Internationalizing companies gather information and knowledge through several methods and through strategic decisions, and utilize knowledge and experiences as guidance for their further strategic decision. The findings provide both theoretical and managerial implications. Also guidelines for future research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} {{have embraced the}} benefits of cloud computing because of its pay-per-use cost model and the elasticity of resources that it provides. But from a data confidentiality and integrity viewpoint, moving a company’s IT systems to a public cloud poses some challenges. System protection is often based on perimeter security, but in the cloud, the company’s systems run on the cloud provider’s hardware and coexist with software from both the provider and other cloud service consumers. Simply put, the cloud blurs the formerly clear separation between the trusted inside and the untrusted outside. Malicious insiders represent a particularly significant concern for security in the cloud, as cloud operators and system administrators are unseen, unknown, and not onsite. Confidential data such as passwords, cryptographic keys, or files {{are just a few}} commands away from access by a malicious or incompetent system administrator. This ReadyNote addresses the threat of malicious insiders in the context of clouds that provide the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, in the sense of clouds where consumers can run virtual machines. The text is <b>complementary</b> to several <b>guidelines</b> and reports on cloud security that have been published by organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), and the Cloud Security Alliance...|$|R
40|$|Public health {{pesticides}} {{has been}} the mainstay control of vectors of malaria and other diseases, and public health pests, but there is increasing concern over how these pesticides are being managed. Poor pesticide management could lead to risks to {{human health and the}} environment, or diminish the effectiveness of interventions. Strategies for strengthening the management of public health pesticides, from manufacture to disposal, should be evaluated to propose future directions. The process and outcomes of three strategies were studied in five regions of the WHO (African Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, South-East Asia Region, Western Pacific Region, and American Region) and 13 selected countries. These strategies are: regional policy development, in-depth country support and thematic support across countries. Consensus, frameworks and action plans on public health pesticide management were developed at regional level. Country support for situation analysis and national action planning highlighted weaknesses over the entire spectrum of pesticide management practices, mainly related to malaria control. The thematic support on pesticide quality control contributed to structural improvements on a priority issue for malaria control across countries. The three strategies showed promising and <b>complementary</b> results, but <b>guidelines</b> and tools for implementation of the strategies should be further improved. Increased national and international priority should be given to support the development of policy, legislation and capacity that are necessary for sound management of public health pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Background: Infants {{living in}} poor {{socioeconomic}} conditions in Bogota, Colombia frequently receive unsuitable complementary foods (CFs) and {{are at risk}} of iron deficiency and poor linear growth. New <b>complementary</b> feeding <b>guidelines</b> (NCFg) emphasizing red meat as a source of iron and zinc were developed for this population. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the NCFg would improve infant iron and zinc status and growth. Methods: 85 infants exclusively breastfed for ≥ 4 mo were randomly assigned at 6 mo to control group (CG; current CF advice) or intervention group (NGG; counseling including advice to offer red meat ≥ 3 days/week). Continued breastfeeding was recommended alongside CF. Main outcomes were (i) haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), iron (serum ferritin (SF) and zinc status at 12 months and (ii) growth from 6 - 12 mo. Results: 85 infants were randomised (43 CG, 42 NGG). NGG infants had significantly higher red meat intake (eg. 5. 4 (SD 1. 8) versus 3. 5 (1. 7) days/week at 12 mo, p< 0. 001); significantly higher Hb (12. 48 g/dL (0. 7) versus 11. 96 g/dL (0. 9), p= 0. 009), Hct (36. 6 % (1. 9) versus 35. 5 % (2. 1), p= 0. 02) at 12 months, and greater change in Hb (0. 4 (0. 8) versus - 0. 13 (1. 0) p< 0. 01) and Hct (1. 04 (2. 2) versus - 0. 15 (2. 4), p= 0. 03) from 6 - 12 months. Red meat consumption was positively related to iron status. SF decreased and zinc increased in both groups but was not significantly different between groups at 12 mo. Proportions of infants with anaemia, iron deficiency, and iron depletion were influenced by definition and cut-offs used, and by adjustment for altitude. There {{were no significant differences in}} linear growth from 6 to 12 months. Conclusions: The new CF guidelines were acceptable and showed efficacy in this population, with increase in red meat consumption and positive effects on Hb and Hct. The results also highlight the need to clarify and define cut-offs for evaluating iron status in infants...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the survey}} {{was to assess the}} {{prevalence}} of clinically diagnosed knee osteoarthritis (OA) in two general practice populations in the Wessex region (practice A: a deprived urban population and practice B: an affluent rural population) and to assess both conventional and complementary therapy use in these two populations. Methods. All patients over 55 yr with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA, as identified from the practice computerized records, were sent a questionnaire about their knee pain and their use of conventional and complementary treatments. Results. A total of 4566 patients over 55 yr were registered in the two practices. Of these, 828 (18. 13 %) had a clinical diagnosis of knee OA and 240 (29 %) patients were asymptomatic at the time of survey. Physiotherapy was under-utilized with only 13. 1 % of patients having received either hospital- or GP-based physiotherapy. There was a high prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, being significantly more in the affluent population (P < 0. 05). In the affluent population there were statistically more social class groups 1 – 3 a; statistically more NSAIDs, glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate were also used. The median amount spent on complementary medicine per month was £ 5. 00, with the affluent population spending significantly more (P < 0. 05). Conclusions. In this population, physiotherapy is an under-utilized treatment for knee OA, in spite of its recommendation as first-line treatment in all <b>guidelines.</b> <b>Complementary</b> medicines and therapies are commonly used, particularly in affluent populations...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to {{atherosclerosis}} of the arterial {{vessel wall}} and to thrombosis is the foremost cause of premature mortality and of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Europe, {{and is also}} increasingly common in developing countries. 1 In the European Union, the economic cost of CVD represents annually E 192 billion 1 in direct and indirect healthcare costs. The main clinical entities are coronary artery disease (CAD), ischaemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The causes of these CVDs are multifactorial. Some of these factors relate to lifestyles, such as tobacco smoking, lack of physical activity, and dietary habits, and are thus modifiable. Other risk factors are also modifiable, such as elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemias, or non-modifiable, such as age and male gender. These guidelines deal with the management of dyslipidaemias as an essential and integral part of CVD prevention. Prevention and treatment of dyslipidaemias should always be considered within the broader framework of CVD prevention, which is addressed in guidelines of the Joint European Societies' Task forces on CVD prevention in clinical practice. 2 - 5 The latest version of these guidelines was published in 20075; an update will become available in 2012. These Joint ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias are <b>complementary</b> to the <b>guidelines</b> on CVD prevention in clinical practice and address not only physicians [e. g. general practitioners (GPs) and cardiologists] interested in CVD prevention, but also specialists from lipid clinics or metabolic units who are dealing with dyslipidaemias that {{are more difficult to}} classify and treat.

40|$|The "UNESCO World Heritage Convention" was ratificated on November 16, 1972. Since then, {{both public}} and private sectors around the world have {{attached}} growing importance to the safeguarding and conservation of selected cultural and natural "objects", focusing on physical characteristics. World Heritage sites receive major publicity and as a result become notable attractions for large numbers of tourists from all over the world. However, in spite of the clear economic benefits and political prestige, this massive influx of tourists disrupts and in most cases, in the long run, destroys the social quality of indigenous community. The deterioration of social quality could ultimately undermine the application of conservation policy. The aim of this research is to: 1) identify the negative impact of conservation policies implemented in living World Heritage sites on the social quality of traditional communities; 2) develop a design tool constraining spatial morphology to overcome the negative influences on the social quality The study leads to a new approach to conservation planning that takes into account sustaining social quality while enforcing UNESCO World Heritage conservation program. Given the complexity and novelty of social problems as new activities and actors enter into traditional living communities, a comparative case-study approach has been adopted, employing on-site survey and in situ investigations by the author. Two cases of UNESCO World Heritage sites have been chosen: the Dayan town in Lijiang, Yunan province of China, and the Ogimachi village in the Chubu region of Japan. In both cases, the conservation program has been applied with respect to physical features of the sites. However, they have been implemented differently from a planning and design point of view, and thus have had different impacts on the social quality of local communities: negative in the case of Dayan and positive in the case of Ogimachi. In the first instance, the study has been used to identify the various aspects and parameters of the problem, and to develop a hypothesis about the role of constrained physical organization in retaining social quality; in the second instance, the study aims to test the model derived from the hypothesis and to develop a <b>complementary</b> design <b>guidelines.</b> Drawing from literature, the study defines social quality in terms of observable, measurable social indicators in the context of living heritage conservation. The data obtained from case studies have been analyzed and generalized within the MOP (Morphology, Operation, Performance) framework. Given the above analysis, the conclusion arrives as a new knowledge-based design tool in the form of design guidelines. The guidelines constrain spatial morphology to enable social interactions and enhance social quality. Extrapolating from this study, the new knowledge-based design tool works in parallel with the conservation of physical objects as applied by current UNESCO policy to safeguard social quality of indigenous community. The conclusions of this dissertation are limited by: the number and the type of cases selected; the methods of data collection and data analysis adopted. These limitations might affect the generalization of the conclusions and applicability of the tool. However, they suggest directions for further investigations towards understanding better the relation between social quality maintenance and environmental conservation. Architectur...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} part of damage observed in destructive earthquakes {{around the world is}} associated with seismic wave amplification due to local site effects. Site response analysis is therefore a fundamental part of assessing seismic hazard in earthquake prone areas. A number of experiments are required to evaluate local site effects. Among the empirical methods the H/V spectral ratios on ambient vibrations {{is probably one of the}} most common approaches. The method, also called the „Nakamura technique“ (Nakamura, 1989), was first introduced by Nogoshi and Igarashi (1971) based on the initial studies of Kanai and Tanaka (1961). Since then, many investigators in different parts of the world have conducted a large number of applications. An important requirement for the implementation of the H/V method is a good knowledge of engineering seismology combined with background information on local geological conditions supported by geophysical and geotechnical data. The method is typically applied in microzonation studies and in the investigation of the local response of specific sites. In the present document, the application of the H/V technique in assessing local site effects due to dynamic earthquake excitations, is the main focus, whereas other applications regarding the static aspects are not considered. In the framework of the European research project SESAME (Site Effects Assessment Using Ambient Excitations: Contract No. EVG 1 -CT- 2000 - 00026), the use of ambient vibrations in understanding local site effects has been studied in detail. The present guidelines on the H/V spectral ratio technique are the result of comprehensive and detailed analyses performed by the SESAME participants during the last three years. In this respect, the guidelines represent the state-of-the-art of the present knowledge of this method and its applications, and are based on the consensus reached by a large group of participants. It reflects the synthesis of a considerable amount of data collection and subsequent analysis and interpretations. In general, due to the experimental character of the H/V method, the absolute values obtained for a given site require careful examination. In this respect visual inspection of the data both during data collection and processing is necessary. Especially during the interpretation of the results there should be frequent interaction with regard to the choices of the parameters for processing. The guidelines presented here outline the recommendations that should be taken into account in studies of local site effects using the H/V technique on ambient vibrations. The recommendations given apply basically for the case where the method is used alone in assessing the natural frequency of sites of interest and are therefore based on a rather strict set of criteria. The recommended use of the H/V method is however, to combine several other geophysical and geotechnical approaches with sufficient understanding of the local geological conditions. In such a case, the interpretation of the H/V results can be improved significantly in the light of the <b>complementary</b> data. The <b>guidelines</b> are organised in two separate parts; the quick field reference and interpretation guidelines (Part I) and detailed technical guidelines (Part II). Part I aims to summarise the most critical factors that influence the data collection, analysis and interpretation and provides schematic recommendations on the interpretation of results. Part II includes a detailed description of the technical requirements, standard data processing and the interpretation of results. Several examples of the criteria described in Part I and II are given in Appendix A. In addition, some physical explanations of the results based on theoretical considerations are given in Appendix B. In Part II, section 1, the results of the experiments performed within the framework of the SESAME project are given in smaller fonts to separate these from the recommendations and the explanations given in the guidelines. The word „soil“ should be considered as a generic term used throughout the text to refer to all kinds of deposits overlying bedrock without taking into account their specific origin. The processing software J-SESAME developed specifically for using in H/V technique, is explained (provided on a separate CD accompanying the guidelines) in Part II. However, the recommendations given in the guidelines are meant for general application of the method with any other similar software. J-SESAME is provided as a tool for the easy implementation of the recommendations outlined in this document. Regarding the processing of the data, several options can be chosen, but the recommended processing options are provided as defaults by the J-SESAME software...|$|R
