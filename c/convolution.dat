5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} <b>convolution</b> {{method that}} they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Voiculescu and Biane that the {{analytic}} subordination property holds for free additive and multiplicative <b>convolutions.</b> In this paper, we present an operatorial approach to subordination for free multiplicative <b>convolutions.</b> This study {{is based on the}} concepts of `freeness with subordination', or `s-free independence', and `orthogonal independence', introduced recently in the context of free additive <b>convolutions.</b> In particular, we introduce and study the associated multiplicative <b>convolutions</b> and construct related operators, called `subordination operators' and `subordination branches'. Using orthogonal independence, we derive decompositions of subordination branches and related decompositions of s-free and free multiplicative <b>convolutions.</b> The operatorial methods lead to several new types of graph products, called `loop products', associated with different notions of independence (monotone, boolean, orthogonal, s-free). We also prove that the enumeration of rooted `alternating double return walks' on the loop products of graphs and on the free product of graphs gives the moments of the corresponding multiplicative <b>convolutions.</b> Comment: 43 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{networks}} rely on <b>convolutions</b> {{to aggregate}} spatial information. However, spatial <b>convolutions</b> are expensive {{in terms of}} model size and computation, both of which grow quadratically with respect to kernel size. In this paper, we present a parameter-free, FLOP-free "shift" operation {{as an alternative to}} spatial <b>convolutions.</b> We fuse shifts and point-wise <b>convolutions</b> to construct end-to-end trainable shift-based modules, with a hyperparameter characterizing the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the operation's efficacy, we replace ResNet's 3 x 3 <b>convolutions</b> with shift-based modules for improved CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 accuracy using 60 % fewer parameters; we additionally demonstrate the operation's resilience to parameter reduction on ImageNet, outperforming ResNet family members. We finally show the shift operation's applicability across domains, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters on classification, face verification and style transfer.
