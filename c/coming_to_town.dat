25|$|In Santa Claus is <b>Coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town</b> (1970), she is {{introduced}} {{as a teacher}} named Jessica, who first meets Santa Claus (then known as Kris Kringle) as a young man, when he's trying to illegally deliver toys to a town run by a despotic ruler. She assists him, and thus becomes a wanted fugitive herself with Kringle and his confederates. In light of this sacrifice, Jessica and Santa soon {{fall in love with}} each other, and marry in the nearby forest. In 1974's The Year Without a Santa Claus and the 2006 live action remake, Mrs. Claus played a large role, as she attempts to show Santa (who wishes to stay home that year for Christmas when he feels no one appreciates or believes in him anymore) that there's still some Christmas spirit left in the world. Mrs. Claus also made appearances in several other Rankin/Bass specials.|$|E
500|$|In his 1947 book From Caligari to Hitler, Siegfried Kracauer argued, {{based largely}} on an {{unpublished}} typescript written and provided by Janowitz, that the film originally included no frame story at all and only the main story, starting with the fair <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>town</b> and ending with Dr. Caligari becoming institutionalized. Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a [...] "revolutionary" [...] film into a [...] "conformistic" [...] one. (See the Themes section for more.) No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist to confirm this fact, until the early 1950s when actor Werner Krauss revealed he still had his copy. Krauss refused to part with it, {{and it was not}} until 1978, after his death, that it was purchased by the German film archive Deutsche Kinemathek. It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} season the show was {{nominated}} for five Teen Choice Awards winning four of them, including best drama. It was also nominated for the Favorite Television Drama People's Choice Award. Kelly Rowan won a PRISM Award for Performance in a Drama Series Episode, with Peter Gallagher also getting nominated. Additionally the season finale was nominated for the TV Drama Series Episode award. The introduction of bisexual character Alex, was praised as [...] "an especially charismatic new presence", with the show was praised for its handling of her lesbian relationship with Marissa. However Mischa Barton was criticized for her acting skills in portraying Marissa, alongside other noted flaws including [...] "flavorless plots," [...] and [...] "flat new characters who failed to grab the audience's interest". IGN faulted the move to quickly rekindle the Ryan and Marissa relationship and [...] "abruptly write off Alex and Lindsay, after [...] them a pretty {{big part of the}} show" [...] but commended a [...] "compelling story centering on Ryan's brother Trey <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>town,</b> leading to a very dramatic season finale" [...] Tate Donovan, who played Jimmy, credited a drop in ratings to [...] "the show moving away from the family dynamic to focus more on the kids".|$|E

500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>town</b> but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 1946, it was {{announced}} that Hal Wallis planned to star Miller in the film version of the Broadway play, Beggars Are <b>Coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town</b> (1945), a noirish story of betrayal and vengeance. Wallis intended this to be Miller's breakout role. Yet Wallis would skip the usual publicity buildup for a budding actress. Miller was to play a torch singer, Kay Lawrence, who befriends a convict, Frankie Madison, who returns to New York after 14 years in prison. Kay's boyfriend, Noll [...] "Dink" [...] Turner, is the owner of the Regent Club, which Frankie claims to own half of. Tired of Kay, Noll sends her to sweet-talk Frankie in an effort to stall for time. Meanwhile, Noll intends to dump Kay and marry a socialite. Both men battle for control of the business that Turner built while Frankie was in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Desert Fury, Wallis {{began work}} on Deadlock, the {{original}} project name for Beggars Are <b>Coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town.</b> Again Miller would be cast with Desert Furys Burt Lancaster and Wendell Corey. After weeks of rehearsals on the Modjeska Canyon location, {{under the direction of}} Byron Haskin, Miller suddenly became the second leading lady. Lizabeth Scott, ever competitive with all actresses, grabbed the Kay role for herself. Miller later recalled, [...] "(Wallis) planned to star me in 'I Walk Alone.' He tested me with Burt; it was a wonderful test. But then Lizabeth Scott decided she wanted the role, and Lizabeth got whatever she wanted—from Hal Wallis! [...] So, I got the second part instead." [...] The 21-year-old Miller was recast as the slumming socialite divorcée, Alexis Richardson. Miller was afraid that playing a [...] "meanie" [...] role might typecast her. She was also forced to cut her 22-inch hair into a shorter chignon. In designing Miller's wardrobe, Edith Head was impressed by Miller's physique, describing it as [...] "the most exciting figure since Betty Grable." [...] The resulting film was renamed I Walk Alone (1948). Shooting took place early December 1946–mid-February 1947. The film was released January 16, 1948. She was 5th-billed after Kirk Douglas. Despite Miller's fears of being typecast as a femme fatale, film historians tend to typecast her [...] "as always playing the 'good girl.'" [...] Typecasting reflected real life as Miller's name seldom appeared in gossip columns and when it did, never involved scandal. Though Miller participated in the Hollywood dating circuit, the one name that invariably appeared in the press was William Haskel Schuyler, a television pioneer and consultant based in San Francisco. In late November 1947, it was announced that Miller and Schuyler would wed. But the marriage was postponed.|$|E
