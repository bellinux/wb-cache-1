Across several measurement steps, we compare different RCS measurement results in order to eliminate the undesired RCS contribution caused mainly by the rotating steel platform. We demonstrate that when it is difficult or impossible to use microwave absorbers on the steel platform, an alternative method can be applied. Finally, {{with the help of}} 2 D radar image post processing, we can also identify and separate the RCS contribution of each element (vehicle, steel platform, ground/multipath/clutter) in the hologram image, and therefore obtain the pure RCS distribution of the tested vehicle. key words – RCS, hologram, <b>radar</b> image, <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> I. CONTEXT 24 GHz UWB (Ultra Wide Band) [21. 65 - 26. 65 GHz] <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> systems are very popular on the market since they provide most of the driving assistance options at a competitive cost [1] [2]. However, in Europe, regulation and permission of 24 GHz UWB for <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> is limited in time. Initially, European Commission (EC) decided the cut-off date would be July 2012, but this date is postponed till January 2018 for new vehicle registration and till January 2022 for vehicles registered before 2018 [3]. Therefore, 26 GHz UWB [24 - 29 GHz] will be ready as a replacement for 24 GHz UWB during the cut-off date. Indeed the shift to the 26 GHz band would be much easier to achieve. Moreover, this technology is allowed with no time limit. This paper deals with RCS measurement of vehicles in the frequency of 22 - 26 GHz for <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> application. II.

The ghost targets are introduced in FMCW radars, thus two or more measurement cycles are expanded to resolve the target ambiguities. In contrast to that FSK cannot solve targets in range direction. For this reason, the combination of FMCW and FSK was proposed, called MFSK. This waveform shows good performance, with a high range and velocity resolution, short measurement time, and ability to avoid ghost targets. The main drawback of this modulation is the complexity.

40|$|This master thesis covers {{two major}} topics, {{the first is}} the use of Advance driver {{assistance}} system (ADAS) sensors for human detection, and second is the use of ADAS sensors for the odometry estimation of the mobile work machine. Solid-state Lidar and <b>Automotive</b> <b>Radar</b> sensors are used as the ADAS sensors. Real-time Simulink models are created for both the sensors. The data is collected from the sensors by connecting the sensors with the XPC target via CAN communication. Later the data is later sent to Robot operating system (ROS) for visualization. The testing of the Solid-state Lidar and <b>Automotive</b> <b>Radar</b> sensors has been performed in different conditions and scenarios, it isn’t limited to human detection only. Detection of cars, machines, building, fence and other multiple objects have also been tested. Moreover, the two major cases for the testing of the sensors were the static case and the dynamic case. For the static case, both the sensors were mounted on a stationary rack and the moving/stationary objects were detected by the sensors. For the dynamic case, both the sensors were mounted on the GIM mobile machine, and the machine was driven around for the sensors to detect an object in the environment. The results are promising, and it is concluded that the sensors can be used for the human detection and for some other applications as well. Furthermore, this research presents an algorithm used to estimate the complete odometry/ ego-motion of the mobile work machine. For this purpose, we are using an <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor. Using this sensor and a gyroscope, we seek a complete odometry of the GIM mobile machine, which includes 2 -components of linear speed (forward and side slip) and a single component of angular speed. Kinematic equations are calculated having the constraints of vehicle motion and stationary points in the environment. Radial velocity and the azimuth angle of the objects detected are the major components of the kinematic equations provided by the <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor. A stationary environment is a compulsory clause in accurate estimation of radar odometry. Assuming the points detected by the <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor are stationary, it is then possible to calculate all the three unknown components of speed. However, it is impossible to calculate all the three components using a single radar sensor, because the latter system of equation becomes singular. Literature suggests use of multiple radar sensors, however, in this research, a vertical gyroscope is used to overcome this singularity. GIM mobile machine having a single <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> sensor and a vertical gyroscope is used for the experimentation.

40|$|<b>Automotive</b> <b>RADARs</b> {{have gained}} {{popularity}} {{recently as a}} means to sense obstacles and avoid collisions, thus preventing loss of life related to vehicular incidence. Research in object detection is increasingly tending towards the 77 GHz <b>automotive</b> <b>RADAR</b> band, owing to the availability of larger bandwidths, resulting in high range resolution. Another advantage of the frequency band comes from the absorption properties of the atmosphere, which limits the range and allows multiple vehicles to use RADARs with minimum interference. A Power Amplifier is the most power hungry block in a transmitter-receiver chain and must be designed for high power efficiency, in order to mitigate radiative and more importantly heat losses.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} by Mercedes Benz {{in the late}} 1990 s, W-band radars operating at 76 - 77 GHz have {{found their way into}} more and more passenger cars. These <b>automotive</b> <b>radars</b> are typically used in adaptive cruise control, pre-collision sensing, and other driver assistance systems. While these systems are usually only about the size of two stacked cigarette packs, system size, and weight remains a concern for many automotive manufacturers. In this dissertation, I discuss how artificially structured metamaterials can be used to improve lens-based <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> systems. Metamaterials allow the fabrication of smaller and lighter systems, while still meeting the frequency, high gain, and cost requirements of this application. In particular, I focus on the development of planar artificial dielectric lenses suitable for use in place of the injection-molded lenses now used in many <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> systems. I begin by using analytic and numerical ray-tracing to compare the performance of planar metamaterial GRIN lenses to equivalent aspheric refractive lenses. I do this to determine whether metamaterials are best employed in GRIN or refractive <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> lenses. Through this study I find that planar GRIN lenses with the large refractive index ranges enabled by metamaterials have approximately optically equivalent performance to equivalent refractive lenses for fields of view approaching ± 20 °. I also find that the uniaxial nature of most planar metamaterials does not negatively impact planar GRIN lens performance. I then turn my attention to implementing these planar GRIN lenses at W-band <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> frequencies. I begin by designing uniform sheets of W-band electrically-coupled LC resonator-based metamaterials. These metamaterial samples were fabricated by the Jokerst research group on glass and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrates and tested at Toyota Research Institute- North America (TRI-NA). When characterized at W-band frequencies, these metamaterials show material properties closely matching those predicted by full-wave simulations. Due to the high losses associated with resonant metamaterials, I shift my focus to non-resonant metamaterials. I discuss the design, fabrication, and testing of non-resonant metamaterials for fabrication on multilayer LCP printed circuit boards (PCBs). I then use these non-resonant metamaterials in a W-band planar metamaterial GRIN lens. Radiation pattern measurements show that this lens functions as a strong collimating element. Using similar lens design methods, I design a metamaterial GRIN lens from polytetrafluoroethylene-based (PTFE-based) non-resonant metamaterials. This GRIN lens is designed to match a target dielectric lens's radiation characteristics across a ± 6 ° field of view. Measurements at <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> frequencies show that this lens has approximately the same radiation characteristics as the target lens across the desired field of view. Finally, I describe the development of electrically reconfigurable metamaterials using thin-film silicon semiconductors. These silicon-based reconfigurable metamaterials were developed in close collaboration with several other researchers. My major contribution {{to the development of the}}se reconfigurable metamaterials consisted of the initial metamaterial design. The Jokerst research group fabricated this initial design while TRI-NA characterized the fabricated metamaterial experimentally. Measurements showed approximately 8 % variation in transmission under a 5 Volt DC bias. This variation in transmission closely matched the variation in transmission predicted by coupled electronic-electromagnetic simulation run by Yaroslav Urzhumov, one of other contributors to the development of the reconfigurable metamaterial.

Radar sensors have the property that the performance is not to be affected by low vision conditions compared with camera sensors or laser based radar sensors, which makes it crucial for the autonomous driving system. <b>Automotive</b> <b>radar</b> system utilizes millimeter-wave band to detect the range, velocity and direction of arrival (DOA).

The main modulation method of <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> is Frequency-Modulated Continous-Wave(FMCW), which holds advantages including high-resolution distance measurement, quick updating and lower sampling frequency required on hardware. %good functions in the various weather condition. The resolution and accuracy of DOA estimation depend on the number of used antennas and their physical size. To improve the performance advanced algorithms and antenna configurations can be used. So-called super-resolution techniques can improve the estimation performance but suffer when few measurements are available and the number of targets is unknown, and the performance will also be degraded by correlated signals. Monopulse is an established technique for radars for precision angle estimation. It enables DOA realized in only one pulse and requires quite less computation complexity. Conventional monopulse with one transmitter and two receivers and phased array monopulse have been well developed especially in tracking radar system. MIMO-monopulse has been studied in some literature, but most of them utilize distributed MIMO. The research and application of colocated MIMO-monopulse are still in progress. In FMCW <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> application, clutter may have a strong effect on DOA detection and estimation of targets with low RCS, e. g. pedestrian. With Space-Time Adaptive Processing(STAP), it is possible to suppress the clutter in the angle-Doppler domain. MIMO-monopulse basically utilizes digital beamformer to generate sum and difference channel, which also allows STAP processing to obtain adaptive sum and difference weighting. With STAP clutter can be canceled, thus false detection of MIMO-monopulse will be avoided. In this master thesis, we propose the solution of angle estimation algorithm using MIMO-monopulse based on an actual <b>automotive</b> <b>radar</b> provided by NXP using colocated MIMO antenna. The algorithm is simulated through Matlab and verified on real experimental data. The performance of the algorithm is compared with conventional DOA algorithm and the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. A feasible extension to STAP will be discussed to suppress the clutter for preventing false DOA estimation. Since monopulse estimator has been approved high performance in the field of single target tracking (such as low RCS pedestrian), our proposed algorithm is also validated in single and multiple target DOA estimations, which is an attractive scenario for a potential application using MIMO-monopulse...|$|R
