30|$|Vande Kopple’s (1985) {{classification}} for meta-discourse included textual {{and interpersonal}} main categories. Textual meta-discourse constituted text connectives, <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> validity markers, and narrators. Interpersonal meta-discourse also included illocution markers, attitude markers, and commentaries. Crismore et al. (1993) then provided a revised categorization of meta-discourse, including two major categories of textual and interpersonal. However, textual component was subdivided into textual markers (logical connectives, sequencers, reminders, and topicalizers) and interpretive markers (<b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> illocution markers, and announcements). The interpersonal aspect was also reorganized into hedges, certainty markers, attributors, attitude markers, and commentary. Hyland (2005) also proposed a models which comprises two major categories, including interactive MDMs, which concern the writer’s awareness of {{and attention to}} his readers and interactional MDMs, which refer to writer’s attempts to make his views more explicit for the readers.|$|E

This study will draw on Hyland’s (2005) {{metadiscourse}} model where <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> endophoric markers, evidentials, frame markers and transition markers {{are included in}} the interactive dimension, and attitude markers, boosters, engagement markers, hedges and self mention are to be found within interactional metadiscourse. I shall apply this framework for the identification and analysis of data in a corpus which comprises a selection of recipes taken from both Middle English Medical Texts (Taavitsainen – Pahta – Mäkinen 2005) and The corpus of early English recipes. The metadiscursive approach to the study of medical recipes will allow us to establish links between authors, texts and audience of the recipe genre and, consequently, to affirm their status as products of social engagement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} cultural {{variations in the}} use of metadiscourse between Turkish and USA postgraduate students’ abstracts in MA thesis written in English. The taxonomy was borrowed from Hyland (2005). The corpora in the present study comprise a total of 52 thesis abstracts written in English from the department of English Language Teaching, 26 thesis from USA students and 26 from Turkish students. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to analyse the texts in the corpora. The analysis revealed that there were some cultural differences in the amounts and types of metadiscourse. The incidence of evidential, endophorics, <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions were fewer in Turkish students’ master thesis abstracts. However, Turkish students used metadiscourse transitions, frame markers and hedges more than USA students. Pedagogical implications were provided in light of empirical data...|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} of the appearance such as gloss provides {{one of the most}} important information for object recognition. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms related to the perception of gloss. We examined whether the neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkeys are <b>coding</b> <b>gloss</b> of objects. We made visual stimuli which have various surface reflectance properties, and tested responses of IT neurons to these stimuli while a monkey was performing a visual fixation task. We found that there exist neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus that selectively responded to specific stimuli. The selectivity was largely maintained when the object shape or illumination condition was changed. In contrast, neural selectivity was lost when the pixels of objects were randomly rearranged. In the former manipulation of the stimuli, gloss perceptions were maintained, whereas in the latter manipulation, gloss perception was dramatically changed. These results indicate that these IT neurons selectively responded to gloss, not to the irrelevant local image features or average luminance or color. Next, to understand how the responses of gloss selective neurons are related to perceived gloss, responses of gloss selective neurons were mapped in perceptual gloss space in which glossiness changes uniformly. I found that responses of most gloss selective neurons can be explained by linear combinations of two parameters that are shown to be important for gloss perception. This result suggests that the responses of gloss selective neurons of IT cortex are closely related to gloss perception...|$|R

He is secure, and long may he be secure, in his advance, whether he performs any services or not. But let him take care how he endangers the safety of that Constitution which secures his own utility or his own insignificance, or how he discourages those who take up even puny arms to defend an order of things which, like the sun of heaven, shines alike on the useful and the worthless. His grants are ingrafted on the public law of Europe, covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages. They are guarded by the sacred rules of prescription, found in that full treasury of jurisprudence from which the jejuneness and penury of our municipal law has by degrees been enriched and strengthened. This prescription I had my share (a very full share) in bringing to its perfection.[19] The Duke of Bedford will stand as long as prescriptive law endures,--as long as the great, stable laws of property, common to us with all civilized nations, are kept in their integrity, and without the smallest intermixture of the laws, maxims, principles, or precedents of the Grand Revolution. They are secure against all changes but one. The whole Revolutionary system, institutes, digest, <b>code,</b> novels, text, <b>gloss,</b> comment, are not only not the same, but they are the very reverse, and the reverse fundamentally, of all the laws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments of the world. The learned professors of the Rights of Man regard prescription not as a title to bar all claim set up against old possession, but they look on prescription as itself a bar against the possessor and proprietor. They hold an immemorial possession to be no more than a long continued and therefore an aggravated injustice.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaking EFL/ESL {{students}} {{aware of}} {{effective and efficient}} reading strategies that assist in the reading of English texts has been the concern of educators and researchers, and specifically reading instructors for years. Dissatisfaction with the current methods of teaching English and awareness of {{the positive effect of}} strategy training has led teachers in Iran to adopt holistic approaches to text processing. Of equal concern is to make students metacognitively aware of strategies and techniques that promote reading comprehension in terms of the macro level characteristics of the text. Text structure knowledge has been recognized as an efficient strategy that enhances reading comprehension. To this end, 85 Iranian EFL learners were provided with instruction on discourse structuring signals (transitional words, frame markers, endophoric markers, <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> and punctuation marks) during one semester. The results demonstrated that metacognitive awareness of text structure and overt teaching of textual features facilitate students’ reading comprehension...|$|E

The aims of the study is to examine the frequency and distribution of metadiscourse used by the particular students in argumentative writing as well as to analyze the errors that made by the particular students in using metadiscourse. The finding shows that Malaysian college students are more inclined to using textual metadiscourse instead of interpersonal metadiscourse. Besides, the selected students are using less <b>code</b> <b>glosses</b> and stance indicator in their argumentative writing. In addition, Malaysian college students committed quite a number of errors in using metadiscourse and practices are needed to train them in using metadiscourse correctly. These findings are useful for Malaysian tertiary level of educators or teachers as they help the educators to figure out the weaknesses of students in using metadiscourse. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has now established that written texts embody interactions between writers and readers, but {{few studies have examined}} the ways that small acts of reformulation and exemplification help contribute to this. Abstraction, theorisation and interpretation need to be woven into a text which makes sense to a particular community of readers, and this invariably involves frequent reworkings and exemplifications as writers assess the processing needs, knowledge and rhetorical expectations of their readers to present and then interpret ideas as they write. Known as <b>code</b> <b>glosses</b> in the metadiscourse literature, these elaborations help to contribute to the creation of coherent, reader-friendly prose while conveying the writer’s audiencesensitivity and relationship to the message. Drawing on a large corpus of research articles, I explore how professional academic writers monitor their texts for readers in this way to restate information or provide examples as they construct their arguments. Analysis of the corpus reveals that elaboration is a complex and important rhetorical function in academic writing, and tha...|$|E

To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and <b>code</b> <b>glosses),</b> and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} rhetorical moves, metadiscourse types and resources used {{to accompany the}} moves in English abstract section of undergraduate students’ (thesis) article at STKIP PGRI Jombang. Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and <b>code</b> <b>glosses.</b> In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} multimodal discourse of academic posters from three disciplines, namely, Chemistry, Speech & Hearing Sciences and Linguistics, {{in an attempt}} to unravel how writers from different disciplinary communities build their communicative purposes into the verbal and visual modes in their posters. The analytical framework adopted for this study builds upon the one proposed by D’Angelo(2010), which incorporates Hyland’s metadiscourse model (2005) and Kress and van Leeuwen’s visual grammar paradigm (2006) for the verbal and visual analyses respectively, and supplements it with multimodal content analysis adapted from Jones’s (2007) model. Follow-up interviews with members of the discourse communities were also conducted to enhance the validity of the results. The findings reveal that there exist a wide range of differences in the use of metadiscourse markers (e. g. hedges, boosters, evidentials, <b>code</b> <b>glosses)</b> across the three group texts pertaining to disciplinary influences. There is also evidence that academics in different subjects value some of the same qualities in the texts necessitated either by the peculiar context of poster presentations (e. g. frame markers, engagement markers) or a need to maintain scientific formality (e. g. self-mentions). Visually, the concern for the context and ‘scientificness’ continue to exert great influences, rendering a myriad of visual manifestations (e. g. framing, modality) that are commonly shared across the data, whereas the cross-discipline discrepancy mainly narrows down to the image usage(functions and types). published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and <b>code</b> <b>glosses)</b> and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers and self-mentions). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Interpersonal Metadiscourse Markers used in Michelle Obama Speech. It has two objectives. First, it is aimed at finding out the types of {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers in each sentences used in Michelle Obama Speech. Second, it is aimed to explain the functions of them. This research uses qualitative research, because the research does not give the numeral or statictics, but just depends on {{the knowledge of the}} researcher in analyzing the data. The data of this study were analyzed by using some steps; first, reading the speech transcript; second, identifying and classifying the interpersonal metadiscourse markers, then, describing the function of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, and the last steps is interpreting the data and drawing conclusion. The result showed that there are two categories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers used in Michelle Obama Speech; those are interactive and interactional metadiscourse. There are 165 (44, 2 %) interactive metadiscourse and 209 (55, 8 %) interactional metadiscourse. Kinds of interactive metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) <b>code</b> <b>glosses</b> and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of interactional metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant interactional metadiscourse, because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) engagement marker...|$|E
40|$|While the {{knowledge}} contained in US patents descriptions {{is essentially the}} same as that conveyed by textbooks and journal articles (Myers 1995, Owen-Smith 2003), it must be shaped to claim temporary exclusive property over an invention. To effectively safeguard the value of such property, patents must reveal enough to suggest technical feasibility but conceal detail to cloud the specifications making replication easy. Usually co-authored by inventors and lawyers, the genre is therefore expected to hold a subtle interplay between boosting and hedging and gather traits from interdisciplinary discourses (Hyland 2000), in this case technical and legal. The aim of this study in progress is twofold: 1) to identify the linguistic act patterns used to match the requirements of legal patentability and the commercial interests of inventors, and 2) to bridge a gap in the know-how of readers and technical students by determining the discursive moves and interdisciplinary traits of the genre, comparing them with more familiar instances like manuals or specialized publications. To achieve this purpose, a corpus of 343 US electro-mechanical patents has been analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively with concordancing software at a macro (rhetorical) and microlevel (linguistic realizations). At this first stage of the research, the prime focus has been set on the most common boosting and hedging devices which stylistically feature the genre and may constitute a lexical and discursive technolectal repertoire useful for both professionals and engineering students. Among the devices detected, some (e. g. signaling nouns and verbs, repetition, evaluative adjectives and adverbs, inferential markers as <b>code</b> <b>glosses)</b> are signs of a pragmatic deference towards the non-expert members of the discursive community (i. e. lawyers and potential investors) and prove to be efficient means to overcome knowledge asymmetries...|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} how {{differences}} {{of language and}} genre affect {{the pattern of the}} usage of metadiscourse (MD: the rhetorical resources used to organise a discourse, or the writer's point of view towards either its content or the reader) in the academic writings produced by expert and student writers in the same discipline. The corpora consist of thirty journal articles (PRO) and fifty-five student assignments, twenty-five from native English speakers (NES) and another thirty from non-native English speakers (NNES). All texts in both the PRO and student corpora are in English, produced by a single-author, in topics of study in language, culture, and communications in the same school of Newcastle University. The research uses a typology derived from those in the literature but focussing on written texts and modified by a pilot study. From the comparison of texts produced by the NES and NNES postgraduate students, the language variable (native English vs non-native English) plays a greater role in the use of MD. The NNES writers use statistically more textual metadiscourse (TMD) while the NES writers employ more interpersonal metadiscourse (IMD) in general and there are statistical differences in the use of sequencers, <b>code</b> <b>glosses</b> which were more used by the NNES, hedges and self references which were more employed by the NES in particular. The finding indicates that the NNES writers are more concerned about expressions to show the logical order and relations between different parts of the text through TMD; the NES writers try more to involve the readers in the argument than do their NNES counterparts with IMD. The findings also show that learning a writing style which is acceptable in western academic life (e. g. 'writer-responsible') influences the use of MID in the NNES academic writing. Evidence of this comes from the interview data and the results of text analyses which show the statistically greater use of textual metadiscourse (e. g. sequencers, <b>code</b> <b>glosses)</b> and the significantly infrequent use of self-references in the NNES texts. From the results in the genre/expertnessv ariable Oournal articles vs student assignments), no overall significant differences were found {{in the use of the}} main V categories (TMD and IMD), but differential purposes (effects) and frequency were found in the use of MD subcategoriesT. he student writers do not use MD devicesi n the same way as the PRO writers, as reflected in the use of MD devices with a limited range of items and purposes in the student texts compared to a broad range of MD features and functions in the PRO texts. In fact, the PRO writers made more use of concessives, concluders, sources, hedges and self references with a broad range of purposes;t he student writers made significantly more use of sequencerst,o picalisers and more use of emphatics with limited purposes. Thus the finding proposes that the way they use MD is influenced by the two factors in the student and PRO texts; the consideration about the readership and the goal of the argument; which lead the different pattern of MID usage in the student and expert writings. This suggests that the genre variable (student assignments vs journal articles) is also a crucial one to influence the use of MID within the same discipline. As regards the language aspect from the comparison between the NES and NNES, the differences are mainly in the amount of features in the use of MD. When it comes to the student and j ournal article texts, genre variable, the differences are not only in the frequency of MD subcategories but also in the way they use the MD features.

This {{study was}} {{primarily}} intended to explore metatextual devices in EFL learners undergraduate thesis. The analysis was centered around metadiscourse taxonomy by Hyland (2005), cooperative principle (Maxim) by Grice, and cooperative principle based model of metadiscourse (metatext) devices by Abdi R (2010). This study explored kinds of metatextual devices in EFL learners‘ undergraduate thesis. The term metadiscourse (metatext) are {{the ways we}} articulate and construct interactions, stressing the fact that, as we speak or write, we negotiate with others, making decisions {{about the kind of}} effects we are having on our listeners or readers (Hyland, 2012 : 126). This study aims to (1) to find out metatextual devices commonly found in EFL learner‘s undergraduate thesis, (2) to find out how EFL learners‘ of IAIN Syekh Nurjati use common metatextual device in the thesis. There relate to the two research question of this study. The research is designed as qualitative research. The data is taken from undergraduate thesis belonging alumni of English language department in 2015. The technique of collecting data is documentation. Then, analyzed with content analysis based on Hyland‘s model investigate the devices that commonly used and how the used of common metatextual devices in the text. The data taken from the clever students, because product from the clever students is reliable and the data more valid. The thesis that analyzed by researcher are one sampling from alumni in 2015. That is not all part of thesis which analyzed, it just introduction chapter because this part of thesis have a key knowledge or information {{about what is going on}} in the next chapter related to the purposes of the study. The result shows that all of devices found in undergraduate thesis including transitions, frame markers, <b>code</b> <b>glosses,</b> evidential markers, engagement markers, self mention, endophoric markers, hedges, booster, and attitude markers, from all of those devices the metatextual devices commonly found in Dinto‘s undergraduate thesis is frame markers.
