500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... I was living in Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E
2500|$|The flapper {{stands as}} one of the most {{enduring}} images of youth and new women in the twentieth century, and is viewed by Americans as something of a cultural heroine nowadays. However, back in the 1920s, many Americans regarded flappers as threatening to conventional society, representing a new moral order. Although most of them were the daughters of the middle class, they flouted middle-class values. They shrugged off their chaperones, danced suggestively, and openly flirted with boys. [...] "Flappers prized style over substance, novelty over tradition, and pleasure over virtue." [...] Ruth Gillettes, a 1920s singer, had a song called [...] "Oh Say! <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> You Tonight?" [...] which expresses the new behavior of girls in the 1920s. Before the 1920s, for a woman to call a man to suggest a date would be impossible. But in the 1920s, many girls seemed to play a leading role in relationships, actively asking boys out or even coming to their homes.|$|E
