5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity,</b> subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest is suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected <b>chest</b> <b>cavities</b> ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The rigid shell {{means that}} turtles cannot breathe as other {{reptiles}} do, {{by changing the}} volume of their <b>chest</b> <b>cavities</b> via expansion and contraction of the ribs. Instead, they breathe in two ways. First, they employ limb pumping, sucking air into their lungs and pushing it out by moving the limbs in and out relative to the shell. Secondly, when the abdominal muscles that cover the posterior opening of the shell contract, the pressure inside the shell and lungs decreases, drawing air into the lungs, allowing these muscles to function {{in much the same}} way as the mammalian diaphragm. A second set of abdominal muscles face the opposite way and when they contract they expel air under positive pressure.|$|R
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its <b>chest</b> <b>cavity.</b> Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her <b>chest</b> <b>cavity,</b> severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity,</b> and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comA case of spontaneous gastric perforation is reported in a 75 -year-old woman due to massive hemorrhaging from a benign gastric ulcer. Blood was prevented from leaving the stomach due to posterior displacement and rotation of the stomach associated with marked underlying vertebral column kyphoscoliosis. Significant deformity of the spine had caused malpositioning of the stomach {{as a result of the}} abnormal shape of the peritoneal and <b>chest</b> <b>cavities.</b> This in turn had led to mechanical obstruction and prevented egress of blood arising from a bleeding arteriole in the base of a chronic gastric ulcer.

5000|$|Joe Leydon of Variety said, [...] "director and co-editor Lussier (a {{frequent}} Wes Craven collaborator) {{plays the}} 3-D gimmick for all it's worth: Everything from tree branches and gun barrels to bloody pickaxes and bloodier body parts appears {{to jump off}} the screen. He also makes effective use of the depth-of-field illusion, allowing audiences long views of various <b>chest</b> <b>cavities</b> from which hearts have been rudely ripped. At the very least, the overall tech package {{is a great deal}} more impactful than that of the 3-D-lensed Friday the 13th Part III (1982)". He added, in spite of the [...] "state-of-the-art 3-D camera trickery, which helmer Patrick Lussier shamelessly exploits to goose the audience with cheap thrills and full-bore gore, My Bloody Valentine is at heart an unabashedly retro work, reveling in the cliches and conventions of the slasher horror pics that proliferated in the early 1980s".|$|R
5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its <b>chest</b> <b>cavity.</b> Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} episodes, the robot team were a duo {{consisting}} of a 50 ft gold robot aptly named Goldar and his companion, a silver-clad humanoid female named Silvar. It was implied {{that they had been}} created by the wizard Methusan. Early in the series, the wizard Methusan completed the team to mirror the Mura family by creating a humanoid rocket-boy named Gam, in the image of Mikko Mura, complete with his trademark red-and-white sweater vest. All members of the robot team were capable of transforming into rockets identified respectively by gold, silver, and red-and-white color schemes. Each had bulb-tipped antennae protruding from their heads, capable of discharging directed blasts of gamma rays. Goldar and Silvar were capable of firing missiles from their <b>chest</b> <b>cavities,</b> but Silvar was only shown doing this once. A regularly featured plot device was Mikko's ability to summon the robots by blowing a special high-frequency whistle: once to summon Gam, twice to summon Silvar and three times to summon Goldar.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an inactivated aqueous vaccine against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was evaluated at two M hyopneumoniae-infected farrow-to-finish commercial farms (A and B) in Greece. In a prospective, randomised double-blind study, two groups on each farm received intramuscular doses {{of either the}} vaccine or the adjuvant when they were one and four weeks of age. The pigs were observed daily for clinical signs of disease; morbidity and mortality were recorded; and bodyweight was recorded at intervals. At slaughter, the lungs of the animals were examined and the <b>chest</b> <b>cavities</b> were examined for signs of pleuritis. No adverse reactions to the treatments were observed {{in any of the}} pigs. On farm A the vaccinated pigs were on average 6 kg heavier at slaughter, and on farm B they were on average 4 kg heavier; on both farms the average daily gain of the pigs was greater than that of the unvaccinated pigs. The prevalence and severity of enzootic pneumonia in the affected lungs were significantly lower in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated pigs...|$|R

5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his <b>chest</b> <b>cavity),</b> {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
40|$|Background. Lung {{transplantation}} is {{the procedure}} {{of choice in}} several end-stage lung diseases. Despite improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppression, early postoperative complications occur frequently. Objective. To evaluate the pleural inflammatory response after surgery. Patients and Methods. Twenty patients aged 18 to 63 years underwent unilateral or bilateral lung transplantation between August 2006 and March 2008. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor in pleural fluid and serum were analyzed. For cytokine evaluation, 20 -mL samples of pleural fluid and blood (right, left, or both <b>chest</b> <b>cavities)</b> were obtained at 6 hours after surgery and daily until removal of the chest tube or for a maximum of 10 days. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by the Holm-Sidak test. Results. All effusions were exudates according to Light`s criteria. Pleural fluid cytokine concentrations were highest at 6 hours after surgery. Serum concentrations were lower than those in pleural fluid, and IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8 were undetectable at all time points. Conclusions. There is a peak concentration of inflammatory cytokines in the first 6 hours after transplantation, probably reflecting the effects of surgical manipulation. The decrease observed from postoperative day 1 and thereafter suggests {{the action of the}} immunosuppression agents and a temporal reduction in pleural inflammation...|$|R

50|$|The <b>chest</b> (thoracic <b>cavity)</b> {{progressively}} slopes outwards {{from the}} thoracic inlet (atop the breastbone) and above {{to the lowest}} ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. In the course of thelarche, some girls develop breasts the lower skin-envelope of which touches the chest below the IMF, and some girls do not; both breast anatomies are statistically normal morphologic variations of {{the size and shape}} of women's breasts.|$|R
25|$|Humans, {{like most}} mammals, breathe by {{negative}} pressure breathing: the rib cage expands and the diaphragm contracts, expanding the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity.</b> This causes {{the pressure in}} the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> to decrease, and the lungs expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes {{the pressure of the}} air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows into the lungs from the atmosphere: inhalation. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person exhales. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans {{conducted in}} 2000 of the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> of a specimen of the ornithopod Thescelosaurus found the apparent remnants of complex four-chambered hearts, {{much like those}} found in today's mammals and birds.

25|$|Blood-shift: Blood {{flow and}} volume is redistributed towards vital organs {{by means of}} a reflex vasoconstriction.

50|$|Some {{uncommon}} {{health issues}} {{that can also}} {{have an effect on}} English Cocker Spaniels include canine hip dysplasia, patellar lunation, canine dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart murmurs. Hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip joint which is {{the most common cause of}} canine arthritis in the hips. Patellar Lunation, also known as luxating patella, refers to the dislocation of the kneecap. Canine dilated cardiomyopathy is an adult onset condition which occurs when the heart muscle is weak and does not contract properly. It can lead to congestive heart failure, which is where fluid accumulates in the lungs, <b>chest,</b> abdominal <b>cavities,</b> or under the skin. Dilated cardiomyopathy is often accompanied by abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias which can complicate treatment.|$|R
25|$|This {{procedure}} is indicated when unexplained fluid accumulates in the <b>chest</b> <b>cavity</b> outside the lung.
