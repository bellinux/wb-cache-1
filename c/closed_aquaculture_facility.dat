50|$|P. miliaris {{occurs in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Scandinavia south to Morocco, {{but not in the}} Mediterranean Sea. It is {{particularly}} common in the North Sea. It is mostly a littoral species but can be found from low tide mark down to a depth of one hundred metres. It is often found on or under Saccharina latissima, a large brown seaweed with which it shares its range. It occurs in a range of other habitats including under boulders and rocks, among seaweed, on rough ground such as oyster banks, in burrows in gravelly sediments and on the rhizomes of Zostera marina in seagrass meadows. The larvae often settle onto man-made structures such as ropes <b>close</b> to <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|R
30|$|In most cases, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to derive conclusions on the origin of microplastics when evaluating and characterising their occurrence in an environmental compartment. So far, the contribution of specific sources has only been identified for microplastics with a typical and distinct size and shape. Examples include pre-production plastic resin pellets, especially if released by localised spills [60, 63, 99, 100], and styrofoam particles found <b>close</b> to intensive <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities,</b> where styrofoam buoys and floats are used [8, 101, 102].

Experiments were conducted to investigate the biogeochemical impact of a commercial oyster <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facility</b> on downstream waters at a facility on Maryland's Eastern Shore. An algal production system (ATS) was installed at the facility to assess the potential for bioremediation and algal production in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system (IMTA). Results of the experiments showed an increase in available ammonia downstream of the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facility,</b> coupled with decreases in dissolved oxygen and total phytoplankton. The algal production system demonstrated an average productivity rate of 82. 8 g/m 2 *day- 1, a nitrogen (N) removal rate of 9. 6 gN/m 2 *day- 1, a phosphorus (P) removal rate of 0. 20 gP/m 2 *day- 1, and harvests consisted of an average of 7. 8 % organic content.

30|$|Products of {{the fishery}} {{industry}} crucially contribute to world’s nutrition. Since the 1990 s the amount of captured fish has been stagnating while the amount of fish produced in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> has been increasing until today (FAO 2012). However, diseases (Meyer 1991) as well as environmental factors like changing seasonal temperatures and concomitant changes in relevant water parameters like oxygen level or pathogen concentration may adversely affect health or even lead {{to the death of}} the cultured fish. Such incidents pose a major risk for fish farms and can lead to big economic losses. Therefore, the selection and farming of as robust animals as possible that are adapted to local environments can contribute to sustainable regional aquaculture and ensure a balanced economic efficiency of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{optimised}} {{reduction of}} dissolved nutrient loads in aquaculture effluents through bioremediation requires selection of appropriate algal species and strains. The {{objective of the}} current study was to identify target species and strains from the macroalgal genus Ulva for bioremediation of land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Eastern Australia. We surveyed land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> and natural coastal environments across three geographic locations in Eastern Australia to determine which species of Ulva occur naturally in this region and conducted growth trials at three temperature treatments on a subset of samples from each location to determine whether local strains had superior performance under local environmental conditions. DNA barcoding using the markers ITS and tufA identified six species of Ulva, with U. ohnoi being the most common blade species and U. sp. 3 the most common filamentous species. Both species occurred at multiple land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Townsville and Brisbane and multiple strains of each species grew well in culture. Specific growth rates of U. ohnoi and U. sp. 3 were high (over 9 % and 15 % day- 1 respectively) across temperature treatments. Within species, strains of U. ohnoi had higher growth in temperatures corresponding to local conditions, suggesting that strains may be locally adapted. However, across all temperature treatments Townsville strains had the highest growth rates (11. 2 - 20. 4 % day- 1) and Sydney strains had the lowest growth rates (2. 5 - 8. 3 % day- 1). We also found significant differences in growth between strains of U. ohnoi collected from the same geographic location, highlighting the potential to isolate and cultivate fast growing strains. In contrast, there was no clearly identifiable competitive strain of filamentous Ulva, with multiple species and strains having variable performance. The fast growth rates and broad geographical distribution of U. ohnoi make this an ideal species to target for bioremediation activities at land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Eastern Australia. © 2013 Lawton et al...|$|R

40|$|Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) winter {{throughout}} the country of Colombia. Recoveries of banded Ospreys indicate that many are shot {{in the country with}} the number increasing since the 1970 s. The increased incidence of shooting has coincided with the development of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Colom- bia that raise tilapia (Oreochromis spp.). Because these facilities typically lose production to birds such as Ospreys that depredate fish, we conducted a survey of 83 facilities in three states or departments in Colombia in 2001 to determine the species of birds that take fish at <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> and the numbers that are killed each year. Our results showed that bird depredation occurs at <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> {{throughout the}} country, but mostly in the southern portion of the country in the department of Huila. Facility managers reported shooting Ospreys in all three departments with as few as five individuals shot annually in Antioquia in northern Colombia to as many as 270 shot annually in Huila. In addition, facility managers reported shooting nine other species of birds including Green Kingfishers (Chloroceryle americana), Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Great Egrets (Casmerodius allms), Olivaceous Cormorants (Phalacrocorax olivaceus), Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nyc- ticorax nycticorax), White-necked Herons (Ardea cocoi), Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis), and Striated Herons (Butorides striatus), for a total estimate of 3 ̆e 9000 birds shot in the three departments annually. A number of alternative methods to shooting had been used to reduce losses to birds including the installation of netting, overhead wires, scarecrows, and noise making devices, but, neither these methods nor shooting, were effective in deterring avian predators...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A {{simulation}} and decision-support {{software product}} for <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facility</b> design and management planning is described (AquaFarm, Oregon State University©), including comprehensive documentation and applications to practical problems. AquaFarm provides (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes, (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management, (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets, and (4) a {{graphical user interface}} and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system, for the analysis and development of facility design specifications and management strategies. Intended user groups include aquaculture research, engineering, education, and production. As guided by the user, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> can be of any type, configuration, and management objectives, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. User-accessible specifications include (1) site climate and water supplies, (2) components and configurations offish culture systems, (3) fish and facility management strategies, (4) unit costs for budget items, (5) production objectives (species, time schedules, and fish numbers and weights), and (6) parameters of unit-process and fish performance models. Based on these specifications, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> are simulated, resource requirements are compiled, and operation schedules are determined so that production objectives are achieved. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, resource and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables. If unsatisfactory resource requirements or unattainable production objectives are found, procedures of iterative design and management refinement are supported. To provide this analytical capacity, {{a wide range of}} existing and newly developed, quantitative methods and models are assembled and synthesized into an integrated analytical framework, including aquatic chemistry, aquatic biology, fish biology, aquacultural engineering, and simulation techniques.

50|$|Hatcheries produce larval and {{juvenile}} {{fish and shellfish}} for transferral to <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> where they are ‘on-grown’ to reach harvest size. Hatchery production confers three main benefits to the industry;1. Out of season productionConsistent supply of fish from <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> is an important market requirement. Broodstock conditioning can extend the natural spawning season and thus the supply of juveniles to farms. Supply can be further guaranteed by sourcing from hatcheries in the opposite hemisphere i.e. with opposite seasons.2. Genetic improvementGenetic modification is conducted in some hatcheries {{to improve the quality}} and yield of farmed species. Artificial fertilisation facilitates selective breeding programs which aim to improve production characteristics such as growth rate, disease resistance, survival, colour, increased fecundity and/or lower age of maturation. Genetic improvement can be mediated by selective breeding, via hybridization, or other genetic manipulation techniques.3. Reduce dependence on wild-caught juvenilesIn 2008 aquaculture accounted for 46% of total food fish supply, around 115 million tonnes. Although wild caught juveniles are still utilised in the industry, concerns over sustainability of extracting juveniles, and the variable timing and magnitude of natural spawning events, make hatchery production an attractive alternative to support the growing demands of aquaculture.|$|R
