6000|$|In {{respect of}} the light {{companionship}} of common usage, however, it is exactly the costume which comes closest to us, and bad taste in that is most jarring and least easily forgiven. There is a certain stage in an observant person's experience of the heedlessness, indolence, and native folly of men and women--and if his observation be conducted in a catholic spirit, he will probably see something of this not merely in others--when the tolerable average sanity of human arrangements strikes him as the most marvellous of all the fortunate accidents in the universe. Rousseau could not even accept the fact of this miraculous result, the provisional and temporary sanity of things, and he confronted society with eyes of angry chagrin. A great lady asked him how {{it was that she}} had not seen him for an age. [...] "Because when I wish to see you, I wish to see no one but you. What {{do you want me to}} do in the midst of your society? I should cut a sorry figure in a <b>circle</b> of mincing <b>tripping</b> coxcombs; they do not suit me." [...] We cannot wonder that on some occasion when her son's proficiency was to be tested before a company of friends, Madame d'Epinay prayed Rousseau to be of them, on the ground that he would be sure to ask the child outrageously absurd questions, which would give gaiety to the affair.[219] As it happened, the father was unwise. He was a man of whom it was said that he had devoured two million francs, without either saying or doing a single good thing. He rewarded the child's performance with the gift of a superb suit of cherry-coloured velvet, extravagantly trimmed with costly lace; the peasant from whose sweat and travail the money had been wrung, went in heavy rags, and his children lived as the beasts of the field. The poor youth was ill dealt with. [...] "That is very fine," [...] said rude Duclos, [...] "but remember that a fool in lace is still a fool." [...] Rousseau, in reply to the child's importunity, was still blunter: [...] "Sir, I am no judge of finery, I am only a judge of man; I wished to talk with you a little while ago, but I wish so no longer."[220] ...|$|R
