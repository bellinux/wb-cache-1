5000|$|Around 1800 in France {{terminal}} <b>crooks</b> were invented, {{which proved}} to be extremely popular. These instruments used a separate <b>crook</b> for each key, and the <b>crooks</b> maintained a fairly uniform distance between the mouthpiece and {{the body of the}} instrument. Horn players typically needed at least eight <b>crooks,</b> for B-alto, A, G, F, E, E, D, and C. After about 1828, an additional <b>crook</b> in A-alto was also included. Although <b>crooks</b> for low B and B were also occasionally made, these keys were usually reached by adding couplers to the C <b>crook.</b> Horns constructed with the large number of <b>crooks</b> needed for playing in an orchestra are sometimes referred to as orchestral horns ("Orchesterhorn" [...] in German). The main disadvantage of this system was that so many <b>crooks</b> needed to be transported. The large cases required for carrying them were often works of art themselves.|$|R

Homme and Grohl joined with Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones to form the supergroup Them <b>Crooked</b> Vultures in 2009. Johannes also performed with the group as a touring member.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with <b>crooked</b> legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>crook</b> on the sound {{produced}} by the bassoon has long been considered particularly significant. Bassoonists often claim that older Heckel <b>crooks</b> have superior playing characteristics and produce a more desirable tone than more modern <b>crooks.</b> In this paper, acoustic pulse reflectometry is used to investigate possible differences in internal bore profile between <b>crooks</b> manufactured {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century and those manufactured in the second half. It is shown that, although all the measured <b>crooks</b> have approximately the same initial and final radii, earlier <b>crooks</b> (manufactured by Heckel) typically have a wider bore in the midsection than <b>crooks</b> made more recently (both by Heckel and other manufacturers). In an attempt to understand how these differences in <b>crook</b> profile affect the bassoon's acoustical properties, impedance measurements for four bassoon/crook combinations are presented and discussed. To determine whether listeners can distinguish between sounds produced using different <b>crooks,</b> psychoacoustical tests have been performed. In the tests, listeners were asked to make judgments on the timbres of notes produced on a reference bassoon using a variety of <b>crooks.</b> Results from the tests are discussed with reference to the <b>crook</b> profile measurements. ...|$|R
50|$|In March 2012, it {{announced}} that <b>Crooks</b> would be joining Halifax Town on a one-month loan. While at Halifax Town, <b>Crooks</b> scored his first professional goal in a 4-0 win over Histon.

For the following season, 2012-13, <b>Crooks</b> was given number 36 shirt, however, he failed to make an appearance for the first-team. On 7 December 2012, <b>Crooks,</b> along with James Burke, joined Radcliffe Borough on loan until mid-January. <b>Crooks</b> made an impressive display at the club, including when he scored a brace against Clitheroe.

5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a <b>crooked</b> cable man to get an illegal cable hook-up for $50, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer.

Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of violations of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a <b>crooked</b> beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively <b>crooked</b> players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E

5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its <b>crooked</b> state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for about 18hours. On November21, a cold front {{moving through the}} Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast. The combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened Kate to an intensity of 100mph (160km/h) by the time the hurricane struck <b>Crooked</b> Island near Mexico Beach, Florida late on November21. After landfall, Kate continued to the northeast, crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm. Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November22. Encountering even colder waters and continued shear, the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast. On November23, Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda, terminating at 1800UTC that day.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} season, the Sounders folded and <b>Crook</b> moved to the Minnesota Strikers. When the NASL collapsed {{at the end of the}} season, the Strikers moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League. <b>Crook</b> spent the 1984-1985 MISL season with the Strikers before moving to the San Jose Earthquakes for the 1985 Western Alliance Challenge Series. [...] He then signed with the Tacoma Stars of MISL later that year. He would play the next seven seasons with the Stars. During those years, he did continued to play an occasional outdoor season, first with the Seattle Storm of the WSA in 1988, http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1988/statswsa88.htm then the Portland Timbers of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) in 1990.http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1990/statswsa90.htm [...] When the Stars folded following the 1991-1992 MISL season, <b>Crook</b> moved to the Portland Pride for the 1993 Continental Indoor Soccer League. In 1994, he returned to outdoor soccer when he signed with the reconstituted Seattle Sounders, now playing in the APSL. That season, he was a second team All Star. He spent three seasons with the Sounders as they won the 1995 and 1996 league championships. In May 1997, <b>Crook</b> returned to indoor soccer with the Seattle SeaDogs of the CISL. That year, the SeaDogs won the league title, then folded, along with the league. <b>Crook</b> moved to the Cleveland Crunch for the 1997-1998 National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) season. In 1998, several ex-CISL teams formed the Premier Soccer Alliance. <b>Crook</b> joined the Portland Pythons of the PSA for the 1998 season. In 1999, the PSA was replaced by the World Indoor Soccer League (WISL). <b>Crook</b> again spent the season with the Pythons, now playing in the WISL.

5|$|In 2002, new {{evidence}} concerning {{the murder of}} Luke Doggett came to light.

Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant (at which he nearly succeeded), the truth was as Reyes suspected: Follmer was <b>crooked.</b> Once the truth of Luke's fate was revealed, Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer's bribe acceptance. Follmer's future at the FBI was left unresolved, although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions.|$|E
