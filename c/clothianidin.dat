5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as <b>Clothianidin,</b> Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as <b>clothianidin</b> and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of <b>clothianidin</b> in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found <b>clothianidin</b> and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{professional}} beekeepers {{and environmentalists}} jointly {{filed a lawsuit}} against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asks for suspension of <b>clothianidin</b> and thiamethoxam. The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives. The EPA responded to the suit by issuing a report blaming the Varroa mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure {{to return to the}} hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides <b>clothianidin</b> and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
25|$|Many {{states which}} were afflicted with the BCTV soon began using {{insecticides}} {{to reduce the}} number of BCTV outbreaks. In 1943, California adopted the BCTV management program, which is still running today. This program focuses on the use of insecticides to reduce the amount of beet leafhoppers by spraying chemicals in non-crop areas where the beet leafhoppers reside. Killing the beet leafhoppers before they invade susceptible host crops leads to fewer crops being infected. Slowly, the use of insecticides was questioned due to its effects on the environment, non-target organisms, and endangered species. As the number of beet leafhoppers continued to rise, the EPA ordered the use of <b>clothianidin</b> to help control the insects in 2006, 2007 and 2008.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees are {{in danger}} in many {{developed}} countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (<b>clothianidin,</b> imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on B. terrestris showed that [...] "field-realistic" [...] levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a [...] "considerable negative effect" [...] on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.|$|E
500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with <b>clothianidin</b> and imidacloprid release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental {{results show that the}} environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E
500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question {{of what was going on}} when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, <b>clothianidin,</b> and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{hypotheses}} were wildly different, including environmental change-related stresses, malnutrition, pathogens (i.e., disease including Israel acute paralysis virus), mites, or {{the class of}} pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which include imidacloprid, <b>clothianidin,</b> and thiamethoxam. Unproven and less credible theories include radiation from cellular phones or other man-made devices, ...|$|E
2500|$|All infested trees {{should be}} removed by {{certified}} tree care personnel {{to ensure that the}} process is completed properly, and chipped in place, their stumps ground to below the soil level.Insecticides such as imidacloprid, <b>clothianidin,</b> dinotefuran have been used to target adult beetles in canopies or as trunk injections to target larvae. [...] Insecticides within the tree may not translocate evenly, which causes some A. glabripennis to survive treatments. Combined with efficacy concerns, high cost, and non-target effects on other insects, widespread prophylactic treatment of trees in an infestation area concern scientists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clothianidin</b> is {{moderately}} toxic in {{the short-term}} to mammals that eat it, and long-term ingestion may result in reproductive and/or developmental effects. Using laboratory test animals as surrogates for humans and dosages much higher than are expected from exposure related to actual use, rats showed low short-term oral, dermal, and inhalation toxicity to <b>clothianidin.</b> For mice, acute oral toxicity was moderate to high. Rabbits showed little to no skin or eye irritation when exposed to <b>clothianidin,</b> and the skin of guinea pigs was not sensitized by it. When extrapolated to humans, {{these results suggest that}} <b>clothianidin</b> is moderately toxic through oral exposure, but toxicity is low through skin contact or inhalation. While <b>clothianidin</b> may cause slight eye irritation, it is not expected to be a skin sensitizer or irritant. <b>Clothianidin</b> does not damage genetic material nor is there evidence that it causes cancer in rats or mice; it is unlikely to be a human carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Permissible {{amounts of}} <b>clothianidin</b> residue {{on food and}} animal feed vary from crop to crop and nation to nation. However, {{regulatory}} authorities around the globe emphasize that when used according to the label instructions, <b>clothianidin</b> residues on food {{are not expected to}} exceed safe levels (as defined by each nation's laws and regulations).|$|E
50|$|In the 2003 EPA {{report it}} was stated that {{although}} no water monitoring studies had been conducted, {{due to the}} extreme mobility and persistence of <b>clothianidin</b> in the environment, <b>clothianidin</b> has the properties of a chemical {{which could lead to}} widespread groundwater contamination should the registrant (e.g. Bayer or Takeda) request field uses involving direct application of <b>clothianidin</b> to the land surface. In a 2010 EPA report, it was noted that the registrant (e.g. Bayer or Takeda) had recently added new uses on the labels, including using the pesticide directly applied to the soil surface/foliage at much higher application rate than as specified in 2003. As a result, the potential for <b>clothianidin</b> to move from the treated area to the nearby surface water body under the new uses is much greater than with use as a seed treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority {{notes that}} <b>clothianidin</b> ranks [...] "among {{the most highly}} acutely toxic {{insecticides}} to bees" [...] through contact and oral exposure. Since <b>clothianidin</b> is a systemic pesticide that is {{taken up by the}} plant, there is also potential for toxic chronic exposure resulting in long-term effects to bees and other pollinators from <b>clothianidin</b> residue in pollen and nectar. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in addition to potential effects on worker bees, there are also concerns about lethal and/or sub-lethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects in the queen from chronic exposure. However, in a 2012 statement the EPA reported that they are not aware of any data demonstrating that bee colonies are subject to elevated losses due to long-term exposure when <b>clothianidin</b> products are used at authorized rates.|$|E
50|$|April 2013 the EU {{decided to}} {{restrict}} thiamethoxam and <b>clothianidin</b> along with imidacloprid.|$|E
5000|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} {{describe the}} toxicological database for <b>clothianidin</b> as [...] "extensive", and {{many studies have}} been reviewed to support registrations around the globe for this chemical. Laboratory and field testing revealed that <b>clothianidin</b> shows relatively low toxicity to many test species but is highly or very highly toxic to others. Toxicity varies {{depending on whether the}} exposure occurs on a short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) basis.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{and field}} testing shows that <b>clothianidin</b> is {{persistent}} and mobile in the environment, stable to hydrolysis, and has potential to leach to ground water and be transported via runoff to surface water bodies. Worst-case scenario estimates indicate that if applied at the maximum rate repeatedly over years, <b>clothianidin</b> {{has the potential}} to accumulate in the top 15 cm of soil. However, the Australian pesticide authority's review of rotational crop studies determined that <b>clothianidin</b> generally is not taken up by crops sown in fields where treated corn seeds were planted, even when the test corn seeds were coated with an intentionally large amount of the chemical (2 mg/seed vs the authorized maximum application rate of 1.25 mg).|$|E
50|$|Pesticides {{used for}} {{whitefly}} control usually contain neonicotinoid compounds as active ingredients: <b>clothianidin</b> (commercial), dinotefuran (over-the-counter and commercial), imidacloprid (over-the-counter and commercial) and thiamethoxam (commercial). Neonicotinoids can be harmful if ingested. Rotation of insecticides from different families may be effective at preventing {{the building of}} tolerance to the product. <b>Clothianidin</b> and dinotefuran are of the same family. Spraying the leaves using insecticidal soap is another, environmentally friendly, option.|$|E
5000|$|In March, 2012, {{commercial}} beekeepers {{and environmental}} organizations filed an emergency legal petition with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend use of <b>clothianidin,</b> urging {{the agency to}} adopt safeguards. The legal petition is supported by over one million citizen petition signatures, targets the pesticide for its harmful impacts on honey bees. The petition points {{to the fact that}} the EPA failed to follow its own regulations. EPA granted a conditional, or temporary, registration of <b>clothianidin</b> in 2003 without a field study establishing that the pesticide would have no [...] "unreasonable adverse effects" [...] on pollinators. The conditional registration was contingent upon the submission of an acceptable field study, but this requirement has not been met. EPA continues to allow the use of <b>clothianidin</b> nine years after acknowledging that it had an insufficient legal basis for initially allowing its use. Additionally, the product labels on pesticides containing <b>clothianidin</b> are inadequate to prevent excessive damage to non-target organisms, which is a violation of the requirements for using a pesticide and further warrants removing all such mislabeled pesticides from use.|$|E
50|$|Nitroguanidine {{derivatives}} {{are used}} as insecticides, having a comparable effect to nicotine. Derivatives include <b>clothianidin,</b> dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety {{decided to}} {{continue}} to suspend authorization for <b>clothianidin</b> use on corn. It {{had not yet been}} fully clarified to what extent and in what manner bees come into contact with the active substances in <b>clothianidin,</b> thiamethoxam and imidacloprid when used on corn. The question of whether liquid emitted by plants via guttation, which bees ingest, posed an additional risk was unanswered.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{arguing that}} {{after more than}} 9 years the EPA {{continues}} to maintain the registration status for <b>clothianidin</b> {{despite the fact that}} the registrant has failed to supply satisfactory studies confirming its safety, an alliance of beekeepers and environmental groups filed a petition on March 21 asking the EPA to block the use of <b>clothianidin</b> in agricultural fields until they have conducted a review of the product. The petitioners state that they are aware that the EPA has moved up its registration review of <b>clothianidin</b> and other neonicotinoids in response to concerns about their impacts on pollinators, however they note that this process is projected by the EPA to take six to eight years and is thus grossly insufficient to address the urgency of the threat to pollinators.|$|E
5000|$|Honey {{bees and}} other pollinators are {{particularly}} sensitive to <b>clothianidin,</b> {{as evidenced by}} the results of laboratory and field toxicity testing and demonstrated in acute poisoning incidents in France and Germany in 2008, and in Canada in 2010 and 2013 associated with the planting of corn seeds treated with <b>clothianidin.</b> To reduce the risk to pollinators from acute exposure to <b>clothianidin</b> sprays, label instructions prohibit the use of these products when crops or weeds are in bloom and pollinators are nearby, but in the U.S. label instructions do not require the use of a [...] "sticker", a sticking agent meant to reduce dust from treated seeds during planting. However, according to the EPA, the use of sticking agents to reduce dust from treated seeds is standard practice in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clothianidin</b> is an {{insecticide}} {{developed by}} Takeda Chemical Industries and Bayer AG. Similar to thiamethoxam and imidacloprid, it is a neonicotinoid. Neonicotinoids are {{a class of}} insecticides that are chemically similar to nicotine, which {{has been used as}} a pesticide since the late 1700s. <b>Clothianidin</b> and other neonicotinoids act on the central nervous system of insects as an agonist of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that stimulates nAChR, targeting the same receptor site (AChR) and activating post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors but not inhibiting AChE. <b>Clothianidin</b> and other neonicotinoids were developed to last longer than nicotine, which is more toxic and which breaks down too quickly in the environment. However, studies published in 2012 show that neonicotinoid dust released at planting time may persist in nearby fields for several years and be taken up into non-target plants, which are then foraged by bees and other insects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clothianidin</b> {{users are}} also {{required}} {{to monitor the}} weather and not use the chemical or seeds treated with it on windy days or when rain is forecast. Workers are protected from <b>clothianidin</b> exposure through requirements for personal protective equipment, such as long-sleeve shirts, gloves, long pants, boots, and face mask or respirators as appropriate. To reduce the possibility that birds and small mammals might eat treated seeds, users are required to ensure that soil covers planted seeds and that any spilled seed is picked up.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{investigation}} of the incident was complete, the BVL suspended the authorization of eight seed treatment products on corn and canola. Upon completion of its investigation, the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection “banned for a period of 6 months the planting of maize by means of negative pressure pneumatic machines for single grain delivery; this ban applies to maize seeds treated with <b>clothianidin</b> or with one of three further insecticides.” Germany reauthorized the use of <b>clothianidin</b> as a seed treatment on canola in June 2008 after the Julius Kühn Institute submitted its findings that equipment and sticker problems associated with corn seed treatments in Germany are not applicable to canola. Furthermore, the German authorities explicitly required the use of additional sticker to ensure the pesticides adhere to the seeds. In June 2008, BVL concluded that “the treatment of rapeseed with <b>clothianidin</b> containing plant protection products does not put bee colonies at risk” but offered additional recommendations to better control dust and discouraging planting on windy days or using pneumatic seeding equipment that discharges air upward. In 2009, BVL decided to continue to suspend authorization for the use of <b>clothianidin</b> on corn, citing unanswered questions that remained about potential exposure of bees and other pollinators to neonicotinoid pesticides.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid, <b>clothianidin,</b> imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, which are absorbed {{through the skin}} to some extent, fipronil is not absorbed substantially through the skin.|$|E
50|$|Once {{laboratory}} and field data identify hazards {{associated with a}} chemical, regulatory authorities take different approaches to mitigate those hazards and bring the risks down to acceptable levels, as defined by each nation's laws and regulations. For <b>clothianidin,</b> hazard mitigation includes establishing {{the maximum amount of}} the chemical that can be used (e.g. kg/acre or mg/seed), requiring buffer zones around treated fields to protect water supplies, and prohibiting the use of low-technology seed treatment methods or equipment that can send clouds of <b>clothianidin</b> dust or spray up into the air during seeding operations.|$|E
5000|$|According to the EPA, <b>clothianidin</b> is {{practically}} non-toxic to test bird species that were fed relatively large {{doses of the}} chemical on an acute basis. However, EPA assessments show that exposure to treated seeds through ingestion may result in chronic toxic risk to non-endangered and endangered small birds (e.g., songbirds). Bobwhite quail eggshell thickness was affected when the test birds were given a diet consisting of relatively large amounts of clothianidin-treated seeds. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Canada lists <b>clothianidin</b> as [...] "moderately toxic" [...] to birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clothianidin</b> is {{authorized}} for spray, dust, soil drench (for uptake via plant roots), injectable liquid (into tree limbs and trunks, sugar cane stalks etc.), and seed treatment uses, in which <b>clothianidin</b> coats seeds that {{take up the}} pesticide via the roots as the plant grows. The chemical {{may be used to}} protect plants against a wide variety of agricultural pests in many countries, of which the following are mentioned in citable English-language sources: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, UK, and the United States. Seed treatment uses of <b>clothianidin,</b> corn in particular, have been revoked or suspended in Germany, Italy and Slovenia. The suspensions are reflective of E.U. pesticide law and are generally associated with acute poisoning of bees from pesticide dust being blown off of treated seeds, especially corn, and onto nearby farms where bees were performing pollinator services.|$|E
5000|$|North American and European {{pesticide}} {{regulatory authorities}} have identified specific data gaps and uncertainties for which <b>clothianidin</b> manufacturers must provide data. Studies required of the manufacturers will further investigate clothianidin's: ...|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{testing at}} the Julius Kühn Institute {{demonstrated}} that 99% of the bees sampled {{tested positive for}} high levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide <b>clothianidin,</b> which is highly toxic to honey bees on an acute contact basis (i.e. direct contact with {{too much of the}} chemical can quickly kill bees). In providing background on the incident, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) noted that <b>clothianidin</b> had been authorized as a seed treatment on corn since 2004, and that “bee damage of this kind in conjunction with this product has not been observed in Germany” prior to the 2008 incident.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clothianidin</b> is an {{alternative}} to organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides. It poses lower risks to mammals, including humans, when compared to organophosphates and carbamates. It has helped prevent insect pests build up resistance to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Germany revoked the {{registration}} of <b>clothianidin</b> {{for use on}} seed corn after an incident {{that resulted in the}} death of millions of nearby honey bees. An investigation revealed that it was caused by a combination of factors: ...|$|E
50|$|Because it is systemic, {{persistent}} and highly toxic to honey bees, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Canada has requested additional data to fully assess the potential effects of chronic exposure of <b>clothianidin,</b> resulting from its potential movement into plant pollen and nectar.|$|E
50|$|Sublethal {{doses of}} {{thiamethoxam}} metabolite <b>clothianidin</b> (0.05-2 ng/bee) {{have been known}} to cause reduced foraging activity since at least 1999, but this was quantified in 2012 by RFID tagged honeybees. Doses of equal or more than 0.5 ng/bee caused longer foraging flights.|$|E
