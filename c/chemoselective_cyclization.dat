40|$|Short peptide {{sequences}} typically lack well-defined structure when {{removed from}} {{the context of a}} larger protein. In order to constrain peptides into well-defined structures, nature often relies on the formation of disulfides between cysteine residues. Chemists have leveraged alternative chemoselective reactions to constrain peptides into defined folded conformations. <b>Chemoselective</b> <b>cyclization</b> strategies typically require extensive synthetic manipulation or the use of conditions which are incompatible with biological systems. This work encompasses the development of alternative peptide cyclization strategies that can be utilized under conditions compatible with biological systems. The strategies we have focused on offer the possibility of implementing cross-linking in a dynamic and reversible manner in aqueous solutions. We have chosen {{to take advantage of the}} bioorthogonal and reversible nature of Schiff base formation in the development of bioorthogonal and dynamic side chain cross-linking. We have demonstrated that an oxime formed by a cyclization reaction between aminooxy- and aldehyde-functionalized side chains in peptide sequences proceeds rapidly and in high yield. These cross-links have been shown to affect peptide folding and are capable of dynamic covalent exchange. Oxime cross-links have been shown to stabilize a model protein-protein interaction, with a dependence upon the sequence context and structure of the cross-link formed. Analysis of a high-resolution structure of the cross-linked oligomer demonstrates that the oxime side chain cross-link is well accommodated into an α-helical fold. We have also demonstrated that the product distribution of a cross-linking reaction in which multiple cross-linked regioisomers can be generated is dependent upon the folded state of the peptide at the time of cross-link formation. An alternative strategy which employs the use of an intermolecular cyclization between a bifunctionalized peptide and dialdehyde functionalized small molecules has also been explored. The intermolecular cyclization strategy has been shown to affect peptide folded structure and be capable of dynamic covalent exchange. Intermolecular cyclization offers a generally applicable and convergent manner to synthesize multiple cross-linked species in a combinatorial manner. This strategy has then been employed to template formation of different cross-linked structures based on the presence of an expressed protein receptor. ...|$|E

Within these highly stereo- and <b>chemoselective</b> transformations, the <b>cyclization</b> mode, optionally yielding five- and six-membered rings, is efficiently {{controlled by the}} substitution pattern of the polyalkenes (acetate vs. a$-unsaturated ester and dicyano groups).

In particular, electrophilic cyclization {{has been used for}} the synthesis of a variety of heterocycles, including benzo[b]furans, isochromenes, dihydroisoquinolines, isobenzofurans and coumestans. An unusual palladium migration has also been explored and applied to the synthesis of fluoren- 9 -ones;Chapter 1 describes the synthesis of 2, 3 -disubstituted benzo[b]furans by the palladium-catalyzed coupling and electrophilic cyclization of terminal alkynes. A highly <b>chemoselective</b> electrophilic <b>cyclization</b> has been achieved by carefully choosing the protecting group on the oxygen functionality. Various electrophiles, such as I 2, Br 2, PhSeCl and p-O 2 NC 6 H 4 SCl, can be used to introduce different functionalities into the desired cyclization products;Chapter 2 presents the synthesis of heterocycles by electrophilic cyclization reactions of acetylenic aldehydes, ketones and imines. The overall synthetic process involves the coupling of a terminal acetylene with o-iodoarenecarboxaldehydes or ketones by a palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction, followed by electrophilic cyclization with various electrophiles in the presence of proper nucleophiles. Oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles can be quickly assembled by this three component process in good to excellent yields;Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of coumestan and coumestrol by selective electrophilic cyclization, followed by palladium-catalyzed intramolecular carbonylation and lactonization. The biologically interesting coumestan system can be quickly constructed by this very efficient approach from common starting materials. The palladium-catalyzed reaction effects as both carbonylation and lactonization in one step;Chapter 4 examines {{the scope and}} synthetic utility of a 1, 4 -Pd through space migration. The synthesis of various fluoren- 9 -ones has been accomplished by the Pd-catalyzed intramolecular C-H activation of imines derived from 2 -iodoaniline and biarylcarboxaldehydes. This methodology makes use of a novel 1, 4 -palladium migration from an aryl position to an imidoyl position to generate the key imidoyl palladium intermediate, which undergoes intramolecular arylation to produce imines of complex polycyclic compounds containing the fluoren- 9 -one core structure.
