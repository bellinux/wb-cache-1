50|$|Large {{transmitting}} tubes have carbonized tungsten filaments {{containing a}} small trace (1% to 2%) of thorium. An extremely thin (molecular) layer of thorium atoms forms {{on the outside}} of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms diffuse to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of tungsten carbide and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.WAAY-TV in Huntsville, Alabama achieved 163,000 hours of service from an Eimac external <b>cavity</b> <b>klystron</b> in the visual circuit of its transmitter; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube. It has been said that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approx. 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid state power amplifiers up to approx. 15 kW also show better overall mains-power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{klystron}} topology {{is proposed}} {{to overcome the}} frequency limits of conventional klystrons. In contrast to the conventional klystron approach, where {{the distance between the}} cavities placed along the drift tube {{is a function of the}} plasma frequency wavelength, the new configuration exploits the interaction property of a sequence of numerous cavities allocated at fixed short distance along the drift tube. The remarkable advantage is to obtain good performance by the use of cavities with low R/Q, as in the case of high frequency and high order mode operation. A frequency operation up to 136 GHz with 20 dB gain and an output power up to a few tens of watts are demonstrated.

25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two <b>cavity</b> oscillator <b>klystron</b> with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency.

40|$|The RF {{system for}} the SNS superconducting linac {{consists}} of a superconducting <b>cavity,</b> a <b>klystron,</b> and a low-level RF (LLRF) control system. For a proton linac like SNS, the field in each individual cavity needs to be controlled to meet the overall system requirements. The purpose of the LLRF control system is to maintain the RF cavity field to a desired magnitude and phase by controlling the klystron driver signal. The Lorentz force detuning causes the shift of the resonant frequency during the normal operation {{in the order of}} a few hundreds hertz. In order to compensate the Lorentz force detuning effects, the cavity is pre-tuned {{into the middle of the}} expected frequency shift caused by the Lorentz force detuning. Meanwhile, to reduce the overshoot in the transient response, a feed-forward algorithm, a linear parameter varying gain scheduling (LPV-GS) controller, is proposed to get away a repetitive noised caused by the pulsed operation as well as the Lorentz force detuning effects. ...|$|R
