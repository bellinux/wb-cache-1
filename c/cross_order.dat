40|$|Current {{methods of}} order tracking, such as {{synchronous}} resampling, Gabor filtering, and Vold-Kalman filtering have undesirable traits. Each method has {{two or more}} of the following deficiencies: requires measurement or estimate of rotational speed over time, failure to isolate the contribution of <b>crossing</b> <b>orders</b> in the vicinity of the crossing time, large computational expense, end effects. In this work a new approach to the order tracking problem is taken. The Second Order Blind Identification (SOBI) algorithm is applied to synthesized data. The technique is shown to be very successful at isolating <b>crossing</b> <b>orders</b> and circumvents all of the above deficiencies. The method has its own restric-tions: multiple sensors are required and sensors must be mounted on a structure that responds quasi-statically to exci-tation of the rotational system...|$|R
25|$|All honours in Canada {{emanate from}} the country's monarch, who is {{regarded}} as the fount of honour. A complex system of orders, decorations, and medals by which Canadians are honoured has evolved. The Victoria <b>Cross,</b> <b>Order</b> of Military Merit, Cross of Valour, Star of Courage, Medal of Bravery are some of the military awards that have been created for Canadians serving in a military capacity. The Victoria Cross has been presented to 94 Canadians and 2 Newfoundlanders between its creation in 1856 and 1993, when the Canadian Victoria Cross was instituted. However, no Canadian has received either honour since 1945.|$|E
