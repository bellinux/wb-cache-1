5000|$|Trunking {{is a more}} {{automated}} {{and complex}} radio system, but provides the benefits of less user intervention to operate the radio and greater spectral efficiency {{with large numbers of}} users. Instead of assigning, for example, a radio channel to one particular organization at a time, users are instead assigned to a logical grouping, a [...] "talkgroup". When any user in that group wishes to converse with another user in the talkgroup, a vacant radio channel is found automatically by the system and the conversation takes place on that channel. Many unrelated conversations can occur on a channel, making use of the otherwise idle time between conversations. Each radio transceiver contains a microcomputer to control it. A control channel coordinates all the activity of the radios in the system. The control channel <b>computer</b> <b>sends</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> data to enable one talkgroup to talk together, regardless of frequency.|$|R

3000|$|... [*]The {{elimination}} of the RTS/CTS scheme. Indeed, {{as there is no}} risk of contention, the RTS/CTS scheme is not needed any more. Thus, the time used to send RTS or CTS packet in the IEEE 802.11 model can be exploited to <b>send</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> data in our model.|$|R
3000|$|... [*]The {{elimination}} of the backoff procedure during the scheduling period. Indeed, because of the backoff algorithm in the IEEE 802.11 model, every node must wait a certain time, each time it wants to <b>send</b> a <b>packet</b> <b>of</b> data. The time that a node has to wait is chosen randomly in a contention window. The maximum contention window size is 1, 023 slots [34] and a slot time lasts usually 20 µs; thus, a node can {{have to wait till}} 2, 046 µs for <b>sending</b> a <b>packet</b> whereas <b>sending</b> a <b>packet</b> takes, in our example, 260 µs. Thus, eliminating the backoff procedure enables gaining a lot <b>of</b> time for <b>sending</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> data.|$|R

30|$|Then, in {{the time}} slot {{allocated}} to node S, if the traffic is unicast, the node S <b>sends</b> RTS <b>packet</b> directly, and if the traffic is multicast, the node S <b>sends</b> <b>packet</b> <b>of</b> multicast directly using full antennas. In the idle time slot unallocated to node S, the node S reserves channel to realize unicast or <b>sends</b> data <b>packet</b> <b>of</b> multicast using one antenna. According to types <b>of</b> receiving CTS <b>packet,</b> node S selects appropriate number of streams to <b>send</b> data <b>packets.</b> When a data <b>packet</b> <b>of</b> unicast is received successfully, node R replies ACK packet to node S for confirmation. Otherwise, a failed transmission occurs and node S needs to retransmit the data packet. ACK packet is unnecessary in multicast transaction. The operation process of node S and node R is shown in Algorithms 2 and 3, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|These critiques {{may have}} no {{practical}} effect. For example, consider a low bandwidth 9.6Kbit/second radio. If the protocol was configured to <b>send</b> one <b>packet</b> <b>of</b> 180 bytes every 5 seconds, it would consume 3% of overall network bandwidth.|$|R
30|$|In an {{interactive}} TCP session, the user will enter a command such a Linux command “ls” by typing {{a list of}} letters (for example, l, s, etc.) and then execute the command on the server machine. The result responses from the remote sever will be a number <b>of</b> <b>packets</b> containing the output generated by executing the command. In general, the user machine will receive an Echo packet as a response whenever the user enters one letter on his machine as a command or {{a part of a}} command. If the command is a single letter, the packet is called a single-letter send or a single-letter echo, respectively. To this end, we only consider the single-letter <b>send</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> the outgoing connection and the single-letter echo <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> the incoming connection. If the two connections of the sensor are a relayed stepping-stone pair, then the number <b>of</b> the <b>send</b> <b>packets</b> in the outgoing connection should be very close to the number <b>of</b> the echo <b>packets</b> in the incoming connection of the sensor.|$|R
40|$|Discovering {{anomalies}} is {{an important}} and challenging task for many settings, from network intrusion to fraud detection. However, most work to date has focused on clouds of multi-dimensional points, with little emphasis on graph data; even then, {{the focus is on}} un-weighted, node-labeled graphs. Here we propose OddBall, an algorithm to detect anomalous nodes in weighted graphs. The contributions are the following: (a) we carefully choose features, that easily reveal nodes with strange behavior; (b) we discover several new rules (power laws) in density, weights, ranks and eigenvalues that seem to govern the so-called “neighborhood graphs ” and we show how to use them for anomaly detection; (c) we empirically show that our method scales linearly with the number of edges in the graph, and (d) we report experiments on many real graphs with up to 1. 5 Given a real graph, with weighted edges, which nodes should we consider as “strange”? Applications of this setting abound: For example, in network intrusion detection, we have <b>computers</b> <b>sending</b> <b>packets</b> to each other, and we want to know which nodes misbehave (e. g., spammers, portscanners). In a who-calls-whom network [30], strange behavior may indicate defecting customers...|$|R

50|$|Details {{about their}} alien nature are rarely given and inconsistent, except to {{reinforce}} the idea that their former lives were almost barren of emotion, unlike most of the relationships humans have with each other. Their original forms, for example, are described as nonsexual, with reproduction a matter <b>of</b> <b>sending</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> genetic material {{to each other in}} the mail. Leaders like the Big Giant Head are unelected and assumed infallible (in fact, it is stated that politicians on their planet are chosen by seeing which one can outrun the giant fireball). The upshot is that living in an Earth culture provides the Solomons with an almost intolerable degree of emotional stimulation and conflict. Although they are ill-equipped to handle such an emotional maelstrom, they love it.|$|R

40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) {{have been}} a {{research}} interest {{over the past few}} years, yet, node cooperation has continually been a recognized issue for researchers. Because of their lack of infrastructure, MANETS depend on the cooperation of intermediate nodes in order to forward or <b>send</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> their own to other nodes in the network. Therefore, nodes located in the central area of the network are used more frequently than the nodes located on the outer boundary. The inner nodes have to forward the <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> other nodes and if there is no payoff for forwarding the packets, the nodes may start to refrain from forwarding the <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> others to save their energy. The Community Enforcement Mechanism has been proposed to force the cooperation of among the nodes and reduce their misbehavior. Although, it provides cooperation among the nodes, it does not essentially increase the network life.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{wormhole}} detection technique {{has been proposed}} which makes use of AODV as an on demand routing protocol and secure neighbor detection protocol with certain modifications. In the technique, sender floods the route request <b>packets</b> in search <b>of</b> destination and in return the receiver responds by sending the route reply. The route reply contains the number of routes that lead to it, sending and receiving time, the identification of intermediate nodes and the request that the sender had sent. During analyzing the reply, sender confirms the number <b>of</b> routes by <b>sending</b> <b>packets</b> <b>of</b> verification to individual nodes whose identification has been stated by the receiver and based upon the delay in time i. e., ∆t, wormhole link is detected. Analysis proves that the proposed technique not only detects the wormhole link but also provides a verification mechanism to judge the validity of nodes...|$|R
