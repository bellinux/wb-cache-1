40|$|International audienceOur {{knowledge}} of Escherichia coli (E. coli) ecology {{in the field}} is very limited in the case of dairy alpine grassland soils. Here, our objective was to monitor field survival of E. coli in <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> and underlying soils in four different alpine pasture units, and to determine whether the soil could constitute an environmental reservoir. E. coli was enumerated by MPN using a selective medium. E. coli survived well in <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> (10 (7) to 10 (8) cells g(- 1) dry <b>pat),</b> but <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> disappeared within about 2 mo. In each pasture unit, constant levels of E. coli (10 (3) to 10 (4) cells g(- 1) dry soil) were recovered from all topsoil (0 - 5 cm) samples regardless of the sampling date, that is, under the snow cover, immediately after snow melting, or during the pasture season (during and after the decomposition of pats). In deeper soil layers below the root zone (5 - 25 cm), E. coli persistence varied according to soil type, with higher numbers recovered in poorly-drained soils (10 (3) to 10 (4) cells g(- 1) dry soil) than in well-drained soils (< 10 (2) cells g(- 1) dry soil). A preliminary analysis of 38 partial uidA sequences of E. coli from pat and soils highlighted a cluster containing sequences only found in this work.

40|$|The {{return of}} organic matter from <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> to soil is {{important}} for global food production and will be critical for pastoral carbon sequestration. Even so, dung organic matter processing in the environment (especially that mediated by invertebrate ecosystem engineers) is poorly understood. Natural abundance isotope tracer techniques have been used successfully to quantify dung carbon movement (e. g. Dungait et al., 2005), but {{were found to be}} insufficiently sensitive where the contribution of dung carbon was low (Bol et al., 2000). High enrichment of the stable isotopes 13 C and 15 N in contextually realistic molecular forms, coupled with compound-specific isotope ratio measurements, is enabling the study of microbial and invertebrate functional relationships within the dung ecosystem. Further, molecular detail may be added to the developing quantitative model of dung degradation and, using the enhanced sensitivity {{of organic matter}} tracing afforded by the high isotopic enrichment, the model may be extended to deeper soil layers. Laboratory dung incubations using 13 C-glucose and 15 NH 415 NO 3 and have shown that the microbial community in cow dung used the labelled glucose as a respiratory substrate; δ 13 C(CO 2) values peaking at 7000 ‰ after 14 h.

40|$|Agriculture {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{anthropogenic}} sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), with dairy and beef production accounting for nearly two-thirds of emissions. Several recent papers suggest that dung beetles may affect fluxes of GHGs from cattle farming. Here, we put these previous findings into context. Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7 % and 12 % respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH 4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0. 05 – 0. 13 % reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes. In contrast, we suggest that the effects of dung beetles may be accentuated in tropical countries, where more manure is left on pastures, and dung beetles remove and aerate dung faster, and that this is thus a key area for future research. These considerations give a new perspective on previous results perspective, and suggest that studies of biotic effects on GHG emissions from dung pats on a global scale are a priority for current research.

40|$|The {{survival}} of enteric bacteria {{was measured in}} bovine feces on pasture. In each season, 11 <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> were prepared from a mixture of fresh dairy cattle feces and sampled for up to 150 days. Four pats were analyzed for Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, and enterococci, and four inoculated pats were analyzed for Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica. Two pats were placed on drainage collectors, and another pat was fitted with a temperature probe. In the first 1 to 3 weeks, there were increases (up to 1. 5 orders of magnitude) in the counts of enterococci (in four seasons), E. coli (three seasons), fecal streptococci (three seasons), and S. enterica (two seasons), {{but there was no}} increase in the counts of C. jejuni. Thereafter, the counts decreased, giving an average ranking of the times necessary for 90 % inactivation of C. jejuni (6. 2 days from deposition) < fecal streptococci (35 days) < S. enterica (38 days) < E. coli (48 days) < enterococci (56 days). The pat temperature probably influenced bacterial growth, but the pattern of increases and decreases was primarily determined by desiccation; growth occurred when the water content was greater than 80 %, but at a water content of 70 to 75 % counts decreased. E. coli and enterococcus regrowth appeared to result from pat rehydration. Of 20 monthly leaching losses of E. coli, 16 were < 10 % of the total counts in the pat, and 12 were < 1 %. Drainage losses of C. jejuni (generally < 1 %) were detected for only 1 to 2 months.

40|$|Artificial <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> were seeded with Cryptosporidium oocysts and {{subjected}} to a simulated rainfall event. The runoff from the faecal pat was collected and different particle size fractions were collected within settling columns by exploiting the size-dependent settling velocities. Particle size and Cryptosporidium concentration distribution at 10 cm below the surface was measured at regular intervals over 24 h. Initially {{a large proportion of}} the total volume of particles belonged to the larger size classes (> 17 μm). However, throughout the course of the experiment, there was a sequential loss of the larger size classes from the sampling depth and a predominance of smaller particles (< 17 μm). The Cryptosporidium concentration at 10 cm depth did not change throughout the experiment. In the second experiment samples were taken from different depths within the settling column. Initially 26 % of particles were in the size range 124 – 492 μm. However, as these large particles settled there was an enrichment at 30 cm after one hour (36. 5 – 49. 3 %). There was a concomitant enrichment of smaller particles near the surface after 1 h and 24 h. For Pat 1 there was no difference in Cryptosporidium concentration with depth after 1 h and 24 h. In Pat 2 there was a difference in concentration between the surface and 30 cm after 24 h. However, this could be explained by the settling velocity of a single oocyst. The results suggested that oocysts are not associated with large particles, but exist in faecal runoff as single oocysts and hence have a low (0. 1 m d− 1) settling velocity. The implications of this low settling velocity on Cryptosporidium risk reduction within water supply reservoirs was investigated through the application of a three-dimensional model of oocyst fate and transport to a moderately sized reservoir (26 GL). The model indicated that the role of settling on oocyst concentration reduction within the water column is between one and three orders of magnitude less than that caused by advection and dilution, depending on the strength of hydrodynamic forcing.

40|$|Most of the {{fieldwork}} {{for this}} study was conducted on the island of Islay, in the Inner Hebrides, the stronghold of the chough, Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax L., in Scotland. The aims of this study were to provide baseline data on the phenology of potential invertebrate foods of the chough, and to provide a greater understanding of the factors affecting these invertebrate populations. The literature concerning (a) the chough in Britain and its feeding ecology, (b) the invertebrate fauna of pasture, (c) the invertebrates associated with cow dung, (d) ivermectin and its effect on the invertebrate fauna associated with cattle dung, and (e) the multivariate analysis methods used in this study, is reviewed. An area of heather moorland and four pastures were selected on Islay. Invertebrates were collected from these sites between January 1988 and November 1989 using pitfall traps, and by sampling soil and <b>cow</b> <b>pats.</b> The data obtained was analysed using two multivariate analysis methods -Two-Way-Indicator-Species- Analysis (TWINSPAN) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DECORANA). Information on 62 surface-active taxa was obtained from pitfall trapping. Although seasonal taxa assemblages were recognized, the distribution of the invertebrate communities was primarily related to soil moisture content. Grazing intensity and seasonality were also important factors determining the composition of the invertebrate fauna at each site. The taxa active during the summer and winter at the two sand grassland sites, did not appear to differ as markedly as at the other sites sampled. Figures showing the seasonal activity of some of the frequently occurring taxa at each site considered potential chough prey items are provided. Surface-active potential chough food items were present, at all the sites investigated, throughout the year. Soil-sampling provided information on 34 taxa. As with the surface-active fauna, the primary factor influencing the soil fauna was soil moisture content. The time of year was also an important factor governing the soil fauna composition, with the majority of taxa occurring in low numbers during the summer months at all the sites sampled. Figures indicating the seasonal occurrences of some of the taxa considered potential chough prey items at each site are provided. Soil {{did not appear to be}} a good source of potential prey items for the chough during the summer months, although, as a result of seasonal increases in size, certain taxa, e. g. Tipulidae larvae, may have been more 'worthwhile' prey items at this time of year than at any other. Information on 54 taxa was obtained from sampling cow dung. Seasonality and age of the dung were very important in determining the composition of the dung fauna. The seasonal variations in the fauna associated with the <b>cow</b> <b>pats</b> are described. Potential chough prey items were associated with cow dung, in any stage of decay, throughout most of the year. Only during the period from October/November to January did there appear to be a lack of suitably sized potential prey items in the dung. The 'summer' months, when fresh dung contained large numbers of beetle adults and developing fly larvae, and late autumn, when pats deposited during the summer months are old enough for the large numbers of Aphodius spp. larvae present to have attained a reasonable size, were considered to be the times at which cow dung presented the best feeding opportunities for the chough. Fifty taxa were identified in samples of chough faeces. Multivariate analysis of these data indicated that the seasonal availability of prey items was the most important factor influencing chough diet throughout the year. Soil-dwelling Tipulidae (January to July) and Bibionidae (January to April) larvae, dung-associated insects (during the spring, and late summer and autumn), and surface-active insects (during the summer) were important invertebrate components of the diet. Cereal grains were extremely important supplementary food items during the early winter months, when invertebrate availability was low. An experiment was conducted at the College to investigate the effects on the dung fauna of spiking cow dung with 2. 0, 1. 0, or 0. 5 mg/kg dung of ivermectin. Pats were placed on pasture between May and September 1988. The pats were lifted, and the soil beneath sampled, after 15 to 90 days exposure. A total of 65 taxa were identified. These data were analysed using TWINSPAN, DECORANA and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CANOCO). The major factors determining the invertebrate fauna of the pats were length of exposure, exposure date, and ivermectin presence/absence. Ivermectin markedly affected the fauna associated with the pats. Pats exposed in June and August degraded faster than those exposed in May or September. In June, the ivermectin-treated pats degraded significantly slower than the control pats. An attempt to extract ivermectin from cow dung for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography is described. This proved unsuccessful and the reasons for this failure, and possible improvements, are discussed. The main conclusions of this study are: (1) that Tipulidae larvae are extremely important components of the chough's diet on Islay, and that the climatic conditions of the island favour these insects; (2) livestock farming on Islay, especially the out-wintering of cattle, provides essential feeding opportunities for the chough, as, (a) gazing animals produce the short sward preferred by the chough as a feeding habitat, (b) large numbers of insects are associated with the dung of these animals, and (c) supplementary feed provided for the cattle in winter also provides an essential alternative food source for the chough at a critical time; (3) the chough's preference on Islay for feeding in sandy, coastal pasture is due to the fact that these sites, (a) contain a variety of suitable invertebrate prey items throughout most of the year, (b) are normally intensively grazed and so contain large amounts of dung with its associated fauna, and (c) are used for out-wintering cattle and therefore cereal grains can be found there; (4) treating cattle with ivermectin could have an adverse effect on the chough as it reduces the number and variety of invertebrates associated with the dung, an important food source for the birds, especially in spring and autumn...|$|R
