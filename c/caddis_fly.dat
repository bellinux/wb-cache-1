5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a <b>caddis</b> <b>fly</b> larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
25|$|Although {{giant hogweed}} is taking hold along the Annick (2006), however the {{riparian}} (water side) flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare crosswort, (a {{relative of the}} goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback. The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants {{as shown by the}} presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, <b>caddis</b> <b>fly</b> larvae and water snail species.|$|E

[...] The river system contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, lampreys, and sticklebacks. The brown colour of the Irvine at places like Darvel and Newmilns is not a result of pollution, but simply organic material washed out of the peat banks at the watershed. Freshwater mussels, a species persecuted for its pearls, [...] are found in places on the Glazert and the Garnock.|$|E

40|$|Since Higler {{published}} {{his list of}} extinct and endangered <b>caddis</b> <b>flies</b> species in 1995 {{a number of new}} and rare species were recorded for the Netherlands. These new findings can be partly attributed to the growing interest among researchers to study <b>caddis</b> <b>flies,</b> which has resulted in a more thorough investigation of certain water types. Other records of rare species were discovered by collecting and identifying pupae and adults, such as Hydroptila vectis and Oxyethira falcata. Some rare species, which have not been recorded since 1950, are common nowadays, possibly caused by the improved water quality of the river systems in the Netherlands. Other new species to the Dutch fauna are the result of new taxonomic insights...|$|R
