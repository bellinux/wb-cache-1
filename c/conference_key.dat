We describe a protocol that establishes a secure multicast group, and distributes a group key by mutually authenticating a group of devices over an open insecure wireless channel.

We address two problems in this work.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> {{protocol}} {{allows a}} group of participants to establish a secret communication (<b>conference)</b> <b>key</b> so that all their communications thereafter are protected by the key. In this paper we consider the distributed <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> (<b>conference</b> <b>key</b> agreement) protocol. We present two round-efficient <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocols, which achieve the optimum {{in terms of the}} number of rounds. Our protocols are secure against both passive and active adversaries under the random oracle model. They release no useful information to passive adversaries and achieve fault tolerance against any coalition of malicious participants. We achieve the optimal round by transferring an interactive proof system to a non-interactive version, while preserving its security capability. ...|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} include teleconferencing, collaborative work, information distribution and interactive games, secure group communication indicates a scenario where all group members can {{send and receive}} messages destined to the group. When {{a group of people}} want to communicate securely over an open network, they have to establish a common <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> K such that all their communications thereafter are encrypted with the key K. There are two typical categories of key management protocols for group communication. One is centralized key distribution and other is distributed key agreement. The later one is suitable for distributed environments, in this all participants together compute a common key without a coordinator. This paper deals with the distributed environment and it proposes a provably secure faulttolerant conference-key agreement protocol under the authenticated broadcast channel model. This paper shows that during the communication between honest participants, an eavesdropper (passive adversary) gets zero knowledge about the <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> established by the honest participants under the assumption of a variant Diffie-Hellman decision problem. It also shows that the honest participants can agree on a common <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> no matter how many participants are malicious. Suppose if a cheater sends a false message to disrupt the <b>conference</b> <b>key,</b> the model does not allow the cheaters to disrupt the <b>conference</b> <b>key.</b> The honest participants shall exclude the cheater from their participant sets. 1. 1 Problem Domain 1...|$|E
40|$|Lots of <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> {{agreement}} protocols {{have been}} suggested to secure computer network conference. Most of them operate only when all conferees are honest, but do not work when some conferees are malicious and attempt to delay or destruct the conference. Recently, Tzeng proposed a <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol with fault tolerance in terms that a common secret <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> among honest conferees can be established even if malicious conferees exist. In the case where a conferee can broadcast different messages in different subnetworks, Tzeng’s protocol is vulnerable to a “different key attack” from malicious conferees. In addition, Tzeng’s protocol requires each conferee to broadcast {{to the rest of}} the group and receive n 1 messages in a single round (where n stands for the number of conferees). Moreover, it has to handle n simultaneous broadcasts in one round. In this paper, we propose a novel fault-tolerant <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> agreement protocol, in which each conferee only needs to send one message to a “semitrusted” conference bridge and receive one broadcast message. Our protocol is an identity-based key agreement, built on elliptic curve cryptography. It is resistant to the different key attack from malicious conferees and needs less communication cost than Tzeng’s protocol...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} simplify key management, two-party and three-party key {{agreement}} schemes based on user identities {{have been proposed}} recently. Multiparty (including more than three parties) key agreement protocols, which also are called <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> schemes, {{can be applied to}} distributed systems and wireless environments, such as ad hoc networks, for the purpose of multiparty secure communication. However, it is hard to extend two- or three-party schemes to multiparty ones with the guarantee of efficiency and security. In addition to the above two properties, interdomain environments should also be considered in key agreement systems due to diversified network domains. However, only few identity-based multiparty <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> agreement schemes for single domain environments and none for interdomain environments were proposed in the literature and they did not satisfy all of the security attributes such as forward secrecy and withstanding impersonation. In this paper, we will propose a novel efficient single domain identity-based multiparty <b>conference</b> <b>key</b> scheme and extend it to an interdomain one. Finally, we prove that the proposed schemes satisfy the required security attributes via formal methods...|$|E
