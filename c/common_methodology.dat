Bollen, who is also an applied statistician. Bollen writes that expert-based evaluations are prone to statistical bias of an unknown direction, that is, not known either to agree with U.S. policy or to disagree with U.S. policy: [...] "Regardless of the direction of distortions, it is highly likely that every set of indicators formed by a single author or organization contains systematic measurement error. [...] The origin of this measure lies in the <b>common</b> <b>methodology</b> of forming measures. [...] Selectivity of information and various traits of the judges fuse into a distinct form of bias {{that is likely to}} characterize all indicators from a common publication." ...|$|E
2500|$|RDF {{is being}} used to have a better {{understanding}} of road traffic patterns. [...] This is because the information regarding traffic patterns is [...] on different websites, and RDF is used to integrate information from different sources on the web. Before, the <b>common</b> <b>methodology</b> was using keyword searching, but this method is problematic because it does not [...] consider synonyms. This is why ontologies are useful in this situation. But one of the issues that comes up when trying to efficiently study traffic is that to fully understand traffic, [...] concepts related to people, streets, and roads must be well understood. Since these are human [...] concepts, they require the addition of fuzzy logic. This is because values that are useful [...] when describing roads, like slipperiness, are not precise concepts and cannot be measured. This would imply that the best solution would incorporate both fuzzy logic and ontology.|$|E

50|$|Decision {{engineering}} {{is both a}} very new and also a very old discipline. Many of its elements - such as the language of assessing assumptions, using logic to support an argument, the necessity of critical thinking to evaluate a decision, and understanding the impacts of bias - are ancient.
