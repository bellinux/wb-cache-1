40|$|Abstract— 4 -G mobile {{communications}} system has utilized high speed data communications technology having connectivity {{to all sorts of}} networks including 2 -G and 3 -G mobile networks. Authentication of mobile subscribers and networks are a prime criterion to check and minimize security threats and attacks. An artificial intelligence based mutual authentication system with four entities is proposed. A person talking salutation or greeting words in different times are always consisting of a very narrow range of frequencies which are varying in nature from person to person. Voice frequency of the salutation or selective words used by a subscriber like Hello, Good Morning etc is taken as first entity. Second entity is chosen as frequency of flipping or clapping sound of the <b>calling</b> <b>subscriber.</b> Then third entity is taken as face image of the <b>calling</b> <b>subscriber.</b> Fourth entity is granted as probabilit...|$|R

30|$|Our work {{is mainly}} {{based on the}} work by Malekesmaeili et al. [4] and Kumar et al. [8]. From [4], the {{topology}} control concept and collision domain routing metric are taken as baseline for routing with modifications. From [8], linear programming-based approach to rout and rate maximization are adopted with modifications to constraints and routing path selection. The essence of this work is to develop a fair subscriber-aware routing algorithm for WMN, in which the positions of subscribers are taken into account in order to ensure fairness without crippling the network performance. The algorithm is <b>called</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Aware Fair Routing in WMN (SAFARI).|$|E

30|$|Multiradio {{wireless}} {{mesh network}} (WMN) is a feasible choice for several applications, as routers with multiple network interface cards have become cheaper. Routing in any network {{has a great}} impact on the overall network performance, thus a routing protocol or algorithm for WMN should be carefully designed taking into account the specific characteristics of the network. In addition, in wireless networks, serious unfairness can occur between users if the issue is not addressed in the network protocols or algorithms. In this paper, we are proposing a novel centralized routing algorithm, <b>called</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Aware Fair Routing in WMN (SAFARI), for multiradio WMN that assures fairness, leads to a feasible scheduling, and does not collapse the aggregate network throughput with a strict fairness criterion. We show that our protocol is feasible and practical, and exhaustive simulations show that the performance is improved compared to traditional routing algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Numbering and {{addressing}} issues arising in the Integrated Broadband Communication Network (IBCN) {{for the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile communications services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile Customer Premises Network (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data. The exclusive use of Personal Telecommunication Numbers (PTN's) as Dialing Numbers (DN) is proposed in IBCN for UMTS and PTS. That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as fixed subscribers. When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the <b>called</b> <b>subscriber.</b> Also, a proposal for the UMTS and PTS numbering plan is presented...|$|E
