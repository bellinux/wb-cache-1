News of Henson's death spread quickly and fans {{from around the}} world responded with tributes and condolences. Many of Henson's co-stars and directors from Sesame Street, the Muppets and other works also shared their thoughts on Henson's death.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical <b>care.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, elements of the division, including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea, were becoming increasingly hard to keep in place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|Today, modern re-tellings of the Lalaurie legend {{often use}} deLavigne and Smith's {{versions}} of the tale to found claims of explicit tortures, and to place the number of slaves who died under Lalaurie's <b>care</b> <b>at</b> {{as many as one}} hundred.|$|E

He died on March 30, 2013, in hospice <b>care</b> <b>at</b> Lenbrook, a {{retirement}} community in Atlanta at age 82 from liver cancer. He is survived by his second wife, Janet; two sons, Terry and Donald; daughter, Rowena; and seventeen grandchildren. Turley was cremated in Duluth, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital <b>care.</b> <b>At</b> very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal <b>care</b> <b>at</b> the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E

5|$|Greeley resumed the editorship of the Tribune, {{but quickly}} learned {{there was a}} {{movement}} under way to unseat him. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the Tribune on November 13 (a week after the election) remained under medical <b>care.</b> <b>At</b> the recommendation of a family physician, Greeley {{was sent to the}} asylum of Dr. George S. Choate at Pleasantville, New York. There, he continued to worsen, and died on November 29, with his two surviving daughters and Whitelaw Reid at his side.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive <b>care</b> <b>at</b> Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir. In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 September 1981, Bill Shankly was {{admitted}} to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack. His condition appeared to be stable {{and there was no}} suggestion that his life was in danger. But, on the following Monday morning, his condition suddenly deteriorated and was transferred into intensive <b>care.</b> <b>At</b> 00:30 on 29 September, he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead, aged 68, at 01:20. He was cremated at the Anfield Crematorium on 2 October and his ashes were scattered on the Anfield pitch at the Kop end.|$|E

5|$|The American Red Cross {{called it}} a major disaster, but getting relief into the area was stalled because of {{landslides}} blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties. California State Route 99 was also blocked by a landslide ten miles south of Gorman, but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day. All aircraft {{not related to the}} relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport. All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable. Most of the injured received medical <b>care</b> <b>at</b> Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital, where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals.|$|E
5|$|The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is {{responsible}} for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services. –11, the city had 50 government hospitals, 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000. For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. The city also has about 4,000 individual clinics and 500 medical diagnostic centres. Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of <b>care</b> <b>at</b> and long waiting times in government facilities, despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 {{was passed}} by the House and Senate before their August recess to add $16 billion in {{supplemental}} funding for the VA, with $10 billion for allowing some Veterans to receive private medical <b>care</b> <b>at</b> taxpayer expense, and $6 billion for increasing the number of VA staff. The Act also gives the VA Secretary expanded authority to fire managers who perform poorly, and authorized the VA to lease additional facilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not <b>care</b> <b>at</b> all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical <b>care</b> <b>at</b> specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Moran {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health <b>care</b> <b>at</b> South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times {{over the next few weeks}} on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, Bojić {{reached the}} Greek island of Corfu, {{where he was}} {{recruited}} to work for Serbian military intelligence. That summer, he was transferred to Thessaloniki, where he continued working for the military. In August, he was granted leave and sailed to France, where he reunited with his fiancée and his brother. Bojić returned to Greece several weeks later, and was diagnosed with tuberculosis in September the following year. Owing to the political connections of his patrons, he managed to find <b>care</b> <b>at</b> an exclusive military hospital in Thessaloniki, but by late October his condition worsened. He died in early November {{at the age of}} 25. He was initially buried at the Allied military cemetery at Zeitenlik, but in 1922, his siblings had his remains relocated to Belgrade, where they were reburied beside those of his parents.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a {{shooting}} spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, {{that he had not}} been sane {{at the time of the}} incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in <b>care</b> <b>at</b> Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.|$|E
