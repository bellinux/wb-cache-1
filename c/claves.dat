50|$|While music {{director}} for Machito, Mario Bauzá developed the 3-2 / 2-3 <b>clave</b> concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin {{on either side}} of <b>clave.</b> When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 <b>clave.</b> When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 <b>clave.</b> In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent <b>clave</b> in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When <b>clave</b> is written in two measures (above) changing from one <b>clave</b> sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>clave</b> {{patterns}} {{are used in}} rumba. What we now call son <b>clave</b> (also known as Havana <b>clave)</b> {{used to be the}} key pattern played in Havana-style yambú and guaguancó. Some Havana-based rumba groups still use son <b>clave</b> for yambú. The musical genre known as son probably adopted the <b>clave</b> pattern from rumba when it migrated from eastern Cuba to Havana {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} charanga format {{consists of}} congas, timbales, bass, piano, flute, {{and a string}} section of violins, viola, and cello. The <b>claves</b> and güiro are played by the singers. Bongos are not typically used in charanga bands. Típica 73 and Orquesta Broadway were two popular New York salsa bands in the charanga format.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>clave</b> pattern used in Cuban popular music {{is called the}} son <b>clave,</b> named after the Cuban musical genre of the same name. <b>Clave</b> is the basic period, {{composed}} of two rhythmically opposed cells, one antecedent and the other consequent. <b>Clave</b> was initially written in two measures of [...] in Cuban music. When written this way, each cell or <b>clave</b> half is represented within a single measure.|$|R
25|$|A chord {{progression}} {{can begin}} {{on either side}} of <b>clave.</b> In salsa “one” can be {{on either side of}} <b>clave,</b> because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression is the primary referent. When a chord progression begins on the two-side of <b>clave,</b> the music is said to be in two-three <b>clave.</b> The following guajeo is based on the <b>clave</b> motif in a two-three sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin and}} {{development}} of the coros de <b>clave</b> is linked not only to the local cabildos, but also to the traditions imported by immigrants from northern Spain, in particular the similarly named coros de <b>Clavé</b> (after Catalan composer José Ansemlo <b>Clavé).</b> Starting in 1845, <b>Clavé</b> established orfeones (French-style choirs) made up of working-class people in Barcelona. Similar choral traditions spread throughout the north of Spain, including Galicia, where the movement was called coralismo. According to some authors, including Odilio Urfé and Ned Sublette, upon introduction in Cuba, the coros de <b>Clavé</b> lost their accent, becoming coros de <b>clave.</b>|$|R
25|$|An unusual {{characteristic}} of reggae drumming {{is that the}} drum fills often do not end with a climactic cymbal. A wide range of other percussion instrumentation are used in reggae. Bongos are often used to play free, improvised patterns, with heavy use of African-style cross-rhythms. Cowbells, <b>claves</b> and shakers {{tend to have more}} defined roles and a set pattern.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cabildos {{of certain}} neighborhoods from Havana, Matanzas, Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, some choral groups were founded during the 19th century that {{organized}} competitive activities, {{and in some}} occasions were visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and presents. Those choral societies were called Coros de Clave, probably after the instrument that used to accompany their performances, the Cuban <b>Claves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Afro-Cuban jazz often uses Afro-Cuban {{instruments}} such as congas, timbales, güiro, and <b>claves,</b> {{combined with}} piano, double bass, etc. Afro-Cuban jazz began with Machito's Afro-Cubans {{in the early}} 1940s, but took off and entered the mainstream in the late 1940s when bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Taylor began experimenting with Cuban rhythms. Mongo Santamaria and Cal Tjader further refined the genre in the late 1950s.|$|E

When <b>clave</b> is written in two measures (right), changing from one <b>clave</b> sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other main}} <b>clave</b> pattern is the rumba <b>clave.</b> Rumba <b>clave</b> {{is the key}} pattern used in Cuban rumba. Use of the triple-pulse form of rumba <b>clave</b> in Cuba {{can be traced back}} to the iron bell (ekón) part in abakuá music. The form of rumba known as columbia is {{culturally}} and musically connected with abakuá which is an Afro Cuban cabildo that descends from the Kalabari of Cameroon. Columbia also uses this pattern. Sometimes [...] rumba <b>clave</b> is clapped in the accompaniment of Cuban batá drums. The [...] form of rumba <b>clave</b> is used in yambú, guaguancó and popular music.|$|R
5000|$|Just as a {{keystone}} {{holds an}} arch in place, the <b>clave</b> pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The two main <b>clave</b> patterns used in Afro-Cuban music are known in North America as son <b>clave</b> and the rumba <b>clave.</b> Both {{are used as}} bell patterns across much of Africa. Son and rumba <b>clave</b> can be played in either a triple-pulse ( [...] or [...] ) or duple-pulse ( [...] , [...] or [...] ) structure. The contemporary Cuban practice is to write the duple-pulse <b>clave</b> in a single measure of [...] It is also written in a single measure in ethnomusicological writings about African music.|$|R
25|$|Concerning {{the role}} of clave in salsa music, Charley Gerard states: “The clave feeling is in the music {{whether or not the}} <b>claves</b> are {{actually}} being played.” Every ostinato part which spans a cycle of four main beats, has a specific alignment with clave, and expresses the rhythmic qualities of clave either explicitly or implicitly. Every salsa musician must know how their particular part fits with clave, and with the other parts of the ensemble.|$|E
25|$|Rumba songs {{consist of}} two main sections. The first, the canto, {{features}} the lead vocalist, performing an extended text of verses that are sometimes partially improvised. The lead singer usually plays <b>claves.</b> The first section may last a few minutes, until the lead vocalist signals {{for the other}} singers to repeat the short refrain of the chorus, in call and response. This second section of the song is {{sometimes referred to as}} the montuno.|$|E
25|$|A charanga francesa formed {{early in}} the 20th century by flautist Octavio 'Tata' Alfonso. Its line-up at its peak was: Tata Alfonso (flute); Bruno Quijarro (violin); Pablo Bequé (double bass); Jesús Lopéz (piano); Abelardo Valdés (güiro); Ulpiano Díaz (timbales). The band {{recorded}} six numbers for Columbia Records in 1918, and was {{regarded as one of}} the three most important charangas in the history of the danzón, and the first to incorporate melodies from the cantos de <b>claves</b> y guaguancó in this genre.|$|E
25|$|Mario Bauzá {{developed}} the 3-2 / 2-3 <b>clave</b> concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin {{on either side}} of <b>clave.</b> When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 <b>clave.</b> When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 <b>clave.</b> In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent <b>clave</b> in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions.

Bauzá consciously maintained a balance of Latino and jazz musicians in Machito's band, in order to realize his vision of Afro-Cuban jazz. Bauzá had the unique experience of mastering both types of music, but it took time for him to teach the jazz musicians in Machito's band about <b>clave.</b> The first time jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham joined the band, Machito had to fire him after just two nights because he couldn't cope with <b>clave.</b>|$|R

2500|$|<b>Clave</b> is {{the basic}} period, {{composed}} of two rhythmically opposed cells, one antecedent and the other consequent. <b>Clave</b> was initially written in two measures of [...] (below). When <b>clave</b> is written in two measures, each cell or <b>clave</b> half is represented within a single measure. The antecedent half has three strokes and {{is referred to as}} the three-side of <b>clave</b> in the parlance of salsa. In Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son <b>clave</b> are also known collectively as tresillo, a Spanish word meaning 'triplet' (three equal beats in the same time as two main beats). However, in the Cuban vernacular, the term refers to the figure shown below in the first measure. The consequent half (second measure) of <b>clave</b> has two strokes and is called the two-side by salsa musicians.|$|R
25|$|The {{instrumental}} set-up is interesting, {{because they}} {{use some of}} the original instruments of the son: the botija and a unique square bongó. Soon this (and other) groups appreciated that the double bass was a musically more suitable instrument: they never went back to the botija. Five years later, the group had new members and a different look, including Agustín Gutierrez (bongó), Abelardo Barroso (sonero, <b>claves),</b> Felipe Nerí Cabrera (maracas, vocals); Gerardo Martínez (double bass, vocals, leader); Guillermo Castillo (guitar, vocals), Carlos Godínez (tres, vocals).|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Cuba, {{including}} its instruments, performance and dance, comprises a large set of unique traditions influenced mostly by west African and European (especially Spanish) music. Due to the syncretic nature {{of most of}} its genres, Cuban music is often {{considered one of the}} richest and most influential regional musics of the world. For instance, the son cubano merges an adapted Spanish guitar (tres), melody, harmony, and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythms. Almost nothing remains of the original native traditions, since the native population was exterminated in the 16th century. The most important instruments were the drums, of which there were originally about fifty different types; today only the bongos, congas and batá drums are regularly seen (the timbales are descended from kettle drums in Spanish military bands). Also important are the <b>claves,</b> two short hardwood batons, and the cajón, a wooden box, originally made from crates. <b>Claves</b> are still used often, and wooden boxes (cajones) were widely used during periods when the drum was banned. In addition, there are other percussion instruments in use for African-origin religious ceremonies. Chinese immigrants contributed the corneta china (Chinese cornet), a Chinese reed instrument still played in the comparsas, or carnival groups, of Santiago de Cuba.|$|E

50|$|Only in {{the last}} couple of decades have the three {{branches}} of <b>clave</b> theory begun to reconcile their shared and conflicting concepts.

50|$|The most {{fundamental}} rhythmic element in salsa {{music is a}} pattern and concept known as <b>clave.</b> <b>Clave</b> is a Spanish word meaning 'code,' 'key,' as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or 'keystone,' the wedge-shaped stone {{in the center of}} an arch that ties the other stones together. <b>Clave</b> is also the name of the patterns played on claves; two hardwood sticks used in Afro-Cuban music ensembles. The five-stroke <b>clave</b> represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms, both popular and folkloric.

25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} guitarist amongst modern Cuban trovadors is Eliades Ochoa (b. Songo La Maya, Santiago de Cuba, 22 June 1946), {{the leader of}} Cuerteto Patría. Ochoa learnt both Spanish guitar and the Cuban trés; Cuban composer and classical guitarist Leo Brouwer {{told him that he}} did not need to learn more about musical technique as he already knew too much! Ochoa plays now with an eight-stringed guitar (a self-designed hybrid of an acoustic six-string and the Cuban trés). Cuerteto Patría includes his brother Humberto Ochoa on guitar, son Eglis Ochoa on maracas, William Calderón on bass, Anibal Avila on <b>claves</b> and trumpet, and Roberto Torres on congas.|$|E
25|$|The Son, said Cristóbal Díaz, is {{the most}} {{important}} genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban instrument known as the tres, and the well-known double-headed bongó; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the <b>claves,</b> the Spanish guitar, the double bass (replacing the early botija or marímbula), early on the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.|$|E
25|$|Salsa {{ensembles}} {{are typically}} {{based on one}} of two different Cuban instrument formats, either the horn-based son conjunto or the string-based charanga. Some bands are expanded {{to the size of}} a mambo big band, but they can be thought of as an enlarged conjunto. The traditional conjunto format consists of congas, bongos, bass, piano, tres, a horn section, and the smaller hand-held percussion instruments: <b>claves,</b> guíro, or maracas, played by the singers. The Cuban horn section traditionally consists of trumpets, but trombones are frequently used in salsa. The section can also use a combination of different horns. Most salsa bands are based on the conjunto model, but the tres is almost never used.|$|E
