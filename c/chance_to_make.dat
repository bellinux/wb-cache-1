5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first five games in 2009, but lost their next four. After beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, they lost badly to Denver on Thanksgiving. They {{defeated}} Dallas 31–24 in Week 13, then lost 45–38 to Philadelphia the next week. At 8–6, {{they still had}} a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs, but losses to Carolina and Minnesota to finish the season left {{them out of the}} playoffs at 8–8.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Umaga and Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Hardy started the match attacking Umaga with moves such as dropkicks, {{inverted}} mule kicks and a Whisper in the Wind. Hardy had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the cover, but instead attempted {{to perform a}} Swanton Bomb. Umaga avoided the move and charged Hardy in the corner. Umaga then performed a Samoan Spike and pinned Hardy after to win the match.|$|E

Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny, with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).|$|E

5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are sent}} on {{assignment}} {{to make a}} sales pitch to a client, and are eager to land the sale. However, Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant), a rival paper salesman from the very small Osprey company who steals more potential sales away from Dunder Mifflin than anyone, has also arrived for a sales pitch. Dwight also reveals that Danny had a romantic history with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) four years previously. Jim and Dwight call in Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is ecstatic at getting a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sale, to come and try to save them. The company ends up taking Danny's offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client's office and head back home, defeated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Hokies's defeat, Virginia Tech chose to start a new quarterback and a new {{offensive}} plan. Behind freshman Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies rolled to five straight victories, including a win over No.22 Clemson by 18points. During the winning streak, Sean Glennon, who had started at quarterback for the Hokies during the first two games of the season, returned to alternate possessions with Taylor in an unusual two-quarterback system. On October 25, the Hokies had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for their early-season loss to LSU when they faced No.2 Boston College on a Thursday night in Blacksburg, Virginia. Though the Hokies dominated for most of the game, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan managed a late-game comeback to win the game 1410 with 11seconds remaining.|$|E
5|$|Karthik was not {{selected}} for the ODIs against Pakistan and returned to action in one-dayers for Tamil Nadu in the meantime, but managed only 59 runs at 19.66 in three matches. Karthik returned to India after Zimbabwe tour in 2006 and made 26 and 11 in the Challenger Trophy for India A, which was not {{enough for him to}} force his way into India’s squad for the home ODIs against Sri Lanka and South Africa. In the meantime, he played in the Duleep Trophy and had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his case for Test retention. However, he scored only 106 runs at 26.50 in two matches and South Zone lost both of these and were eliminated, and Karthik spent the next month on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E

5|$|The evening draw, which {{consisted}} of men's team play, saw Team North America extending their lead to five points. Heath McCormick dominated against Thomas Ulsrud, who lost second Christoffer Svae {{in the middle of}} the game due to illness. Kevin Martin established an early lead in the first half of the game versus Niklas Edin and held his lead to win. Glenn Howard had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the draw a North America sweep, starting off with a small lead against Tom Brewster, but a mistake in the eighth end from Brent Laing led to a chance for Brewster to come back and tie the game, which he did. At the end of the day, Team North America led Team World 13–8.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's {{substitution}} of Paulinho for Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk {{resulted in an}} improvement in their play after the restart; Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved shots in quick succession from Oscar, Paulinho and Fred. By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal indeed came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed {{the ball into the}} net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over Júlio César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but just missed the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it eight. Seconds later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst ever loss (6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to a chorus of boos.|$|E

5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
5|$|The hosts {{scored the}} opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a {{position}} on the right. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, {{to the head of the}} Uruguayan Football Association, Raúl Jude. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.|$|E

5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
5|$|With {{limited time}} remaining, Clemson {{attempted}} an onside kick {{in an effort}} to retain possession and have a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up some of the scoring deficit. The kick was recovered by Virginia Tech, however, and the Vick-led Tech offense returned to the field at the Clemson 44-yard line. Suggs was stopped for no gain on a run up the middle, Vick threw an incomplete pass, then he completed a 14-yard pass to Wynn for a first down at the Clemson 30-yard line. After the first down, Ferguson gained a few yards on a run up the middle, then Suggs advanced the ball to just short of the first-down marker. On third down, Suggs gained the first down with a run up the middle. Following the first down, Clemson defender Alex Ardley was called for a personal foul and ejected from the game. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Clemson 10-yard line. From there, Clemson was called for a five-yard offsides penalty. On the first play after the consecutive penalties, Vick pitched the ball to Suggs, who ran into the end zone untouched. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech extended its lead to 4120 with 3:41 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Saudis spent $15 {{million to}} equip royalist tribes, hire {{hundreds}} of European mercenaries, and establish their own radio station. Pakistan, which saw a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{money in the}} conflict, extended rifles to the royalists. Remnants of the Imam's Army also had elements of the Saudi National Guard fight alongside its ranks. Iran subsidized royalist forces on and off, as the Shah felt compelled to provide al-Badr (a Zaidi) with financing. The British allowed convoys of arms to flow through one of its allies in Northern Yemen, the Sheriff of Beijan, who was protected by the British administration in Aden. British military planes conducted night operations to resupply al-Badr's forces. The MI6 was responsible for contacting the royalists, and used {{the services of a}} private company belonging to Colonel David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service (SAS), who recruited dozens of former SAS men as advisors to the royalists. Britain participated in a $400 million British air defense program for Saudi Arabia. The Lyndon Johnson administration was more willing than Kennedy's to support long-range plans in support of the Saudi army. In 1965, the US authorized an agreement with the Corps of Engineers to supervise the construction of military facilities and in 1966 it sponsored a $100 million program which provided the Saudi forces with combat vehicles, mostly trucks. Faisal also initiated an Islamic alignment called the Islamic Conference, to counter Nasser's Arab socialism.|$|E
