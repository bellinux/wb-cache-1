40|$|The {{integrity}} of the repair is critical to maintain coaptation of the severed flexor tendon end until healing has advanced sufficiently. In our hospital, we use a modified Savage repair (four-strand Adelaide technique) using 3 – 0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) for acute flexor tenorrhaphy and an active postrepair mobilization protocol. To explain the apparent differences between the theoretical and actual repair strength of a multistrand repair in a single tension test and the reduced strength of a repair subjected to cyclic loading, we compared single and cyclical tensile loading with different suture in vitro configurations of 3 – 0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA; one, two, and four strands) and an ex vivo four-strand repair of freshly divided porcine tendon to calculate the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Mechanical testing was repeated 15 times with both single tensile and <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> for each suture configuration and porcine repair. In the in vitro model, {{the presence of a}} knot in a single strand reduced the UTS by 50 %. The stiffness of a knotted strand was substantially less than the unknotted strand but became identical after <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading.</b> There was no statistical significance of the UTS between single and <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> with different numbers of strands in this model. In the ex vivo four-strand porcine repair model, there was a significant reduction in UTS with <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading,</b> which equated to the number of strands times the strength of the knotted strand. This discrepancy {{can be explained by the}} change in stiffness of the knotted strand after <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> and has important implications for previous studies of suture tendon repair using single tensile loading where the UTS may have been overestimated. We believe that <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> is more representative of physiological loading after acute flexor tendon repair and should be the testing model of choice in suture tenorrhaphy studies.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveUnderstanding the {{mechanical}} functions of specific cartilage molecules such as aggrecan {{is important for}} understanding both healthy cartilage and disease progression. Cartilage is primarily composed of chondrocytes and an extracellular matrix consisting of multiple biopolymers, ions, and water. Aggrecan is one matrix biopolymer which consists of a core protein and multiple anionic glycosaminoglycans. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} the stiffness of extracted aggrecan decreases under increased solution cation concentration, and {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine whether changes in solution ion concentration resulted in changes in tissue-level viscoelastic properties. MethodsMiddle-zone explants of bovine calf patellofemoral cartilage were harvested and cultured overnight before mechanical testing. Repeated stress–relaxation and <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> tests were performed after equilibration in solutions of 0. 15 M and 1 M NaCl and 0. 075 M and 0. 5 M CaCl 2. A stretched exponential model was fit to the stress–relaxation data. Storage and loss moduli were determined from the <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> data. ResultsChanges in ionic strength and species affected both stress–relaxation and <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading</b> of cartilage. Stress–relaxation was faster under higher ionic strength. CaCl 2 concentration increases resulted in decreased peak stress, while NaCl increases resulted in decreased equilibrium stress. Storage and loss moduli were affected differently by NaCl and CaCl 2. ConclusionsThese results show that cartilage stress–relaxation proceeds faster under higher concentrations of solution cations, consistent with the theory of polymer dynamics. These data demonstrate the complexity of cartilage mechanical properties and suggest that aggrecan stiffness may be important in tissue-level cartilage viscoelastic properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a parametric study investigating the axisymmetric consolidation of a semi-infinite transversely isotropic saturated clay subjected to a time-varying circular pressure at the ground surface. Based on Biot’s governing consolidation equations for transversely isotropic clay, the general solutions have been previously derived by applying the Laplace–Hankel transform technique. A numerical inverting procedure was then used to study the consolidation behavior in the time domain for three loading cases, that is, instantaneous constant, ramp, and cyclical sinusoidal loadings. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that the pore pressure dissipation of the clay under the aforementioned time-varying loadings exhibits different characteristics that require special attention. Under ramp loading, the non-dimensional construction time factor, View the MathML source, significantly influences pore pressure dissipation, while under <b>cyclical</b> <b>loading,</b> pore water pressure changes may lag behind or exceed the period of the cycle, depending on the parameters that characterize the properties of the transversely anisotropic soil.

40|$|Using a model {{organism}} (rabbits) {{that resembles}} a number of mammalian herbivores in key aspects of its chewing behaviors, we examined how variation in dietary mechanical properties a ects food breakdown during mastication. Such data have implications for understanding phenotypic variation in the mammalian feeding apparatus, {{particularly with respect to}} linking jaw form to diet-induced repetitive loading. Results indicate that chewing frequency (chews/s) is independent of food properties, whereas chewing investment (chews/g) and chewing duration(s), which are proportional to repetitive loading of the jaws, are positively related to food sti ness and toughness. In comparisons of displacement-limited and stress-limited fragmentation indices, which respectively characterize the intraoral breakdown of tough and sti foods, increases in chewing investment and duration are linked solely to sti ness.
