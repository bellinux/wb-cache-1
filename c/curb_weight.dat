Instead of a heavy, double-overhead cam engine like in the ZR-1, the Z06 used a high-output, tuned version of the standard LS1 Corvette engine (designated LS6), which initially produced 385hp (287kW). Although its total horsepower output was less than that of the last ZR-1, the Z06 was much lighter, and could out-perform the ZR-1 in every category except top speed.

25|$|The Storm SRTV {{is based}} on an {{original}} design by BC Customs (BCC) of Utah, originally submitted for the Ground Mobility Vehicle System (GMV 1.1) competition hosted by SOCOM. It is in the tactical family of SXOR Mobility Vehicles of SXOR Motorsports. It is a highly mobile 2-door off-roading pickup truck design with all-wheel-drive. The light-weight tactical vehicle has a high performance mid-engine for maximum stability with 430 horsepower and 425lb-ft of torque. The SRTV can exceed double its <b>curb</b> <b>weight</b> in payload while performing missions. The engine will run using standard gasoline, 87 Octane or higher, diesel, or JP-8. The SRTV is constructed of MIL-STD aircraft tubing, minimizing weight, maximizing strength, and providing a skeletal base for multiple types of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ballistic and blast armoring. The vehicle utilizes identical components with multiple body configurations, hence, it provides multi-role configurations.|$|E
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall <b>curb</b> <b>weight</b> is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} {{to a lack of}} large-automaker participation in the electric car industry, a number of small companies cropped up in their place, designing and marketing electric cars for the public. In 1994, the Reva Electric Car Company was established in Bangalore, India, as a joint venture between the Maini Group India and AEV of California. After seven years of research and development, it launched the REVAi an all-electric small micro car, known as the G-Wiz i in the United Kingdom, in 2001. The car was powered by lead–acid batteries, and in January 2009, a new model was launched, the REVA L-ion. It is similar to the REVAi but powered by high performance lithium-ion batteries, which reduce the car's <b>curb</b> <b>weight.</b> In many countries the REVAi does not meet the criteria to qualify as a highway-capable motor vehicle, and fits into other classes, such as neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) in the United States and heavy quadricycle in Europe. The REVA sold more than 4,000 vehicles worldwide by March 2011 and was available in 26 countries. Sales in the UK, its main market, ended by late 2011. Production ended in 2012 and was replaced by the Mahindra e2o in 2013.|$|E

Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan. The 1977–1979 Custom Cruiser was now based on the Delta 88's B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight's C-body (thus also sharing the coil spring suspension, rather than the multi-leaf spring) and came with a two-way tailgate rather than the clamshell of 1971–76 models. A fuel economy gauge was optional.|$|R
30|$|The {{available}} database {{is enormous}} {{but should be}} regarded inhomogeneous and, for some parts, as questionable. Some studies are based on modeled data (virtual cars), some on laboratory measurements with isolated engines, and some based on unified test schemes about actually driving the car. Some measurements were performed on laboratory test stands, others on real streets. They are also based on cars with various <b>curb</b> <b>weights.</b> Accordingly, there are strongly deviating results: Sullivan et al. [30], for example, resumed that, by 2015, diesel-driven cars will (still) have 14 % to 27 % less CO 2 emission due to a higher TTW efficiency, compared to petrol-fuelled cars and based on German certification data. But in reality, consumers preferred bigger motorization than modeled. A comparison by a German non-governmental organization revealed that certified CO 2 emissions of new diesel cars on German streets increased since 2000 and coincided with falling CO 2 emissions of new petrol-fuelled cars at 173 g CO 2 /km in 2006 (reviewed by Helmers [1]).|$|R
50|$|The Manta Mirage was a {{mid-engined}} vehicle produced by Manta Cars, owned by brothers Brad and Tim LoVette, in Costa Mesa, California* from 1974 to 1986. The Mirage, originally {{referred to as}} just the 'Manta', or the 'Manta Can-Am', was a light-weight road-legal car, based loosely on the McLaren M8 Can-Am racing car. The Mirage's steel space frame chassis was fitted with a high-output V8 engine and 4-speed transaxle. Most Mirages were equipped with 327 cu. in. (5.4 L) or 350 cu. in. (5.7 L) Chevrolet small block V8 engines, though some used 454 cu. in. (7.4 L) or 460 cu. in. (7.5 L) V8 engines. The original Mirage design mated the Chevy V8 to a Corvair transaxle via a Kelmark adapter and remote shifter. The bodywork was all hand-laid fiberglass, pre-colored {{in a range of}} gel-coat colors. Gull-wing doors were fitted to a removable top section, while the doors flip forward for entry.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a formula was {{specifically}} designed for the nutritional support of tube-fed elderly patients (Elderly-Specific Formula [ESF], Nestlé, Switzerland). It was tested against a standard formula (Sondalis Iso [SI], Nestle ́ Clinical Nutrition, Marne la Vallée, France) in sixteen 22 -month-old Sprague Dawley rats fed by total continuous enteral infusion for 7 days. Body weight, stool weight, and nitrogen balance were measured daily. After death, muscle weight, plasma levels of amino acids, tissue protein, and amino acid content were measured. The ESF <b>curbed</b> <b>weight</b> loss, improved cumulative nitrogen balance, and increased jejunum protein content. Plasma levels of threonine, leucine, and isoleucine and the sum of total amino acids were higher in ESF-fed than in SF-fed rats.

40|$|Over {{the past}} quarter century obesity has reached {{epidemic}} proportions in many developed countries. Exercise is one of the behavioral approaches to <b>curbing</b> <b>weight</b> gain or losing body fat. We reviewed the data on (1) magnitude of weight and fat loss when exercise is implemented without any changes in food intake, (2) necessary volumes and intensities of exercise to accomplish and sustain weight and fat loss, (3) effects of obesity on spontaneous physical activity and other forms of energy expenditure, (4) effects of obesity and aerobic fitness on the capacity to oxidize fat, and (5) the effects of exercise on the appetite. When ex-ercise is implemented without any changes in food intake, a daily expenditure of 400 Kcal produces a fat loss that is about one third of that expected on the basis of caloric deficit incurred by exercise. Oxidation of fat is negatively influenced by exercise intensity so that for an appreciable fat loss it would be necessary to exercise for long periods of time. Genetics and low aerobic fitness can also play a negative role. Obesity is associated with low levels of spontaneous physical activity and reduced capacity to oxidize fat. Aerobic training can enhance the capacity to oxidize fat by increasing the volume and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscles. Exercise is associated with short-term suppression of hunger and a failure to compensate for exercise energy expenditure during the hours to several days following exercise. Exercise is advisable as an approach toward fat loss, even more so when it is associated with dietary restraint, because it improves fat oxidation, saves lean body mass, and does not immediately stimulate hunger. Key words: exercise intensity, food intake reduction, energy expenditure, aerobic fitness, fat oxidation, genetics, short-term suppression of hunger, lean body mas...|$|R

30|$|Over {{the last}} year and a half, a new {{approach}} has been adopted by some American commissions that allows for an early weigh-in process [42, 43] to give athletes more time to rehydrate before the commencement of the bout in an effort to decrease the aforementioned dehydration risks. Specifically, this new weigh-in procedure offers athletes several more hours than the customary 24  h prior to competition in which to rehydrate. The California State Athlete Commission in May 2017 passed a 10 -point weight-cutting regulation [38] that endorsed the extended rehydration period and proposed several recommendations to <b>curb</b> extreme <b>weight</b> cutting. Alternatively, One Championship has implemented a much more progressive approach to prevent extreme weight cutting [44]. An athlete’s competing weight class is assigned by One Championship based upon their current walking weight and daily training weights. Once the competition weight class has been established, the athlete cannot alter their weight class fewer than 8  weeks prior to the event and One Championship can conduct random weight checks leading up to the event. These two approaches highlight very different interventions—one that tries to reverse the effects of extreme weight cutting and the other that tries to prevent extreme weight cutting from occurring. Intuitively, the longitudinal approach offers a means to reframe the weigh-in process and mitigate extreme weight-cutting practices. However, the adoption of such a process will need to overcome imbedded weight-cutting practices in MMA culture and will require consistent support from the sanctioning and promotional organizations in which the athletes are competing. Beyond the initiation of any new weigh-in practice, there should be further efforts to scientifically validate the need for such measures and subsequent investigation to show that the new practice is creating a healthier or safer process of the athlete.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} {{guardrail}} {{would not be}} able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of <b>curb</b> or dike, <b>weight</b> of impacting vehicle, distance from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact. Guardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment. Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks.|$|R
