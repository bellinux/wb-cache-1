The second phase consisted of individual semi-structured interviews with cancer patients to assess their attitudes towards cancer, its management and enrolment into cancer <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> Results Ninety-four patients responded to the survey giving a response rate of 22. 1 %. Three quarters of respondents stated that they would be willing to participate in a <b>clinical</b> <b>trial.</b> The factors that most influenced older patients' willingness to participate in a cancer study were recommendations from a cancer doctor and the chance that the study treatment may help them feel better.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionBecause “real-life” {{patients}} {{often do}} not meet the strict eligibility criteria of <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> we assessed the trial eligibility of patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in routine practice and compared the survival of “trial-ineligible” and potentially “trial-eligible” patients. Patients and MethodsThe present prospective, multicenter German cohort study is recruiting patients from 110 oncology/urology outpatient centers and hospitals at initiation of systemic first-line treatment. The demographic, clinical, treatment, and survival data were collected. We defined patients as “trial-ineligible” when ≥ 1 exclusion criterion (Karnofsky performance status < 80 %, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, non–clear cell carcinoma histology) was documented. Otherwise, the patients were considered “trial-eligible”. ResultsOf 732 patients included, 57 % were classified as “trial-ineligible”. Overall, the median first-line progression-free survival (PFS) was 7. 9 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 6. 9 - 8. 9 months). The median first-line PFS of “trial-eligible” and “trial-ineligible” patients was 11. 0 months (95 % CI, 9. 6 - 13. 1 months) and 5. 3 months (95 % CI, 4. 6 - 6. 5 months), respectively. The median OS of the “trial-eligible” and “trial-ineligible” patients was 26. 0 months (95 % CI, 22. 1 - 29. 7 months) and 12. 6 months (95 % CI, 10. 6 - 15. 8 months), respectively. ConclusionOur data suggest that patients in routine practice differ from patients treated in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> and that almost 60 % of mRCC patients in German routine practice would be ineligible for participation in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> While their first-line PFS and OS were shorter than those of “trial-eligible” patients, the PFS and OS of “trial-eligible” patients were comparable with the results from <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> <b>Physicians</b> should be aware of these differences when discussing treatment options and outcome expectations with patients...|$|R

Although the efficacy of warfarin in both prevention and treatment of thrombosis has been demonstrated in numerous randomized clinical studies, {{one of the major}} concerns that remains is the risk of bleeding. Although the net benefit of warfarin has been demonstrated in large <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> <b>physicians</b> and patients alike are often reluctant to use warfarin because of the bleeding risk. Bleeding in patients on warfarin is generally minor requiring no intervention, but the development of a major bleeding complication is associated with significant morbidity and can even be fatal. Numerous risk factors that increase the probability of having a hemorrhage while on warfarin have been identified, and bleeding risk scores have been developed. Various strategies to reduce bleeding risks have been developed and have become more important, since the use of warfarin and other anticoagulants continues to increase. This paper provides a concise review of bleeding risk factors, while outlining recommendations both physician and patients can incorporate to help reduce the risk of bleeding.

40|$|Endoscopic therapies {{aimed to}} reduce {{gastroesophageal}} reflux have gained an enormous enthusiasm {{during the last}} 5 years when several of them were approved by the regulatory agencies and released on the market. These novel therapies comprise 3 types of techniques: injection/bulking, plicating/suturing and radiofrequency thermal injury. Open-labelled trials performed on proton pump inhibitors-responding patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms have shown an improvement in reflux symptoms during short term follow-up. Longer-term data are now available and show disappointing results with partial-thickness plications of the cardia. Randomized sham-controlled trials, which are essential to proof the efficacy of GERD endotherapy because of a known high placebo effect {{in the management of}} GERD patients, have been conducted, one with radiofrequency and one with polymer injection, and have confirmed the clinical efficacy of both techniques, although the clinical benefit was less impressive than suggested in open-labelled trials. While mechanistic studies have suggested that the compliance of the gastroesophageal junction might be altered by GERD endotherapy, objective assessment of acid reflux with ambulatory pH-metry has shown, however, minimal or no modification by the treatment. Concerns about the safety of these new techniques have raised when complications were reported as the number of treated cases increased. Currently, no definite indication is established for each technique, but numerous potential indications exist and should be addressed in the setting of carefully designed <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> <b>Physicians</b> should be patient and wait for proof of efficacy and safety of these techniques before using them in their clinical practice. Specific and extensive warning should be obtained before starting clinical application. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical view of endoscopic therapy in GERD management.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart {{failure is}} a serious, common, and growing problem. Hospital admissions, {{which account for}} the bulk of health service costs {{associated}} with heart failure, are becoming more frequent. AIM: To determine whether management of heart failure differs by age and sex. METHOD: A retrospective case note review of prevalent cases in 16 general practices in West London. Five hundred and eighty-three patients (57 % women) with a diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean age of patients with heart failure was 78 years (SD = 9. 5) [...] 74 years at diagnosis (SD = 10) [...] and was higher for women than men (76 years versus 71 years, P < 0. 001). In 32 % of patients there was no record of a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram to support diagnosis. Echocardiography, performed in 34 % of patients, was less likely in older patients in both sexes (test for trend P = 0. 04 in women and 0. 02 in men) and, overall, in women (29 % compared with 40 % of men, P = 0. 006). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, recorded in 54 % of patients, decreased with age in both sexes (P < 0. 001) and, on unadjusted data, was more likely in men than in women (61 % compared with 49 %, P = 0. 005). On adjustment for age, sex differences in the use of echocardiography and ACE inhibitors were reduced and no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing age, men and women with heart failure were less likely to have undergone echocardiography or to have received an ACE inhibitor. When account was taken of age, there were no statistically significant sex differences in management; however, because of the demographic distribution of heart failure, women are disproportionately affected by age differences in management. <b>Clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> <b>physician</b> practice, and service developments in heart failure have neglected older people.

Luckily for Phipps, Jenner’s idea did not prove fatal: cowpox exposure did offer smallpox protection. When the Royal Society of London declined to publish his findings, Jenner simply turned to more pediatric subjects to prove his point. As legend has it, this included his own infant son [1].

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether the {{immediate}} availability of serum markers would increase the appropriate use of thrombolytic therapy. BACKGROUNDSerum markers such as myoglobin and creatine kinase, MB fraction (CK-MB) are effective in detecting acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency setting. Appropriate candidates for thrombolytic therapy are not always identified in the emergency department (ED), as 20 % to 30 % of eligible patients go untreated, representing 10 % to 15 % of all patients with AMI. Patients presenting with chest pain consistent with acute coronary syndrome were evaluated in the EDs of 12 hospitals throughout North America. METHODSIn this randomized, controlled <b>clinical</b> <b>trial,</b> <b>physicians</b> received either the immediate myoglobin/CK-MB results at 0 and 1 h after enrollment (stat) or conventional reporting of myoglobin/CK-MB 3 h or more after hospital admission (control). The primary end point was the comparison of the proportion of patients within the stat group versus control group who received appropriate thrombolytic therapy. Secondary end points included the emergent use of any reperfusion treatment in both groups, initial hospital disposition of patients (coronary care unit, monitor or nonmonitor beds) and the proportion of patients appropriately discharged from the ED. RESULTSOf 6, 352 patients enrolled, 814 (12. 8 %) were diagnosed as having AMI. For patients having AMI, there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients treated with thrombolytic therapy between the stat and control groups (15. 1 % vs. 17. 1 %, p = 0. 45). When only patients with ST segment elevation on their initial electrocardiogram were compared, there were still no significant differences between the groups. Also, there was no difference in the hospital placement of patients in critical care and non–critical care beds. The availability of early markers was associated with more hospital admissions as compared to the control group, as the number of patients discharged from the ED was decreased in the stat versus control groups (28. 4 % vs. 31. 5 %, p = 0. 023). CONCLUSIONSThe availability of 0 - and 1 -h myoglobin and CK-MB results after ED evaluation had no effect on the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients presenting with AMI, and it slightly increased the number of patients admitted to the hospital who had no evidence of acute myocardial necrosis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effectiveness}} of statin therapy {{in a real}} life setting may differ from that in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> as <b>physicians</b> make non-randomised treatment decisions for patients with less uniform and possibly different characteristics. We therefore performed a study to compare the {{effectiveness of}} different statins and doses in routine clinical practice with respect to total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and goal attainment according to European guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Naive statin users starting treatment in 2003 and 2004 with LDL-C measurements at baseline and between 30 and 365 days after start of treatment were extracted from the PHARMO database. During treatment with their initial statin dose LDL-C reduction and attainment of cholesterol goals were compared between different statins and doses. RESULTS: Of 2303 identified naive patients, approximately 30 % were allocated to the high CVD-risk group. Average LDL-C reductions were 48 %, 42 %, 39 %, and 32 % at mean doses of 11 mg rosuvastatin, 17 mg atorvastatin, 22 mg simvastatin and 35 mg pravastatin, respectively. The proportion of patients attaining cholesterol goals was 75 % for rosuvastatin, 68 % for atorvastatin, 56 % for simvastatin, and 42 % for pravastatin. Dose comparisons showed greater LDL-C reduction and increased goal attainment for rosuvastatin 10 mg compared to other statins at most doses (adjusted p < 0. 05).

40|$|The use of {{pulmonary}} artery flow-directed catheters has assumed epidemic proportions without <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> establishing improved outcome {{as a result}} of their use. During the past 10 years, however, it has become clear that improved outcome is found only in small groups of patients and that use of these catheters is associated with considerable risks of morbidity and mortality. A <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> is urgently needed to assess the balance between risks and benefits. While awaiting such <b>trials,</b> <b>physicians</b> should limit catheter use to circumstances in which there is a large probability that the data will result in more effective management; the measurements should only be used to answer specific questions about patient therapy. This situation will occur in a relatively small number of patients...|$|R

Vitamin D 3 is liposoluble, so dietary fat could increase its oral absorption. Our {{aim was to}} compare serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] after the oral intake of cholecalciferol with a high- or low-fat meal. Methods. In a single-blind, parallel <b>clinical</b> <b>trial,</b> 32 healthy <b>physicians</b> {{were divided into two}} groups. In the same day, they ingested 50, 000 IU (1. 25 mg) of vitamin D 3 with food: group 1 (G 1) : lipids: 25. 6 g and group 2 (G 2) lipids: 1. 7 g. Serum 25 (OH) D (0, 7, and 14 days), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium (0 and 14 days) were measured. Results. Baseline mean serum 25 (OH) D levels were 42. 7 ± 19. 0 nmol/L in G 1 and 36. 4 ± 19. 0 nmol/L in G 2 (P = 0. 38). After cholecalciferol, mean serum 25 (OH) D was higher in G...|$|R
40|$|The {{cure for}} the headache] {{was a kind of}} leaf, which {{required}} to be accompanied by a charm, and if a person would repeat the charm {{at the same time that}} he used the cure, he would be made whole; but that without the charm the leaf would be of no avail. ” 5 —Socrates, according to Plato 5 The above quote is by a famous western philosopher, Plato. This quote reflects the general setting of a <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> where a new drug (treatment group) is tested against a placebo group to measure the efficacy of the drug. The leaf represents a new drug, which can be the treatment group. The charm can be either a placebo controlled or a standard controlled group [...] in this case a placebo controlled group. Now putting everything into a big picture, we can interpret the quote by saying that without the placebo group the active treatment for the headache has no meaningful purpose. In other words the validity of the experiment is questionable and insignificant. So what is placebo and placebo effect? What is the significance of having a placebo controlled trial? And at last, why is the placebo group so important in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials?</b> Traditionally the <b>physicians</b> used to give an inert substance made out of sugar, called placebo, t...|$|R
40|$|Wernicke-Korsakoff {{syndrome}} (WKS) is {{a disorder}} {{of the brain}} caused by a deficiency of vitamin B 1 (thiamine). It is characterised by an acute onset of {{some or all of}} an eye movement disorder, lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movement (ataxia) and confusion. Patients may die in the acute phase, and many survivors go on to develop permanent memory impairment. Alcohol abuse is an important cause of WKS, although {{it is not the only}} consideration. Heavy drinking may lead to particular problems with uptake of thiamine from the diet. When recognised, WKS is treated with thiamine, but it is not clear how effective this is, particularly in managing the mental features. Recommendations about dosage and duration of thiamine treatment are acknowledged to be arbitrary. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing thiamine with placebo or alternative treatments, or comparing different thiamine treatments. Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria, but one reported no data that we could analyse, and analysis of the other study was limited by shortcomings in design and in presentation of the results. Therefore no good evidence could be derived from randomised controlled <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> to help <b>physicians</b> choose the right dose, frequency, route or duration of thiamine treatment for preventing or treating WKS due to alcohol abuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (rHuEPO) {{has proven to be}} a major advance in the therapeutic options available for managing anemia in cancer patients. The results of placebo-controlled <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> and large, community-based, open-label studies have confirmed that epoetin alfa, a recombinant human erythropoietin, significantly reduces transfusion requirements, and reliably increases hemoglobin (Hb) levels in anemic (Hb level < 12 g/dl) cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Increased Hb improves patients' energy level and their ability to perform the activities of daily living, as well as their overall quality of life (QOL). These findings are independent of tumor type and disease status and are comparable in patients receiving nonplatinum- and platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Furthermore, more than a decade of use in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> and by <b>physicians</b> in routine clinical practice has demonstrated that epoetin alfa is safe and well tolerated when used to treat cancer patients with anemia. The availability of epoetin alfa as an alternative to transfusion has changed practices in anemia management; physicians can now treat anemia with the goal of achieving adequate Hb levels to relieve anemia-related fatigue, a major symptom contributing to decreased QOL in cancer patients. Incremental benefit analysis has shown that increasing Hb level from 11 g/dl to 12 g/dl yields the greatest improvement in QOL per 1 g/dl increase in Hb. The demonstrated efficacy of epoetin alfa for increasing Hb levels and improving patient QOL have made this agent a rationale choice for management of cancer-related anemia. Ongoing research will continue to provide new insights into best management of anemia with epoetin alfa in cancer patients. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG...|$|R
40|$|Summary Introduction: Patients who are {{treating}} cancer have often used alternative therapies. In the internet era, {{information can be}} broadcasted widely, and this happened with phosphoethanolamine in Brazil, where this substance was claimed by the population to be the "cure for cancer. " Method: This is a cross-sectional study developed by the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology (SBOC). An objectively structured questionnaire was sent by e-mail and SMS to active MDs members of the SBOC. Descriptive statistics {{was used to evaluate}} the data. Statistical significance between the variables was tested by Pearson's Chi-squared test (p< 0. 05 was considered significance). Results: The survey was sent to 1, 072 oncologists, and 398 (37. 1 %) answered at least part of it. One hundred and fifteen (28. 9 %) had followed patients who had used phosphoethanolamine. Among these, 14 (12. 2 %) observed adverse events and four (3. 5 %) attributed clinical benefit to the substance. Most of the oncologists (n= 331; 83. 2 %) believe that it should only be used as part of a <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> protocol. Most <b>physicians</b> did not recommend this drug to their patients (n= 311; 78. 1 %). Oncologists in Southeast, South and Midwest Brazil {{were more likely to have}} patients taking the drug compared to the Northern and Northeastern regions. Conclusion: This is the first survey to assess the opinion and experience of oncologists about this alternative therapy. Most oncologists in Brazil do not believe that synthetic phosphoethanolamine is active in cancer treatment, do not recommend its use without proper evaluation, and state that it should only be available to patients in the context of <b>clinical</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{incorporate}} meaningful Interprofessional Education (IPE) into a core didactic oncology {{course by}} bringing {{into the classroom}} a series of cancer specialist physicians, from around the United States, who instructed from and discussed their own <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> MethodsThe instructor recruited physicians from selected nationwide cancer centers {{as well as from}} more regional institutions. Prior to each IPE session, students pre-read relevant trials or other materials. At an arranged time, an approximately 30 -minute Skype™ session began which included student questions. Assessments of student learning included individual examinations and a group trial. Survey data was also collected on student views of interprofessionalism, cancer trial informatics and the role of pharmacists on <b>trial</b> teams. ResultsGroup <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> showed substantial student creativity and achievement of new skills in trial design. Essays indicated that students learned as individuals. Survey data showed that prior to the interprofessional sessions, students felt uncomfortable discussing trial designs/results with graduates of other health professions. Following the sessions and group trial assignment, students gained significant confidence discussing <b>trials</b> with <b>physicians</b> and felt increased recognition for the pharmacist’s role in the trial team and increased appreciation for the perspective of <b>trial</b> <b>physicians.</b> Students reported that they enjoyed the opportunity to talk with top cancer physicians. ConclusionsDidactic core courses can be modified to accommodate meaningful interprofessional team education. Considerable time was required to arrange external Skype™ speakers; however, this IPE oncology exercise was very highly rated by students indicating that this was preparatory time well-invested...|$|R
50|$|As {{performance}} measurement is a core {{component of the}} HIF, {{it needs to be}} robust across different products and in diverse settings. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IGH will perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. The HIF would expand assessment beyond pre-approval <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical <b>trials,</b> <b>physician</b> surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed HIF mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for-performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale.|$|R
