5|$|Bennett edited {{some of the}} {{keyboard}} works of Beethoven and Handel and co-edited the Chorale Book for England with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns collected by Catherine Winkworth. He supervised the first British printed edition of the St Matthew Passion. A full vocal score (with piano accompaniment) was adapted from the German edition prepared by Adolf Bernhard Marx (Berlin 1830), which followed Mendelssohn's revival of the work; this was revised {{with reference to the}} score published by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett's additional tempo and dynamic markings were shown in parentheses for distinction. He provided harmonies for the figured bass both in the solo music sections (based on the Leipzig full score) and elsewhere. Bennett also produced editions of Bach's The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> and Handel's masque Acis and Galatea.|$|E
25|$|Sviatoslav Richter {{recorded}} Bach's Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> on a Bösendorfer at Salzburg in two {{settings of}} 1972 and 1973.|$|E
25|$|He often {{spent much}} time at the <b>clavier,</b> picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his {{pleasure}} showed that it sounded good.... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the <b>clavier....</b> He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time.... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.|$|E
25|$|The Inventions and Sinfonias (BWV 772–801). These short two- and three-part contrapuntal {{works are}} {{arranged}} in the same chromatic order as The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> omitting some of the rarer keys. These pieces were intended by Bach for instructional purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Hail Mary, or Ave Maria in Latin, {{has been}} set to music {{numerous}} times. Among the most famous settings is the version by Charles Gounod (1859), adding melody and words to Johann Sebastian Bach's first prelude from The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{a second}} {{successful}} Kickstarter funded {{the creation of}} a new edition of Bach's Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b> Once again, the score underwent public review on MuseScore.com, and was recorded by Kimiko Ishizaka, with both score and recordings released into the public domain in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1735 Bach {{started to}} prepare his first {{publication}} of organ music, which was printed as third Clavier-Übung in 1739. From around that year {{he started to}} compile and compose the set of preludes and fugues for harpsichord that would become his second book of The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peter Quince at the <b>Clavier,</b> {{a setting}} of the poem by Wallace Stevens, was {{commissioned}} by Pennsylvania State University {{in honor of the}} state's tercentenary (both Stevens and Argento are Pennsylvania natives.) For the Dale Warland Singers, Argento wrote I Hate and I Love (1981), with text by Catullus, and Walden Pond (1996), based on excerpts from Thoreau.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{published}} or carefully compiled in manuscript many {{collections of}} pieces that explored {{the range of}} artistic and technical possibilities inherent in almost every genre of his time except opera. For example, The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> comprises two books, each of which presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key, displaying a dizzying variety of structural, contrapuntal and fugal techniques.|$|E
25|$|Bach's {{most famous}} fugues are {{those for the}} {{harpsichord}} in The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> which many composers and theorists look at as the greatest model of fugue. The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> comprises two volumes written in different times of Bach's life, each comprising 24 prelude and fugue pairs, one for each major and minor key. Bach is also known for his organ fugues, which are usually preceded by a prelude or toccata. The Art of Fugue, BWV 1080, {{is a collection of}} fugues (and four canons) on a single theme that is gradually transformed as the cycle progresses. Bach also wrote smaller single fugues, and put fugal sections or movements into many of his more general works. J. S. Bach's influence extended forward through his son C.P.E. Bach and through the theorist Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg (1718–1795) whose Abhandlung von der Fuge ("Treatise on the fugue", 1753) was largely based on J. S. Bach's work.|$|E
25|$|One of Gould's {{performances}} of the Prelude and Fugue in C major from Book II of The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> was chosen for inclusion on the NASA Voyager Golden Record by a committee headed by Carl Sagan. The disc of recordings {{was placed on the}} spacecraft Voyager 1, which is now approaching interstellar space and is the farthest man-made object from Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{theories}} surrounding equal temperament {{began to}} be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the meantone system, common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in colored hearing {{dates back to}} Greek antiquity, when philosophers asked if the color (chroia, {{what we now call}} timbre) of music was a quantifiable quality. Isaac Newton proposed that musical tones and color tones shared common frequencies, as did Goethe in his book Theory of Colours. There is a long history of building color organs such as the <b>clavier</b> à lumières on which to perform colored music in concert halls.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, Barenboim had widened his concert repertoire, {{performing}} works by baroque {{as well as}} twentieth-century classical composers. Examples include: J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> (which he has played since childhood) and Goldberg Variations, Albeniz's Iberia, and Debussy's Préludes. In addition, he turned to other musical genres, such as jazz, and the folk music of his birthplace, Argentina. He conducted the 2006 New Year's Eve concert in Buenos Aires, in which tangos were played.|$|E
25|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Anna Magdalena Bach composed several musical pieces bearing her husband's name: Professor Martin Jarvis of the School of Music at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia, claims that she composed the famed six cello suites (BWV 10071012) and was involved with the composition of the aria from the Goldberg Variations (BWV 988) and the opening prelude of The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b> These ideas were also made into a TV documentary Written by Mrs Bach.|$|E
25|$|Debussy's {{influences}} were wide-ranging. He {{acquired a}} taste for parallel motion in fifths, fourths and octaves from medieval music, and an appreciation for figuration and arabesque from the Baroque masters. He especially had a great love for the French <b>clavier</b> composers Couperin and Rameau, as well as J. S. Bach. Chopin and Liszt were also powerful influences, {{not only in terms}} of pianistic layout and harmonic ingenuity, but also because of their willingness to create new forms to accommodate their material.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{standard}} {{pitch range}} for the carillon. In general, a concert carillon {{will have a}} minimum of 48 bells. The range of any given instrument usually depends on funds available for the fabrication and installation of the instrument: more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. Older carillons can be transposing instruments, generally transposing upward. Most modern instruments sound at concert pitch. A carillon <b>clavier</b> has both a manual and a pedal keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Friedemann’s {{compositions}} {{include many}} church cantatas and instrumental works, {{of which the}} most notable are the fugues, polonaises and fantasias for <b>clavier,</b> and the duets for two flutes. He incorporated more elements of the contrapuntal style learned from his father {{than any of his}} three composer brothers, but his use of the style has an individualistic and improvisatory edge which endeared his work to musicians of the late 19th century, when there was something of a revival of his reputation.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing from}} a blind {{musician}} {{who contributed to}} the Open WTC Kickstarter, MuseScore set up new stretch funding goals to support making music notation more accessible to {{blind and visually impaired}} musicians. Though the top goal of automatically converting all scores in the MuseScore.com library to Braille was not funded, they did get funding to create Braille sheet music for both the Goldberg Variations and the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b> The digital files (for Braille terminal) are available for free download, like the standard scores.|$|E
25|$|When a tonal {{answer is}} used, it is {{customary}} for the exposition to alternate subjects (S) with answers (A), however, in some fugues this order is occasionally varied: e.g., see the SAAS arrangement of Fugue No. 1 in C Major, BWV 846, from the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> Book 1 by J. S. Bach. A brief codetta is often heard connecting the various {{statements of the}} subject and answer. This allows the music to run smoothly. The codetta, just as {{the other parts of}} the exposition, can be used {{throughout the rest of the}} fugue.|$|E
25|$|Tennis player Yannick Noah {{called to}} vote for Royal, while Sarkozy {{obtained}} the support of singers Johnny Hallyday, Mireille Mathieu and Faudel, of rapper Doc Gyneco, and former politician and current actor Bernard Tapie. He also {{had the support of}} actors Jean Reno and Christian <b>Clavier,</b> both residing in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Sarkozy was the mayor between 1983 and 2002 and of Gérard Depardieu. But also of industrialist Martin Bouygues, whose children attended the same school as Sarkozy's offspring. The humourist Dieudonné and the writer Alain Soral supported Jean-Marie Le Pen. Actress Juliette Binoche supported José Bové.|$|E
25|$|In 1785 {{the family}} moved to Bonn, where Reicha {{became a member of the}} Hofkapelle of Max Franz, Elector of Cologne, playing violin and second flute in the court {{orchestra}} under his uncle's direction. The young Beethoven entered the Hofkapelle as violist and organist in 1789 and Reicha befriended him; the two became lifelong friends. Christian Gottlob Neefe, one of the most important figures in the musical life of the city at the time, may well have instructed both Reicha and his gifted piano pupil Beethoven in composition and introduced them to the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b>|$|E
25|$|The major {{development}} {{taking place}} in Bach's time, and to which he contributed in no small way, was {{the development of a}} temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed to use these in all available keys (12 major and 12 minor), and which allowed modulating without retuning. Already his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation incomparable to any contemporary work this composition has been compared to, but the full expansion came with The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> using all keys, which Bach seems to have been developing from around 1720, with the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach as one of its earliest witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Further entries of {{the subject}} follow this initial exposition, either {{immediately}} (as for example in Fugue No. 1 in C major, BWV 846 of the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier),</b> or separated by episodes. Episodic material is always modulatory and is usually based upon some element heard in the exposition. Each episode has the primary function of transitioning for the next entry {{of the subject}} in a new key, and may also provide release from the strictness of form employed in the exposition, and middle-entries. André Gedalge states that the episode of the fugue is generally based {{on a series of}} imitations of the subject that have been fragmented.|$|E
25|$|Peterson taught {{piano and}} {{improvisation}} in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto {{for five years}} during the 1960s, but it closed because concert touring called him and his associates away, {{and it did not}} have government funding. Later, he mentored the York University jazz program and was the Chancellor of the entire university for several years in the early 1990s. He also published his original jazz piano etudes for practice. However, he asked his students to study the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> the Goldberg Variations, and The Art of Fugue, considering these piano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Pianists Benny Green and Oliver Jones were among his students.|$|E
25|$|Many of Reicha's string quartets are {{similarly}} advanced, and also anticipate numerous later developments. The eight Vienna string quartets (1801–5) are among {{his most important}} works. Though largely ignored since Reicha's death, they were highly influential during his lifetime and left their mark on the quartets of Beethoven and Schubert, much as Bach's Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> was ignored by the public but well-known to Beethoven and Chopin. Reicha also wrote prolifically for various kinds of ensembles other than wind quintets and string quartets, including violin sonatas, piano trios, horn trios, flute quartets, various works for solo wind or string instruments accompanied by strings, and works for voice. He also wrote in larger-scale genres, including at least eight known symphonies, seven operas, and choral works such as a Requiem.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th century Bach was {{primarily}} valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw {{the publication of}} some major Bach-biographies, {{and by the end}} of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals and websites exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including for instance the Air on the G String, and of recordings, for instance three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.|$|E
25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 19th century saw an {{increasing}} number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> was printed concurrently by Simrock (Germany), Nägeli (Switzerland) and Hoffmeister (Germany and Austria) in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott (BWV 80). In 1818, Hans Georg Nägeli called the Mass in B Minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he was inspired by the then-unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat.|$|E
25|$|The only {{carillon}} {{tower in}} the Philippines and in Southeast Asia that is manually {{played by a}} <b>clavier</b> or a wooden keyboard, the U.P. Carillon towers about 130 feet tall. The U.P. Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by National Artist Juan Nakpil, Conservatory of Music director Ramon Tapales and UP President Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower {{the grounds of the}} university. Several years later, on 1 August 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the U.P. Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four octaves were installed by the Dutch carilloneeur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the U.P. Alumni Association. These bells were forged by Van Bergen Co. in Netherlands and the largest of them weighs five tons, where the total cost of construction summed up to ₱200,000.|$|E
25|$|The excerpt below, bars 7–12 of J. S. Bach's Fugue no. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, {{from the}} Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> Book 1 {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} most of the characteristics described above. The fugue is for keyboard and in three voices, with regular countersubjects. This excerpt opens at last entry of the exposition: the subject is sounding in the bass, the first countersubject in the treble, while the middle-voice is stating a second version of the second countersubject, which concludes with the characteristic rhythm of the subject, and is always used together with the first version of the second countersubject. Following this an episode modulates from the tonic to the relative major by means of sequence, {{in the form of an}} accompanied canon at the fourth. Arrival in E-flat major is marked by a quasi perfect cadence across the barline, from the last quarter note beat of the first bar to the first beat of the second bar in the second system, and the first middle entry. Here Bach has altered countersubject 2 to accommodate the change of mode.|$|E
25|$|By 1793, Beethoven had {{established}} a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility, often playing the preludes and fugues of J. S. Bach's Well-Tempered <b>Clavier.</b> His friend Nikolaus Simrock had begun publishing his compositions; the first {{are believed to be}} a set of variations (WoO 66). By 1793, he {{had established}} a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact. Beethoven's first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, a concert in which he first performed one of his piano concertos. It is uncertain whether this was the First or Second. Documentary evidence is unclear, and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion (neither was completed or published for several years). Shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, Opus 1. These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky, and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the <b>clavier.</b> My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
25|$|Felix Mendelssohn {{significantly}} {{contributed to}} the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the StMatthew Passion, instrumental in setting off {{what has been called}} the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 40s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen über den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian musicologist Erwin Ratz {{argues that}} the formal {{organization}} of a fugue involves not only the arrangement of its theme and episodes, but also its harmonic structure. In particular, the exposition and coda tend to emphasize the tonic key, whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities. Ratz stressed, however, {{that this is the}} core, underlying form ("Urform") of the fugue, from which individual fugues may deviate. Thus it is to be noted that while certain related keys are more commonly explored in fugal development, the overall structure of a fugue does not limit its harmonic structure. For example, a fugue may not even explore the dominant, one of the most closely related keys to the tonic. Bach's Fugue in B major from book one of the Well Tempered <b>Clavier</b> explores the relative minor, the supertonic and the subdominant. This is unlike later forms such as the sonata, which clearly prescribes which keys are explored (typically the tonic and dominant in an ABA form). Then, many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether, and either use serial (pitch-oriented) rules, or (as the Kyrie/Christe in György Ligeti's Requiem, Witold Lutosławski works), use panchromatic or even denser harmonic spectra.|$|E
500|$|J. S. Bach: French suite no.5 BWV 816, English suite no.3 BWV 808, {{chromatic}} fantasia and fugue BWV 903 and preludes and fugues BWV 846, 876, 881 from The Well-Tempered <b>Clavier</b> (1992) ...|$|E
500|$|Fugue in A minor: This, {{like the}} other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Fauré {{composed}} {{at the start of}} his career, when he was a church organist in Rennes. They are both, in Koechlin's view [...] "in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered <b>Clavier,</b> and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery".|$|E
