25|$|There is no {{official}} state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support {{at least one}} of the three traditional denominations—Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant—with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> (up to 2.3%) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the <b>church</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Austria a colloquially called <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> (Kirchensteuer, officially called Kirchenbeitrag, i.e. church contribution) {{has to be}} paid {{by members}} of the Catholic and Protestant Church. It is levied by the churches {{themselves}} and not by the government. The obligation to pay <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1% (Catholic church) and 1.5% (Protestant church).|$|E

25|$|Members {{of state}} churches pay a <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> of between 1% and 2% of income, {{depending}} on the municipality. In addition, 2.55% of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, {{this right}} was further {{implemented}} through the Freedom of Religion Act.

25|$|Germany levies a <b>church</b> <b>tax,</b> on {{all persons}} declaring {{themselves}} to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared amongst Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the break}} with Rome, {{it was the}} Pope and general councils of the Church that decided doctrine.

25|$|There {{has never}} been a {{separate}} <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established Church of Greece, in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each diocese independently.|$|E

Grubišić criticized Church leadership on several occasions because of their profligacy. He believed that religious communities should be financed only by their members through <b>church</b> <b>tax,</b> praising the example of Germany.|$|E
25|$|In the Landtag, the SPD {{was able}} to extract some {{concessions}} {{from time to time}} in areas for which the assembly was responsible, such as education and social policy.

50|$|St. Martin's {{church in}} Mumpf is first {{mentioned}} in 1441. It was renovated and expanded in 1541 and in 1741 the choir was rebuilt.

25|$|Avoidance of the <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> (between 1 and 2 percent {{depending}} on location) {{has been a}} popular reason cited for defections from the Church. In 2010, the number of defections hit a record of 83,097, caused {{in part by the}} church's position that homosexuality is a sin. That position was made clear on a Finnish television discussion program concerning gay rights that was broadcast on 12 October 2010, in which church clergy and laymen were divided both for and against proposed legal amendments to increase LGBT rights.|$|E
25|$|Secularization has had {{its impact}} in Germany as {{elsewhere}} in Europe; nevertheless, 28.9% {{of the total population}} is Catholic (23.761 million people as of December 2015), down 4% compared to the year 2000. Before the 1990 unification of the Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), Catholics were 42% of the population of West Germany. What makes it easier to know religious statistics in Germany is that Christian taxpayers must declare their religious affiliation as <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> is deducted by the state to be passed on to the relevant church in the state where the taxpayer lives.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the year}} 2000, Sweden had a {{mandatory}} <b>church</b> <b>tax,</b> {{to be paid}} if one did belong to the Church of Sweden, which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths {{as well as the}} Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.|$|E

25|$|The {{ruling by}} Justice Isaac Parker, who {{happened}} to be a Unitarian, determined that not only did the separating church lose its claim on the church property, but it also lost its status as an established church. As congregations continued to defect to Unitarianism, the Dedham case increased conservative support for disestablishment. In 1833, the state constitution was amended to eliminate <b>church</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{particular}} problem was fund-raising. The Confessing Christians depended completely on offertories, since the official church bodies {{did not share}} their revenues from the contributions levied from the parishioners {{by way of a}} surcharge on the income tax (so-called <b>Church</b> <b>tax),</b> collected and then transferred by the state tax offices. To block any access to funds, in 1934 the Nazi government subjected any form of public money collection to state approval, which was regularly denied if Confessing Christians applied for it. So door-to-door collections became a dangerous, but necessary thing. In the parish of the Capernaum Congregation, never anybody denounced the collectors, while in other, particularly more rural parishes many a Confessing Christian cleric and layman or laywoman was denounced and subsequently taken to court.|$|E
2500|$|This opt-out is {{also used}} by members of [...] "free churches" [...] (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the <b>church</b> <b>tax,</b> from which the free churches do not benefit, {{in order to support}} their own church directly.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing the church is to retain the registered, tax-paying members (regardless of how often they attend services) to fund parishes and church agencies, especially its international relief organizations like Adveniat. German Roman Catholics, however, are divided over the issue of a compulsory <b>Church</b> <b>tax.</b> Under the tax an additional 8 percent to 9 percent of personal income tax is deducted at source by the German state from registered churchgoers (of Catholic and Protestant communities). [...] Although the tax provides the Catholic and Lutheran churches with an exact membership count and a net income of 5.6 billion euros (in 2008) which has helped make the German Roman Catholic Church one of the wealthiest in the world, it forces out or excommunicates Catholics who wish to retain membership but do not want to pay the tax. Many Catholics favour leaving the system intact because it pays the salaries of thousands of church employees and contributes to the work of aid agencies such as Caritas, among others. Other Catholics say members should not have to be forced out of the church or excommunicated simply because they don't want to pay the <b>Church</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Agreement has {{not been}} {{ratified}} because of problems with <b>Church</b> <b>taxes,</b> which had become {{very important for the}} Latin Church in the region. The non-implementation of the treaty, as well as the failure of the 1990s peace negotiations, was a disappointment in John Paul II's papacy. A related issue was the refusal by some Israeli governmental officials to grant visas to Church personnel.|$|R
50|$|The parish {{church in}} Holderbank is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 1275. It served as grave church for the Twingherren of Wildegg. They also held the rights to collect the <b>church</b> <b>taxes</b> until 1805 when they ceded those rights to the canton. After the Reformation, in 1565 the villages of Möriken and Wildegg became part of the Holderbank parish. In 1701-02 the present church was built by Samuel Jenner.|$|R
50|$|The {{status of}} Catholicism in Switzerland is {{complicated}} further by {{the existence of}} Landeskirchen (Roman Catholic cantonal churches), imposed by anti-clerical cantonal governments in the 19th century and organised along democratic lines and control the application of funds collected through <b>church</b> <b>taxes.</b> Most cantonally delineated Roman Catholic church bodies are members in their umbrella Roman Catholic Central Conference of Switzerland (RKZ, official names in link=no, link=no, link=no, link=no).|$|R

[...] It is divided into 27 dioceses, 7 of them with the rank of metropolitan sees. All the archbishops and bishops are members of the Conference of German Bishops. Due to a <b>church</b> <b>tax</b> compulsory for those who register civilly as Catholics, it is the wealthiest part of the Catholic Church in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Church</b> <b>tax</b> (Kirchensteuer) is {{compulsory}} in Germany {{for those}} confessing {{members of a}} particular religious group. It is deducted at the PAYE level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; Roman Catholic church may deny such as person a burial plot. [...] In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) {{in order to ensure}} proper tax withholding.|$|E

25|$|The jus patronatus (patronage right) {{consisted}} of jus presentandi, {{the right to}} propose clergy for a specific church, and later became jus vocandi, the right to appoint such clergy. Furthermore, the patron {{had the right to}} part of the <b>church</b> <b>taxes</b> and other income of the church. Jus patronatus did not have any relevance in Norway until after the 1640s, when a few noblemen began to receive it. This privilege was never widespread in the Kingdom.|$|R
