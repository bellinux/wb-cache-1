25|$|Paparrigopoulos, {{as well as}} Sp. Zampelios set {{the basis}} for the {{formation}} of national identity in modern Greek society. Besides, their work did not concern only a closed and restricted circle of specialists and academics. It was addressed to the society of their times, in order to strengthen their national self-knowledge. Besides, Paparrigopoulos' classes at the University, which constituted the raw material for the writing of his memorable History, were frequently published in Pandora magazine, of which he was the <b>co-publisher,</b> {{as well as in the}} Athenian Press. The term Greek-Christian which was devised for scientific purposes, functioned towards the same direction but did not remain a simple instrument of analysis in the hands of specialists. As this term appeared in mid-ninth century exactly, it became a canvass on which the ideology of the Greek state was developed and shaped. The content of education, the orientation of historical studies and the study of tradition (folklore) were organized on this basis. In addition, the Megali Idea (Greek Great Idea) which was nebulous until that time, acquired flesh and bones. The Byzantine Empire, which had now been acclaimed a cultural mold of the Greek state which was still small, became the model for its territorial expansion.|$|E

Polytron drew ire for the decision, which raised awareness for the business needs of indie developers. In July 2013, a year later, Microsoft announced {{that they no longer}} charged for patches, and Fish tweeted that Polytron's patch would take [...] "a couple of months".

Fish cited a lack of promotion and publicity, and poor advertising of the game on Microsoft's digital market.|$|E
