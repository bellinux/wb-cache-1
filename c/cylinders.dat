5|$|Side-mount <b>cylinders</b> are <b>cylinders</b> {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount <b>cylinders.</b> They {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with other side mounted stage, travel and/or decompression <b>cylinders</b> where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three <b>cylinders</b> on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E
5|$|Steel <b>cylinders</b> are {{manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial <b>cylinders.</b> The <b>cylinders</b> used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba <b>cylinders</b> up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed <b>cylinders</b> have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
50|$|A {{differential}} <b>cylinder</b> {{acts like}} a normal <b>cylinder</b> when pulling.

50|$|A {{consistent}} lockup {{is important}} to keep all these parts in line, and revolvers are prone to abuse that can damage these parts, adversely affecting the accuracy and even safety of the revolver. This lockup consists of two parts, the crane to frame lockup, and the <b>cylinder</b> bolt to <b>cylinder</b> lockup. Many swing-out <b>cylinder</b> revolvers only support the <b>cylinder</b> securely at the rear, and flipping the <b>cylinder</b> open and closed can bend the crane and prevent the <b>cylinder</b> from lining up parallel to the bore. The <b>cylinder</b> bolt, which engages the bottom of the <b>cylinder</b> through a slot in the frame, should provide a relatively tight lockup, and not drag the <b>cylinder</b> during rotation or pop loose when the hammer is cocked at a reasonable speed. Fanning a revolver can batter the <b>cylinder</b> bolt and prevent a solid lockup.|$|R

5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel <b>cylinders</b> are often used because they are denser than aluminium <b>cylinders.</b> They also often have a lower mass than aluminium <b>cylinders</b> with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel <b>cylinders</b> can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox <b>cylinders</b> are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving <b>cylinders</b> may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving <b>cylinders</b> are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to <b>cylinders</b> with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study is to measure the maximum static {{friction}} and dynamic friction in the actuation process of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> after TiO 2 nanoparticles are added to grease. The study makes an innovative design of a new measuring equipment of friction force, which can measure the friction force between the piston seal in pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> bore. The friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> bore directly affects the output dynamic property of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> motion. Friction force measuring system can measure the change of friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> bore under the condition with different operating speeds, and can analyze the relationship between friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> and output dynamic property of pneumatic <b>cylinder.</b> Such a friction force measuring equipment takes pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> as an output of motive force to drive the measurement of pneumatic <b>cylinder,</b> and uses load cell and draw-line encoder to measure the friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> bore and the motion speed. In the experiment, the friction forces of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> given with oil and without oil are measured respectively, achieving the friction force property of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> bore when being lubricated by nanogrease added with nanoparticles of different weight percentages (wt. %).

40|$|An {{experimental}} study was made about an elastically mounted <b>cylinder</b> {{exposed to a}} periodic fluid flow field. The corresponding analysis placed emphasis on the prediction of fluid lift forces and <b>cylinder</b> responses normal to the deterministic, sinusoidal oscillating flow. A <b>cylinder</b> model was driven sinusoidally in still fluid {{in order to give}} a relative sinusoidal motion between the fluid and <b>cylinder.</b> This experimental arrangement was selected due to both a simple implementation of experimental apparatus and a strict control of the input variables such as <b>cylinder</b> driving amplitude and frequency. The corresponding fluid lift forces and the <b>cylinder</b> response amplitude were measured for two different size <b>cylinder</b> models (D = 1 inch, and D = 2 inch) for various <b>cylinder</b> driving frequencies and amplitudes;For a stationary <b>cylinder</b> in an oscillating fluid flow, it is well-known that the fluid lift force is a function of Reynolds number;(DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] .

PLEASE SEE DAI);where U(,m) is the maximum fluid oscillating velocity, D is the <b>cylinder</b> diameter, (nu) is the fluid kinematic viscosity and A is the fluid oscillating amplitude;On the other hand, for an elastically mounted <b>cylinder,</b> the vortices generated behind <b>cylinder</b> model can excite the <b>cylinder</b> model and, in turn, the vibrating <b>cylinder</b> can affect the vortex formation and the fluid lift forces. It is believed that the fluid force estimation based on stationary <b>cylinder</b> data must be in error compared to the actual situation. In this experiment, {{it was found that the}} fluid lift forces and the <b>cylinder</b> response amplitudes for an elastically mounted <b>cylinder</b> can be explained and predicted using frequency ratios such as f(,n) /f(,d), f(,r) /f(,d), and f(,v) /f(,d), where f(,n) is the <b>cylinder</b> natural frequency, f(,r) is the <b>cylinder</b> response frequency in the y-direction, f(,v) is the vortex shedding frequency, and f(,d) is the <b>cylinder</b> driving (fluid oscillating) frequency, rather than the Reynolds and the Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. When f(,r) /f(,d) = f(,v) /f(,d) = f(,n) /f(,d) = integer, there occurs a sharp increase of the <b>cylinder</b> response amplitudes and the fluid lift forces. The measured fluid lift forces at this integer relationship region were found to be far greater than those corresponding to a stationary <b>cylinder</b> exposed to an oscillating flow field.

The {{change in}} flow {{characteristics}} downstream of a circular <b>cylinder</b> (inner <b>cylinder)</b> {{surrounded by a}} permeable <b>cylinder</b> (outer <b>cylinder)</b> made of a high porosity screen was investigated in shallow water using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. The diameter of the inner <b>cylinder,</b> outer <b>cylinder</b> and the water height were kept constant during the experiments as d = 50 mm, D = 100 mm and hw = 50 mm, respectively. The depth-averaged free stream velocity was also kept constant as U = 180 mm/s which corresponded to a Reynolds number of Red = 9000 based on the inner <b>cylinder</b> diameter. It was shown that the outer permeable <b>cylinder</b> had a substantial effect on the vortex formation and consequent vortex shedding downstream of the circular <b>cylinder,</b> especially in the near wake. The time averaged vorticity layers, streamlines and velocity vector field depict that {{the location of the}} interaction of vortices considerably changed by the presence of the outer <b>cylinder.</b> Turbulent statistics clearly demonstrated that in comparison to the natural <b>cylinder,</b> turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses decreased remarkably downstream of the inner <b>cylinder.</b> Moreover, spectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations showed that the vortex shedding frequency significantly reduced compared to the natural <b>cylinder</b> case. ...|$|R
