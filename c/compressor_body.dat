25|$|In an {{isothermal}} compression process, the {{gas in the}} system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate {{isothermal compression}} even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the <b>compressor</b> <b>body</b> itself.|$|E
40|$|A {{moving magnet}} type oil-free linear {{compressor}} {{has been designed}} for applications such as electronics cooling. A control system using a solenoid operated valve was developed for DC offset and axial clearance control. Operation of the linear compressor with a fixed clearance of 0. 8 mm was compared with a zero DC offset operation. The fixed clearance operation requires a higher power input. The mean piston position can be controlled by using a DC bias on the drive voltage or by using a bleed flow from the <b>compressor</b> <b>body</b> to the suction side of the compressor. Using a DC bias on the drive voltage induces a higher power loss than using a bleed flow {{when there is a}} small radial clearance between the piston and cylinder. This provides evidence that the piston control in a refrigeration system with capacity control should be for a zero DC offset using a bleed flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the results of {{performance}} analysis of a heat driven continuous vapor adsorption refrigerator with activated carbon as the adsorbent and 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetra. uoroethane (HFC- 134 a) as the refrigerant. A set of four adsorption cells takes on the role of the mechanical compressor in the conventional vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) system. Three specimens of activated charcoal under various packing densities were investigated. A parametric analysis was carried out with several evaporating,condensing/adsorbing and desorbing temperatures which are typical operating conditions catered to by HFC- 134 a. A new integrated relative performance evaluation scheme is proposed. It uses the maximum cycle uptake di. erence as a factor against which the coe. cient of performance (COP) and exergetic e. ciency are evaluated. It is shown that there is an optimal set of operating conditions wherein the exergetic e. ciency is the maximum.

40|$|A {{framework}} for effective computational methodology {{was developed for}} multi-stage compressor map generation. The methodology consists of using a few isolated-blade row Navier-Stokes solutions for each blade row to construct a body force database. The purpose of the body force database is to replace each blade row in a multi-stage <b>compressor</b> by a <b>body</b> force distribution to produce same pressure rise and flow turning. To do this, each body force database is generated {{in such a way}} that it can respond to the changes in local flow conditions. Once the database is generated, no further Navier-Stokes computations are necessary. The process is repeated for every blade row in the multi-stage <b>compressor.</b> The <b>body</b> forces are then embedded as source terms in an Euler solver. The method is developed to have the capability to compute the performance in a flow that has radial as well as circumferential non-uniformity with a length scale larger than a blade pitch; thus it can potentially be used to characterize the stability of a compressor under design. It is these two latter features as well as the procedure to obtain the body force representation that distinguish the present methodology from the streamline curvature method...|$|R
40|$|Indoor ice rinks use 1091 MWh {{per annum}} for ice hockey based on {{statistics}} from over 100 Swedish ice rinks (Stoppsladd, 2011). The refrigeration system contributes 35 to 75 %( (Rogstam, 2010) of total energy usage in ice rinks with average value of 43 % (Stoppsladd, 2010) for indoor to 75 % for outdoor ice rinks. The basic aim of {{project is to}} reduce energy consumption in Swedish ice rinks and scope is for indoor and outdoor ice rinks in cold and mild summer climatic conditions like Sweden. To achieve target of energy reduction in ice rinks actual heat loads on outdoor bandy ice rink are being estimated along with performance analysis of refrigeration machine. The refrigeration system, heat loads on ice surface and their correlation is studied and analyzed in detail for Norrtälje Outdoor bandy ice rink for four warm days and whole season 2010 - 2011. The tricky and significant task of validation of input climate data for accurate heat loads calculations is completed with Swedish Metrological & Hydrological (SMHI) climate model data, correlations and related web based geographical data. The heat loads (conductive, convective and radiant) on outdoor bandy ice rink are calculated through thermodynamic relations with validated input climate data and measurements where as refrigeration system performance is monitored and analyzed with ClimaCheck(CC) instrumentation. The average cooling capacity is calculated for four warm days by CC internal method and actual cooling energy produced is obtained by practically assumed COP of system with aid of MYCOM compressor software. The cooling capacity and heat loads on ice surface are compared and analyzed considering energy usage affecting parameters and weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and solar load. The convection and condensation are contributing 75 %, radiation 18 %, ice resurfacing 4 % and ground and header heat gain 3 % to total heat loads on ice sheet for whole season. The deviation between total cooling energy produced by refrigeration machine and total heat load energy is found 19 % and 27 % for four warm days and whole season 2010 - 2011. The deviation is due to overestimation of heat losses from <b>compressor’s</b> <b>body,</b> <b>compressor’s</b> on and off operations, overestimated radiation heat load due to unmeasured negative radiation and lack of actual ice resurfacing heat load evaluation. The developed model in MS Excel allows comparison of field climate data with SMHI model data, indoor and outdoor ice rinks in terms of predicted energy usage by refrigeration system and in total and acts as decision tool to choose for building an indoor/outdoor ice rink...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an examination of}} body force distributions in a single stage low speed <b>compressor.</b> The <b>body</b> force distributions are developed using two different computational procedures, an axisymmetric streamline curvature calculation and an unsteady, three-dimensional flow simulation. A two-dimensional body force representation {{is defined as a}} benchmark to evaluate the departures of the computed forces from two-dimensional behavior. The most important contribution to this departure (for both the streamline curvature calculation and the three-dimensional simulation) is identified as the change in streamtube height across the blade rows. The magnitude of the departures increase with blade loading and, for the compressor examined, are smaller than five per cent of the two-dimensional estimate at design but show values up to 50 per cent near stall. by Georg A.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} an axial <b>compressor</b> <b>body</b> force representation {{constructed from}} 3 D CFD calculations. The radial distribution of body forces {{is compared to}} that of a body force representation based on axisymmetric streamline curvature (SLC) calculations, and shown to be in qualitative agreement except {{in the vicinity of the}} blade tip. In terms of stall inception type and stall point, computations based on both representations exhibit agreement with rig test data. A parametric study is undertaken in which the magnitude of the forces in the blade tip region of both representations is reduced so as to obtain reductions in compressor pressure rise similar to those observed experimentally due to increased tip clearance. It is shown that on a back-to-back basis, a given change to the end wall forces produces similar effects on the computed stall point, whether the underlying body force representation derives from 3 D CFD or SLC. Based on this result one route to capturing effects of tip clearance on stall prediction can be the development of a tip clearance body force model for use in conjunction with SLC calculations. by Jonathan Kerner.

40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 100 Performance {{verification}} of centrifugal compressor rerates creates a unique challenge to turbomachinery users. It {{is not often}} practical to perform flange-to-flange performance tests on machinery already installed in the field, as the redundant instrumentation necessary to conduct a reliable test is rarely present onsite. In addition, rerated units are typically commissioned during a turnaround where time constraints do not allow the luxury of a test. In some cases, {{it may be possible}} to remove a relatively small <b>compressor</b> <b>body</b> from the site and shop test it. However, in almost all circumstances the cost associated with doing so is prohibitively expensive. This leaves the user faced with the dilemma of being uncertain of a rerated compressor's performance until it is actually run with the new process. A solution is proposed to the problem of performance verification for rerated centrifugal compressors. Single stage scale model testing of the aerodynamic elements that comprise a compressor stage is a proven method used by original equipment manufacturers in the development of new components. This practice may also be used to find the performance of aerodynamic elements intended to be used in compressor rerates. If the test proves successful, the design can be incorporated with a high degree of confidence that the equipment will operate as expected. After the rerate is complete, the performance can be verified through limited field testing. The details a single stage testing program as well as the independent field performance {{verification of}} four very different compressors are presented. Two of the units under consideration were single body. The other unit consisted of a two-body compressor train. The compressors under consideration were originally supplied by three different original equipment manufacturers. The full scale hardware consisted of impellers ranging in size from 17. 0 in to 43. 5 in in diameter. The scale factors used to model the aerodynamic stage ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 25. A total of seven different stages were single stage scale model tested between the three compressors. The limited field testing used only the existing instrumentation previously installed on the compressor trains. After the field variables were taken into account, it was found that the predicted performance was in good agreement with actual compressor operations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for {{the integration of}} blade row body forces, derived from axisymmetric and three- dimensional flow fields, {{for use in the}} stability analysis of axial <b>compressors.</b> The <b>body</b> force database represents the body forces {{as a function of the}} local flow coefficient times the overall flow coefficient; doing this overcomes a source of non-uniqueness in the representation. Stability calculations using body force databases from this methodology as well as from a legacy method, applied to axisymmetric streamline curvature calculations, are compared. A procedure for joining body forces extracted from axisymmetric and three-dimensional CFD calculations is presented along with an assessment of the sensitivity of the stall prediction and onset behavior to the shape of the body force curves. The slope of the body force curves near the point corresponding to peak pressure rise, as well as those near zero flow, are found to be important in determining the stall point and inception type. Comparisons to previous work and test data from a single stage research compressor are made. by Amish A. Patel. Thesis (S. M.)

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and tip out maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, <b>compressor,</b> throttle <b>body,</b> <b>compressor</b> recirculation valve and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, supercharger pulley, throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor recirculation valve (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured intake system noise reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|R
