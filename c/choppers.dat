5|$|Florida {{experienced}} a prolonged drought {{at the onset}} of the Early Archaic era that lasted until the Middle Archaic period. Although the population decreased overall on the peninsula, the use of tools increased significantly during this time.

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver <b>choppers</b> made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the <b>choppers</b> {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

50|$|With no {{confirmed}} {{sightings of}} <b>Chopper</b> since {{the news that}} he was heading into a hurricane, Mega-City One mourns {{the loss of a}} legend, and an old friend of <b>Chopper's</b> - WipeOut Jones - is sent to represent the city. The news of <b>Chopper's</b> demise is somewhat premature. As his board spirals down towards the stormy sea <b>Chopper</b> spies a lone ship and guides his board towards it. On board <b>Chopper</b> discovers that the only crew member is a paranoid and murderous robot chef called Cookie, who has a penchant for using his crew members as ingredients. <b>Chopper</b> disposes of Cookie after the insane robot tries to put <b>Chopper</b> on the menu. <b>Chopper's</b> board is badly damaged in the scuffle so takes control of the ship and heads to Oz by sea. Having repaired his board, <b>Chopper</b> ditches the ship 40 kilometres from the coast of Oz and completes the journey on his board. He arrives to a hero's welcome, but Dredd attempts to arrest him. The crowds protest but Dredd argues that <b>Chopper</b> cannot race as he missed the qualifying heats. The qualifying Surfers refuse to race unless <b>Chopper</b> is allowed to compete and Dredd is arrested by local Judges as not to cause a riot. The local authorities set <b>Chopper</b> up with a hotel room and donate to him a Bondi Special powerboard to replace his badly damaged Stratos 4 and he sets out to practice for the race with WipeOut Jones. It soon becomes apparent to <b>Chopper</b> that the Bondi Special powerboard doesn't suit his surfing style. On the day of the race WipeOut Jones offers <b>Chopper</b> his Stratos 4 powerboard stating that he (Jones) is merely there to make up the numbers and had no real chance of winning the race. Jug McKenzie taunts <b>Chopper</b> as the pair swap boards, claiming that <b>chopper</b> is clutching at straws.|$|R

5|$|Human {{settlements}} on Polish lands occurred {{later than}} in the more climatically hospitable regions of southern and western Europe and were dependent on the recurring episodes of glaciation. Gatherer-hunter Homo erectus campsites, together with their inhabitants' primitive stone tools (<b>choppers</b> and microliths), bones of the large mammals they hunted and the fish they caught, were found below the San River glaciation period sediments in Trzebnica and are about 500,000 years old. Younger sites related to the same species were found at Rusko near Strzegom, located, like Trzebnica, in the Lower Silesia region. This represents the microlithic complexes of the Lower Paleolithic period. Homo erectus, earlier known as Pithecanthropus erectus, was a species of early humans.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, <b>choppers,</b> and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of fast beam <b>chopper</b> is {{developed}} and tested. The <b>chopper</b> is basically a periodic beam energy transformer which performs 10 % modulation of beamâ€™s kinetic energy. The modulated fraction of the beam is chopped off by a downstream RFQ due to the relatively narrow injection energy window of the RFQ. The <b>chopper</b> uses magnetic-alloy cores and a fast high-voltage transistor switch {{in order to produce}} output voltage pulses with short rise- and fall-time and a good flat-top. The <b>chopper</b> system, that includes a <b>chopper</b> cavity and a pulsed power supply, is installed at the HIMAC facility. Test operations so far demonstrate that an efficient chopping can be obtained with this type of <b>chopper.</b> Capture experiments of the chopped beam at the HIMAC main-ring, as well as improvements of the <b>chopper</b> power supply, are on the way. ...|$|R
