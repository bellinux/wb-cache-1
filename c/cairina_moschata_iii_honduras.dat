Disease spread by flies costs farmers in the US alone an estimated $ 60 million a year. But researchers at the University of Guelph Ontario, carried out experiments on several local farms where pigs and cattle were being reared. Comparisons were made between rearing pens which had a four to five week-old muscovy duck placed in them and those without. They found that the Muscovy had {{reduced the number of}} flies by between 80 - 98 %. Females ducks, for some reason, devour houseflies three times more rapidly than the drakes.

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. regenti is {{analogous}} to that of human schistosomes. Adult flukes mate in a nasal mucosa of anatid birds (e.g. Anas platyrhynchos and <b>Cairina</b> <b>moschata)</b> and produce eggs with miracidia which hatch directly in the host tissue and leak outside when the bird is drinking/feeding. Once in water, the miracidia swim using their cilia and actively search for a proper molluscan intermediate host (Radix lagotis, Radix labiata, Radix peregra). In the snail, the miracidia develop into a primary sporocyst in which secondary sporocysts are formed and give rise to cercariae later on.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the productive performance of Sudani ducks (local breed) {{in comparison with}} Muscovy ducks (imported breed) this experiment was conducted during summer season in Egypt. A total number of 24 Sudani (<b>Cairina</b> <b>moschata)</b> and 24 Muscovy (<b>Cairina</b> <b>moschata)</b> ducklings (3 weeks old) were used in this study, to evaluate some productive traits including growth performance and carcass characteristics. The results revealed that body weight gain of Muscovy breed was significantly higher by 27. 22 % than Sudani breed at 3 - 12 weeks of age. Meanwhile, Muscovy ducklings consumed more feed at 3 - 12 weeks of age than Sudani breed. Feed conversion was better in Muscovy (4. 37) than Sudani (5. 25) ducks. The results also indicated that percentage of inedible parts and dressing and deboning percentage were approximately similar in both breeds. Percentage of giblets in Sudani ducks {{was significantly higher than}} in Muscovy, while percentage of carcass fat, breast and drumsticks were significantly higher in Muscovy compared to Sudani ducks. Moisture percentage was higher (p< 0. 05) while ether extract and ash percentages were lower (p< 0. 05) in breast and leg meat of Muscovy ducks as compared to Sudani ducks. Protein percentage in breast and leg meat was similar in the two breeds. It is concluded that Muscovy ducks had better productive performance than Sudani ducks. Moreover, Muscovy ducks had higher percentages of carcass fat, breast and drumsticks than Sudani ducks. Meat of Sudani ducks is characterized by its lower percentage of moisture with higher percentages of ether extract and ash than meat of Muscovy ducks...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the age- dependent development of non-shivering thermogenesis in ducklings reared either at thermoneutrality (25 °C) or in the cold (4 °C). Non-shivering thermogenesis was assessed weekly by simultaneously measuring whole body metabolic heat production and electromyographic activity during shivering at different temperatures ranging from 29 °C to 0 °C. We found that ducklings reared at thermoneutrality displayed a capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis during the ␣rst month of post-hatching life. This thermogenic mechanism increased further in ducklings chronically exposed to a cold environment, but it decreased over time when birds were kept in a thermoneutral environment...|$|R
