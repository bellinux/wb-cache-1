5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by David Fincher and was written by Beau Willimon, who has served as an aide to Charles Schumer, Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton. Independent studio Media Rights Capital purchased the rights to House of Cards, with the intent on creating a series.

Netflix, interested in launching their own original programming, outbid the networks, picking the series up for 26 episodes, totaling two seasons. Netflix was the only bidder that was interested in purchasing the rights without seeing a completed pilot. Thus, the show was not forced into manipulating story arcs introduced in the pilot to create artificial cliffhangers.|$|R

50|$|According to a 1985 {{news article}} written by Christopher Evans of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the game {{originated}} in Garner, Texas. Two local boys, William Thomas and Walter Earl, developed {{the game in}} response to a general disapproval of card-playing games held by many Protestants at that time. William and Walter were able to incorporate dominoes in their game, which mimicked the mechanics of a trick-taking <b>card</b> game like <b>pitch.</b> The game they developed, which was the precursor to today's 42, found acceptance since dominoes did not carry the negative stigma of card-playing. From there, the game spread throughout Texas.|$|R
50|$|Syndergaard rebounded {{after his}} rough start in Washington with a {{brilliant}} outing on July 3 against the Chicago Cubs. He went 7 innings, allowing just one run, and struck out 8 batters.

5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL Wild <b>Card</b> Game, Bumgarner <b>pitched</b> his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout {{to give him the}} most career complete game shutouts {{in the history of the}} Wild Card Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher to have more than one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|R
50|$|The Giants set up Madison Bumgarner {{to start}} Game 1 against Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright. After being retired in {{order in the}} 1st inning, the Giants loaded the bases in the 2nd with nobody out. Brandon Crawford struck out, then Travis Ishikawa blooped a single down the left-field line to give the Giants a 1-0 lead. With two outs, Gregor Blanco hit a hard ground ball to third-baseman Matt Carpenter that proved too hot to handle, and allowed a second run to score for the Giants. Brandon Belt added a third on a {{sacrifice}} fly in the 3rd inning, {{and that was to}} prove to be the final run of the contest. After Wainwright was forced to leave the game in the fifth inning due to his pitch count, the Cardinal bullpen shut the Giants line-up down the rest of the way. However, Bumgarner displayed the same form he had in the Wild <b>Card</b> game, <b>pitching</b> 7 shutout innings giving up just 4 hits (all singles), walking only 1 and striking out 7. Bumgarner set a postseason record for scoreless innings on the road, his streak standing at 26. Sergio Romo came in to finish the 8th inning, and Santiago Casilla closed out the game retiring the Cardinals in order in the 9th as the Giants won 3-0.|$|R
50|$|During the 2009 spring {{training}} camp, Motte competed with Ryan Franklin and Chris Perez {{in an attempt}} to earn the role as the Cardinals' 2009 closer; manager Tony La Russa later said he would not establish a closer. Instead, he would use a mix of relievers in the ninth inning. Motte was called on to save the first game. However, he gave up four runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the ninth inning. Pittsburgh won 6-4. After this blown save opportunity, La Russa moved Motte into a middle reliever role. Despite the blown the save on opening day and occasional rough outings that contributed to a 4.59 ERA, Motte recorded 14 holds. Motte became the Cardinals' de facto closer late in the 2011 season - La Russa still had not named him as the closer - helping his team win the Wild <b>Card.</b> Motte <b>pitched</b> in two games against the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which the Cardinals won the series 3 games to 2. Motte also pitched in three games in the 2011 National League Championship Series (NLCS) against St. Louis' division rival, the MIlwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals won this series in six games. Motte was on the mound for the final out of the NLCS winning the Cardinals their 18th pennant. He was also on the mound when the Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in the World Series.|$|R

5000|$|Sealo {{started off}} {{his career as}} a {{newspaper}} seller, then was discovered by freak scouters. He was a regular feature at Coney Island's freak show from circa 1920 to 1970 and was exaggerated as a human with a seal body on some promotional sideshow posters. Despite his genetic disability, Sealo was still able to carry out feats like sawing a crate in half and shaving with a straight razor on his own, as well as moulding animal figurines out of clay. His partner on-stage was Toby, a chimpanzee. Sealo had trouble getting up and down the performance stage due to his weak legs. He would spend the time in which he was not performing on stage selling <b>pitch</b> <b>cards.</b> After performing, he preferred resting at hotels to sleeping at the fairground.

40|$|Objectives: ‘Self Care’ cards play a {{significant}} role in delivering health education via community pharmacies in Australia and New Zealand. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether such an initiative could have a similar impact in an Irish context. The secondary objective was to understand the importance of health literacy to this initiative. Methods: Ten cards were developed for the Irish healthcare setting and trialed as a proof of concept study. The pilot study ran in ten community pharmacies in the greater Cork area for a six-month period. Using a mixed methods approach (Questionnaires & focus group) staff and patient reactions to the initiative were obtained. Concurrent to the pilot study, readability scores of cards (Flesch-Kincaid, Fry, SMOG methods) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) health literacy screening tool was administered to a sample of patients. Results: 88. 7 % of patient respondents (n= 53) liked the concept of the ‘Self Care’ cards and 83 % of respondents agreed that the use of the card was beneficial to their understanding of their ailment. Focus groups with Pharmacy staff highlighted the importance of appropriate training for the future development of this initiative. An emerging theme from designing the cards was health literacy. The pilot ‘Self Care’ <b>cards</b> were <b>pitched</b> at too high a literacy level for the general Irish public to understand as determined by readability score methods. It was found that 19. 1 % of a sample population (n= 199) was deemed to have low health literacy skills. Conclusion: The ‘Self Care’ initiative has the potential to be Pharmacy’s contribution to health education in Ireland. The initiative needs to be cognizant of the health literacy framework that equates the skills of individuals to the demands placed upon them...|$|R
40|$|Jim Hoy, {{professor}} of English at Emporia State University, has ridden and {{written about the}} Flint Hills region of east-central Kansas since the 1970 s. His earlier works include The Cattle Guard: Its History and Lore (1982), Prairie Poetry: Cowboy Verse of Kansas, with Vada Snider (1995), and a prequel to the present book, Cowboys and Kansas: Stories from the Tallgrass Prairie (1997). Hoy aptly describes his work as 2 ̆ 2 part memoir, part history, part ethnography. 2 ̆ 2 Moreover, 2 ̆ 2 this paean to the Flint Hills is my thanks to the land that has nurtured my life and nourished my soul. 2 ̆ 2 After introducing the reader to Flint Hills geology and sociology, Hoy rounds up his thirty chapters into five parts treating cowboys, cattle and horses, ranching, rodeo and other fun, and 2 ̆ 2 a rough country, 2 ̆ 2 the latter focused on criminals and crimes in the region. Each section blends bits of history (mostly without citations), folklore, tales (short, medium, and tall), poetry, and reminiscences {{from a wide range}} of Flint Hills inhabitants. Readers interested in any of the topics listed above anywhere in the Great Plains will profit by comparing their special region with Hoy 2 ̆ 7 s. For example, we learn that 2 ̆ 2 In the Flint Hills the farmer and cowboy can be, and often are, the same person. 2 ̆ 2 Sounds a bit different from the range wars that raged elsewhere between 2 ̆ 2 sodbusters, 2 ̆ 2 cattle ranchers, and sometimes sheep ranchers. We also get vignettes of celebrities of the past, including Casey Tibbs, Lucille Mulhall, Bill Pickett, and, of course, William Allen White. My favorite sections of the book describe frontier pastimes, such as the venerable <b>card</b> games of <b>pitch,</b> pond fishing, early rodeo, and, yes, polo during the 1920 s. Hoy also illuminates frontier dangers, such as prairie fires, conflicts, and the changes that gradually transformed the Flint Hills. Given his understandable boosterism, we can forgive him an occasional exaggeration, such as terming the region 2 ̆ 2 the best grazing land in the world. 2 ̆ 2 That honor surely would be contested by the rich pampas of Argentina. A few photographs, many more valuable for flavor than hard information, complement the text. After finishing Hoy 2 ̆ 7 s paean, many readers will likely pull out an atlas and ask, 2 ̆ 2 Now, where do I fly into to visit this strange and wondrous land? 2 ̆...|$|R
