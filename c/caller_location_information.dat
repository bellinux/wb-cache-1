Wireless E 911 technology provides emergency responders with the location and callback number of a person calling 911 from a mobile phone. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 called for GAO to study state and local use of funds collected {{for the purpose of}} wireless E 911 implementation. We are reporting on (1) the progress made in implementing wireless E 911 services throughout the country, (2) the states and localities that have established taxes, fees, or charges for wireless E 911 implementation, and (3) the states or localities that have used funds collected for the purposes of wireless E 911 for unrelated purposes. To address these issues, we surveyed state-level E 911 contacts on the collection and use of E 911 funds. Of the 51 state E 911 contacts (including the District of Columbia) who were asked to participate in our survey, we received 44 responses.

In 1994, working {{in cooperation with the}} emergency response agencies of Covington, KY, 911 Mapping Systems, Inc. founded in 1992 by Robert Graham Thomas Jr., implemented the first real-time on-screen E911 street map display to highlight the caller's position, nearest available emergency responders and other relevant information such as fire hydrants, hazardous materials and/or other data maintained by the city. Shortly thereafter, integrated mapping became a standard and integral part of all CAD systems and continues to evolve alongside 911 response technology. For Wireline E911, the location is an address. For Wireless E911, the location is a coordinate. Not all PSAPs have the Wireless and Wireline systems integrated.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{initiate}} an emergency communication to summon help when needed is regarded by the European Union {{as a right}} of all citizens and when emergency assistance is needed {{it is essential that}} emergency services organisations are able to determine the location of the caller {{with a high degree of}} confidence in the shortest possible period of time. High quality accurate and reliable <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> is vital for enabling the emergency services organisations to provide a timely response to an emergency incident. In order to achieve this objective in Europe, Article 26 (5) 1 of the Universal Service Directive requires Member States to ensure that “undertakings concerned make <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> available free of charge to the authority handling emergency calls as soon as the call reaches that authority”. Furthermore, competent regulatory authorities at the national level are required to “lay down criteria for accuracy and reliability of the <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> provided. ” This ECC Report provides an analysis of the caller location solutions available in order to implement the relevant legislative provisions of the Universal Service Directive by competent regulatory authorities in CEPT countries.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Although states faced challenges and delays in the past, states have made significant progress implementing wireless Enhanced 911 (E 911) since 2003. Wireless E 911 deployment usually proceeds through two phases: Phase I provides general <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> by identifying the cell tower or cell site that is receiving the wireless call; Phase II provides more precise caller-location information, usually within 50 to 300 meters. Currently, according to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), nearly 98 percent of 911 call centers, known as Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), are capable of receiving Phase I location information, and 97 percent have implemented Phase II {{for at least one}} wireless carrier. This represents a significant improvement since 2003 when implementation of Phase I was 65 percent and Phase II was 18 percent. According to NENA's current data, 142 U.

40|$|This article asks {{member states}} to develop {{national}} regulations for mobile operators enforcing the automatic positioning of emergency calls: "Member states shall ensure that undertakings which operator public telephone networks make a <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> available to authorities handling emergencies, to the extent technically feasible, for all calls to the single European emergency call number 112.

Because more than 80 % of European operators have implemented so-called Cell-ID technology [CI 03] for mobile positioning, only very low accuracy levels can be offered for now in emergency situations: 100 meters potentially in urban areas, but only up to 3 -kilometer accuracy in rural areas.

40|$|The {{emergency}} call {{systems in the}} United States and elsewhere are undergoing a transition from the PSTN-based legacy system to a new IP-based system. The new system {{is referred to as}} the Next Generation 9 - 1 - 1 (NG 9 - 1 - 1) or NG 112 system. We have built a prototype NG 9 - 1 - 1 system which features media convergence and data integration that are unavailable in the current {{emergency call}}ing system. The most important piece of information in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system is the <b>caller's</b> <b>location.</b> The <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> is used for routing the call to the appropriate call center. The emergency responders use the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> to find the caller. Therefore, it is essential to determine the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> as precisely as possible to minimize delays in emergency response. Delays in response may result in loss of lives. When a person makes an emergency call outdoors using a mobile phone, the Global Positioning System (GPS) can provide the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> accurately. Indoor positioning, however, presents a challenge. GPS does not generally work indoors because satellite signals do not penetrate most buildings. Moreover, there is an important difference between determining location outdoors and indoors. Unlike outdoors, vertical accuracy is very important in indoor positioning because an error of few meters will send emergency responders to a different floor in a building, which may cause a significant delay in reaching the caller. This thesis presents a way to augment our NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system with a new indoor positioning system. The indoor positioning system focuses on improving the accuracy of vertical location. Our goal is to provide floor-level accuracy with minimum infrastructure support. Our approach is to use a user's smartphone to trace her vertical movement inside buildings. We utilize multiple sensors available in today's smartphones to enhance positioning accuracy. This thesis makes three contributions. First, we present a hybrid architecture for floor localization with emergency calls in mind. The architecture combines beacon-based infrastructure and sensor-based dead reckoning, striking a balance between accurately determining a user's location and minimizing the required infrastructure. Second, we present the elevator module for tracking a user's movement in an elevator. The elevator module addresses three core challenges that make it difficult to accurately derive displacement from acceleration. Third, we present the stairway module which determines the number of floors a user has traveled on foot. Unlike previous systems that track users' foot steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing counting technique. Additionally, this thesis presents our work on designing and implementing an NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system. We first demonstrate how emergency calls from various call origination devices are identified, routed to the proper Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the <b>caller's</b> <b>location,</b> and terminated by the call taker software at the PSAP. We then show how text communications such as Instant Messaging and Short Message Service can be integrated into the NG 9 - 1 - 1 architecture. We also present GeoPS-PD, a polygon simplification algorithm designed to improve the performance of location-based routing. GeoPS-PD reduces the size of a polygon, which represents the service boundary of a PSAP in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system...|$|R
