5|$|In 1983, Gingrich {{founded the}} Conservative Opportunity Society (COS), {{a group that}} {{included}} young conservative House Republicans. Early COS members included Robert Smith Walker, Judd Gregg, Dan <b>Coats</b> <b>and</b> Connie Mack III. The group gradually expanded to include several dozen representatives, who met each week to exchange and develop ideas.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 herd book {{describes}} {{two distinct}} types of Highland cattle. One was the West Highland, or Kyloe, originating and living {{mostly on the}} Western Islands, which had harsher conditions. These cattle tended to be smaller, to have black <b>coats</b> <b>and,</b> due to their more rugged environment, to have long hair. These cattle were named due {{to the practice of}} relocating them. The kyles were narrow straits of water the cattle were driven across to get to market.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Mérens {{are the result of}} the harsh mountain environment where they live, and they are reminiscent of the horses in the cave drawings at Niaux, made some 13,000 years ago. These images depict animals with dense <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> a skull shaped like the modern Mérens, with a beard-like protrusion of hair under the jawbone.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the plasma sprayed 80 Ni- 20 Al coatings on aluminum-magnesium (Mg ≈ 2. 6 ‒ 3. 6 %) alloy substrate, which before plasma spraying was cleaned using blasting with Al 2 O 3 particles. The wear resistance and corrosion tests of sprayed <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> aluminum-magnesium alloy were performed. The volume loss, average {{central part of the}} cross-sectional area of wear track, wear rapidity, wear rate, wear resistance and corrosion current of <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Al-Mg substrate were evaluated. The wear resistance and corrosion of nickel-aluminum <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> aluminum-magnesium substrate were compared at the work. Furthermore the wear tracks analysis of sprayed <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> substrate surface was carried out...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{aluminide}} <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> of section thickness were investigated on two cast nickel-base superalloys. Cast section thickness ranged from 0. 038 cm to 0. 15 cm. Simulated engine exposures in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied. The effects of surface machining before <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> re-machining and re-coating after exposures were examined. The properties evaluated included tensile strength, stress rupture, high-cycle mechanical fatigue, and thermal fatigue. A metallurgical analysis {{was made of the}} microstructures of the <b>coated</b> <b>and</b> uncoated alloy...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{photovoltaics}} {{promises a}} very low cost production of solar energy by fast roll-to-roll <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> printing processes. Both vacuum <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> solution <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> printing are used to deposit the organic semiconductors and electrode materials. The technology has made significant progress in terms of record efficiencies exceeding 10 % and device stability, where recent results justify to envisage that a device lifetime of more than 10 years is possible to achieve even with flexible devices. The technology will be introduced with recent progress and remaining challenges. The technological aspects to be solved to realize the potential of this technology will be addressed as well as where the <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> converting industry can contribute to make it happen...|$|R
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E
5|$|While no {{official}} service uniform {{was developed for}} the tropics, during the Mutiny in India in 1857, many of the regiments fought in their undress uniform (white drill), rather than the standard uniform. The 52nd were the first regiment to dye their white uniforms khaki {{for use in the}} field. This early khaki was a grey colour. For most purposes, they discarded their <b>coats</b> <b>and,</b> adopting the Indian traditions, wore their shirts out, rather than tucked in; shirts were also dyed. The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps. Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.|$|E
60|$|So saying, Mr. Bale retired {{into his}} private room again. Mr. Medlin placed his papers inside his desk, locked it, {{took off his}} <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hung it on a peg, put on another <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> his hat, {{and then turned to}} Bob.|$|R

There is a pub in Margate named [...] "The Doggett <b>Coat</b> <b>and</b> Badge".|$|R
40|$|Co-YSZ/HAp nano-composite <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> nano-HAp single <b>coating</b> were {{deposited}} on Ti substrate using {{the combination of}} electrocodeposition and electrophoretic deposition, and electrophoretic depositions, respectively. Surface and cross section morphologies of the coatings were observed by scanning electron microscope. Element distribution and crystal phase of the coatings were analyzed by energy dispersive spectrum and X-ray diffraction. The adhesive strength of the <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate was determined by shear strength testing. The {{results indicate that the}} adhesive strength of Co-YSZ/HAp nano-composite <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate is higher than that of nano-HAp single <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate. It shows that Co-YSZ as an interlayer reduces the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients between HAp and titanium <b>and</b> Co-YSZ/HAp nano-composite <b>coating</b> has better mechanical properties...|$|R
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped <b>coats</b> <b>and,</b> compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning <b>coats,</b> <b>and</b> in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E

5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's <b>coats,</b> <b>and</b> fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical <b>coats,</b> <b>and</b> that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent their}} {{first month of}} service drilling in Washington D.C. During this time they were barracked in the U.S. Treasury Building. On May 25, they marched to Alexandria, Virginia where they set up camp and remained {{for a month and}} a half. During this time, President Lincoln and his cabinet reviewed the regiment and dubbed them the “Steady Fifth” due to their performance during the review. While encamped in Alexandria, the unit received new uniforms consisting of dark blue <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> trousers—the Regular Army uniform of the time. The 5th Massachusetts was one of very few volunteer units to take the field in Regular Army uniforms and were frequently mistaken for Regular troops during the Bull Run campaign. On July 13, the 5th Massachusetts received orders to march for Centreville, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
