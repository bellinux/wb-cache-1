Populations are typically poly-morphic for flower color. The genetic control of stem color can be partially accounted for through the pleiotropic action of two of the loci involved in determining flower color. The locus Pip codes for pigment hue in both flower and stem, and ///codes for pigment Inten-sity In the two tissues. Biochemical analysis confirms the identical nature of the antho-cyanidins in flowers and stems. Compared with flowers, however, stems contain fewer or less complex glycosides of the anthocyanldins. The expression of flower-color loci at an earlier stage of the plant life cycle adds another dimension to studies concerned with accounting for the maintenance of the flower-color polymorphism In this species...|$|E

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> (Ipomoea purpurea) {{is highly}} {{polymorphic}} for flower color. Part of this phenotypic variation {{is due to}} allelic variation at the P locus. This locus determines whether flowers will be purple or pink, where purple is dominant to pink. We have determined that the anthocyanin biosynthetic gene flavonoid 39 -hydroxylase (f 39 h) corresponds to the P locus. In the pink allele of f 39 h {{there is a large}} insertion in the third exon, which results in the production of a truncated transcript. This shortened transcript produces a nonfunctional F 39 H enzyme, resulting in the production of pink flowers rather than purple.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> (Ipomoea purpurea), {{a native}} to Central America, {{is a common}} weed in the southeastern United States. The plant was {{introduced}} to Europe probably in the 17 th century and to Japan in the 18 th century. The cultivars with purple, red and white flowers were already recorded in the 18 th century, and the most extensively characterized mutant displaying white flowers with pigmented spots and sectors was recorded in the early 19 th century. The early genetic studies on the variegated flower line, named flaked, were conducted by Barker (1917) in the United States and followed by Imai and Tabuchi (1935) in Japan. The flaked mutation, also called anthocyaninflaked (aflaked or af), was recently shown {{to be caused by}} the insertion of the transposable element Tip 100 into the CHS-D gene for anthocyanin biosynthesis. The 3. 9 kb Tip 100 element belonging to the Ac/Ds family contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 808 amino acids. The patterns of the flower variegations in the mutable flaked (af) lines are determined by the frequency and timing of the excision of Tip 100 from the CHS-D gene. In addition to the mutable af allele, there is a leaf variegation mutation yellow-green leafmutable, or yglm, conferring dark green spots and sectors on a yellow green background. A plant carrying the two alleles, af and yglm, tends to show a peculiar similarity in both timing and frequency of the variegations in flowers and leaves, and the patterns of the flower and leaf variegations are also generally heritable. Based on the observation, it has been proposed that there must be another genetic element termed Modulator acting on both af and yglm alleles and that the timing and frequency of the variegations in flowers and leaves are determined by the heritable state of the Modulator. As an initial step to understand the complicated flower and leaf variegation system in the <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory,</b> I examined whether Tip 100 is an autonomous element carrying an active transposase gene within the element. Tip 100 and its internal deletion derivative dTip 100 were introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and their capability to transpose in the transgenic tobacco plants was examined. The introduced Tip 100 element was able to transpose from the integrated vector into the tobacco genome whereas dTip 100 was not. The defective dTip 100 could be transposed by introduction of Tip 100, indicating that Tipl 00 is the first autonomous element characterized in Ipomoea species. Based on these results, I have speculated the nature of the putative Modulator element affecting flower and leaf variegations in various mutable lines. To characterize whether many different mutant alleles in the CHS-D gene are present in the <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> producing either white flowers or white flowers with pigmented spots and sectors, the structures of the CHS-D gene regions in the mutants grown as a weed in the southeastern United States. All of the mutants examined were found to be derivatives of the af mutant previously characterized, and some of them carry additional DNA rearrangements associated with Tip 100. Based on the results, I have concluded {{that there had been a}} "founder" mutation in the CHS-D gene and that subsequent DNA rearrangements mediated by Tip 100 and other mobile genetic elements had occurred in some of the geographically spread mutants originated from the founder. I have also discussed a possible evolutionary process to generate variants and mutants carrying sequence alterations in the CHS-D gene region of the <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tip 100 is an Ac-like {{transposable element}} {{that belongs to}} the hAT superfamily.

As Tip 100 data were already available in databases, the sequences of related elements in ten additional species of Ipomoea and five commercial varieties were isolated and analyzed. Evolutionary analysis based on sequence diversity in nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS), was also applied to compare the evolution of these elements with that of Tip 100 in the Ipomoea genus. Tip 100 sequences were found in I. purpurea, I. nil, I. indica and I. alba, all of which showed high levels of similarity. The results of phylogenetic analysis of transposon sequences were congruent with the phylogenetic topology obtained for ITS sequences, thereby demonstrating that Tip 100 is restricted to a particular group of species within Ipomoea. We hypothesize that Tip 100 was probably acquired from a common ancestor and has been transmitted vertically within this genus...|$|E

By using a nucleotide sequence of CHS-D from the sister species Ipomoea nil (Japanese morning glory [Johzuka-Hisatomi, Y., Hoshino, A., Mori, T., Habu, Y. & Iida, S. (1999) Genes Genet. Syst. 74, 141 – 147], it is also possible to determine the relative frequency of insertion and loss of elements within the CHS-D locus between these two species. At least four different types of transposable elements exist upstream of the coding region, or within the single intron of the CHS-D locus in I. purpurea. There are three distinct families of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITES), and some recent transpositions of Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) -like elements (Tip 100), of some short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs), and of an insertion sequence (InsIpCHSD) found in the neighborhood of this locus. The data provide no compelling evidence of the transposition of the mites since the separation of I. nil and I. purpurea roughly 8 million years ago. Finally, it is shown that the number and frequency of mobile elements are highly heterogeneous among different duplicate CHS loci, suggesting that the dynamics observed at CHS-D are locus-specific...|$|E
40|$|Ipomoea purpurea (<b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory)</b> is {{an annual}} vine native to Mexico {{that is well}} known for its large, showy flowers. Humans have spread morning glories worldwide, owing to the horticultural appeal of morning glory flowers.

Naturalized populations in the Southeastern United States are highly polymorphic for a number of flower color morphs, unlike native Mexican populations that are typically monomorphic for the purple color morph. Although I. purpurea was introduced into the United States from Mexico, {{little is known about the}} specific geographic origins of US populations relative to the Mexican source. We use resequencing data from 11 loci and 30 I. purpurea accessions collected from the native range of the species in Central and Southern Mexico and 8 accessions from the Southeastern United States to infer likel y geographic origins in Mexico. Based on genetic assignment analysis, haplotype composition, and the degree of shared polymorphism, I. purpurea samples from the Southeastern United States are genetically most similar to samples from the Valley of Mexico and Veracruz State.

Questions: Did the genetic basis of RoundUp defence antedate the introduction of RoundUp? If so, how does defence today compare with defence then? Organism: A preserved collection of Ipomoea purpurea seeds (the <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory)</b> was germinated from 10 accessions sampled from the early 1980 s. A contemporary population of I. purpurea derived from a crossing scheme was used for comparison. Methods: Replicate seeds from both the historical and contemporary populations were planted into a field experiment located at the University of Georgia’s Plant Sciences Farm. Individuals were sprayed with the field rate of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide RoundUp. Tolerance, or the fitness response following herbicide application, and resistance, a measure of the amount of damage a plant exhibits after herbicide application, were determined for each line of both the historical and contemporary populations. Results: Genetic variation for both types of defence was already present in this weed species prior to the herbicide’s introduction in the mid- 1990 s.

40|$|The genus Ipomoea {{includes}} approximately 600 species distributed on {{a worldwide}} scale that {{are characterized by}} a diversity of floral morphologies and coloration pattern. Most Ipomoea species {{can be found in}} the Americas, particularly in Mexico, and those widely distribution are covered with the Pacific basin and Africa, Asia and Australia. 　The genus Ipomoea can be divided into following three subgenuses, Eriospermum, Ipomoea and Calystegia. 　Among the subgenus Ipomoea, three morning glories, I. nil (the Japanese morning glory) with blue flowers, I. purpurea (the <b>common</b> <b>morning</b> <b>glory)</b> with dark purple flowers, and I. tricolor with blue flowers, were domesticated well as ornamental plants, and many mutants displaying various flower colors were isolated. 　The blue flowers of I. nil and I. tricolor contain a polyacylatyed cyanidin-based anthocyanin, termed Heavenly Blue Anthocyanin(HBA), as a major pigment, whereas the dark purple flowers of I. purpurea contains a cyanidin derivative that lacks a methyl residue and one glucose molecule from HBA. 　　The Japanese morning glory had been introduced into Japan from China as a medical herb approximately in the 8 th century, and a number of spontaneous mutants displaying various flower colors have been isolated since the 17 th century. 　According to the classical genetic studies, mutations affecting flower pigmentations can be classified mainly into three categories: mutations conferring white flowers, mutations affecting blue flower coloration, and mutations influencing flower hue. 　Mutations conferring white flowers can be classified into four groups, a, c, ca, and r; the a, and r mutants exhibit white flowers with green stems and normal-colored black seeds, and the c mutants display white flowers with red stems and normal-colored seeds, while the ca mutants produce white flowers with green stem and ivory seeds. 　 Blue　flower coloration was regarded to be mainly controlled by two genetic loci, Magenta and Purple. 　Recessive magenta and purple mutants bloom magenta and purple flowers, respectively, and double mutants carrying both magenta and purple alleles display red flowers. 　 Three loci, Dusky, Duskish and Dingy, control flower hue, and recessive mutations in one of these loci confer dull colored flowers. 　　The anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is well documented, and the genes for anthocyanin biosymthesis can be divided between structural genes for enzymes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and regulatory genes for transcription factors acting on the structural genes. The structural genes encoding enzymes to produce anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucsides, which are the first major stable colored pigments in the anthocyamin biosynthesis pathway have been identified and characterized. 　Further modifications of　anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucsides including glycosylation, acylation, and methylation can occur in a species-specific manner, although only limited information about the genes responsible for these modification processes is available. 　 The transcriptional regulators encoded by the regulatory genes are known to include members of proteins containing an R 2 R 3 -MYB domain, a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) domain, and conserved WD 40 repeats (WDRs), and the combinations of the R 2 R 3 -MYB, bHLH, and WDR factors and their interactions determine the set of genes to be expressed. 　Among the mutations affecting flower pigmentations, a and r such as a- 3, and r- 1 and r- 3 are mutations in the structural genes encoding dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR), chalcone synthase (CHS) and anthosyanidin synthase (ANS), respectively. 　For the genes controlling blue flower coloration, the Purple gene was shown to be NHX 1 encoding a vacuolar Na + / H + exchanger, which is responsible for increasing vacuolar pH in the petals during flower opening. 　　In this dissertation, he briefly introduced flower pigmentation of three morning glories, I. nil, I. purpurea, and I. tricolor, the genes for biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments, and the I. nil spontaneous mutations that control the flower coloration. 　In Chapter 2, he described that spontaneous mutations in F 32 ̆ 7 H, magenta, pink, and fuchsia, conferring reddish flowers are shown to be a nonsense mutation caused by a single C to T base transition generating the TGA stop codon in I. nil, an insertion mutation caused by 0. 55 -kb DNA transpon Tip 201 belonging to the hAT superfamily in I. purpurea, and a single T insertion generating the stop codon TAG in I. tricolor, respectively. 　Although various plants exhibiting reddish flowers are postulated to carry mutations controlling the F 32 ̆ 7 H activity, none of them have been identified and only a few F 32 ̆ 7 H mutations identified are those affecting seed coloration;the tt 7 mutation in Arabidopsis conferring pale brownseeds and reduced anthocyanin content to the whole plant is caused by a single C to T base transition generating the stop codon TAA, and the recessive t mutant in soybean affecting pigmentation in its seed coats and trichome hairs is a frameshift (a single C deletion) mutation. Therefore, the characterization of the magenta, pink, and fuchsia mutations in these three moming glories were the first report on the mutation in the F 32 ̆ 7 H gene conferring reddish flowers. 　In Chapter 3, he described that the dusky, mutation in I. nil conferring reddish-brown or purplish-grey hue in the petals are frameshift mutations caused by 4 -bp insertions at an identical position near the 3 ’end of the 3 GGT gene for a novel glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3 - O - lucoside- 2 " - O -glucosyltransferase, which mediates the glucosylation of anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucosides to yield anthocyanidin 3 - O -sophorosides. Except for the 3 GGT gene described here, there has been only one gene, whose mutation is characterized in the genes mediating an addition of a sugar residue to the glucose molecule of anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucosides; the petumia Rt gene encoding UDP-rhamnose:anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucoside- 6 " - O -rhamnosyltransferase (3 RT), which controls the conversion of anthocyanidin 3 - O -glucosides into anthocyamidin 3 - 0 -rutinosides.     In Chapter 4, he first charancterized the tissue-specific expression of three MYB genes, three bHLH genes, and two WDR genes in I. nil. 　Subsequently, he showed that the c and ca mutations are frameshift mutations caused by a 2 -bp deletion and 7 -bp insertions in the genes for the R 2 R 3 -MYB and WDR transcriptional regulators designated as MYB 1 and WDR 1, respectively. 　In addition to defects in flower, stem, and seed pigmentations, he also found that the ca mutants show reduced trichome formation in seeds, which is a novel epidermal traits associated with the transcriptional factors. 　　Based on these results, he also discusses in Chapter 5 that the three morning glories, I. nil, I. purpurea, and I. tricolor, can collectively serve good models for the elucidation of anthocyan in pigmentation in the flowers, because the identified mutations affecting flower pigmentation in these Ipomoea are comparable with or slightly exceed the characterized mutations flower coloration in petunia, which is regarded to be a model plant for flower pigmentation...|$|E
