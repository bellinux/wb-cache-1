50|$|The {{renewable}} energy sector benefited when the Alliance '90/The Greens party joined {{the federal government}} between 1998 and 2005. Support for {{renewable energy}} <b>continued</b> <b>under</b> all <b>following</b> governments, regardless of composition, including the current CDU/CSU and SPD coalition government starting in 2013. The renewable energy sector was aided especially by the Renewable Energy Sources Act that promotes renewable energy mainly by stipulating feed-in tariffs and recently also market premiums that grid operators must pay for renewable energy fed into the power grid. People who produce renewable energy can sell their 'product' at fixed prices {{for a period of}} 20 or 15 years. This has created a surge in the production of renewable energy.In 2012, Siemens estimated the total cost of renewable energy would come to at least €1.4 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) by 2030.|$|R

50|$|The naval {{campaign}} of 1702 was therefore {{played out in}} two distant theatres of America and Spain, linked together by {{the trail of the}} Spanish treasure ships across the Atlantic. The American theatre became a scene long remembered in popular English tradition following Admiral Benbow's running battle in August off Santa Marta. However, the Royal Navy's main effort was not off the Spanish Main, but off the Spanish coasts in Europe. Under the leadership of King William III, the Maritime Powers - England and the Dutch Republic - had resolved upon a Mediterranean strategy for the Allied fleets, a policy <b>continued</b> <b>under</b> William's successors <b>following</b> his death in March 1702. It was hoped that this strategy would encourage Portugal to join the Allies, open the Strait of Gibraltar, and secure English naval power in the Mediterranean. Their allies, the Austrians, were also clamouring for a naval presence in the Mediterranean to assist them in achieving their own primary ambitions - the capture of Spain's provinces in Italy. To meet these ends, the Anglo-Dutch fleets would first need to seize a port in the Iberian Peninsula from which their ships could operate. The Allies, therefore, resolved upon an expedition, led by Admiral George Rooke, to capture the southern Spanish port of Cádiz, and at a stroke cut off Spain's transatlantic trade.|$|R
