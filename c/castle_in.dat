5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster <b>Castle</b> <b>in</b> 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the <b>castle</b> <b>in</b> 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting.

The property had also been listed as a Portland Historic Landmark and was the city's only castle structure constructed in the 1930s. Two stones from Canterbury Castle serve as steps in the zen garden of Stansel's home in East Hampton, New York.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle is {{a medieval}} <b>castle</b> <b>in</b> {{the small town}} of Clare in Suffolk, England. Built shortly after the Norman conquest of England by Richard Fitz Gilbert, the motte and bailey castle was later {{improved}} in stone. In the 14th century the castle was the home of Elizabeth de Clare, one of the richest women in England, who maintained a substantial household there. The castle passed {{into the hands of the}} Crown, and by the 16th century was in ruins. Damaged by the construction of the Great Eastern Railway through the <b>castle</b> <b>in</b> 1867, the remains of the castle are now part of a local park and a scheduled monument and a grade 2* listed building.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} <b>castle</b> {{constructed}} <b>in</b> Lincoln, England, {{during the}} late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The <b>castle</b> is unusual <b>in</b> that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such <b>castles</b> <b>in</b> the country, the other being at Lewes <b>in</b> Sussex. Lincoln <b>Castle</b> remained <b>in</b> use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved <b>castles</b> <b>in</b> England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman <b>castles</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|R

5|$|Conisbrough Castle was {{probably}} similar to two other castles {{owned by the}} Warren earls. Hamelin Plantagenet was also responsible {{for the development of}} Mortemer <b>Castle</b> <b>in</b> France, where a similar keep was built on top of a motte, and Conisbrough might also have had resemblances to Sandal <b>Castle</b> <b>in</b> the north of England, also owned by the earls. The design of the keep was poor from a military perspective. The central circular tower provided defensive advantages but the buttresses introduced 12 vulnerable corners into the stonework, and the keep itself had no arrow slots to permit the defenders to fire on any attackers. Rather than being designed primarily for military defence, it was constructed to symbolise and reinforce Hamelin's lordship and new social status.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{moved back}} onto the {{offensive}} in Europe in 1543, allying himself with Spain against France once again. Despite Henry's initial successes around Boulogne in northern France, King Charles and Francis made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to an invasion by France, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response Henry issued another device in 1544 to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Work began on Southsea <b>Castle</b> <b>in</b> 1544 on Portsea Island to further protect the Solent, and on Sandown Castle the following year on the neighbouring Isle of Wight. Brownsea <b>Castle</b> <b>in</b> Dorset was begun in 1545, and Sharpenrode Bulwark was built opposite Hurst Castle from 1545 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the <b>castle</b> <b>in</b> 1804 to examine whether the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the <b>castle</b> <b>in</b> landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E

In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.|$|E
