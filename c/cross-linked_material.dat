50|$|In {{this type}} of polymer, the polymer forms through the cross linking of the pendant groups from the linear thermoplastics. For example, Saegusa et al. have shown the {{reversible}} cross-linking of modified poly(N-acetylethyleneimine)s containing either maleimide or furancarbonyl pendant moideties. The reaction is shown in Scheme 3. They mixed the two complementary polymers to make a highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>material</b> through DA reaction of furan and maleimide units at room temperature, as the cross-linked polymer is more thermodynamically stable than the individual starting materials. However, upon heating the polymer to 80 °C for two hours in a polar solvent, two monomers were regenerated via RDA reaction, indicating the breaking of polymers. This was possible because the heating energy provided enough energy {{to go over the}} energy barrier and results in the two monomers. Cooling the two starting monomers, or damaged polymer, to room temperature for 7 days healed and reformed the polymer. The reversible DA/RDA reaction is not limited to furan-meleimides based polymers as it is shown by the work of Schiraldi et al. They have shown the reversible cross-linking of polymers bearing pendent anthracene group with maleimides. However, the reversible reaction occurred only partially upon heating to 250 °C due to the competing decomposition reaction.|$|E

This project, however, {{provides a}} class of thermoset ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) materials based on norbornene dicarboximide moieties containing acetal ester group linkage which is degradable when subjected to heat or acidic-catalysis. In this study, acetal ester linkages were introduced into di-functional monomer by a one-step neat reaction between a functionalised imidonorbornene containing a terminal carboxylic acid group and a 1, 4 -butanediol divinyl ether. Each monomer and product was characterised by 1 H and 13 C NMR analysis, while the obtained polymers were analysised by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FTIR, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and oven. The results of TGA indicated that the <b>cross-linked</b> <b>materials</b> started losing weight at 150 ℃ {{and the extent of}} the weight loss at 300 ℃.

The samples after hydrolysis in dilute acid were completely soluble in DCM and were therefore characterised by NMR, which shows all the acetal ester linkages were broken down during hydrolysis and that cross-linked polymers changed into linear polymers.

40|$|The IFNAR {{chain of}} the type I {{interferon}} (IFN) receptor (IFNIR) undergoes rapid ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and acts as a species-specific transducer for type I IFN action. Using the vaccinia/T 7 expression system to amplify IFNAR expression, we found that human HeLa-S 3 cells transiently express high levels of cell surface IFNAR chains (approximately 250, 000 chains per cell). Metabolic labeling and immunoblot analysis of transfected HeLa cells show that the IFNAR chain is initially detected as 65 -kDa and 98 -kDa precursors, and then as the 130 -kDa mature protein. Due to variation in N-glycosylation, the apparent molecular mass of the mature IFNAR chain varies from 105 to 135 kDa in different cells. IFNIR structure was characterized in various human cell lines by analyzing 125 I-labeled IFN cross-linked complexes recognized by various antibodies against IFNIR subunits and JAK protein-tyrosine kinases. Precipitation of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>material</b> from Daudi cells with anti-IFNAR antibodies showed that IFNAR was present in a 240 -kDa complex.
