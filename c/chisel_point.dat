5000|$|The {{pilot hole}} also reduces the power needed {{to turn a}} large drill bit, and reduces the large bit {{breakage}} risk. For twist drill bits, the pilot size is usually selected so that the <b>chisel</b> <b>point</b> of the larger drill {{does not need to}} remove any material, which reduces the chance of splitting the web of the bit. A pilot thus sized also prevents a larger drill bit from slipping on the material and guides the larger bit effectively. Very large holes may be stepped by drilling successively larger pilot holes before the final size drill is used.|$|E

50|$|From {{the arrival}} of James Cook in 1769 and {{especially}} Marion Du Fresne's longer stay in New Zealand in 1772, Māori were able to obtain iron and steel which {{did not exist in}} pre contact Māori culture. Māori quickly learned the superiority of this material, especially for carving. Māori learnt to ask sailors to sharpen 8 inch long ships nails to a <b>chisel</b> <b>point</b> on a ships wheel in exchange for fish. This period between 1779 and 1820 - the height of the musket wars, has been called the golden age of Māori wood carving Much of the carving was confined to waka taua. During the middle 19th century, from 1835, {{the arrival of}} large numbers of European settlers and ships meant that ship's boats were far more commonly available and were increasingly used by Māori in preference to waka. In 1839 100 ships visited The Bay of Islands. This was a trend that the missionaries such as Marsden and Williams had noted had begun in the 1830s. The beamier, lighter, ship's boat was better load carriers with more stability and was sometimes equipped with sails for windward sailing. Use of shipsboats became common as many Māori worked {{on a wide variety of}} sealing, whaling and trading sailing vessels,both in New Zealand and in the Pacific. During the Land Wars few waka were used for movement of warriors as when the Waikato campaign started in 1863 the government forces made a point of sinking all the waka they could find on the Waikato River and its tributaries to slow rebel communications. Later, some fine examples of these waka were placed in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
40|$|Heavy rains {{in recent}} years have {{triggered}} an increase in herbicide-resistant weeds and crop diseases in long-term no-till (NT) farming systems in Queensland, Australia. As a possible solution, occasional or strategic tillage (ST) has been applied during summer fallow in two farms located near Jimbour and Biloela, Queensland, Australia. We investigated the impact of different frequencies (one to three passes) and timings (December, January and March) of tillage imposition on microbial indicators of soil health. Tillage implements included chisel plow sweeps at the Biloela site and narrow <b>chisel</b> <b>point</b> and offset disc at the Jimbour site. Seven soil samples were collected from each plot in April 2013 at 17, 10 and 2 weeks post-ST from 0 to 0. 1 and 0. 1 to 0. 2 m depths and composited separately for each soil depth. Samples were analysed for microbial biomass C, enzyme activity, community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) via microrespirometry method and bacterial genetic fingerprinting. Overall, {{there were no significant differences}} for any of these parameters between NT and ST at both sites. However, irrespective of tillage treatments, significant differences between soil depths were found for enzyme activity (Biloela), substrate utilisation (Jimbour and Biloela) and bacterial genetic fingerprinting (Jimbour). There were no major effects of ST on the microbial indicators used either under different timings, frequencies or type of tillage implement. Therefore, ST with chisel plow sweeps, narrow <b>chisel</b> <b>point</b> and offset disc may be undertaken with minimal impact on soil microbial communities to combat problems associated with long-term NT Vertisols, such as weed and soil-borne disease outbreak in Queensland, Australia...|$|E
40|$|Combination chisel plows {{are used}} {{extensively}} in crop production {{areas in the}} United States as part of conventional, reduced, and mulch-tillage systems. Use of combination chisel plows in corn residue can reduce surface residue cover to levels that afford little protection from soil erosion processes. Changes in the operation and setup of the equipment, however, can significantly affect the amount of residue that is incorporated into the soil. The objective of this project was to evaluate operational effects of a combination chisel plow equipped with coulter gangs on corn residue cover. Variables included timing of chisel plowing, <b>chisel</b> <b>point</b> selection, speed and depth of chiseling, and coulter gang engagement. Fall chisel plowing left higher levels of residue cover than did spring chiseling. The difference was negated, however, when overwintering losses following fall chiseling were accounted for.

5000|$|The {{examination}} of metal composition {{in the formation}} of different types [...] does add knowledge concerning production modes. The thicker the object is, the more lead wasdeliberately added to the cast. The highest amounts of lead were measured in the duckbill axes, less in the flat socketed axes, and much less in thinner blades like spears and daggers, which were much more worked and annealed after being cast. This observation corresponds well with the controlled alloying of the duckbill axes and ribbed daggers (with much less lead in the latter) from the MBIIa, but does not correspond with the spears. Although they are derived mainly from MBIIa contexts, their composition is less controlled and more varied. There might be a connection between the level of allowing control and the investment in the cast — the more complex types, like duckbill and flat socketed axes and ribbed daggers, are usually cast in steatite, two-piece closed and well-carved moulds.On the other hand, some of the less controlled alloyed types, like spearheads and knives as well as more simple tools such as <b>chisel</b> <b>points,</b> were mainly cast into open, relatively roughly carved limestone moulds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} strain rate on tensile {{properties}} of several lead-free solder was investigated using miniature size specimens. High-temperature lead-free solder which are Sn-Cu and Sn-Sb alloys were prepared. Moreover, low-Ag lead-free solder which are Sn- 1 Ag- 0. 7 Cu (SAC 107, mass%) based alloys were prepared. Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) was also prepared for comparison. Tensile strength is {{proportion to the}} logarithm of strain rate in all solder investigated. Although 0. 1 % proof stress decreases at high strain rate in high-temperature solder, it scarcely changes in low-Ag solder. Elongation somewhat increases with increasing strain rate in high-temperature solder.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of deformation and damage evolution in electrodeposited, fully dense, nanocrystalline Ni {{with an average}} grain size of ~ 30 nm and a narrow grain size distribution were investigated by recourse to (i) tensile tests performed in situ in the transmission electron microscope and (ii) microscopic observations made at high resolution following ex situ deformation induced by compression, rolling and nanoindentation. Particular attention was also devoted to the characterization of the structure in grain interiors and {{in the vicinity of}} grain boundaries at Angstrom-level resolution in the as-deposited material and following compression, and to the real-time video-imaging of the evolution of dislocation activity and damage during deformation; these images are presented in this paper and in the web sites provided as supplementary material to this paper. These observations clearly reveal that dislocation-mediated plasticity plays a dominant role in the deformation of nanocrystalline Ni examined in this study. Fracture surface examination confirms dimpled rupture with the scale of the dimples being several times larger than the grain size. Dislocation emission at grain boundaries together with intragranular slip and unaccommodated grain boundary sliding facilitate the nucleation of voids at boundaries and triple junctions. Individual monocrystal ligaments, formed by the growth/linking of these voids, undergo extensive local plasticity to the extent that many of them neck down to a <b>chisel</b> <b>point.</b> These voids as well as those that may have existed prior to deformation can act as nucleation sites for dimple...|$|E

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 4 factorial. The effect of plowing depth {{on all of the}} parameters mentioned was highly significant. Implement draft and drawbar power requirement both increased with plowing depth, whereas a decreasing trend of specific draft with depth was observed. Soil moisture content had no significant effect on draft and specific draft of chisel plow in the range of moisture contents studied, though both parameters were minimized at 10 - 12 % m. c. At this moisture level, the drawbar power requirement showed a significant reduction comparing with the other two moisture levels. This indicated that the soil was close to its optimum friability at this moisture content. Soil penetrometer readings, taken before and after plowing, indicated the existence of a hardpan from about 8 to 20 cm below the surface which was broken by chisel tines, but another hard layer formed under the plowing depth by the <b>chisel</b> <b>points.</b> Comparison of the results from the present study with those from the previously published works on chisel plow draft at similar plowing depths showed that the values obtained for draft and specific draft were acceptably close to those previous investigators.
