5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

5|$|As a landlord, Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner {{to improve the quality of}} life of those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts as a result of his uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better,</b> but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Doohan {{moved to}} London, Ontario for further {{technical}} education. After hearing a radio drama {{that he knew}} he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better,</b> he recorded his voice at the local radio station, and learned about a drama school in Toronto. There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where his classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall and Richard Boone.|$|E
25|$|The SLA's sordid {{behavior}} inevitably {{led to the}} {{alienation of}} many civilians and pushed some Sierra Leoneans to join the rebel cause. With morale low and rations even lower, many SLA soldiers discovered that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> by joining with the rebels in looting civilians in the countryside instead of fighting against them. The local civilians referred to these soldiers as ‘sobels’ or ‘soldiers by day, rebels by night’ because of their {{close ties to the}} RUF. By mid-1993, the two opposing sides became virtually indistinguishable. For these reasons, civilians increasingly relied on an irregular force called the Kamajors for their protection.|$|E

25|$|While {{staying with}} Jim's brother in Chicago in 1924, {{the family was}} {{listening}} to the radio; Jim said that he and Marian <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than the musical act currently on the air. Jim's brother bet him $10 that they could not. To win the bet, Jim and Marian went to WIBO, where they were immediately put on the air. At the end of the performance, the station offered the couple a contract for a weekly show, which paid $10 per week. The sponsor of the show was Oh Henry! candy, and they appeared for six months on The Oh Henry! Twins program, switching to radio station WENR by 1927.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was sure she <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better,</b> and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E
25|$|Field's {{claim to}} {{distinction}} does not rest {{entirely on the}} fact that he wrote the first volume of verse to appear in Australia, he also founded the first savings bank in June 1819. He is spoken of with respect in Miss Marion Phillips's A Colonial Autocracy. He was the B.F. {{of one of the most}} famous of Lamb's essays and the recipient of more than one of his delightful letters, which suggests that he must have had likeable qualities. His verse has little value, but he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> work in prose and had some claims to be an Elizabethan scholar, his special interest being Thomas Heywood. His Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales, published in 1825, is an interesting collection of some of the earliest scientific papers relating to Australia.|$|E

25|$|Another {{explanation}} {{given for}} the re-use is the short time between the start of construction (late 312 at the earliest) and the dedication (summer 315), so the architects used existing artwork {{to make up for}} the lack of time to create new art. It could be that so many old parts were used because the builders themselves did notfeelthe artists of their time <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than what had already been done by different people. As yet another possible reason, it has often been suggested that the Romans of the 4th century truly did lack the artistic skill to produce acceptable artwork, and were aware of it, and therefore plundered the ancient buildings to adorn their contemporary monuments. This interpretation has become less prominent in more recent times, as the art of Late Antiquity has been appreciated in its own right. It is possible that a combination of those explanations is correct.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Parsons and Smith brought Fertig some {{unpleasant}} orders from MacArthur's headquarters. The American Army {{was willing to}} provide radios and other equipment for Fertig's command, but these were only {{to be used for}} passing information on Japanese activities, from coastwatchers and other sources, to Australia. The guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the Japanese. Fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support. However, due to the numerous atrocities that the Japanese were committing against the Philippine population, the only way that Fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the Japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning, so as to provide the Filipinos an outlet for revenge against the Japanese. Fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the Japanese, then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with MacArthur's headquarters and its directives. In addition, General Charles A. Willoughby, MacArthur's Chief of Intelligence, was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources. If a regular U.S. Army had been defeated by the Japanese in the Philippines, then no irregular force <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> The guerrillas' only purpose was to provide intelligence and later, if fully equipped prior to the return of American forces to the Philippines, to fight as regular forces under the command of American officers.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his success}} with Cooper, Brabham {{was sure he}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> He {{considered}} buying Cooper in partnership with Roy Salvadori and then in late 1959 he asked his friend Ron Tauranac {{to come to the}} UK and work with him, producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham continued to drive for Cooper, but on the long flight back from the 1960 season-opening Argentine Grand Prix, he had a heart-to-heart with John Cooper. John's father Charlie and the designer Owen Maddock had been reluctant to update their car, but although a Cooper had won in Argentina, other cars had been faster before they broke down. Brabham helped design the more advanced Cooper T53, including advice from Tauranac. Brabham spun the new car out of the next championship race, the Monaco Grand Prix, but then embarked on a series of five straight victories. He won from the front at the Dutch, French, and Belgian Grands Prix, where title rival Moss was badly injured in a practice accident that put him out for two months. Two other drivers were killed during the race. At the British Grand Prix, Brabham was closing on Graham Hill's BRM before Hill spun off, leaving Brabham the victory. He then came back from eighth place to second at the Portuguese Grand Prix after sliding off on tramlines and won after race leader John Surtees crashed. Brabham's points total was put out of reach when the British teams withdrew from the Italian GP on safety grounds. Mike Lawrence writes that Brabham's expertise in setting up the cars was a significant factor in Cooper's 1960 drivers' and constructors' titles.|$|E

500|$|More {{controversial}} was Herring's {{relief of}} Brigadier Arnold Potts and Blamey's of Major General Arthur Samuel Allen at Herring's urging. Herring {{acknowledged that the}} two men had faced a difficult task but felt that they were tired and that Brigadier Ivan Dougherty and Major General Vasey <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> Supporters of Allen, who left school at age 14, saw this as the action of an autocratic elitist who [...] "ran his staff as he had controlled junior counsel in his barrister's chamber; they did his bidding, his way, or were forthwith dispensed with".|$|E
500|$|Not all {{reviews of}} the season were positive. A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal called it [...] "one of the more hit-or-miss seasons of South Park in the show’s history", but said he was {{confident}} the series <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> {{and that it had}} yet not entered the [...] "staggering animal begging to be put out of its misery stage of a show's lifetime". He described the season as a [...] "weekly exercise in South Park schizophrenia", with some episodes faring better than others, although he said {{the first half of the}} season was generally strong. Josh Modell, also of the A.V. Club, agreed that the season was uneven, with several episodes [...] "you kinda shrugged your shoulders at", but others like [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch" [...] that he found [...] "pretty damn funny".|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{innovation}} {{of putting}} the engine behind the driver, the Coopers and their chief designer, Owen Maddock, were generally resistant to developing their cars. Brabham pushed for further advances, and {{played a significant role}} in developing Cooper's highly successful 1960 T53 [...] "lowline" [...] car, with input from his friend Tauranac. Brabham was confident he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than Cooper, and in late 1959 he asked Tauranac to come to the UK and work with him, initially producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham describes Tauranac as [...] "absolutely the only bloke I'd have gone into partnership with". Later, Brabham offered a Coventry-Climax FWE-engined version of the Herald, with [...] and uprated suspension to match the extra power.|$|E

"Shape" [...] {{was written}} by Sting, Dominic Miller and Craig Dodds, and {{produced}} by Dodds under his production name Craigie, for the Sugababes' second studio album, Angels with Dirty Faces (2002). It is a remake of Sting's 1993 recording [...] "Shape of My Heart"; the song's verses were changed, while the chorus that features Sting's vocals was re-recorded. According to Sugababes member Mutya Buena, [...] "He felt he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> with the chorus, so he came in to re-record it". The song was engineered by Jack Guy, and programmed by Dean Barratt. Additional vocal recording was completed by Ben Georgiades. [...] "Shape" [...] is the album's fourth and final single, and was released in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2003 as a CD single and cassette tape. The B-side is a cover version of English producer Adamski's and English musician Seal's 1990 single [...] "Killer".|$|E
500|$|Crane {{drew from}} a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle. Centurys [...] "Battles and Leaders" [...] series served as direct {{inspiration}} for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss's [...] "Recollections of a Private") contains many parallels to Crane's work. Thomas Beer wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write The Red Badge of Courage after having announced that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than Émile Zola's La Débâcle. This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. The metaphor of the [...] "red badge of courage" [...] itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny's insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.|$|E
500|$|Critical views presuppose Metternich had {{the ability}} to shape Europe favorably but chose not to. More modern critiques like that of A. J. P. Taylor have {{questioned}} how much influence Metternich actually wielded. Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich “had only his own persuasiveness to rely on”, and this degraded over time. By this interpretation, his task was to create a “smokescreen” that hid Austria’s true weakness. When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, “most men <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> while shaving.” The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomat: Taylor described him as “the most boring man in European history.” Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to effect even his own proposals for administrative reform. In contrast, those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich describe him as “unquestionably [...] master of diplomacy”, someone who perfected and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era. In a similar vein, Alan Sked argues that Metternich’s “smokescreen” may well have served a purpose in furthering a relatively coherent set of principles.|$|E
