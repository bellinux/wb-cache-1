40|$|The {{problems}} and solutions {{with respect to}} <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> {{which may not be}} correctly fitted to the car were charted by means of: (1) surveys among importers and manufacturers of <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> and passenger cars; and (2) a field study. In particular, standard rear seat belts, which were made compulsory for passenger cars in 1990, proved to be problematic. The aim of this report is to provide a solution specific for the Netherlands in the short term. Three problem areas were determined which influence whether <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> could be properly fitted to cars or not. These include: (1) Length of short belt sections including full buckles, which are not appropriate for the fixing of child seats; (2) Outer anchoring points on the rear seat which are positioned too far forward; and (3) belt knots which prevent the belt from being pulled tight. The most notable point which became apparent during the survey is that five of the eight importers/manufacturers of <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> were not aware of the interface problems of <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> and passenger cars. A distinction was made between seats still to be purchased and those already in possession, when proposing solutions for these problems. The report also cited specific information activities aimed at a number of target groups...|$|R

2500|$|All {{versions}} of the Model S have the same body and normally seat five passengers. An optional folding third row becomes a rear-facing two-place <b>child</b> <b>seat</b> with a five-point harness. Consumer Reports said that the 7-passenger capacity afforded by this option is larger than any other electric vehicle, though not really {{the same as a}} full-size SUV that seats 7 adults. The two extra seats are only for children over [...] tall and weighing between , which the magazine described as [...] "a narrow size range. It's too big for smaller kids, and larger ones won't fit under the sloping glass window." [...] The seats fold away under the rear cargo area, which Consumer Reports said is a [...] "cumbersome and awkward" [...] operation, though for the third row seats are [...] "useful for occasional extra passengers when your kids bring friends along", provided the driver had planned ahead and left the cargo area empty. Though the rear-seat option includes a stronger rear bumper, the magazine also said that seating behind the rear axle on the Model S, like any third-row seat, is an additional risk in severe rear impacts, though these are relatively rare.|$|E

The aim is to establish the extent and type of misuse of both <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> and standard seat belts. This paper deals only with <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> (<b>child</b> restraints). In the first stage of the project, a method for measuring misuse was defined. Assessments of injury potential were based on accepted criteria, in combination with both knowledge derived from extensive laboratory testing and with accident data. A special form and a rating system were developed in order to judge the overall severity of misuse. In the second stage, a field study was conducted at parking areas of shopping centres, roadside restaurants, and theme parks such as zoos. The use of child restraints in the cars of the visitors was observed by trained technical students. Data on some 500 <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> were collected. Considering the overall results, the degree of misuse of <b>child</b> <b>seats</b> was considerable. Serious errors were noted for almost 70 % of the seats. Recommendations are given concerning an internationally accepted and standardised method for measuring the misuse of child restraints...|$|R
