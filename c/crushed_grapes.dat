25|$|Cato {{described}} {{the process of}} pressing as taking place in a special room that included an elevated concrete platform containing a shallow basin with raised curbs. The basin was shaped with gentle slopes {{that led to a}} runoff point. Horizontally across the basin were long, wooden beams whose front parts were attached by rope to a windlass. The <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> were placed between the beams, with pressure applied by winding down the windlass. The pressed juice ran down between the beams and collected in the basin. As the construction and use of a wine press was labor-intensive and expensive, its use was generally restricted to large estates, with smaller wineries relying on treading alone to obtain grape juice.|$|E
25|$|The Medinah Athletic Club {{building}} {{was intended to}} combine elements of many architectural styles. At the eighth floor, its Indiana limestone facade was decorated by three large relief carvings in ancient Assyrian style. Each frieze depicted a different scene {{in the order of}} constructing a building, with Contribution on the south wall, Wisdom represented on the west wall and Consecration on the north. (According to an article in the Chicago Tribune from Sept 16, 1928 entitled “Building art inspires panels”:“The friezes were designed by George Unger, in collaboration with Walter Ahlschlager, and carved by Léon Hermant. The figures are costumed in the period of the building, which is that of an old fortress in Mesopotamia in Xerxes time, about 5th century BC. The theme of the panels as explained by Mr. Unger, was inspired by the history of construction of any building. The south panel starts the story. Here a magnificent cortege is displayed. This panel, termed Contribution, signifies the getting together of treasures for the construction of the building. In the west panel, facing Michigan Avenue, a ruler is shown with his counselors and an architect is shown bringing in a model of the building planned. The north panel shows the consecration of the building after it has been built. A priest is sacrificing a white bull whose blood will be mixed with <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> and poured into the earth. A monkey trainer and his animals are shown. Since the animals represented bigotry in the ancient drawings, they are shown here in leash as symbolic belief that bigotry has no place in the Masonic order.”) The figures in all three scenes are said to be modeled after the faces of club members {{at the time of its}} design. Three Sumerian warriors were also carved into the facade at the twelfth-floor setback, directly above the Michigan Avenue entrance, and remain visible today.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the quality of hen eggs changes after adding <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds in the compound feed of the hens. Grape seeds are formed as a side product during wine making processes and contain large amounts of biologically active substances and suitable acids, which can improve the feed conversion and subsequently also improve the technological properties of eggs. With processing of grape seeds the effective utilization of crop residues in vineyards comes about. The experiment was conducted in two experimental periods and in each period 100 laying hens were surveyed. They were separated into two groups an experimental and a control one. In the control group the hens were fed with a standard mixture of N 2 feed and in the experimental group there was a supplement of 5 weight percent of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds in the compound feed. Eggs were collected daily and once every two weeks an analysis of technological properties of eggs was conducted. The results of the experiment showed that the addition of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds containing a biologically active substance did not have a statistically significant effect on the quality and selected technological parameters of eggs...|$|R
2500|$|Over the years, {{winemaking}} {{techniques have}} evolved.

Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as [...] "manipulating" [...] or [...] "adulterating" [...] the wine from its natural or [...] "authentic state". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered too much manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as [...] "fraud".

So many of the grapes are harvested and manufactured in common that it is necessary the vintage should begin on a fixed day, and no one was allowed to anticipate or postpone. Some cut the grapes, and dropped them into the flattish wooden barrels, which others, after mashing the berries with a long wooden pestle, bore off and emptied frothing and gurgling into big casks mounted on carts. These were then driven into the village, where the mess was poured into the presses, and the wine crushed out to the last bitter dregs. The vineyards were a scene of activity, but not hilarity, though a little way off they looked rather lively with the vintagers at work in them. We climbed to one of them far up the mountain-side one day, where a family were gathering the grapes on a slope almost as steep as a house roof, father, mother, daughter, son-in-law, big boy, and big girl all silently busy together. There were bees and wasps humming around the tubs of <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> in the pale afternoon sun; the view of the lake and the mountains was inspiring; but there was nothing bacchanalian in the affair, unless the thick calves of the girl, as she bent over to cut the clusters, suggested a Mænad fury. These poor people were quite songless, though I am bound to say that in another vineyard I did hear some of the children singing. It had momentarily stopped raining; but it soon began again, and the vintage went sorrowfully on in the mud. All Villeneuve smelt of the harsh juice and pulp arriving from the fields in the wagons, carts, tubs, and barrels which crowded the streets and sidewalks, and in divers cavernous basements the presses were at work, and there was a slop and drip of new wine everywhere. After dark the people came in from the fields and gossiped about their doors, and the red light of flitting lanterns blotched the steady rainpour. Outside of the village rose the black mountains, white at the top with their snows.|$|E

50|$|A {{wine press}} is a device used to extract juice from <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> during wine making. There {{are a number}} of {{different}} styles of presses that are used by wine makers but their overall functionality is the same. Each style of press exerts controlled pressure in order to free the juice from the fruit (most often grapes). The pressure must be controlled, especially with grapes, in order to avoid crushing the seeds and releasing a great deal of undesirable tannins into the wine. Wine was being made at least as long ago as 6000 BC; in 2011, a wine press was unearthed in Armenia with red wine dated 6,000 years old.|$|E
50|$|Other {{experts think}} tannins are {{the cause of}} RWH. Tannins are the {{flavonoids}} in wine that give its degree of mouth-drying bitterness.

The skins also impart color to wine, which is why red wines typically have a lot more tannin than whites. Red wines are fermented while in contact with the skins and seeds. Modern winemakers take care to minimize undesirable tannins from seeds by <b>crushing</b> <b>grapes</b> gently when extracting their juice.|$|R

This is the process used in the production of Beaujolais nouveau wines. To an extent, most wines were historically treated to some form of semi or partial carbonic fermentation (as noted in history section above) with the amount dependent on the shape and size of the vessel that the grapes were stored in prior to crushing.
