5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}.

Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Johansen rapidly climbed {{prospect}} charts for the 2010 NHL Draft, {{starting the}} year as a potential second round selection, before rising to 16th among North American skaters when the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) released its mid-season ranking. Johansen's coach with Penticton noted that, {{as one of the}} younger players of his draft class, his skill was often overlooked. NHL scouts praised his speed, playmaking ability and vision on the ice but believed he needed to show more <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> physicality. He had been compared to Ottawa Senators centre Jason Spezza, while Johansen had said he tried to model his game after San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton. He finished the season as the tenth ranked skater according to Central Scouting and was projected to be a top 20 pick, perhaps as high as top 10. With the fourth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Johansen was chosen by the Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E

Cobie Smulders guest stars, reprising her role of Maria Hill from The Avengers, with previous Whedon collaborators J. August Richards and Ron Glass also guest starring. Emphasis was put on <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> continuity with the MCU films, and some elements are reused from the films throughout the episode, most notably Extremis.

5|$|Murray {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} most {{intelligent}} tacticians on the court, often constructing points. Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts of his game, include a well-disguised drop shot and his net game. As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal, although hard courts are his preferred surface. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid, as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure, especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.|$|E
5|$|Rivera was a {{dominant}} reliever throughout his career, pitching with a <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> longevity uncharacteristic {{of a role}} commonly marked by volatility and high turnover. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is the major leagues' all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most in AL history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen non-consecutive); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen non-consecutive); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). Rivera's career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making {{him one of the}} top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons (minimum 60innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.|$|E
