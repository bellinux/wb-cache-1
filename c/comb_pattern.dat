50|$|The {{culture is}} {{noted for its}} ceramic vessels with tipped or beet-shaped bottom, {{thin-walled}} and thoroughly dressed, later supplanted by more thick-walled round- and flattened-bottom. Vessel ornamentation is dominated by jagged and smooth lines, and <b>comb</b> <b>pattern,</b> sometimes with grid, triangle, and zig-zag decorations. The ornamentation technique is close {{to that of the}} Kelteminar monuments of Central Asia and the Afanasevo culture of Altai. In rare cases, vessels have print-comb ornamentation, more typical to the Chalcolithic art of the Eastern Urals and Tumen-Ob region. Thick-walled vessels are sometimes covered with textile patterns, rows of pearls, and rarely pits. The discovery of a metal awl in the remains of a house allowed confident attribution of the Bolshemys complexes to the Eneolithic Age. In the Eneolithic layers, the number of bifaces, arrowheads, and large plates is five to ten times greater compared to the Neolithic layers. Bolshemys people lived in light surface dwellings.|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the global {{electronics}} manufacture environment has brought about the onset {{of a variety of}} new, untested materials and processing chemicals. The interactions between substrates and processing chemicals that can occur during manufacture, storage and use must be assessed in order to determine long-term reliability. Surface insulation resistance (SIR) testing is a standard industry technique used to assess the interactions between processing chemicals (e. g., soldering fluxes) and substrates. SIR test method conditions vary in terms of the temperature and the humidity used to accelerate the normal failure modes. Typically, a 45 to 50 volt bias is applied to an interdigitated <b>comb</b> <b>pattern,</b> and periodic SIR measurements are made using a 100 volt test. Pass/fail criteria based solely on SIR electrical values, (e. g., 100 MΩ) however are inadequate. Often the electrical measurement fails to reveal the presence of surface dendrites due to contaminants related to processing chemicals. This failure occurs because the dendrite burns out between electrical readings when the circuit continues to be biased at 50 volts. A new “linear test circuit ” has been developed to overcome this deficiency. The circuit uses an operational amplifier to detect the formation of a surface dendrite between electrodes on the <b>comb</b> <b>pattern.</b> When the dendrite shorts the circuit, voltage to the <b>comb</b> <b>pattern</b> is removed. Thus, the presence of the dendrite is captured electrically, and the dendrite is preserved for further analysis. This paper will present the circuit used and data showing its ’ effectiveness at detecting both surface dendrites and subsurface conductive anodic filament formation...|$|E

50|$|There are {{basically}} two different classes of digital music which create very different {{demands for a}} pitch detection algorithm: monophonic music and polyphonic music. Monophonic music is a passage with only one instrument playing one note at a time, while polyphonic music can have multiple instruments and vocals playing at once. Pitch detection upon a monophonic recording was a relatively simple task, and its technology enabled the invention of guitar tuners in the 1970s. However, pitch detection upon polyphonic music becomes {{a much more difficult}} task because the image of its spectrogram now appears as a vague cloud due to a multitude of overlapping <b>comb</b> <b>patterns,</b> caused by each note's multiple harmonics.|$|R
50|$|The term safety razor {{was first}} used in 1880 and {{described}} a basic razor with a handle attached to a head where a removable blade may be placed.

The double-edged safety razor is a razor with a slant bar that can be used on both sides, with two open edges. The blade on the double-edged safety razor is slightly curved to allow for a smoother and cleaner shave.|$|R

40|$|Fiber optics {{are widely}} used in {{flexible}} endoscopes which are indispensable for many applications in diagnosis and therapy.

Hence, the images suffer from false colored spatial moiré, which is further stressed by the downgrading fiber optic transmission yielding a honey <b>comb</b> <b>pattern.</b> To solve this problem we propose a new approach that extends the interpolation between known intensities of registered fibers to multi channel color applications. The inventive idea takes into account both the Gaussian intensity distribution of each fiber and the physical color distribution of the Bayer pattern.

30|$|Miyamoto’s {{scenario}} {{for the third}} dispersion {{is consistent with the}} {{scenario for}} the introduction of wet rice cultivation into the Korean peninsula provided by Ahn (2010). Ahn discusses and dismisses claims for very early rice cultivation in the Korean peninsula and finds inconclusive evidence for rice cultivation during the Chŭlmun (<b>comb</b> <b>pattern)</b> period (ca. 6000 – 1300  BCE). Previous researchers (e.g., Crawford and Lee 2003) concur on the evidence for Chŭlmun cultivation of Setaria and Panicum diffused from the Liaoning region, consistent with the Shandong/Liaodong dispersion hypothesis. Ahn argues against earlier views that wet rice cultivation was introduced into the Korean peninsula from the south, and concludes in favor of the scenario where it enters the peninsula from Liaodong in the early Mumun period around or after 1500  BCE. Thereafter, evidence for agricultural settlements engaged in rice farming is found throughout the peninsula {{with the exception of the}} northeast. The relative importance of wet rice cultivation shows regional variation throughout the Mumun period: wet rice is dominant in the central and southwest regions, while millet and other dry field crops are relatively more important in the southeast (Ahn 2010 : 93).|$|E

50|$|Through {{the whole}} Siberian prehistoric period from the Neolithic until the Iron Age, {{there are a}} very limited range of ceramic types. The vast {{majority}} of ceramic finds are round bulbous vessels, often with folded edges. In the Neolithic they mostly had concave bases, while later flat bases became more common. In {{the eastern part of}} the west Siberian forest steppe, on the Ob, Irtysh and Yenissei, decoration consisted of <b>comb</b> <b>patterns,</b> puncture rows and dimples, arranged in long series or fields (right image). In the course of the dramatic growth of the Andronovo culture in the middle Bronze Age, another type spread through the region. Examples of it are decorated with meander bands, herringbone patterns and triangles (left image). These ceramic types endured even into the Iron Age in west Siberia, yet a stark decline in decoration is pservable, contemporary with the entrance of the Scythian and Hunnic Sarmatian nomads.

40|$|Multileaf collimators (MLCs) are {{becoming}} increasingly important for beam shaping and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Their unique design can introduce subtle effects in the patient/phantom dose distribution. The PEREGRINE 3 D Monte Carlo dose calculation system predicts dose by implementing a full Monte Carlo simulation of the beam delivery and patient/phantom system. As such, it provides a powerful tool to explore dosimetric effects of MLC designs. We have installed a new MLC modeling package into PEREGRINE. This package simulates full photon and electron transport in the MLC and includes tongue-and-groove construction and curved or straight leaf ends in the leaf shape geometry. We tested {{the accuracy of the}} PEREGRINE MLC package by comparing PEREGRINE predictions with ion chamber, diode, and photographic film measurements taken with a Varian 2 1 OOC using 6 and 18 MV photon beams.

Our results demonstrate PEREGRINE's accuracy for modeling MLC characteristics, and suggest that PEREGRINE would be an ideal tool to explore issues such as (1) underdosing between leaves due to the ''tongue-and-groove'' effect when dose from multiple MLC patterns are added together, (2) radiation leakage in the bullnose region, and (3) dose under a single leaf due to scatter in the patient...|$|R

Nevertheless, the breakthrough of endoscopy came not until the development of Bozzinis "Lichtleiter".

By the integration of video sensors at the proximal or distal end of rigid or flexible endoscopes, it became possible {{in the last quarter of}} the last century to observe {{the inside of the}} human body not only via the ocular, but also to capture and use still images and video sequences for documentation, research and education, independent from the presence of the patients. Furthermore, the meanwhile well advanced age of digital technologies facilitates the possibility, not only to transmit and store endoscopically acquired images and sequences from inside the human body in real time through the internet towards almost every arbitrary computer, but likewise opens the currently unused possibilities, to manipulate these images for a modified view for the operator, and furthermore condition, evaluate and analyze them using computers. Specifically, the new possibilities to automatically analyze the content of endoscopic imagery and the application of the extracted information for enhanced documentation, diagnosis and treatment shall be sketched out in this contribution.
