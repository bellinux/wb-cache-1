25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog the hooks and loops or they can wear out with use, requiring the use of <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes</b> for clearing the Velcro as part of daily maintenance. Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|R
50|$|It was {{established}} by the Danish immigrant Wilhelm Jordan as W. Jordan Börste & Penselfabrik in 1837. Originally a manufacturer of combs, the company expanded into brushes. In 1927 it took up toothbrush manufacturing, {{with an emphasis on}} international export from 1960. From 1966 it also produced toothpicks. It now produces dental hygiene products as well as painting <b>brushes</b> and <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes.</b> Jordan has also acquires companies like dental floss producer Peri-dent (in 1987).|$|R

The vz. 58 {{also has a}} proprietary bipod, flash hider and scope mount for NSP-2 night vision scope (vz.58 Pi variant). Grenade launching inserts, as well as under barrel grenade launchers were developed but never adopted.|$|E
50|$|Although {{keeping a}} tape drive clean is important, normal {{cleaning}} cartridges are abrasive and frequent use will shorten the drive's lifespan. LTO drives have an internal tape head <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> that is activated when a cartridge is inserted. When {{a more thorough}} cleaning is required the drive signals this on its display and/or via Tape Alert flags. Cleaning cartridge lifespan is usually from 15 to 50 cleanings. There are 2 basic methods of initiating a cleaning of a drive: robot cleaning and software cleaning.|$|E

Unscrew the thumb screws and remove the bipod feet from the traversing plate; then remove the barrel assembly ball out of the socket in the base plate. Remove the collar which attaches the bipod to the barrel. To assemble the weapon, proceed in the reverse order.|$|E
5000|$|The {{string trimmer}} {{was invented in}} the early 1970s by George Ballas of Houston, Texas, who {{conceived}} the idea while watching the revolving action of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes</b> in an automatic car wash. His first trimmer was made by attaching pieces of heavy-duty fishing line to a popcorn can bolted to an edger. Ballas developed this into {{what he called the}} [...] "Weed Eater", since it chewed up the grass and weeds around trees.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} Opinels have been offered over the years. A few are sold more for their novelty value than for practical purposes, such as Le Géant. Besides the Slim Effile series and the Couteau du Jardin, Opinel also offers a hawkbill-bladed pruning knife designed {{for use in the}} garden or vineyard, and a large folding wood saw with locking blade using the same Virobloc mechanism as found on large Opinel knives. For the kitchen, the company sells vegetable peelers, chefs knives, paring knives, knives with corkscrews (couteau tire-bouchon), and prep knives for the kitchen, including a mushroom knife (couteau à champignon), with an integral boar's hair <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A Turk's head brush {{is a type}} of <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> {{where the}} {{bristles}} are arranged covering the end of the stem as a half-sphere, so {{that the end of the}} stem does not come into direct contact with the surface being cleaned, especially when cleaning the inside of a cylindrical object. A larger type, mounted on a long stem and used for removing cobwebs, is called a Turk's head broom. The name has long been in use for this type of brush, so named because its cleaning end resembles a [...] "wild" [...] head of hair. Turk's head brushes and brooms are used for domestic purposes, for cleaning artillery, for pharmaceutical use, for sweeping chimneys, and for other purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Installing and {{deploying}} large covers can be labour-intensive task. The {{most efficient}} way involves rolling and unrolling each section separately, and storing them on the gym floor cover storage system (rack) in a rolled up state to prevent creases and static dust accumulation. Advances in the newer Protex GymPro products allow for smaller storage racks while the newer tile systems are stacked on compact platform trucks for storage and transport. Dual <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers while the carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using the Host Cleaning method with the covers still in place.|$|E
50|$|Accessories for bottles include <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes</b> {{and drying}} racks. Brushes may be {{specially}} {{designed for a}} specific manufacturer's bottles and teats. Bottle warmers warm previously made and refrigerated formula. Coolers designed to fit a specific manufacturer's bottles are available to keep refrigerated formula cold. Special formula powder containers are available to store pre-measured amounts of formula so that caregivers can pre-fill bottles with sterile water and mix in the powder easily. The containers are typically designed to stack together so that multiple pre-measured amounts of formula powder may be transported as a unit.|$|R
50|$|Mineral {{spirits are}} an {{inexpensive}} petroleum-based {{replacement for the}} vegetable-based turpentine. It is commonly used as a paint thinner for oil-based paint and <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes,</b> and as an organic solvent in other applications. Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of pinene, and it has inferior solvent properties. Artists use mineral spirits {{as an alternative to}} turpentine since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of mineral spirits than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.|$|R

50|$|Hi-Point {{semi-automatic}} pistols are polymer {{framed and}} {{generally regarded as}} simple, inexpensive handguns, which trade-off aesthetics for lower manufacturing cost. Based on a simple blowback design, Hi-Point pistols {{do not have a}} breech-locking system like most handguns. Instead they have large, heavy slides that hold the breech closed through sheer mass. The result is a heavier gun, for its size, that is bulkier and may be less aesthetically appealing than designs employing recoil operation. While making the pistols heavier, this design also makes them mechanically simple and easy to maintain. Hi-Point recommends hosing out the action with a powder solvent like Break Free Powder Blast, Rem Oil or another aerosol solvent, then every 300-400 rounds running a <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> through the barrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{screening}} {{motion is}} recordable and optimal operating data are reproducible {{at any time}} eventuating to constant product quality. For better results the feeding rates, inclination angles and shaft eccentricity have to be adjusted properly.The surface qualities of the tumbler screening machines range from glass beaded to electrically polishes finish. The deck lifting devices may be manual or pneumatic. Tumbler screening machine having round body is suitable for operating with various types of mechanically driven cleaning devices. These systems {{have a range of}} rotating cleaning systems depending on the product specific mesh such as bouncing ball cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning, combined ultrasonic and balls, air <b>cleaning,</b> <b>brush</b> cleaning, combination of ultrasonic and balls or air and brushes.To maximize the screening efficiency the double screening machine or double screening machine with pre-screening are available for handling bulk materials.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, {{in the direction of}} the grooves. Distilled water (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, lint-free cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press). A simple [...] "cleaning bath" [...] device called the Spin Clean gives good results, and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning. In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record. Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it. Though in the past, using alcohol on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer. As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.|$|E
50|$|Frustrated {{with the}} {{available}} products that damaged his brushes when he cleaned them, in 1954, Zimmerman invented a new <b>brush</b> <b>cleaning</b> system which he named “Silicoil”. Silicoil became so popular with artists that Zimmerman patented {{the system and}} formed the Lion Company, Incorporated to manufacture and distribute the product domestically and internationally. Today - after over 50 years in the market - Silicoil {{remains one of the}} leading <b>brush</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems.|$|R
30|$|Chemicals are {{released}} to the environment during production, use, and waste management of products. This release has to be restricted by regulations and limit values securing human health and minimizing negative impacts on the environment. In spite of this effort, {{it is also clear}} that zero emissions are not possible and thus it is necessary to focus on the main exposure routes to achieve a better protection. The example of CdS containing paint pigments clearly shows that it is necessary to include both natural sciences and socioeconomic aspects for a meaningful decision. It also demonstrates the importance of including the consumers into the risk assessment as in this case release to the waste water can easily be avoided, in this case by not <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes</b> with artists’ paints under the tap.|$|R
40|$|Dental <b>cleaning</b> and {{polishing}} <b>brushes</b> are very {{often used in}} dental offices and mostly contaminated by a mixture of prophylaxis paste, blood and saliva. To prevend a transfer of infectious agents at anew usage, {{it is necessary to}} reprocess the instruments before the next usage. This dissertation examines, whether the manufacturers of dental <b>cleaning</b> {{and polishing}} <b>brushes</b> provide instructions on reprocessing and if they adhere to the references of the Robert Koch-Institute. Only two of four examined manufacturers provided instructions on automatic reprocessing, which completely adhere to the references of the Robert Koch-Institute. For manual reprocessing, only one of eight manufacturers provided instructions which completely adhere to the references of the Robert Koch-Institute. Thus the majority of manufacturers provide incorrect and non-complete reprocessing instructions for dental <b>cleaning</b> and polishing <b>brushes</b> and a potential risk for patient-to-patient transmission may still exist...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies (FBs) discovered in adults {{are the result}} of intentional ingestion, most of which are found in patients with a preexisting psychiatric illness, with substance abuse disorders, or in people seeking secondary gain. No similar case of internal injuries following unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristle has been reported. A 58 -year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b> The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristle atypically presenting with halitosis. Physicians’ awareness of this potential injury from grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristles would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b> Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes...|$|E
