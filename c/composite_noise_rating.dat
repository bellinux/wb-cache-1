40|$|Error {{correction}} {{and message}} authentication are well {{studied in the}} literature, and various efficient solutions have been suggested and analyzed. This is however {{not the case for}} data streams in which the message is very long, possibly infinite, and not known in advance to the sender. Trivial solutions for error-correcting and authenticating data streams either suffer from a long delay at the receiver’s end or cannot perform well when the communication channel is noisy. In this work we suggest a constant-rate error-correction scheme and an efficient authentication scheme for data streams over a noisy channel (one-way communication, no feedback) in the shared-randomness model. Our first scheme does not assume shared randomness and (non-efficiently) recovers a (1 [*]−[*] 2 c) -fraction prefix of the stream sent so far, assuming the noise level is at most c[*]<[*] 1 / 2. The length of the recovered prefix is tight. To be able to overcome the c[*]=[*] 1 / 2 barrier we relax the model and assume the parties pre-share a secret key. Under this assumption we show that for any given <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> c[*]<[*] 1, there exists a scheme that correctly decodes a (1 [*]−[*]c) -fraction of the stream sent so far with high probability, and moreover, the scheme is efficient. Furthermore, if the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds c, the scheme aborts with high probability. We also show that no constant-rate authentication scheme recovers more than a (1 [*]−[*]c) -fraction of the stream sent so far with non-negligible probability, thus the relation between the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> and recoverable fraction of the stream is tight, and our scheme is optimal. Our techniques also apply to the task of interactive communication (two-way communication) over a noisy channel. In a recent paper, Braverman and Rao [STOC 2011] show that any function of two inputs has a constant-rate interactive protocol for two users that withstands a <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> up to 1 / 4. By assuming that the parties share a secret random string, we extend this result and construct an interactive protocol that succeeds with overwhelming probability against <b>noise</b> <b>rates</b> up to 1 / 2.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of noise from building mechanical systems with time-varying fluctuations on human task performance and perception, and to determine how well current indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> methods account for this performance and perception. Six different noise conditions with varying degrees of time-varying fluctuations, many focused in the low frequency rumble region, were reproduced in an office-like setting. Thirty participants were asked to complete typing, grammatical reasoning, and math tasks plus subjective questionnaires, while being exposed for approximately one hour to each noise condition. Results show that the noise conditions with higher sound levels (greater than 50 dBA) combined with excessive low frequency rumble as well as those with larger timescale fluctuations (i. e., a heat pump cycling on and off every 30 seconds) were generally perceived to be more annoying than the other signals tested, although statistically significant negative relationships to task performance were not found. Other findings are (1) that the noise characteristics most closely correlated to higher annoyance/distraction responses in this study were higher ratings of loudness followed by roar, rumble, and changes in time; and (2) that perception of more low frequency rumble in particular was significantly linked to reduced performance on cognitively demanding tasks. As for the ability of current indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> systems to match human performance or perception, none of the indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> methods evaluated were significantly correlated to task performance, but aspects of subjective perception such as loudness ratings were statistically related.

In this paper, we first present the problem of binary classification {{in the presence of}} random noise on the class labels, which we call class noise.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{problem of the}} transition from quantum to classical physics is usually explained by decoherence, and viewed as a gradual process. The study of entanglement, or quantum correlations, in noisy quantum computers implies {{that in some cases}} the transition from quantum to classical is actually a phase transition. We define the notion of entanglement length in $d$-dimensional noisy quantum computers, and show that a phase transition in entanglement occurs at a critical <b>noise</b> <b>rate,</b> where the entanglement length transforms from infinite to finite. Above the critical <b>noise</b> <b>rate,</b> macroscopic classical behavior is expected, whereas below the critical <b>noise</b> <b>rate,</b> subsystems which are macroscopically distant one from another can be entangled. The macroscopic classical behavior in the super-critical phase is shown to hold not only for quantum computers, but for any quantum system composed of macroscopically many finite state particles, with local interactions and local decoherence, subjected to some additional conditions. This phenomenon provides a possible explanation to the emergence of classical behavior in such systems. A simple formula for an upper bound on the entanglement length of any such system in the super-critical phase is given, which can be tested experimentally. Comment: 15 pages.
