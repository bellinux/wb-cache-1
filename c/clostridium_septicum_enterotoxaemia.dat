40|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> {{produces}} {{a number of}} diseases in human and farm animals which, {{in most of the}} cases, are fatal without clinical intervention. Alpha toxin is an important agent and the unique lethal virulent factor produced by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum.</b> This toxin is haemolytic, highly lethal and necrotizing activities but is being used as an antigen to develop animal vaccines. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate the alpha toxin of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> and produce highly specific antibodies against it. In this work, we have developed a simple and efficient method for alpha toxin purification, based on electroelution that can be used as a time-saving method for purifying proteins.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a Taqman allelic {{discrimination}} assay based on three SNPs of the TPI gene is described. It {{was used as}} a differential diagnostic tool to detect blackleg and malignant edema. Sudden deaths of grazing ruminants, such as cattle, sheep and goats, which show clinical signs related to hyperacute infective processes, encouraged the development of a rapid and precise diagnostic molecular method. Specific primers and probes for <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> and <b>Clostridium</b> chauvoei were designed {{on the basis of the}} TPI gene sequence. The multiplex PCR was tested on the DNA of a total of 57 strains, including 24 Clostridium chauvoei, 20 <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum,</b> 1 Bacillus anthracis and 12 other Clostridium spp. The DNA samples from Clostridium chauvoei and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> strains were amplified.

To avoid misdiagnosis, a confirmatory assay based on a Sybr green real time PCR was proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Five {{cases of}} postparturient {{vulvovaginitis}} and metritis in cattle caused by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> (malignant edema) {{are described in}} the current report. The diagnosis was established based on detection of C. septicum by culture and fluorescent antibody test. All animals were Holsteins, and 4 were primiparous (the parity of 1 animal was not reported). All animals developed clinical signs 1 – 3 days after calving, consisting of swelling of perineal and perivulvar areas, fever, and depression. Perineal, perivulvar, and perivaginal gelatinous and often hemorrhagic edema was consistently observed on gross examination. Longitudinal vulvar, vaginal, cervical, and uterine body tears, covered by fibrinous exudates, were also present. Microscopically, vulvar, vaginal, and uterine mucosae were multifocally necrotic and ulcerated. Large Gram-positive rods, some with subterminal spores, were present within the edematous subcutaneous and submucosal tissues. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> was demonstrated by culture and/or fluorescent antibody test in tissues of most animals.

Cefbuperazone, cefoxitin, and moxalactam had poor activity against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, and Bacteroides distasonis. The susceptibility of other Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Eubacterium lentum was variable.

Cellulitis continues to cause extensive losses in turkey production in USA due to severe mortality, carcass condemnation and treatment costs. Clostridium perfringens and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> {{have been recognized}} as the primary causative agents of cellulitis in turkeys. In this study, cellulitis lesions and mortality in turkeys were successfully reproduced with Clostridium perfringens and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> isolated from cellulitis cases. Clostridium perfringens and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> isolates varied {{in their ability to}} produce spores as well as toxins. We observed differences in the toxicity and biological effects of different strains of C. perfringens and C. septicum in vitro, and in vivo.. Though the spore count and hemolytic effects of C. perfringens were found to be higher than C. septicum in vitro, mortality studies in mice and turkeys showed that C. septicum was much more potent than C. perfringens. However, gross lesions produced by C. perfringens and C. septicum were almost identical. Surprisingly, the development of cellulitis lesions and mortality was markedly higher in 7 -week-old birds than in 3 -week-old birds. The results of our study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} both C. perfringens and C. septicum can multiply in the subcutaneous and muscle tissues and cause cellulitis lesions in turkeys. Our cellulitis disease model offers promise as a challenge model in the development of vaccines against cellulitis in turkeys. Both bivalent C. perfringens and C. septicum toxoid and C. septicum toxoid were found to be safe and offered complete protection against cellulitis following homologous challenge under experimental conditions. The use of these vaccines enabled us to reduce the mortality and antibiotic usage in preventing cellulitis in commercial turkeys. Multiple vaccinations or use of a day old vaccine followed by a booster dose probably will offer better protection than a single vaccination at 6 -weeks of age against cellulitis due to C. perfringens and C. septicum in turkeys...|$|R
