Being a descendant of Sophia of Hanover, and having rights under the Act of Settlement 1701, as amended by the Sophia Naturalisation Act 1705, he was naturalised as a British citizen in October 1947 under the name Mr. Friedrich von Preussen (having also been known during residence in the UK as [...] "George Mansfield"). This naturalization was controversial to some, and his status and a subsequent claim for compensation was debated in Parliament and the law courts until 1961. In the period 1917-32, it was settled that a person who had a foreign title would normally undertake to relinquish it before he/she could receive a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> British <b>naturalization,</b> and no exception was made in the case of Mr. Friedrich von Preussen.|$|R

Finally, on August 9, 2004, the United States government filed suit to revoke Geiser's citizenship. On September 29, 2006, US District Court Judge David S. Cercone of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ordered the revocation of Geiser's US citizenship, citing Title 8 Chapter 12 § 1451(a) of the US Code, which states that citizenship should be revoked and the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>naturalization</b> canceled [...] "on the ground that such order and <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>naturalization</b> were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation".

60|$|The {{status of}} {{children}} born of American parents residing {{in a foreign}} country, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizens residing abroad where such question is not regulated by treaty, are all sources of frequent difficulty and discussion. Legislation on these and similar questions, and particularly defining when {{and under what circumstances}} expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, is especially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization. The United States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may come in good faith to reside within its limits on their complying with certain prescribed reasonable and simple formalities and conditions. Among the highest duties of the Government is that to afford firm, sufficient, and equal protection to all its citizens, whether native born or naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying with it such support from the Government should not be fraudulently obtained, and should be bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance with the law; and yet frequent instances are {{brought to the attention of}} the Government of illegal and fraudulent <b>naturalization</b> and <b>of</b> the unauthorized use <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulent character <b>of</b> the <b>naturalization</b> has appeared upon the face <b>of</b> the <b>certificate</b> itself; in others examination discloses that the holder had not complied with the law, and in others certificates have been obtained where the persons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but had not even been within the United States at the time <b>of</b> the pretended <b>naturalization.</b> Instances <b>of</b> each of these classes of fraud are discovered at our legations, where the <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>naturalization</b> are presented either for the purpose of obtaining passports or in demanding the protection of the legation. When the fraud is apparent on the face <b>of</b> such <b>certificates,</b> they are taken up by the representatives of the Government and forwarded to the Department of State. But even then the record of the court in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Upon the presentation of these for the issue of passports or in demanding protection of the Government, the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates are not infrequently used in transactions of business to the deception and injury of innocent parties. Without placing any additional obstacles in the way of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestly recommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the ready cancellation of the record <b>of</b> every <b>naturalization</b> made in fraud.|$|R
60|$|The United States, {{with great}} liberality, offers its {{citizenship}} {{to all who}} in good faith {{comply with the requirements}} of law. These requirements are as simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilege to which he is admitted can or should permit. I do not propose any additional requirements to those which the law now demands; but the very simplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have made fraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to the discredit and injury of all honest citizens, whether native or naturalized. Cases of this character are continually being brought to the notice of the Government by our representatives abroad, and also those of persons resident in other countries, most frequently those who, if they have remained in this country long enough to entitle them to become naturalized, have generally not much overpassed that period, and have returned to the country of their origin, where they reside, avoiding all duties to the United States by their absence, and claiming to be exempt from all duties to the country of their nativity and of their residence by reason <b>of</b> their alleged <b>naturalization.</b> It is due to this Government itself and to the great mass of the naturalized citizens who entirely, both in name and in fact, become citizens of the United States that the high privilege of citizenship of the United States should not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws and of the good name of every honest citizen. On many occasions it has been brought to the knowledge of the Government that <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>naturalization</b> are held and protection or interference claimed by parties who admit that not only they were not within the United States at the time <b>of</b> the pretended <b>naturalization,</b> but that they have never resided in the United States; in others the <b>certificate</b> and record <b>of</b> the court show on their face that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided the required time in the United States; in others it is admitted upon examination that the requirements of law have not been complied with; in some cases, even, such certificates have been matter of purchase. These are not isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common occurrence, and which are reported from all quarters of the globe. Such occurrences can not, and do not, fail to reflect upon the Government and injure all honest citizens. Such a fraud being discovered, however, there is no practicable means within the control of the Government by which the record <b>of</b> <b>naturalization</b> can be vacated; and should the certificate be taken up, as it usually is, by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the Government to whom it may have been presented, there is nothing to prevent the person claiming to have been naturalized from obtaining a new certificate from the court in place of that which has been taken from him.|$|R
