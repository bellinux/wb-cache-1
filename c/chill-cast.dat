40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that there are model materials which can be used to develop better assumptions to improve theories, to verify the applicability of theories, or to get creep information which is otherwise unobtain-able. The mechanical properties necessary to characterize non-linear component behaviour are defined and presented for some <b>chill-cast</b> lead alloys at 20 °C. When normalized, they are shown to be suffciently similar to structural steels to allow the prediction of prototype response from model tests.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} {{at the design stage}} {{to predict the}} creep behaviour of components and structures operating at high temperature. The direct calculation of the creep behaviour requires extensive material data for the long service lives of the components and engineering methods are needed to minimise the amount of data needed. This can be achieved in some cases by use of the so called Reference stress method and the objective of this work was the experimental prediction of the creep deformation of some components using developments of this idea. It has been achieved by the determination of Reference stresses from accelerated room temperature creep tests of lead alloy models. Reference stresses, which characterise the creep response of components in relation to uniaxial tests, have previously been determined by calculation. Reference stresses determined by the new experimental methods have been compared with analytical predictions for beams in pure bending, cantilevers, thin cylinders and thin spheres under internal pressure. Acceptable agreement was found for the Reference stresses and consequent predictions of creep deformations. The method has also been used successfully to predict creep strains in a cylindrical pressure vessel with a hemispherical end. The methods of <b>chill-casting</b> models from a lead-antimony-arsenic alloy have been improved and the material has been calibrated by constant and stepped load, uniaxial and biaxial (combined pressure and torsion of thin cylinders) tests. The creep strains cannot be characterised by separate. stress and time functions; a strain hardening law best describes its stepped load response; the von-Mises criterion gives accurate predictions of creep strains in the tension-compression quadrant but underestimates the creep strains in the tension-tension quadrant...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of aluminium alloys}} capable of elevated temperature service by utilization of Rapid Solidification (RS) processing techniques has been an area of intense study during the past decade. The ternary alloy system, Al-Cr-Fe, has displayed very promising mechanical properties when produced by an evaporation-vapour deposition technique, but little indication exists of whether similar properties may be achievable by using other, more commercially applicable, RS techniques. This work comprises {{a study of the}} microstructure and tensile properties of a range of Al-Cr-Fe alloys (Al- 2. 93 to 8. 43 wt% Cr- 0. 67 to 2. 07 wt% Fe) processed by high pressure gas atomisation (HPGA), supplemented by additional experiments using melt-spinning and <b>chill-casting</b> techniques in order to allow the effects {{of a wide range of}} cooling rates (< 1 k/s to 106 K/s) to be examined. A series of binary Al-Cr alloys (Al- 1. 99 to 5. 50 wt% Cr) were also processed in order to facilitate comparison with the ternary alloys. The variety of microstructures observed in the atomised powders were consistent with the different cooling rates and nucleation temperatures experienced by droplets of different diameters. The cooling rate necessary to suppress formation of the Ali 3 Cr 2 phase was found to be consistently higher in the ternary alloys than in the corresponding binaries. No evidence was found of partitionless solidification having occurred in the Al-Cr-Fe powders, the estimated solidification front velocities being insufficient to prevent the partitioning of the iron to the infinity-aluminimum cell boundaries. The infinity-aluminium phase was found to be divided into two co-existing, but distinct, solid solutions with different chromium solute levels. A fine spherical phase was observed in the finest particles of the most concentrated alloy (Al- 8. 43 wt% Cr- 1. 26 wt % Fe), which was found to be similar to the icosahedral phase identified in the melt-spun ribbon. A relationship has been determined between the thickness of wedge shaped chill castings and powder particle diameters for similar microstructural transitions. A procedure is proposed by which the determination of alloy compositions designed to give a particular microstructure in a specific powder size fraction can be accomplished by a simple chill casting technique. The mechanical properties of the atomised powders consolidated by extrusion have been determined and related to the microstructures and strengthening mechanisms operative in the materials. A large contribution to the strength of the extruded materials is derived from their fine grain size. However, none of the atomised Al-Cr-Fe alloys matched the properties obtained in the Al- 7. 5 wt% Cr- 1. 2 wt% Fe alloy material produced by the vapour deposition technique. None of the alloys investigated retained its strength after prolonged thermal exposure at or above 350 °C, nor possessed adequate tensile strength properties at 350 °C. The results do suggest, however, that a service temperature of 300 °C may be possible...|$|R
40|$|The global {{trend towards}} energy {{efficiency}} and environmental sustainability has generated a strong demand for clean energy technologies. Among the many energy solutions, the work in this dissertation contributes to two strategic goals: the reduction of fuel consumption in the transportation sector, and the increase of domestic wind power capacity. The key barriers to achieving these goals are materials challenges. Automobiles can be made more efficient by thermoelectric conversion of waste heat from the engine into electricity {{that can be used}} to power electrical components in the vehicle. Vehicles can forego petroleum fuel altogether by using electric or hybrid motors. Unfortunately, the conversion efficiency of current thermoelectric technology is too low to be considered economically feasible, and the permanent magnets used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators require critical rare-earth elements that are economically unstable (often referred to as the "rare- earth crisis"). In order to combat these challenges, a "spark erosion" technique was utilized for producing nanoparticles that improve thermoelectric efficiency and contribute to the development of electromotors that do not require rare-earths. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I describe the utilization of spark erosion for producing high-quality thermoelectric nanoparticles at a remarkably high rate and with enhanced thermoelectric properties. The technique was employed to synthesize p-type bismuth- antimony telluride (BST) and n-type skutterudite nanoparticles, using a relatively small laboratory apparatus, with low energy consumption. The compacted BST nanocomposite samples made from these nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined, 20 - 50 nm size nanograin microstructure, and show an enhanced Figure of merit, ZT, of 1. 36 at 360 K due to a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. The skutterudite nanocomposites also show reduced thermal conductivity but still require enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor. Such a technique is essential for providing inexpensive, oxidation-free nanoparticles required for fabricating high performance thermoelectric devices for power generation from waste heat, and for refrigeration. We have investigated the spark erosion of MnBi, a promising rare-earth-free permanent magnet, and have determined that spark erosion provides the best approach for producing MnBi particles. The low-temperature phase of MnBi (LTP-MnBi) is an attractive rare-earth free permanent magnet material due it its high uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which produces an unusually high coercivity at the elevated temperatures required for motor and generators. However, due to the peritectic Mn-Bi phase diagram and the slow interdiffusion of Mn and Bi below the 350 °C phase change temperature, bulk samples of LTP-MnBi with high saturation magnetization (MS) have been difficult to achieve. In Chapter 3, we describe the successful formation of high- purity bulk LTP-MnBi ingots and spark erosion of this material to produce single-domain particles of MnBi at an unprecedented rate. The bulk ingots have MS > 90 wt % of LTP-MnBi, and are formed by <b>chill-casting</b> and by vacuum- annealing of arc-melted ingots. The as-prepared powder then consists of amorphous, crystalline, and superparamagnetic particles, mostly as porous aggregates. The major fraction of the powder consists of 20 - 30 nm particles. A short anneal crystallizes the amorphous particles producing a high moment, albeit with HC of only a few kOe. If lightly milled, the agglomerates are broken up and yield an HC of 1 T and a maximum energy product of 3. 0 MGOe. The particles can be further engineered through milling, annealing, and/or solution processing in order to produce unique properties that hold promise to achieving the first bulk permanent magnet that utilizes the ex...|$|R

The microstructural evolution in <b>chill-cast</b> and directionally solidified Ti- 44 Al- 11 Nb (at. %) was studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. From this data, the microstructural distribution and formation sequences of various phases like Al 3 Ti, TiAl, and Ti 3 Al were established. The elemental and phase distributions were determined by TEM with {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX) and spectrum imaging. Both casting techniques produced the same phases, (Al 3 Ti, TiAl, and Ti 3 Al with some Nb in solid solution), but the microstructural distribution was markedly different. The chill-casting technique resulted in a coarser microstructure, with large gamma crystals and duplex regions of either (gamma + alpha 2) or (gamma + Al 3 Ti) interspersed throughout the alloy.

40|$|Unmodified, Na-modified, and Sr-modified {{castings}} of Al- 7 pct Si and Al- 12. 5 pct Si alloys {{were cast}} in molds {{in which it}} was possible to create different cooling conditions. It is shown how solidification influences the distribution of porosity at the surface and the center of the castings as a function of modification and Si content in sand- and <b>chill-cast</b> samples. Eutectic modification, Si content, and cooling conditions have a great impact on the distribution of porosity. Unmodified and Na-modified castings are more easily fed with porosity tending to congregate near the centerline of the casting, while Sr-modified castings solidify in a mushy manner that creates a more homogeneous distribution of porosity in the casting. The amount of porosity was highest in the Sr-modified alloys, lower in the Na-modified alloys, and lowest in the unmodified alloys. The size of the porosity-free layer and the effectiveness of the feeders were greater in the castings made with the steel chills due to the increased thermal gradients and consequent increase in the directionality of solidification...|$|E
