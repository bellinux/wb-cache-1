5|$|<b>CAM</b> sailings were {{initially}} limited to North American convoys with aircraft maintenance {{performed by the}} Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. <b>CAM</b> ships sailed on Gibraltar and Freetown convoys beginning in September, 1941, after an aircraft maintenance unit was established at the RAF base at North Front, Gibraltar. No <b>CAM</b> aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult-mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter. <b>CAM</b> sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with an RAF aircraft maintenance unit in Archangelsk.|$|E

5|$|Martha starts dating <b>Cam</b> Reynolds and he {{encourages}} {{her to work}} at his pole dancing club. Martha {{becomes the}} star pole dancer at the venue after <b>Cam</b> manipulates her. Peter Baker (Nicholas Bishop) has a stag night at the venue and Martha is caught pole dancing by Jack, Ric and Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright). Jack is annoyed with Martha's new life and tries to convince her to leave <b>Cam.</b> <b>Cam</b> sets fire to his club and Martha is left trapped inside until Jack saves her. Jack and Martha become good friends once more, until they sign their divorce papers. Jack then begins a relationship with Sam Tolhurst which devastates Martha.|$|E

50|$|In many ways, {{the story}} of out-of-order {{microarchitecture}} has been how these <b>CAMs</b> have been progressively eliminated. Small <b>CAMs</b> are useful; large <b>CAMs</b> are impractical.|$|R
30|$|Not all <b>CAMs</b> {{from passing}} {{vehicles}} are of equal utility. It {{is obvious that}} for most applications, only the <b>CAMs</b> originating from positions ahead of the receiver contain useful information. As a consequence, {{only half of the}} received <b>CAMs</b> is of particular interest. During high-load conditions where not all <b>CAMs</b> can be processed, the <b>CAMs</b> originating from positions ahead of the receiver should be preferably processed.|$|R
5|$|The first RAF trial <b>CAM</b> launch {{was from}} Empire Rainbow, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six <b>CAM</b> ships joined convoys in June 1941. When a <b>CAM</b> ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually {{launched}} and landed {{at a nearby}} airfield to get in as much flight time as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of <b>CAM</b> assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills {{from the lack of}} flying time during the assignment.|$|E
5|$|Auburn scored {{their first}} points {{late in the}} second on a 36-yard <b>Cam</b> Newton pass to Emory Blake to bring the score to 24–7 at the half. With the only Alabama points in the third scored on a 32-yard Shelley field goal, Auburn brought the margin to 27–21 {{entering}} the fourth on a 70-yard <b>Cam</b> Newton touchdown pass to Terrell Zachery and a one-yard Newton run. The Tigers took a 28–27 lead in the fourth on a seven-yard Philip Lutzenkirchen reception from Newton that held {{to the end of}} regulation.|$|E

50|$|The {{spring-loaded}} <b>camming</b> {{device was}} developed in Yosemite National Park the 1970s, and {{is now one of}} the most popular forms of protection. Each <b>camming</b> device has three or four <b>cams,</b> a shaft, and a trigger mechanism. When the trigger is engaged, the <b>cams</b> contract, allowing it to be placed inside the crack. The trigger is then released, causing the <b>cams</b> to expand outward against the walls of the crack. The device is designed to convert a downward pull on the shaft into outward force through the <b>cams.</b>|$|R

5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN would attempt to cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay.|$|E

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} suggesting the underlying {{reasons for the}} use of complementary and alternative medicines (<b>CAMs)</b> by people with HIV/AIDS, or individual attitudes and beliefs about the use of <b>CAMs.</b> Using focus groups and a survey with 151 individuals attending the HIV Clinics at The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, we aimed to provide insights into factors that influence the use of <b>CAMs</b> among people living with HIV/AIDS. Roughly half (49 %) of the participants had used <b>CAMs</b> to manage their HIV/AIDs. Users of <b>CAMs</b> utilized a wide range of treatments in managing their condition, but costs of the <b>CAMs</b> meant that users were not necessarily able to use them as much as they might have liked. Use of <b>CAMs</b> was based on a desire to find something beneficial rather than on being dissatisfied with conventional medicine. Further research is needed into (a) the effects of <b>CAMs</b> and (b) the enhancement of communication and collaboration between patients, doctors and complementary medicine practitioners...|$|R
30|$|Neurons {{communicate}} via {{synaptic connection}} mostly mediated by precisely-controlled intercellular interactions. <b>CAMs</b> {{are involved in}} all stages of synapse formation and stabilization, providing ‘bridges’ between pre- and post-synaptic sites. At present, mounting evidence clearly indicates that no single pair of <b>CAMs</b> is necessary or sufficient for the organization of synapse developments from initiation to maturation, indicating overlapping or redundant functions of <b>CAMs.</b> The diversity of the isoforms and functions of <b>CAMs</b> {{may contribute to the}} complexity of neuronal network. Abnormalities in <b>CAMs</b> often cause neurological diseases.|$|R

Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny <b>cam</b> from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny <b>cam.</b> However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|Molk {{was also}} {{recognized}} by Sports Illustrated as an honorable mention All-American. <b>Cam</b> Gordon {{was selected as}} a second team Freshman All-American by CFN at safety, and he was joined on the second team by offensive line selection Taylor Lewan.

5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and <b>CAM</b> photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and <b>CAM</b> photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E

30|$|These <b>CAMs</b> transduce {{signals from}} outside to inside, {{but they also}} can transduce signals in the {{opposite}} direction because of their functions in cell migration and synaptic plasticity. For example, L 1 can bind ankyrin, resulting in oligomerization of <b>CAMs</b> and an enhancement of homophilic trans-adhesion on the membrane (Tuvia et al., 1997). Different members of L 1 <b>CAMs</b> can interact with ankyrin to form hetero-oligomers with different affinities, and different regulation by homophilic or heterophilic ligand binding to the <b>CAMs</b> (Malhotra et al., 1998). Together, the <b>CAMs</b> mediate the adhesion response to external stimuli, and inside-out signaling transduction.|$|R

5|$|Swirral Edge {{offers a}} shorter but equally {{exciting}} scramble along a similar sharp arête. The main path to {{it comes up}} from Red Tarn, which is linked by a surprisingly level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye <b>Cam.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 17 {{ships in}} the Japanese carrier force that raided Darwin in 1942 sank nine ships and killed 251 people {{for the loss of}} four aircraft.

50|$|Most of the <b>CAMs</b> {{belong to}} four protein families: Ig (immunoglobulin) {{superfamily}} (IgSF <b>CAMs),</b> the integrins, the cadherins, and the selectins.|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin {{superfamily}} (IgSF) {{cell adhesion}} molecules (<b>CAMs)</b> are cell surface glycoproteins {{that not only}} mediate interactions between neurons but also between neurons and other cells in the nervous system. While typical IgSF <b>CAMs</b> are transmembrane molecules, this superfamily also includes <b>CAMs,</b> which do not possess transmembrane and intracellular domains and are instead attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In this review, {{we focus on the}} role GPI-anchored IgSF <b>CAMs</b> have as signal transducers and ligands in neurons, and discuss their functions in regulation of neuronal development, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, learning, and behavior. We also review the links between GPI-anchored IgSF <b>CAMs</b> and brain disorders...|$|R
