2500|$|In late 1916, Sopwith, whose earlier 1½ Strutter {{had proved}} {{successful}} {{as a light}} bomber, (particularly when operated as a single seater), designed a new, single-engined bomber aircraft. The new bomber was developed in parallel with the Cuckoo carrier based torpedo bomber and closely resembled the Cuckoo. It, like the Cuckoo, was a <b>compact</b> <b>tractor</b> biplane, powered by a 200hp (149kW) Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine. Unlike the Cuckoo, the bomber's two-bay wings did not fold. It {{was designed as a}} single-seat aircraft, with the pilot sitting in a cockpit under the wing centre section to give a good view forwards and downwards for bombing. [...] The aircraft bombload of up to 560lb (255kg) was carried vertically within the fuselage, in cells behind the pilot.|$|E

Most tractors used in grounds care can be classified into three size groups: 1) riding lawn mowers (3 to 8 horsepower) which are fitted with a mower and usually do not have other equipment or attachments that could be mounted separately; 2) lawn and garden or <b>compact</b> <b>tractors</b> (7 to 40 horsepower) that can be mounted {{with a variety of}} tools and equipment; and 3) large tractors which range from 40 to 80 horsepower and have a low center of gravity for working slopes.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{perpetuate}} traditional forest management, the authors tested a new <b>compact</b> <b>tractor</b> designed to replace pack mules when harvesting firewood from Mediterranean coppice stands. The new machine was capable of replacing a standard eight-mule team, and small enough {{to use the same}} infrastructure. The main characteristics of the tractor were its narrow width, a shifting center of gravity and a capacity to unitize loads for more efficient handling. The tests showed that the new tractor can outperform an equivalent mule team under the same working conditions, doing the job without incurring a higher cost. Installing a remote control can enhance operator safety, and bring it to the same good levels achieved with animal extraction. Even if the new machine can fill the technical role of pack mules, it certainly cannot reflect the same cultural and historical value. This research was never spurred by the desire to replace draught animals, but rather by their rapidly declining numbers, and was undertaken with the purpose of preserving traditional coppice management. There is a cultural and ethical obligation to preserve animal logging, which can partly be obtained through optimized deployment, so as to increase animal logger revenues and provide them with a further motivation to stay in business. © 2011 Elsevier B.

50|$|JCB {{has also}} made its name in the tractor world by {{producing}} {{one of the first}} such machines that features proper suspension and is capable of travelling at speed on roads. The JCB Fastrac entered production in 1990. Prior to this design, the suspension was difficult because of the fixed-height connections required to farm machinery, and tractors were notoriously slow on the roads. Dependent on the model, the Fastrac can travel at 50 km/h, 65 km/h or 75 km/h (40 mph). At launch the Fastrac was featured on the BBC television programme Tomorrow's World, and years later as Jeremy Clarkson's tractor of choice in Top Gear. From 2006 the company also produces a range of <b>compact</b> <b>tractors</b> designed for grounds-care, horticultural, and light agricultural duties.|$|R

50|$|Although {{most people}} think first of four-wheel {{vehicles}} when they think of tractors, a tractor may have one or more axles. The key benefit is the power itself, which only takes one axle to provide. Single-axle tractors, more often called two-wheel tractors or walk-behind tractors, have had many users {{since the beginning of}} internal combustion engine tractors. They tend to be small and affordable. This was especially true before the 1960s, when a walk-behind tractor could often be more affordable than a two-axle tractor of comparable power. Today's <b>compact</b> utility <b>tractors</b> and advanced garden tractors may negate most of that market advantage, but two-wheel tractors still enjoy a loyal following, especially where an already-paid-for two-wheel tractor is financially superior to a <b>compact</b> or garden <b>tractor</b> {{that would have to be}} purchased. Countries where two-wheel tractors are especially prevalent today include, Thailand, China, Bangladesh, India, and other Southeast Asia countries.|$|R
