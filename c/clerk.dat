5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything that raised a point of law, and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The Chief Justice also appointed the <b>Clerk</b> of the Warrants, <b>Clerk</b> of the Treasury (also known as the <b>Clerk</b> of Hell), the Keeper of the Seal, the <b>Clerk</b> of Essoins and the <b>Clerk</b> of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own <b>clerk,</b> rather than that of the court), as well as other officials. The Custos Brevium appointed the <b>Clerk</b> of the Juries, responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the <b>clerk</b> to the barons, and the <b>clerk</b> to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each <b>clerk</b> acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first <b>clerk</b> was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn <b>clerk</b> appointed three. Each side <b>clerk</b> studied under a sworn <b>clerk</b> for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side <b>clerk</b> had the chance of being promoted to sworn <b>clerk,</b> first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one <b>clerk,</b> who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a <b>clerk,</b> who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E

5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy <b>clerk.</b> Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting <b>clerk.</b> Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was <b>Clerk</b> of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E
40|$|Background.  The {{quality of}} {{admission}} <b>clerking</b> to psychiatry wards will influence initial management of patients suffering from mental illness. Incomplete <b>clerking</b> may put patient safety at risk. Aims.  We sought {{to assess the}} completeness of <b>clerking</b> to general adult psychiatry wards and to evaluate whether the introduction of an admission booklet would improve <b>clerking.</b> Method.  We analysed the completeness of <b>clerking</b> to general adult psychiatric wards by trainee doctors. Using an audit approach, the first phase assessed completeness of <b>clerking</b> when trainee doctors used continuation sheets to document the <b>clerking</b> in a free-hand manner. Thereafter, we developed a standardised admission booklet to document the <b>clerking</b> and assessed completeness of <b>clerking</b> in the second phase. Results.  The admission booklet significantly improved the completeness of <b>clerking.</b> Notable improvements were seen in multiple components of history taking and initial management, particularly in documenting risk to self and others. Conclusions.  Improving <b>clerking</b> by use of an admission booklet can lead to more informed management decisions particularly {{in regard to the}} patients' physical health and clinical risk management. This may consequently improve patient safety and help trainees communicate important aspects of the case to seniors and the wider multi-disciplinary team...|$|R

5|$|During the War of 1812, White {{enlisted in}} the United States Army as a soldier and was {{promoted}} to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as <b>Clerk</b> of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving <b>Clerk</b> of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court <b>clerk,</b> White taught jurisprudence.

5|$|Following {{his return}} from the war to his {{hometown}} of Romney in June 1865, White was unable to recommence his practice of law or hold a public office due to the existing state laws of the Constitution of West Virginia which disbarred former Confederate States government and military personnel. White's situation was further complicated, as {{he had not been}} pardoned or paroled by the United States for his service in the Confederate States Army. White rented a farm in Hampshire County and engaged in successful agricultural pursuits until the disenfranchisement of former Confederates was struck from the state's constitution in 1872. In 1872, White was elected to the position of <b>Clerk</b> of Court for Hampshire County and began his term the following year in 1873. During his tenure as <b>Clerk</b> of Court for Hampshire County, White also served one term as <b>Clerk</b> of the Circuit Court between 1873 and 1876, but declined to run for a second term in that office. Prior to the American Civil War, White's father John Baker White had also served as the county's <b>Clerk</b> of Court for 47 years between 1815 and 1861. White served as <b>Clerk</b> of Court for Hampshire County for 29 years until 1902. He and his father served in the position a combined total of 76 years.

40|$|The text {{purports to}} {{elucidate}} {{the state of}} a social stratum which has been gaining more and more attention in the sociological analysis — the <b>clerks.</b> On the basis of empirical research conducted, which encompassed 400 <b>clerks</b> from four different production sectors in Milan, the author is constructing a typology founded on two principal dimensions — structural and ideological-cultural characteristics. In such a manner four main types of the <b>clerk’s</b> position have been obtained, peculiar for the population that was the object of research: (1) traditional <b>clerks</b> — <b>clerks</b> having high-level qualifications, and good prospects of advancing in their careers, which are {{at the same time}} characterized by identification with the middle Class and setting the distinction in relation to the working class. The repercussion of that is obvious from the fact that those <b>clerks</b> are not organized into a syndicate. (2) politicized <b>clerks</b> — those who also have high-level qualifications, but they are organized into a syndicate and they identify themselves with working class interests and they are much more egalitarian in their value orientations. (3) proletarian <b>Clerks</b> — those having lower qualifications and accordingly much less paid, but syndically active, identifying themselves with the wording class and more egalitarian in their value orientations. (4) ruinated <b>clerks</b> — those are the non-qualified <b>clerks,</b> but nevertheless they do not identify themselves with the working class, and »declassed« in that way. Traditional <b>clerks</b> are most often found in smaller factories which have not yet been reached by processes of organizational and technological transformation. Proletarian <b>clerks</b> are, however, employed in huge factories which gravitate to large industrial centers. Politicized <b>clerks</b> have particularly emerged from the conflicts and disturbances of 1968 / 69. The ruinated <b>clerks</b> are those employed at jobs not demanding any qualifications, in smaller factories, in little centers whose culture is setting firm differences between manual and intellectual work...|$|R
