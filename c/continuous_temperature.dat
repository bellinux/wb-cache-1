50|$|In {{the early}} years of jet development, during WWII, {{it became clear that the}} jet's fuel {{efficiency}} was well below that of the reciprocating engine. The low <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerated by the combustion chambers, under 1200 K, was to blame. Piston engines tolerate a peak combustion temperature of some 4800 K, because this high temperature is sustained only for one or two milliseconds. The thermodynamic efficiency of an ideal engine is given simply by 100(1 − Te/Tp) in percent, where Te is the exhaust temperature in kelvins, and Tp is the peak combustion temperature. Thus, an airplane could easily triple its fuel efficiency by using a diesel engine to inject the kerosene fuel and combust the fuel/air mixture instead of a jet engine.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} about <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> {{measurements}} of pig-iron at tapping from blast furnace 2 in Oxelösund, SSAB. Nowadays {{the temperature is}} only checked once at every tapping. The purpose of this project is {{to see if the}} process stability increases by continuously knowing the temperature and to compare the costs of this new technique with the technique used today. Possible savings due to less consumption of coke/coal if the silicon amount and the temperature are closer to their aim values will be regarded and if as little steam consumption as possible are used. The process stability can be divided into different sub goals. The ordinary measuring techniques were investigated {{as a part of the}} main goal; such as the ordinary measured temperature, the pig-iron and slag samples. The new <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> measuring technique was compared with the ordinary temperature measurement and investigations of the life length were done. How representative the pig-iron and slag samples are, when taking them at the time they are today, are also looked into. The continuous measured temperature showed around 0, 37 % higher temperature than the ordinary measured temperature. The pig-iron and slag samples should be taken as they are today, for mainly safety aspects. By using <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement, some of the sub goals can be achieved for a more stable process. The economy on the other hand has shown that large savings can be done by using this <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> method due to a more stable process. This is mainly because of a decrease in steam usage in the experimental period. By regarding only the material of the methods the <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> equipment is a bit more expensive, but the savings are much larger so the <b>continuous</b> <b>temperature</b> method is beneficial. With time this method could probably improve the process stability even more since the operators will deal with the information and the probe better...|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the thermohydrodynamic (THD) performance of journal bearings {{continues to be an}} important issue. This is particularly so for high speed or heavily loaded bearing designs. This paper focuses attention on the thermal boundary conditions at the lubricant-bearing interface. The solid component conduction problem is solved in advance of the main THD analysis. Boundary conditions are then imposed on the lubricant THD analysis through use of an appropriate influence coefficient matrix that incorporates the solid component conduction problem. This avoids the current practice of solving the lubricant and solid component problems separately in an iterative loop to achieve <b>continuous</b> <b>temperatures</b> and heat fluxes at the interface. Instead, only the lubricant problem needs to be solved using the boundary conditions imposed by the influence coefficient matrix. Copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|Opuntia plants grow {{naturally}} {{in areas where}} temperatures are extreme and highly variable in the day during the entire year. These plants survive through different adaptations to respond to adverse environmental conditions. Despite this capability, it is unknown how CAM photosynthetic activity and growth in Opuntia plantlets is affected by constant heat or cold. Therefore, the main objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the short-term effect of high (40 °C) and low (4 °C) <b>continuous</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the photosynthetic efficiency, the organic acid content (malic acid) and the relative growth rate (RGR) in seven-month-old Opuntia streptacantha plantlets during 5, 10, and 15 days. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis allowed us to determine that high temperatures negatively impact the photosynthetic efficiency of O. streptacantha plantlets, which exhibited the lowest values of maximum quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (Fv/Fm = 52 %, Fv/F 0 = 85 %), operational quantum yield of PS (ΦPSII = 65 %) and relative electron transport rate (rETR = 65 %), as well as highest values of basal fluorescence (F 0 = 226 %) during 15 days of treatment. Similarly, low temperatures decreased Fv/Fm (16 %), Fv/F 0 (50 %), ΦPSII and rETR (16 %). High temperatures also decreased nocturnal acidification in approximately 34 - 50 %, whereas low temperatures increased it by 30 - 36 %. Additionally, both <b>continuous</b> <b>temperatures</b> affected drastically diurnal consumption of malic acid, which was related to a significant RGR inhibition, where the specific photosynthetic structure area component was the most affected. Our results allowed determining that, despite the high tolerance to extreme temperatures described for Opuntia plants, young individuals of O. streptacantha suffered photosynthetic impairment that led to the inhibition of their growth. Thus, the main findings reported in this study can help to predict the potential impact of climatic change on the establishment and survival of succulent species of arid and semiarid regions of Mexico...|$|R
