5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome <b>centration,</b> which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5000|$|At between {{about the}} ages of 4 and 7, {{children}} tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence {{in the interest of}} reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the [...] "intuitive substage" [...] because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. <b>Centration,</b> conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.Centration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation, whilst disregarding all others. Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance's appearance does not change its basic properties.

50|$|While <b>centration</b> is a {{generally}} tendency for children within various cognitive tasks, perseveration, {{on the other}} hand, is <b>centration</b> in access. Perseveration {{can be defined as}} the continual repetition of a particular response (such as a word, phrase, or gesture) despite the absence or cessation of a stimulus. It is usually caused by brain injury or other organic disorder. In a broader sense, perseveration is used to describe a wide range of functionless behaviours that arise from a failure of the brain to either inhibit prepotent responses or to allow its usual progress to a different behavior. This includes impairment in set shifting and task switching in social and other contexts.|$|E

Changes in mean values and covariances of nutrients during leaf develop- ment may be relevant for plant fitness through herbivory if variation in leaf nutrients influences plant defoliation. • We analysed the between-population and developmental covariation of leaf nutrients by using common principal components (CPC) analysis. We also studied the rela- tionships between leaf nutrient covariates and natural levels of plant defoliation. • Plants at our two study sites shared a CPC structure of covariation between con- <b>centrations</b> of the leaf nutrients. Trends of nutrient covariation across individual plants were largely determined by between-plant variations in Ca concentration (CPC 1), and by an ‘overall nutrient status’ gradient (CPC 2) that was positively asso- ciated with major macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), in both expanding and mature leaves. • Plant defoliation {{was positively related to}} scores on CPC 2 for both expanding and mature leaves, indicating greater consumption on plants with balanced, high con- <b>centrations</b> of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium.

[...] A particular type of <b>centration</b> is egocentrism - literally, [...] "self-centeredness." [...] Piaget claimed that young children are egocentric, capable of contemplating the world only from their personal perspective. For example, a three-year-old presented his mother a model truck as her birthday present; [...] "he had carefully wrapped the present and gave it to his mother with an expression that clearly showed he expected her to love it." [...] The three-year-old boy had not chosen the present out of selfishness or greediness, but he simply failed to realize that, from his mother's perspective, she might not enjoy the model car as much as he would.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model of chemical weathering in soil horizons and underlying bedrock (WITCH) has been coupled to a {{numerical model}} {{of water and}} carbon cycles in forest ecosystems (ASPECTS) to simulate the concentration of major species within the soil horizons and the stream of the Strengbach granitic watershed, located in the Vosges Mountains (France). For the first time, simulations of solute con- <b>centrations</b> in soil layers and in the catchment river have been performed on a seasonal basis. The model is able to reproduce the con- <b>centrations</b> of most major species within the soil horizons, as well as catching the first-order seasonal fluctuations of aqueous calcium, magnesium and silica concentrations. However, the WITCH model underestimates concentrations of Mg 2 + and silica at the spring of the catchment stream, and significantly underestimates Ca 2 + concentration. The deficit in calculated calcium can be compensated for by dis- solution of trace apatite disseminated in the bedrock. However, the resulting increased Ca 2 + release yields important smectite precipi- tation in the deepest model layer (in contact with the bedrock) and subsequent removal of large amount of silica and magnesium from solution. In contrast, the model accurately accounts for the concentrations of major species (Ca, Mg and silica) measured in the catchment stream when precipitation of clay minerals is not allowed. The model underestimation of Mg 2 + and H 4 SiO 4 concentrations when precipitation of well crystallized smectites is allowed strongly suggests that precipitation of well crystallized clay minerals is over- estimated and that more soluble poorly crystallized and amorphous materials may be forming. In agreement with observations on other watersheds draining granitic rocks, this study indicates that highly soluble trace calcic phases control the aqueous calcium budget in the Strengbach watershed...|$|R
