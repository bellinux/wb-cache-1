50|$|Box {{connectors}} join conduit to a {{junction box}} or other electrical box. A typical box connector is inserted into a knockout in a junction box, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a lock nut) {{from within the}} box, as a bolt would be secured by a nut. The {{other end of the}} fitting usually has a screw or compression ring which is tightened down onto the inserted <b>conduit.</b> <b>Fittings</b> for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the <b>conduit.</b> <b>Fittings</b> for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.|$|E

40|$|By the mid- 1950 s Thomas & Betts had {{established}} {{itself as a}} respected manufacturer of quality <b>conduit</b> <b>fittings</b> for the construction and maintenance market [1]. It had earned five Army-Navy "E " awards for its war production. One of its chief executive officers had served {{as head of the}} National Electrical Manufacturers Association in the 1940 s and another would become head in 1959. As the Korean War wound down, Thomas & Betts ' managers became concerned with what they viewed as a potentially significant change in the electrical market, a change that could prove detrimental to the company. One of the company's competitors, AMP Inc., introduced a machine for automatically attaching electrical terminals shortly after World War II. This machine had the capacity to attach small terminals (similar to Thomas & Betts' Sta-Kons) to wires at the pace of a machine-gun. AMP's terminals came in a strip on a large reel which was fed through the machine, so they became known as strip-fed terminals. For original equipment manufacturers (appliance, automotive, telecommunications) who repeatedly attached the same size termina...|$|E
40|$|In today's {{world where}} {{seemingly}} every firm {{is involved in}} international trade, the need to better understand that trade has created a growth industry. The experiences {{of a large number}} of firms have been condensed to some "common denominators, " such as: [...] . to the typical company, the fundamental or strategic reason for entering foreign markets becomes apparent only some time after its first tentative ventures in that direction [14, p. 1]. A textbook on international marketing may take several chapters to discuss the initial entry decision [4, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 21], a decision that involves a great many details. 2 The 1980 s and 90 s are not the first time that small firms have elected to enter international markets. This paper makes use of a historical case study to address some of the decisions a firm must make in selling its products and producing its goods in a foreign country. This paper will contrast the experience of one small firm in the 1930 s with the stereotypical textbook example of the 1990 s. The firm in question is the Thomas & Betts Company (T&B) which began as a sales agency for electrical conduit in New York City, but by the 1920 s had grown to where it manufactured <b>conduit</b> <b>fittings</b> in its Elizabeth, NJ, plant [3]. T&B focused its own sales effort on the East Coast market; sales agencies represented the firm elsewhere. The foreign country in question is Canada. The period from the late 1920 s through the start of World War II was a period in the development o...|$|E
40|$|Thomas & Betts {{was in its}} thirty-first year in 1929, still {{relatively}} small, but rejuvenated by a new managerial team. It had undergone a transformation from a sales agency for electrical conduit and fittings to a manufacturer of <b>conduit</b> <b>fittings.</b> It was started {{in the aftermath of}} the 1893 depression and survived the 1907 -panic and the 1920 depression. Its survival can be attributed to the conservative management principles of its founders and the rapid rate at which the nation electrified. As electricity became commonplace in industry and urban homes, the electrical industry would move more in step with the economy; it would no longer march to the beat of its own drummers. The demand for products like those of Thomas & Betts was derived from the demand for new construction, producers ' durables, and, to a lesser extent, consumers ' durables. These crucially depended on the real interest rate, which increased sharply in the early 1930 s [2, p. 566]. The goal of profit maximization would become subordinate to the more fundamental goal of survival. It was to be a severe test for Thomas & Betts ' young managers, and help came from an unexpected source. It was an episode in which the company takes justifiable pride, but the legacy was expansion into a market niche that proved to be a source of problems in the post-World War II era. Nineteen twenty-nine was a banner year for Thomas & Betts. It would be seven years before net sales or gross profit in nominal terms exceeded the levels of that year, eight years before net profit exceeded the 1929 level. The source of the drop in net sales is not difficult to trace. Between 1929 and 1933, nominal GNP fell by 47 percent; real GNP, by 24 percent. Nominal national income emanating in the contract-construction industry, the source o...|$|E
