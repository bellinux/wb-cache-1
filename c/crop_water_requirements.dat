40|$|Abstract:- In {{the region}} of Thessaly, at {{the area where the}} former lake Karla extended, before it was drained, a number of surface {{reservoirs}} operate and supply the sufficient water quantities for irrigation of nearby cultivated areas mainly during the period between June and August, when the irrigation water requirements are high, while the available water from other resources is negligible. In the present study, monthly climatic data taken from the meteorological station of the National Meteorological Service (N. M.

40|$|Advanced {{irrigation}} technologies, including center pivot irrigation, {{are excellent}} tools {{that make it}} possible to meet <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> {{with a high level of}} water and energy efficiency and distribution uniformity. Within constraints of available water capacity and other site-specific limitations, a well designed, maintained and managed irrigation system provides for a high level of flexibility and precision to meet <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> with minimal losses. The key to optimizing center pivot irrigation is management, which takes into account changing <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> and the soil’s permeability and water holding capacities. LOW PRESSURE CENTER PIVOT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS Center Pivot irrigation systems are used widely throughout the Central High Plains, including the Texas High Plains where most of the systems are low pressure systems, including Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA); Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA); Mid-Elevation Spray Application (MESA) and Low Pressure In-Canopy (LPIC). Low pressure systems offer cost savings due to reduced energy requirements as compared with high pressure systems. They also facilitate increased irrigation application efficiency, due to decreased evaporation losses during application. Considering high energy costs and in many areas limited water capacities, high irrigation efficiency can help to lower overall pumping costs, or at least optimize crop yield/quality return relative to water and energy inputs...|$|E

While the agronomic and {{economic benefits of}} regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) have long been established, the local variability in soils and climate and the irrigation system design limits its practical applications. This paper uses a case study approach (a 225 ha stone fruit orchard) to unveil limitations derived from environmental spatial variability and irrigation performance. The spatial variability of soil physical parameters and meteorology in the orchard was characterized, and its implication on <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> was established. Irrigation depths applied during 2004 - 2009 were analysed and compared with <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> under standard and RDI strategies. Plant water status was also measured during two irrigation seasons using stem water potential measurements. On-farm wind speed variability amounted to 55 %, representing differences of 17 % in reference evapotranspiration. During the study seasons, irrigation scheduling evolved towards deficit irrigation; however, the specific traits of RDI in stone fruits were not implemented.

From a completely block randomized design, seeds were grown on three plots with each having three replicates. Three treatments were compared: half of the root system watered and half droughted by delivering 50 % less <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> (CWR) per irrigation depicted as 50 %PRD; both halves of the root system received water application of 50 % less <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> per irrigation (50 %CWR); while in the control treatment, both halves received 100 % <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> (100 %CWR).

Effects of the differences in water-use on growth parameters, such as plant height, stem girth; number of leaves and leaf area were examined. Weights at harvest and root-to-shoot ratios were also compared. Drying half of the root system caused marked declines in all growth parameters in 50 %CWR but only slight declines in 50 %PRD.

The irrigation system under {{study is a}} demand-based semi-automatic irrigation system, where flows in the main canal are automatically controlled and secondary canals manually operated. The main canal headworks have been equipped with the SCADA system with proportional integral (PI) discharge controllers and the canal itself has been provided with self-regulating AVIS/AVIO downstream control gates for flow regulation in the canal. The secondary canals have manually operated sliding gates, which are opened or closed as per <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> of the command area following a crop-based irrigations operation (CBIO) schedule under which they remain closed for one week after one or several weeks open, depending upon water needs. The flow in the main canal is then automatically adjusted according {{to the number of}} open or closed secondary offtakes. These operations result in fluctuating flows in the main canal and if not properly planned can cause serious implications for canal safety and its hydrodynamic performance. The PI discharge controllers regulate discharge releases to the canal in order to satisfy demands. The proper selection of PI coefficients ensures system safety and efficient water delivery.

Soft wheat was selected as a typical winter crop. Sugar beet was selected as a typical spring/summer crop. First we analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of the average seasonal mean temperature and the average seasonal estimated global radiation, subsequently the spatial and temporal variation of the simulated seasonal water requirement, water consumption and water deficit of wheat and sugar beets were studied. We found that the weather pattern changes are not uniformly distributed across Europe. A seasonal dependence was found. The impacts of the changing weather patterns differ per crop and per region. In various European regions the wheat water requirement showed a downward trend which {{can be attributed to}} a shorter growing season as a result of higher temperatures in spring. This downward trend can also be attributed to a lower evaporative demand in winter and spring as a result of diminishing global radiation values. Only a limited number of regions showed an upward trend. For sugar beets the Mediterranean regions of France and Spain showed a downward trend in the water requirement which can be attributed to a lower evaporative demand due to reduced solar radiation in summer and autumn. Large areas with an upward trend in the water requirement are spread across the rest of Europe. These upward trends can be attributed to higher temperatures in summer and autumn.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> of some selected crops for the area around Kampe (Omi) Dam Irrigation Project. These crops include rice, maize, tomato, vegetable amaranth, pepper, onion and cabbage. <b>Crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> {{for each of the}} crops was determined by using 25 -year climatic data in CROPWAT. Reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) was determined using the FAO Penman Monteith method. For all the crops considered, three decades: decades I, II, and III and seven crop growth stages: nursery, nursery/land preparation, land preparation, initial stage, development stage, mid-season and late season stage were considered. Crops were planted during the 2007 Rainy Season and the crop coefficient for each was determined. The study shows that for the area under study, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) varied from 3. 4 to 4. 8 mm/day. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and <b>crop</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> for paddy rice varied from 0. 28 to 4. 18 mm/day and 2. 0 to 102. 4 mm/day, for maize from 1. 82 to 4. 88 and 1. 3 to 45. 6 mm/day, for tomato from 8. 7 to 52. 8 and 0. 0 to 45. 2 mm/day, for vegetable from 3. 07 to 4. 74 and from 7. 4 to 45. 6 mm/day, for pepper 3. 13 to 4. 8 and from 15. 1 to 40. 7 mm/day, for onion from 1. 80 to 38. 4 mm/day, and for cabbage from 28. 2 to 40. 9 mm/day respectively. The peak <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> was 0. 63 l/s/ha or 5. 4 mm/day with an application efficiency of 65 %. Irrigation <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> was estimated as about 61. 2 MCM while the actual water diverted was 131 MCM. The reservoi...|$|R

In their view, the reason was that amount of applied irrigation water was significantly less than the tomato <b>crop’s</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement.</b> Other researchers attributed improved plant growth with wastewater to improved soil condition, and in particular to enhanced soil organic matter content (Mohammad and Mazahreh 2003; Yonts 2010).|$|R
