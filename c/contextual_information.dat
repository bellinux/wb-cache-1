40|$|Point-of-interest (POI) {{recommendation}} {{is an important}} application in location-based social networks (LBSNs), which learns the user preference and mobility pattern from check-in sequences to recommend POIs. However, previous POI recommendation systems model check-in sequences based on either tensor factorization or Markov chain model, which cannot capture <b>contextual</b> check-in <b>information</b> in sequences. The <b>contextual</b> check-in <b>information</b> implies the complementary functions among POIs that compose an individual's daily check-in sequence. In this paper, we exploit the embedding learning technique to capture the <b>contextual</b> check-in <b>information</b> and further propose the SEquential Embedding Rank (SEER) model for POI recommendation. In particular, the SEER model learns user preferences via a pairwise ranking model under the sequential constraint modeled by the POI embedding learning method. Furthermore, we incorporate two important factors, i. e., temporal influence and geographical influence, into the SEER model to enhance the POI recommendation system. Due to the temporal variance of sequences on different days, we propose a temporal POI embedding model and incorporate the temporal POI representations into a temporal preference ranking model to establish the Temporal SEER (T-SEER) model. In addition, We incorporate the geographical influence into the T-SEER model and develop the Geo-TemporalSEER (GT-SEER) model...|$|R

25|$|Sensory {{information}} {{received by}} place cells {{can be categorized}} as either metric or <b>contextual</b> <b>information,</b> where metric information corresponds to where place cells should fire and contextual input corresponds {{to whether or not}} a place field should fire in a certain environment. Metric sensory information is any kind of spatial input that might indicate a distance between two points. For example, the edges of an environment might signal the size of the overall place field or the distance between two points within a place field. Metric signals can be either linear or directional. Directional inputs provide information about the orientation of a place field, whereas linear inputs essentially form a representational grid. Contextual cues allow established place fields to adapt to minor changes in the environment, such as a change in object color or shape. Metric and contextual inputs are processed together in the entorhinal cortex before reaching the hippocampal place cells. Visuospatial and olfactory inputs are examples of sensory inputs that are utilized by place cells. These types of sensory cues can include both metric and <b>contextual</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most current {{studies of}} bilingual lexical access {{are based on}} the {{comprehension}} of isolated words without considering whether <b>contextual</b> <b>information</b> affects lexical access in bilinguals. However, in everyday communication, words are most often encountered in a meaningful context and not in isolation (e.g. in a newspaper article). Research done by DÃ©prez (1994) has shown that mixed utterances in children are not limited to the lexical level but also in the areas of morphology, syntax, and pronunciation. Researchers also began to investigate the cognitive nature of bilingual lexical access in context by examining word recognition in sentences.|$|E

40|$|A multi-armed bandit episode {{consists}} of n trials, each allowing selection {{of one of}} K arms, resulting in payoff from a distribution over [0, 1] associated with that arm. We assume <b>contextual</b> side <b>information</b> {{is available at the}} start of the episode. This context enables an arm predictor to identify possible favorable arms, but predictions may be imperfect so that they need to be combined with further exploration during the episode. Our setting is an alternative to classical multiarmed bandits which provide no <b>contextual</b> side <b>information,</b> and is also an alternative to contextual bandits which provide new context each individual trial. Multi-armed bandits with episode context can arise naturally, for example in computer Go where context is used to bias move decisions made by a multi-armed bandit algorithm. The UCB 1 algorithm for multi-armed bandits achieves worstcase O (p Kn log(n)) regret. We seek to improve this using episode context, particularly in the case where K is large. Using a predictor that places weight Mi> 0 on arm i with weights summing to 1, we present the PUCB algorithm which achieves regret O (1 p n log(n)) where M â is the weight Mâ on the optimal arm. We also discuss methods for obtaining suitable predictors for use with PUCB. ...|$|R
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, {{and it is important}} for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important <b>contextual</b> <b>information.</b> A change in color of a specific object can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E
