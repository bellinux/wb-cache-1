5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best <b>cutting</b> <b>material</b> for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Propagation both by {{seed and}} {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened <b>cutting</b> <b>material</b> taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E

40|$|The {{priority}} in this subproject was {{to test the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> developed {{in the course of}} the collaborative project under manufacturing conditions in order to evaluate their efficiency and to draw conclusions relating to the need for further development. The application of the newly developed <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> in the manufacturing facilities of the end users ensured that the development of the <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> was entirely practice-oriented and guarantees the immediate implementation and application of the research results in an industrial environment. These practical tests provided extremely important information relating to the influence exerted by material, machining technique and conditions of use on the specific wear and the efficiency characteristics of the new <b>cutting</b> <b>materials.</b> As demonstrated clearly by the tests, each machining task imposes different demands on the wear and the efficiency of the <b>cutting</b> <b>materials,</b> depending on the material, the operation, the machining conditions and the machine tool involved. This means that efficiency can be increased appreciably only when the substrate, the coating system and geometry of the cutting tool have been carefully adapted to suit in the machining task in hand. Using the new <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> under manufacturing conditions lead to an increase of efficiency in a range of 25 % to more than 200 %, as compared with the standard <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> previously used, depending on the machining task. This increase in efficiency as a result of the high levels of performance achieved by the new <b>cutting</b> <b>materials,</b> can be exploited for longer tool life and/or higher cutting speeds and can make a major contribution to the drive to cut austenitic stainless steels more swiftly and more economically than it was previously possible.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{industrial}} processing of cobalt-chromium (CoCr) cast alloys, tungsten carbide and CBN <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> are mainly used. Ceramic <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> {{have a high}} hardness and only suffer a decrease in hardness of 50  % at 1200 °C compared to room temperature. This effect occurs with carbide at 800 °C. In addition, the pressure resistance is temperature dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. At room temperature, the compressive strength of alumina ceramic (Al 2 O 3) is about 3000 N/mm 2 and at 1500 °C only 100 N/mm 2. The edge preparation has also an important influence on the chip formation, the chip transport, the tool wear, the surface integrity of the material and on the roughness of the workpiece surface.

50|$|CryoJet / IceJet is a {{derivative}} of the machining process called abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining. CryoJet/IceJet technology uses ice particles made of water {{coming from a}} running water or freshwater system to cut material.

The pressurized water acting as a cutting jet can be re-used, with adequate filtering, creating a closed water circuit. However, the majority of users do not re-use the water. If more widely used, CryoJet may produce a drastic reduction in the amount of abrasive waste spill currently produced during the water jet cutting process, as no mineral abrasive is used by this technology.|$|E
50|$|The UV {{light from}} an ArF laser is well absorbed by {{biological}} matter and organic compounds. Rather than burning or <b>cutting</b> <b>material,</b> the ArF laser dissociates the molecular bonds {{of the surface}} tissue, which disintegrates into the air in a tightly controlled manner through ablation rather than burning. Thus the ArF and other excimer lasers have the useful property that they can remove exceptionally fine layers of surface material with almost no heating or change to {{the remainder of the}} material which is left intact. These properties make such lasers well suited to precision micromachining organic materials (including certain polymers and plastics), and especially delicate surgeries such as eye surgery (e.g., LASIK, LASEK).|$|E

In this way he discovered that stone tools were found in connection with amber, pottery, glass beads, whereas bronze was found with both iron and gold, but silver was only found in connection with iron. He also found that bronze weapons did not occur with iron artifacts - so that each period could be defined by its preferred <b>cutting</b> <b>material.</b> He also found that the types of grave goods varied between burial types: stone tools were found with uncremated corpses and stone-chamber tombs, bronze weapons and lurs in relation to stone-schist graves, and iron with chamber tombs in barrows.

50|$|In 1926, Krupp, a German company, {{developed}} carbide, a {{very hard}} mixture of sintered carbides of various heavy metals, especially tungsten carbide, used for cutting edges and dies. This new material revolutionized metal-removal or “chip-cutting” in manufacturing. In the 1950s, carbide was used in all machining processes except for sawing.In 1942, German scientists further developed carbide into cermet. After World War II, American universities developed this material further and began to market it as a <b>cutting</b> <b>material</b> for machine tools under the brand name Cermet.Sawing non-ferrous material, such as aluminum, brass, plastic and wood with carbide tipped circular saw blades began in the 1930s. However, attempts to cut ferrous material with carbide tips failed because the existing saws lacked the speed, rigidity, and innovation required to transfer high force with low vibration. These attributes are all necessary for carbide sawing. Also, the existing tooth geometry with positive cutting angles caused cracking of the carbide tips which were harder and consequently, more brittle than the high-speed steel (HSS) circular blades.|$|E
5000|$|Aconitum napellus {{is grown}} in gardens for its {{attractive}} spike-like inflorescences and showy blue flowers.

[...] Like other species in the genus, A. napellus contains several poisonous compounds, including enough cardiac poison that it was used on spears and arrows for hunting and battle in ancient times.

40|$|Abstract. Diamond {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} gaining importance as <b>cutting</b> <b>materials</b> for various construction materials. The quality of synthetic diamonds, monocrystalline {{as well as}} polycrystalline or CVD-diamonds has been significantly improved over the last years.

The paper highlights current developments in the joining of synthetic diamonds to steel. Owing to their covalent atomic bonding diamonds cannot easily be wetted and joined by employing conventional brazing alloys. Hence, active agents are needed to foster an interfacial reaction. Different active filler concepts are presented and discussed regarding their joint formation. The brazing temperatures influence not only possible diamond degradation but also the interfacial decomposition of the diamond due {{to the formation of}} corresponding reaction layers...|$|R
