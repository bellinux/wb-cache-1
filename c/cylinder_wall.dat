25|$|The {{regenerator}} is the {{key component}} invented by Robert Stirling and its presence distinguishes a true Stirling engine from any other closed cycle hot air engine. Many small 'toy' Stirling engines, particularly low-temperature difference (LTD) types, {{do not have a}} distinct regenerator component and might be considered hot air engines; however a small amount of regeneration is provided by the surface of the displacer itself and the nearby <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall,</b> or similarly the passage connecting the hot and cold cylinders of an alpha configuration engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{reciprocating}} sleeve valves were open-ended, {{rather than}} sealing in a junk head. The open end uncovered the exhaust ports {{high in the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the bottom of}} the sleeves' stroke, leaving the ports cut into the sleeve to handle the incoming charge only. The sleeves had a stroke of 30% of the piston travel at 1.950 in (49.5mm) and operated 15 degrees in advance of the crankshaft. The Crecy sleeve valves were of similar construction but differed in their operation compared to the rotary sleeve valve design that was pioneered by Roy Fedden, and used successfully for the first time in an aircraft engine, the Bristol Perseus, in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|The {{volume of}} traffic through the lift grew {{steadily}} through the 1880s and 1890s, but the hydraulic cylinders continued to cause problems. The gland of one cylinder (where the piston travelled through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall)</b> was temporarily repaired in 1887 and replaced in 1891, and the gland of the other cylinder was replaced in 1894. The main cause for concern was corrosion of the pistons. The use of canal water as a working fluid in the hydraulic system and the immersion of the pistons in the wet dock at river level led to corrosion and [...] "grooving" [...] of the pistons. Attempts to repair the grooves with copper made matters worse as it reacted electrolytically with the acidic canal water and hastened corrosion of the surrounding iron. In 1897 the lift was converted to use distilled water as its working fluid, slowing corrosion, but not stopping it completely. Over {{the next few years}} maintenance and repairs took place with increasing frequency, requiring complete closure of the lift for several weeks or a period of reduced and slower operation with a single caisson.|$|E

50|$|Some larger {{diesel engines}} suffer from {{cavitation}} {{due to high}} compression and undersized cylinder walls. Vibrations of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> induce alternating low and high pressure in the coolant against the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall.</b> The result is pitting of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall,</b> which will eventually let cooling fluid leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.|$|E
5000|$|The goal {{of modern}} engine break-ins is the {{settling}} of piston rings into an engine's <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall.</b> A <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> is not perfectly smooth {{but has a}} deliberate slight roughness to help oil adhesion.

50|$|The {{temperature}} {{at the top}} of the compression stroke depends on many factors, particularly the compression ratio of the cylinder and the starting temperature of the inducted air. When the engine is cold, the temperature of the inducted air is low and it receives little heat from the engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition, as the air is compressed and becomes heated, some of this heat is lost to the cold <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls,</b> further reducing the {{temperature at}} the top of the compression stroke.

40|$|Eight {{different}} {{series of}} thin-walled Mylar cylinders were tested experimentally {{to investigate the}} general instability of ring-stiffened, unpressurized, thin-walled cylinders under axial compressive loading. The primary objectives for these tests were: {{to determine whether the}} bending or the torsional stiffness of the rings was the most effective stiffening parameter; to determine the relative effectiveness of ring-stiffeners around the inside and the outside of the cylinders; and to investigate the mechanism of buckling of unpressurized cylinders under axial compression. It was found that the torsional stiffness of the ring-stiffeners was the most important parameter for stiffening the thin-walled Mylar cylinders under axial loading. Ring-stiffeners with a low torsional stiffness did not stiffen the cylinder effectively until the rings were closely spaced. Ring-stiffeners {{on the inside of the}} cylinders did not affect the maximum buckling load when they were not bonded to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls.</b> Ring-stiffeners on the outside of the cylinders provided effective stiffening whether they were bonded to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls</b> or not. The experimental results of thin-walled cylinders under axial compression indicated that the <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls</b> expand laterally to some critical amount, at which time they become unstable and suddenly collapse into buckling. The ring-stiffeners increase the critical compressive load with their effective torsional stiffness by resisting the annular collapse of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>walls</b> into diamond shaped buckles. At an L/R ring spacing ratio of 1. 0 or less, the walls tended to buckle across the ring-stiffeners...|$|R

5000|$|Undersquare {{engines are}} {{typically}} tuned to exhibit peak torque at lower RPM than an oversquare engine {{due to their}} longer crank throw and high piston speed at high RPM. While the surface area of the cylinder in an undersquare engine may be {{higher than that of}} a square engine cylinder, heat exchange through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> is lessened compared to heat exchange through the cylinder head and piston since the <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> is not in constant contact with the expanding gasses. Since each unit of area of <b>cylinder</b> <b>wall</b> permits less heat loss to the engine than through the cylinder head or piston, undersquare engines generally exhibit improved thermal efficiency compared to oversquare engines. For these reasons, diesel truck engines which require low RPM torque and high thermal efficiency more than high power density most commonly adopt an undersquare engine geometry.|$|E
