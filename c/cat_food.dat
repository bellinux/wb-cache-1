5|$|Friskies is a {{brand of}} wet and dry <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> and treats. It is owned by Nestlé Purina PetCare Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. Friskies was initially introduced by Carnation Company in the 1930s as a dog food brand. When Friskies <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, it was the first dry pet food product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> proliferated as the competition for consumer spending intensified.|$|E

5|$|The merger {{was opposed}} by {{consumer}} advocates, {{such as the}} Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns. The two companies combined would become the largest pet food brand by market-share with a 45 {{percent share of the}} <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> market. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners, creating the separate Meow Mix Company. Ralston's St. Louis, Missouri location was chosen as the new company's North America headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|The company {{introduced}} an appetizer <b>cat</b> <b>food,</b> Fancy Feast Appetizers, in 2009. A Purina Pro Plan line for senior dogs {{was introduced in}} 2010. It contains medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) for brain function and has whole grains for digestion. A grain-free product, Purina ONE Beyond, was introduced in 2011. Purina Pro Plan Sport, which contains extra fat and protein and is intended for athletic dogs, was made available in 2013. In 2014 Purina introduced a product for the growing Brazilian market called Ravena, which used locally available ingredients, such as acerola and jabuticaba fruits. Purina-branded accessories, such as training pads, beds, leashes and cleaners began being sold in 2011 under the Purina PetGear name through brand licensing agreements with other manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of <b>cat</b> <b>food.</b> The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

25|$|Australia banned {{irradiated}} <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> after {{a national}} scare where cats suffered from paralyzation after eating a specific brand of highly irradiated catfood {{for an extended}} period of time. The suspected culprit was malnutrition from consuming food depleted of Vitamin A by the irradiation process. The incident was linked only to a single batch of one brand's product and no illness was linked to any of that brand's other irradiated batches of the same product or to any other brand of irradiated <b>cat</b> <b>food.</b> This, along with incomplete evidence indicating that the <b>cat</b> <b>food</b> was not sufficiently depleted of Vitamin A makes irradiation a less likely cause.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} in client-owned geriatric cats to evaluate the short- term effects of a test food on serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and creatinine (Cr) concentrations. Test food contained functional lipids (fish oil), antioxidants (vitamins C and E), L-carnitine, botanicals (vegetables), highly bioavailable protein, and amino acid supplements. Cats (n = 80) were fed either test food or owner's-choice foods (non-nutritionally controlled cohort). Cats were included based on age (≥ 9 years), indoor only, neutered, and free of chronic disease. At baseline, all cats had serum Cr concentrations within the reference interval. Renal function biomarkers and urinalysis results at baseline and after consuming test food or owner's-choice foods for 3 and 6 months were evaluated. <b>Cats</b> consuming test <b>food</b> showed significant decreases in serum Cr and BUN concentrations across time. Overall, <b>cats</b> consuming owner's-choice <b>foods</b> showed significant increases in serum SDMA concentrations at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline (P ≤ 0. 05), whereas in <b>cats</b> consuming test <b>food</b> serum SDMA concentrations did not change. At baseline or during the 6 -month feeding trial, 23 (28. 8 %) cats had increased serum SDMA, but normal serum Cr consistent with IRIS Stage 1 chronic kidney disease. This included 6 <b>cats</b> fed test <b>food</b> and 17 <b>cats</b> fed owner's-choice <b>foods.</b> In the 6 <b>cats</b> fed test <b>food,</b> serum SDMA decreased in 3 cats and remained stable in 1 cat, whereas in the 17 <b>cats</b> fed owner's-choice <b>foods,</b> serum SDMA increased in 13 cats and decreased or remained stable in 4 cats. The increase in serum SDMA concentration was significant (P = 0. 02) only for <b>cats</b> fed owner's-choice <b>foods.</b> These results suggest that nonazotemic cats with elevated serum SDMA (early renal insufficiency) when fed a food designed to promote healthy aging are more likely to demonstrate stable renal function compared with <b>cats</b> fed owner's-choice <b>foods.</b> <b>Cats</b> fed owner's-choice <b>foods</b> were more likely to demonstrate progressive renal insufficiency...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cat</b> <b>food</b> is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency.

40|$|Because {{animal studies}} are labor intensive, {{predictive}} equations are used extensively for calculating metabolizable energy (ME) concentrations of dog and <b>cat</b> pet <b>foods.</b> The {{objective of this}} retrospective review of digestibility studies, which were conducted over a 7 -year period and based upon Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) feeding protocols, was to compare the accuracy and precision of equations developed from these animal feeding studies to commonly used predictive equations. Feeding studies in dogs and cats (331 and 227 studies, respectively) showed that equations using modified Atwater factors accurately predict ME concentrations in dog and <b>cat</b> pet <b>foods</b> (r²=  0. 97 and 0. 98, respectively). The National Research Council (NRC) equations also accurately predicted ME concentrations in pet foods (r² =  0. 97 for dog and <b>cat</b> <b>foods).</b> For dogs, these equations resulted in an average estimate of ME within 0. 16 % and 2. 24 % of the actual ME measured (equations using modified Atwater factors and NRC equations, respectively); for cats these equations resulted in an average estimate of ME within 1. 57 % and 1. 80 % of the actual ME measured. However, better predictions of dietary ME in dog and <b>cat</b> pet <b>foods</b> were achieved using equations based on analysis of gross energy (GE) and new factors for moisture, protein, fat and fiber. When this was done there was less than 0. 01 % difference between the measured ME and the average predicted ME (r² =  0. 99 and 1. 00 in dogs and cats, respectively) whereas the absolute value {{of the difference between}} measured and predicted was reduced by approximately 50 % in dogs and 60 % in cats. Stool quality, which was measured by stool score, was influenced positively when dietary protein digestibility was high and fiber digestibility was low. In conclusion, using GE improves predictive equations for ME content of dog and <b>cat</b> pet <b>foods.</b> Nondigestible protein and fiber content of diets predicts stool quality...|$|R
