25|$|The bricks have {{indeterminate}} numerals {{that can}} be read as 1632 or 1682, and the numerals's style does not match colonial scripts. The bricks also have a mortar coating indicating that they may have been re-used as interior bricks in later repairs, alterations, or new construction. The best <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> is the bricks were part of an earlier church at the same site, then re-used as interior bricks in the 1680 church.

25|$|Charging times vary {{depending}} on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available circuit breaker amp rating (current). In a best <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.|$|E

Rip currents from Nate and the more distant Maria killed one and injured another in New Jersey; several others were caught in rip currents, though they were able to escape.

2500|$|In March 2011, the {{president}} and CEO of Diamond Aircraft Canada, Peter Maurer, indicated that his company's future was in doubt and relied on getting the D-Jet to market, as piston sales remained slow {{since the start of}} the Great Recession in 2007. To get the D-Jet into production the company found $20M in private investment, plus the commitment of an additional $35M from the Government of Ontario. The Ontario government investment was contingent on Diamond also securing an additional $35M from the Government of Canada. If both federal and provincial loans were provided then, combined with funds already provided, the total provincial and federal government investment would have been $100M. Maurer indicated [...] "If we don’t get the funding from the federal government, it puts us in a difficult situation. If the D-JET, for example, in a worse <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> were not to continue it would have a negative impact on the rest of the company’s operations.

40|$|Introduction: In {{medical and}} {{clinical}} education, creating {{critical thinking and}} promoting clinical reasoning abilities are the highest aims and results of education. The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the efficacy of digital <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> versus print/paper <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> on clinical reasoning in problem-based learning (PBL). If a study used the multimedia <b>scenario</b> <b>case</b> interventions, video <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> and online-guided <b>scenarios</b> as digital <b>case</b> PBL, we would consider it eligible. Method:The study was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search for all randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses for digital <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> versus paper <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> in PBL were conducted using Medline (Ovid), Scopus, ISI Web of Science and CINAHL. Google Scholar was used to follow the bibliographies of the related papers to create an exhaustive data set. Search results were limited to the years 2003 - 2013. Results: Our searches yielded 65 hits. After initial screenings of the titles and abstracts, we assessed the full texts of studies. Five eligible studies with 222 students were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that both of the digital and paper-based scenarios have similar impacts on clinical reasoning. But the review of papers showed that 73 % of students are more satisfied with digital scenarios in comparison with paper-based scenarios and found that digital scenarios are 90 % more time saving than paper-based scenarios. Conclusion: According to the results of meta-analysis, efficacy of digital-based scenarios is similar to the efficacy of paper-based scenarios while simultaneously creating more satisfaction and saving the time of students and teachers; therefore, it is suggested that electronic PBL be used rather than paper-based in all levels of medical education...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between attitudes and knowledge, and assesses the impact of factual information on attitudes {{on the topic of}} prison conditions in Canada. A questionnaire, distributed to a non-representative sample of volunteer first year criminology students, forms the basis of this research. The questionnaire incorporated an attitude scale, measuring respondent "punitiveness", and a knowledge scale, measuring the accuracy of factual information concerning prison conditions at the disposal of respondents. The questionnaire was comprised of both global and specific questions and included an experimental manipulation (i. e., <b>case</b> <b>scenarios).</b> Respondents were supportive of both punitive and progressive penal policies and practices. Study participants were familiar with the general facets of prison life, but lacked information on penal policies, prisoner health issues, prisoners' rights, and release from prison. The results of this research do not support a relationship between attitudes and knowledge. Respondents held particular attitudes concerning prison conditions regardless of the amount or accuracy of factual information at their disposal. Participant assessments of penal severity were positively associated with their perceptions of sentencing severity. However, this research indicates that this relationship is spurious. An underlying individual trait, "punitiveness", influenced both attitudes towards sentencing and attitudes towards prison conditions. Respondents favouring punitive penal practices were more likely to appraise prison conditions and sentencing practices as lax. This research also indicates that providing participants with factual information via <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> does not alter their opinions. Respondents receiving global questions and those receiving <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> expressed statistically similar perceptions of prison conditions. Further, manipulating offence severity within the <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> did not alter participant perceptions of prison conditions. However, factual information, in the form of <b>case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> strengthens {{the relationship between}} "punitiveness" and perceptions of criminal justice leniency...|$|R
