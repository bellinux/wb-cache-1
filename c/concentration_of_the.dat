With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E

30|$|In a SWTT, the tracer {{reaction}} is a hydrolysis process (Wellington and Richardson 1994). A higher reaction rate leads to higher <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product tracer, and lower <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reacting tracer (Romero et al. 2012). If reaction rate is too high, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product tracer will be generated during the injection phase (rather than the shut-in phase), which affects <b>the</b> normal distribution <b>of</b> its back-production profile. On the other hand, a low reaction rate requires a longer reaction time (shut-in time) to form detectable <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product tracer.|$|R
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{inert gas}} in the {{breathing}} gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert {{gas in the}} lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|In non-competitive inhibition, {{the binding}} of the {{inhibitor}} to the enzyme reduces its activity {{but does not}} affect the binding of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhibitor. Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain the same as the actual binding of the substrate, by definition, will still function properly.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E

A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E

5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} mobilisation and <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army was {{hampered by}} escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše.

The Yugoslav radio network linking the division with the 4th Army and flanking divisions was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E
