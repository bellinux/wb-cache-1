Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what CoinAge magazine termed [...] "near-heroic measures {{on the part of}} the Mint", the piece did not circulate. [...] In a 1974 article for CoinAge, numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, [...] "the <b>circulation</b> <b>value</b> of the coin has been nil". Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors. Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected. More than 11 {{million of the}} 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as [...] "just unconscionable", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient.

A new acoustic technique is utilized to measure the circulation produced {{in the wake of}} lift-generating aircraft. Ultrasonic signals are transmitted in a path around the wake vortex, and are used to determine the average in-line velocity component along the acoustic path. It is shown herein that this velocity component is directly proportional to the net <b>circulation</b> <b>value</b> within the acoustic path. This is the first study to take this methodology and implement it in a realistic airport setting. This project included constructing a prototype and conducting field tests to prove the validity of this technology in a realistic environment setting. During field tests an acoustic path enclosed the vorticity shed behind one wing of a Piper PA- 28 aircraft. Fourteen initial test flights were conducted in calm atmospheric conditions, and results show circulation values measured are comparable in magnitude and direction to expected circulations generated by the Piper PA- 28 aircraft. Additional testing in various atmospheric conditions revealed the scope of practice for such a measurement technology.

30|$|The {{state has}} a strict scope for the {{collective}} use of rural land [1]. Rural land transfer refers to the circulation of collective construction land, which mainly includes farmer’s own housing land, land used by rural self-owned enterprises, and land occupied by rural public places and facilities [2]. Land transfer is a method of land use permitted by national laws. It must be subject to scope and conditional restrictions in order to lease and resell rural collective land. There are many details of the transfer of land in rural areas and the sale of land in cities [3]. The same is true whether the land in the cities or in the countryside is a commodity with <b>circulation</b> <b>value.</b> However, {{the fact that the}} land has an immovable position also allows the land circulation to not circulate the land itself. It is actually the change of ownership of the land within a certain period of time. Domestic land transfer and foreign land resale are two different concepts. This is because foreign land is privately owned and domestic land is owned by rural collectives. The impact of the transfer of collectively owned land in China is more complicated than the impact of land transfer abroad. However, in land transfer, the evaluation of land prices is the most critical economic issue affecting land circulation [4]. Under this background, the influencing factors of the valuation of rural collective land are studied. Starting from the actual situation in rural China, it is a subject worthy of advancing to use artificial intelligence algorithm to establish a scientific and objective land evaluation index system. Taking into account the nonlinear characteristics of various policy and social issues, such as the nature of land and market chaos in the process of rural land transfer, neural networks are introduced to study rural land evaluation based on the development of wireless networks. The mechanisms that influence the promotion of rural revitalization are explored [5].|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the factors}} that limits {{survival}} from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is the interruption of chest compressions. During ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia the electrocardiogram reflects the probability of return of spontaneous circulation associated with defibrillation. We have used this in the current study to quantify in detail the effects of interrupting chest compressions. Methods From an electrocardiogram database we identified all intervals without chest compressions that followed an interval with compressions, and where the patients had ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia. By calculating the mean-slope (a predictor of the return of spontaneous circulation) of the electrocardiogram for each 2 -second window, and using a linear mixed-effects statistical model, we quantified the decline of mean-slope with time. Further, a mapping from mean-slope to probability of return of spontaneous circulation was obtained from a second dataset and using this we were able to estimate the expected development of the probability of return of spontaneous circulation for cases at different levels. Results From 911 intervals without chest compressions, 5138 analysis windows were identified. The results show that cases with the probability of return of spontaneous <b>circulation</b> <b>values</b> 0. 35, 0. 1 and 0. 05, 3 seconds into an interval in the mean will have probability of return of spontaneous <b>circulation</b> <b>values</b> 0. 26 (0. 24 – 0. 29), 0. 077 (0. 070 – 0. 085) and 0. 040 (0. 036 – 0. 045), respectively, 27 seconds into the interval (95 % confidence intervals in parenthesis). Conclusion During pre-shock pauses in chest compressions mean probability of return of spontaneous circulation decreases in a steady manner for cases at all initial levels. Regardless of initial level there is a relative decrease in the probability of return of spontaneous circulation of about 23 % from 3 to 27 seconds into such a pause. </p...|$|R

Invasive meningococcal disease remains a rare infectious disease not only with high mortality but also with important morbidity and remains as a leading cause of sepsis and septic shock. The pathogenic mechanisms of microcirculatory disorders in meningococcal septic shock have been subject to controversy. This article presents the results of a study of 11 paediatric patients’ (4  boys and 7 girls) with meningococcal septic shock (Group I) who were hospitalized at the Regional Children's Infectious Hospital from 2009 to 2011. The average age of the patients was 37. 4 ± 8. 4 mo. Septic shock was diagnosed according to International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference: definitions of criteria for sepsis and organ dysfunction in paediatrics. Heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, average blood pressure, SpO 2 were monitored. The cardiac output, ejection fraction, fraction shortening, stroke volume were measured by ultrasound in M-mode by Teichholz method. Blood circulation in the a. mesenterica, a. hepatica, a. lienalis, a. renal sinister, v. porta, v.  lienalis, v. renal sinister was determined by impulse Doppler’s wave. Acid-base and electrolytes level in serum, nitric oxide (NO), endothelin I, creatinine, C-reactivity protein and lactate blood level were measured. The control group consisted of 21 healthy children (9 boys and 12 girls), aged 37. 5 ± 5. 4 mo. in average (Group II). We used t-criteria (Student’s) and correlation with R-criteria (Spearmen) for statistical analysis. The data showed a statistically significant lower fraction of ejection, fraction of shortening, stroke volume in Group I. Moreover, our data showed a statistically high level of mesenterial and portal blood flow rate and high pulse index in v. renal sinister compared to healthy children. The blood level of NO was increased in Group I as well as in Group II. Direct correlations were determined between the level of NO and mesenteric, hepatic arterial and venous blood flow rate. Statistically significant inverse correlations between the level of NO and pulse resistive index in splanchnic vessels were discovered as well as inverse correlations between the NO level and the indicator of the severity of condition on PRISM scale (r = – 0. 952). At the same time, we have found no correlation between splanchnic <b>circulation</b> <b>value</b> and cardiac output. Based on the results of this study, we consider that NO has organ protective effects in children with meningococcal sepsis.

40|$|The {{structure}} and {{dynamics of the}} flow field created by a plunging flat plate airfoil are investigated at a chord Reynolds number of 10, 000 while varying plunge amplitude and Strouhal number. Digital particle image velocimetry measurements are used to characterize the shedding patterns and the interactions between the leading and trailing edge vortex structures (LEV and TEV), resulting {{in the development of}} a wake classification system based on the nature and timing of interactions between the leading- and trailing-edge vortices. The convection speed of the LEV and its resulting interaction with the TEV is primarily dependent on reduced frequency; however, at Strouhal numbers above approximately 0. 4, a significant influence of Strouhal number (or plunge amplitude) is observed in which LEV convection is retarded, and the contribution of the LEV to the wake is diminished. It is shown that this effect is caused by an enhanced interaction between the LEV and the airfoil surface, due to a significant increase in the strength of the vortices in this Strouhal number range, for all plunge amplitudes investigated. Comparison with low-Reynolds-number studies of plunging airfoil aerodynamics reveals a high degree of consistency and suggests applicability of the classification system beyond the range examined in the present work. Some important differences are also observed. The three-dimensional flow field was characterized for a plunging two-dimensional flat-plate airfoil using three-dimensional reconstructions of planar PIV data. Whereas the phase-averaged description of the flow field shows the secondary vortex penetrating the leading-edge shear layer to terminate LEV formation on the airfoil, time-resolved, instantaneous PIV measurements show a continuous and growing entrainment of secondary vorticity into the shear layer and LEV. A planar control volume analysis on the airfoil indicated that the generation of secondary vorticity produced approximately one half the circulation, in magnitude, as the leading-edge shear layer flux. A small but non-negligible vorticity source was also attributed to spanwise flow toward the end of the downstroke. Preliminary measurements of the {{structure and}} dynamics of the leading-edge vortex (LEV) are also investigated for plunging finite-aspect-ratio wings at a chord Reynolds number of 10, 000 while varying aspect ratio and root boundary condition. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) measurements are used to characterize LEV dynamics and interactions with the plate in multiple chordwise planes. The relationship between the vorticity field and the spanwise flow field over the wing, and the influence of root boundary conditions on these quantities has been investigated. The viscous symmetry plane is found to influence this flow field, in comparison to other studies YiRo: 2010,Vi: 2011 b,CaWaGuVi: 2012, by influencing tilting of the LEV near the symmetry wall, and introducing a corewise root-to-tip flow near the symmetry plane. Modifications in the root boundary conditions are found to significantly affect this. LEV circulations for the different aspect ratio plates are also compared. At the bottom of the downstroke, the maximum circulation is found at the middle of the semi-span in each case. The circulation of the sAR= 2 wing is found to significantly exceed that of the sAR= 1 wing and, surprisingly, the maximum <b>circulation</b> <b>value</b> is found to be independent of root boundary conditions for the sAR= 2 case and also closely matched that of the quasi- 2 D case. Furthermore, the 3 -D flow field of a finite wing of sAR= 2 was characterized using three-dimensional reconstructions of planar PIV data after minimizing the gap between the plunging plate and the top stationary wall. The LEV on the finite wing rapidly evolved into an arch structure centered at approximately the 50 % spanwise position, similar to previous observations by Calderon et al. CaWaGu: 2010, and Yilmaz and Rockwell YiRo: 2010. At that location, the circulation contribution due to spanwise flow was approximately half that of the shear layer flux because of the significantly greater three-dimensionality in the flow. Increased tilting at the 25 % and 75 % spanwise locations suggests increasing three-dimensionality at those locations compared to the symmetry plane of the arch (50 % spanwise location). The deviation between the LEV circulation and integrated convective vorticity fluxes at the 50 % spanwise location suggests that entrainment of secondary vorticity plays a similar role in regulating LEV circulation as in the 2 D case. While the wing surface flux of vorticity could not be measured in that case, the significant difference between LEV circulation and the known integrated fluxes is comparable to that for the 2 D plate, suggesting that a significant boundary flux of secondary vorticity may exist...|$|E

The purpose of these experiments was to determine the out-of-plane forces on an underwater vehicle due to vortex shedding. This paper describes experiments conducted in a Circulating Water Channel to measure pressure and vorticity values at stations along a body of revolution. The-model was a 1 metre long body of revolution, diameter 0. 125 metres with a detachable NACA 0020 appendage. A computer controlled transverse rig positioned a Freestone probe which was used to measure vorticity. A Scanivalve was used to acquire data at thirty-six pressure tappings at each station. Experiment runs were conducted under various conditions. All runs were with the body stationary, and the speed of flow maintained at 2. 5 metres/second.

30|$|Hygroscopicity (K) of {{the samples}} {{obtained}} was determined by means of climatic chamber BINDER KBF 115 (BINDER, Germany) with internal <b>circulation.</b> The <b>value</b> of K was determined by means of conditioning of granule samples with the diameter of 3 – 4  mm with the mass of 3.500  ±  0.006  g in the chamber at 25  °C and the relative air humidity (φ) of 80 % for 1  h. Granules were uniformly distributed in a cup with the diameter of 50  mm and height of 10  mm in a single layer. The value of K was determined {{as the amount of}} water absorbed with a sample of unit mass for 1  h.|$|R
