500|$|They {{asked if}} I'd {{go back to}} the old Temperatures, only this time with Paul [...] At this point we were still hoping to make it for the midseason. After a couple of weeks we agreed that the show should go off the air in January, but {{continue}} production so that we would have 11 shows ready for airing any time they wanted them. Some of the nonsense and hijinks of the first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of the second version. As to why the series was not cancelled, Asher remarked, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> in two words: Paul Lynde." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and that you know. We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the purpose of sight in humans and animals, even {{elementary}} school children <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> animals have vision to help them find food and avoid danger (function/adaptation). Biologists have three additional explanations: [...] sight {{is caused by a}} particular series of evolutionary steps (phylogeny), the mechanics of the eye (mechanism/causation), and even the process of an individual's development (ontogeny). [...] Although these answers may be very different, they are consistent with each other. This idea was formulated in the 1960s when Tinbergen delineated the four questions based on Aristotle's four causes.|$|E

60|$|Science {{will tell}} you that there are no such powers as those claimed by the Eastern mystics. I, John Fothergill West, <b>can</b> {{confidently}} <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> science is wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> I <b>answer</b> <b>that?</b> Probably {{through some}} of your own family. It has made its way through Lady Kingsbury to Castle Hautboy, and has then been talked about. I am not {{responsible}} for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] Julien said grimly, [...] "you will appease a {{very natural}} curiosity on my part. It {{is not like}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> letter, sir," [...] Mr. Paul Boldside resumed, [...] "the {{better it}} will be, I can tell you, {{for the sale}} of your publication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not good}} at riddles,' said Mr Keith, comfortably, 'but I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> one. I would not put back dinner. I would not put back dinner for the King.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hide me away, {{and tell}} no one {{anything}} about me. And you, dear cousin, say {{nothing to the}} neighbours, and if they should put questions, you <b>can</b> make <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> I {{have not yet been}} found.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Decision {{problems}} {{are closely related}} to function problems, which <b>can</b> have <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> are more complex than a simple 'yes' or 'no'. A corresponding function problem is [...] "given two numbers x and y, what is x divided by y?".|$|R
60|$|I <b>can</b> only <b>answer,</b> <b>that</b> if {{this be a}} fault on my part, it is a {{deliberate}} one. I have spoken, whether rightly or wrongly, concerning what I know--concerning matters which are to me articles of faith altogether indubitable, irreversible, Divine.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> better 'n me," [...] Wild Water replied. [...] "An' {{between you}} an' me," [...] his gaze drifted over the blanket-draped windlass, [...] "it's a pretty good-looking town-site." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{you have}} your eyes, and you <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} for yourself. He is gone; though he is not far; still is he {{beyond the reach of}} the swiftest gondola in Venice, praised be St. Mark!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> in one word," [...] the Colonel declared. [...] "I {{think that}} it is unfortunate. The poor fellow has been terribly upset, and his nerves {{have not been able to}} stand the strain. That is all there is about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|BRODIE. At any rate, 'tis not the {{interest}} of a victim, or we should certainly have known of it before; nor a practical tool-mongering interest, like my own; nor an interest professional and official, like the Procurator's. You <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for <b>that,</b> I suppose? ...|$|R

5000|$|Geniuses {{must answer}} the 1 {{question}} that Phanya Nirunkul ask. Each geinus <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> only twice.

6000|$|... "Mean?" [...] {{the latter}} replied scornfully. [...] "I reckon you <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> better'n we could. When the bank on Broadway was broke into {{there was the}} same kind of notice in the papers, for I saw it with my own eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir,' she said, 'I {{know all}} that has {{happened}} to you, and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life. But there is none that <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> question save only I myself, if you will promise to do all I ask.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will sit}} down," [...] he said, [...] "I am not well! The sea disagrees with me horribly. Well, well, {{you want to}} know why I came here! I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} by another. What are you doing here? Why are you going to Africa?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{led me to}} a chair. I have an indistinct remembrance that he {{was very}} affectionate. I don't think he put his arm round my waist to support me--but I am not sure. I was quite helpless, and his ways with ladies were very endearing. At any rate, we sat down. I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for <b>that,</b> if I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for nothing more.|$|R
2500|$|In 1809, the antiquary Richard Warner was {{appointed}} rector of the parish. He {{may never have}} resided, but in 1830 The Edinburgh literary journal noted [...] "Some of our readers may perhaps ask Who is the Rev. Richard Warner? We <b>can</b> only <b>answer,</b> <b>that</b> he is the Rector of Great Chalfield, Wilts".|$|R
6000|$|They that {{to refute}} the {{invocation}} of saints, have denied that they [...] have {{any knowledge of}} our affairs below, have proceeded too farre, and [...] must pardon my opinion, till I <b>can</b> throughly <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> piece of [...] Scripture, 'At the conversion of a sinner the angels of Heaven [...] rejoyce'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said my sentimental friend Gregoire, [...] "for {{the matter}} of that, I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> the lad was always talking about this young woman: {{he told me the}} whole story himself, and many a good laugh I had with citizen Schneider as we talked about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But who, indeed, <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> question?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Twice he {{has been}} here for flying visits. Once Alice has been {{to see him in}} Berlin. He is, I believe, a very wealthy {{manufacturer}} there. He crosses often to England. He has money, and he is always gay." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now methinks I {{hear you}} say, [...] "Was ere {{a man so}} foolish, pray, [...] Since first the world began?" [...] Oh, hush!

6000|$|... "It has, indeed, General," [...] one of {{the senior}} {{officers}} said, warmly. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for myself, <b>that</b> I should have been proud {{to have been able}} to tell such a story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. If you are {{wanted you}} can be sent for in the morning. You had best call here about eleven, so <b>that</b> you <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> any {{questions}} <b>that</b> the admirals may ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think there}} can be much harm in that," [...] Madam Vipon agreed; [...] "at any rate I will talk to Jeanne.

6000|$|Fleda looked {{this inquiry}} {{in the face}} {{only long enough to}} {{recognize}} that, in her embarrassment, she must take instant refuge in a superior one. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> better if I know how kind to her you've been. Have you been kind to her?" [...] she asked as simply as she could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{the worst}} of it. You are unanswerable. Yours is the logic of youth, and no man <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that.</b> The facts of life can, {{but they have no}} place in the logic of youth. Youth must try to live {{according}} to its logic. That {{is the only way to}} learn better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> question, Rima," [...] I said. [...] "Ah, no, poor child, {{there are}} none there like you--not one, not one.

6000|$|ANABEL. I DO think you're {{the last}} word in selfishness.

5000|$|Embree {{snapped a}} number of {{pictures}} of the attack, but eventually stopped.
