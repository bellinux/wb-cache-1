5|$|<b>Cornering</b> weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping {{of the rear}} suspension. <b>Cornering,</b> camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies <b>cornering</b> weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E

Calvin says that because he bought D'artagnan for $500, D'artagnan (who has only fought three times) must fight at least five times. When Django and Dr. Schultz offer to reimburse Calvin and then change their minds, Calvin has his chief tracker, Mr. Stonecipher, unleash several attack dogs that tear D'artagnan to pieces.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with <b>cornering</b> force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel <b>corner</b> {{detection}} method is presented, to extract geometrically important <b>corners</b> for robot applications, such as indoor mobile robot navigation or manipulation. Intensity‐based <b>corner</b> detectors, {{such as the}} Harris <b>corner,</b> can detect <b>corners</b> in noisy environments, but have inaccurate <b>corner</b> positions and miss the <b>corners</b> of obtuse angles. Edge‐based <b>corner</b> detectors, such as the Curvature Scale Space, can detect structural <b>corners,</b> but show unstable <b>corner</b> detection due to incomplete edge detection in noisy environments. The proposed image‐based direct curvature estimation can overcome limitations in both the inaccurate structural <b>corner</b> detection of the Harris <b>corner</b> detector (intensity‐ based) and the unstable <b>corner</b> detection of the Curvature Scale Space, caused by incomplete edge detection. Various experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a {{general theory of}} <b>corner</b> rings in noncommu-tative rings that generalizes the classical notion of Peirce decompositions with respect to idempotents. Two basic types of <b>corners</b> are the Peirce <b>corners</b> eRe (e 2 = e) and the unital <b>corners</b> (<b>corners</b> containing the identity of R). A gen-eral <b>corner</b> is both a unital <b>corner</b> of a Peirce <b>corner,</b> and a Peirce <b>corner</b> of a unital <b>corner.</b> The simple axioms for <b>corners</b> engender good functorial prop-erties, and make possible a broader study of subrings with {{only some of the}} features of Peirce <b>corners.</b> In this setting, useful notions such as rigid <b>corners,</b> split <b>corners,</b> and semisplit <b>corners</b> also come to light. This paper develops the foundations of such a <b>corner</b> ring theory, with a view toward a unified treatment of various descent-type problems in ring theory in its sequel.

5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when <b>cornering,</b> and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of <b>cornering</b> force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Corner</b> {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in object recognition and motion analysis. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical <b>corner</b> detection framework based on spectral clustering (SC). The framework consists of three stages: contour smoothing, <b>corner</b> cell extraction and <b>corner</b> localization. In the contour smoothing stage, wavelet decomposition is imposed on the raw contour to reduce noise. In the <b>corner</b> cell extraction stage, several atomic <b>corner</b> cells are obtained by SC. In the <b>corner</b> localization stage, the <b>corner</b> points of each <b>corner</b> cell are located by the <b>corner</b> locator based on the kernel-weighted cosine curvature measure.

30|$|We {{consider}} the <b>corner</b> as {{the intersection of}} two edges or as a point {{that there are two}} dominant and different edge directions in its local neighborhood. There are several methods for <b>corner</b> detection [20 – 24]. Harris <b>corner</b> detector {{is one of the most}} well-known <b>corner</b> detectors and is based on measuring the <b>corner</b> strength. Comparison between Harris <b>corner</b> detector and other <b>corner</b> detectors like SUSAN shows the superiority of Harris <b>corner</b> detector in the case of stability and complexity (running time) [25]. Therefore, Harris <b>corner</b> detector is used for feature extraction.|$|R

5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, <b>cornering</b> stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E
5|$|In 1317 Edward II {{settled the}} {{inheritance}} of Glamorgan and Caerphilly Castle on Eleanor de Clare, who had married the royal favourite, Hugh le Despenser. Hugh used {{his relationship with}} the king to expand his power across the region, taking over lands throughout South Wales. Hugh employed Master Thomas de la Bataile and William Hurley to expand the Great Hall at the castle, including richly carved windows and doors. In 1326, however, Edward's wife, Isabella of France, overthrew his government, forcing the king and Hugh to flee west. The pair stayed in Caerphilly Castle at the end of October and early November, before leaving to escape Isabella's approaching forces, abandoning the extensive stores and £14,000 held at the castle. William la Zouche besieged the castle with a force of 425 soldiers, <b>cornering</b> the constable, Sir John de Felton, Hugh's son – also called Hugh – and the garrison of 130 men inside. Caerphilly held out until March 1327, when the garrison surrendered on the condition that the younger Hugh was pardoned, his father having been already executed.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' <b>cornering</b> method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E

After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to resign. At first thrown {{by the fact that}} he is alive, Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, while <b>cornering</b> him at the edge of Pride Rock, hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father. Having grown overconfident, Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride, initiating a battle between Simba's pride of lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit, where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas, who overheard Scar blame them for what he'd done. Simba then takes his rightful place as king.

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the <b>cornering</b> style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
