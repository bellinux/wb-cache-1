5000|$|In 1917, the Norwegian Synod {{merged with}} two other Norwegian Lutheran groups and formed the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church. This led to {{disagreement}} {{among members of the}} Norwegian Synod. The people who became the ELS had concerns regarding fellowship with those who did not share the same doctrine. The Norwegian Synod had taught that conversion and salvation were entirely the work of God without any cooperation from humans. The new merged church allowed that <b>conversion</b> depended <b>in</b> some <b>degree</b> on humans accepting God's grace. A group of people therefore gathered at Lime Creek Lutheran Church near Lake Mills, Iowa, in June 1918 and reorganized as the Norwegian Synod of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church (also known as [...] "Little Norwegian" [...] Synod) The name was later changed to the Evangelical Lutheran Synod in 1957.|$|R

40|$|In this work, a {{flexible}} and efficient flow microreactor {{has been developed}} for the synthesis of an aromatic amine via a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, a key bond-forming reaction in the synthesis {{of a wide range}} of naturally-occurring and pharmaceutically active targets. The microreactor, coupled with a highly active palladium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst, enabled the full conversion of the reagents within twenty minutes, even at very low catalyst concentrations. In addition to the classical two-feed design, a novel, more flexible four-feed flow system was developed with a configuration optimised to avoid clogging, which is one of the main problems in microreactors and in continuous flow reactive systems in general. We report the effect of flow rate, temperature and catalyst loading on <b>conversion</b> <b>degree.</b> <b>In</b> particular, a slight increase in temperature allowed faster conversion even at low catalyst loadings, likely due to the highly efficient heat transfer provided by the confined microreactor geometry...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{aimed to develop}} a novel process scheme for {{hydrolysis}} of native cassava starch at high dry solid s using an enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR). Firstly, liquefied cassava starch having solids content up to 50 % by weight was prepared by three stage liquefactions in a conventional equipment using a commercially available heat stable a-amylase (Termamyl 120 L). The liquefied cassava starch was further saccharified in an EMR using glucoamylase (AMG E). By using the developed process scheme, a highly clear hydrolysate with dextrose equivalent (DE) approximately 97 could be produced, provided the increase of solution viscosity during the liquefaction was precisely controlled. The excessive space time could result <b>in</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>degree</b> of starch. Moreover, a residence time distribution study confirmed that the EMR could be modelled as a simple continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Using Lineweaver-Burk analysis, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) and glucose production rate constant (k 2) were 552 (g/l) and 4. 04 (min - 1), respectively. Application of simple CSTR model with those kinetic parameters was quietly appropriate to predict the reactor’s performance at low space time. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{critically}} examine the politics of religious <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> India. Since Christianity is the main religion espousing and conducting <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> ever-larger numbers in India, my focus, in the following pages, is to interrogate the debate surrounding this particular undertaking and the attendant conflict dynamics. This study is organized according to the following framework. First, it situates religious <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> the context of radical Hindu nationalism. Second, it explores the issue of religious <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> the theories of identity and globalization. Third, it probes the specifics of Christian <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> India and investigates the issue within the framework of identity politics and secularism. Fourth, it examines the response and reaction of the radical Hindu nationalists towards religious <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> general and Christian <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> particular from the perspective of ethno-religious nationalism. Fifth and finally, it evaluates the dimensions of conflict between Christians and Hindus and how they are played out in the shared social arena. In conclusion, this article stresses that religious <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> India is a form of a socioeconomic emancipatory undertaking. Those who feel stifled by the discriminatory caste order prevalent within Hinduism and live a marginal existence embrace this new identity. In the same breath it argues that Christianity in general, and Christian missionaries in particular, have courted criticism, opposition, and violence from radical Hindus, informed citizenry, and the institution of the state, as they are considered an “external other”—accused of undermining the complex sociopolitical order in the country...|$|R

40|$|Conversion {{is one of}} {{the very}} {{productive}} means of forming new words in English morphology. It is a derivational process that includes no overt marking; i. e. there is no difference in the form even though the lexical category of the word has changed from one class to another. The main goal of this thesis is to provide a critical and informative analysis of <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> English throughout distinct time periods and try to explain the problems that are left unanswered regarding this topic. There are two main approaches {{that are going to be}} presented in this research, such as synchronic analysis on <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> the first part, and then a historical perspective will be examined in the second part of the research. For the synchronic analysis, in addition to representing the types of <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> Present-Day English in greater detail, many controversial questions raised on <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> English will be thoroughly investigated with numerous examples explicated; there are four main problems that are raised in this linguistic field, namely the problem of directionality, the problem of definition of conversion, syntactic approach of conversion, and the issue of productivity. The purpose of this part of study is to outline a number of different linguistic theories that has been proposed on <b>conversion.</b> <b>In</b> addition to this, a historical perspective of <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> English will be examined as a diachronic approach of analysis. The word formation process of conversion has been present for centuries in the language (Biese 1942). Little attention has been drawn on conversion historically. Apart from the fact that there have not been many studies in this linguistic area, the purposes of this diachronic study are to deliver instructive, unified and meticulous descriptions on conversion with a great deal of comprehensive historical exemplifications and also to be able to trace, with confidence, the practicable and more reliable explanations to the essential questions that arise. I will divide this part into four sub-sections, namely <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> Old English, <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> Middle English, and <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> Early Modern English, and manipulate the instances of <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> each period and find out how the morphological process; i. e. conversion, evolved which hopefully shed insights on rather practical and explicative answers to the problems of conversion...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} Sweden’s {{greenhouse gas emissions}} originates from the transportation sector, and the Swedish government has set the goal that the entire Swedish vehicle fleet will be independent from fossil fuels by 2030. One of the strategies investigated {{to achieve this goal}} is biomass gasification, which is a technology {{that can be used to}} transform lignocellulosic materials into a raw gas. This gas can be further upgraded into a transportation fuel, such as substitute natural gas (SNG), Fischer-Tropsch diesel, dimethyl ether, or methanol. Three major techniques can be used for biomass gasification: entrained-flow gasification; single fluidised bed gasification; and dual fluidised bed gasification (DFBG). This thesis focuses on DFBG with SNG as the end-product. For this process, there is an optimal overall efficiency of SNG production for a certain <b>degree</b> of char <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> the gasification chamber. The aim of the work of this thesis is to elucidate how the <b>degree</b> of fuel <b>conversion</b> <b>in</b> the gasifier of a DFBG unit is influenced by different parameters. This knowledge is valuable for the design, upscaling, and optimisation of such units. For this purpose, semi-empirical modelling is combined with experimental work. The model is used to identify the key parameters that affect char gasification in a DFBG unit and to provide the corresponding sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, a general approach for optimising the definition of the <b>conversion</b> classes used <b>in</b> modelling the fuel population balance is proposed and evaluated. Experiments conducted at the laboratory scale examine how the conversion conditions of a fuel particle (fuel vertical mixing, fuel concentration, fuel size, pyrolysis atmosphere, and cooling of the char after pyrolysis) affect the char gasification rate. Experiments are also used to determine the particular kinetic and structural parameters of the biomass fuel used in the Chalmers DFBG unit. The 1 D model, combined with the developed discretisation method for the fuel conversion classes and the experimentally determined kinetic and structural parameters, gave results that were in good agreement with the experimental data for the char <b>conversion</b> <b>degree</b> <b>in</b> the gasification chamber of the Chalmers DFBG unit. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the position of the fuel during pyrolysis and char gasification had a significant effect on the char gasification rate, for conditions relevant for DFBG. Particle size was also identified as an important parameter. Thus, when carrying out laboratory-scale tests to generate fuel reactivity data to be used for modelling large-scale units, it is important to replicate the conditions experienced by the fuel particles in the large-scale unit and to use similar fuel sizes...|$|R
