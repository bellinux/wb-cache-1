5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and <b>cast</b> <b>away</b> by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E
