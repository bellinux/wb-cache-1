50|$|A {{drawback}} to private investment <b>capital</b> <b>subscription</b> {{is the fact}} that the subscriptions are not transferable to heirs. The money managers are very selective of the people with whom they are willing to work. Therefore, upon the death of a PICS subscriber the initial investment of $150,000.00 and any pro-ration of the 10% annual interest earned is returned to the deceased estate.|$|E
50|$|A private {{investment}} <b>capital</b> <b>subscription</b> (PICS), is a financial tool {{that relies on}} a small pool of investors’ money for real estate investments. The money managers of {{private investment}} capital subscriptions or PICS are real estate investment experts, who also invest in related real estate products such as tax lien certificates, foreclosures, notes, as well as development projects {{on behalf of their}} subscribers and themselves.|$|E

50|$|Since the firm’s inception, Cordiant {{has raised}} and managed four {{emerging}} market debt funds totalling USD 1.44 billion in <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{funds that}} the IDB lends are raised by selling bonds to {{institutional}} investors at standard commercial rates of interest. The bonds are backed by (a) {{the sum of}} the <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions</b> actually paid in by the Bank's 47 member countries, plus (b) {{the sum of the}} callable <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions</b> pledged by the Bank's 22 non-borrowing member countries. Together these constitute the Bank's ordinary capital, some US$101 billion. Of this amount, 4.3 percent is paid in, while the remaining 95.7 percent is callable.|$|R
50|$|Unlike a {{real estate}} {{investment}} trust or REIT, a Private Investment <b>Capital</b> <b>Subscription</b> does not give its investment subscribers any ownership in the real estate held and often PICS invests in real estate paper, such as trust deeds, notes, tax lien certificates and foreclosure properties. The actual ownership of the real estate and related products is held by the managers who are often a separate Limited Liability Partnership or Company.|$|E
50|$|The act was {{originally}} {{supported by the}} Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR), who were to provide half the capital for the line, as well as work the railway for 40% of net profit; during {{the passage of the}} bill through parliament agreement was reached that a rival company, the South Yorkshire Coal Railway and Canal Company would take control of the line south of Barnsley, and the LYR the portion north, with each company having running powers over the Silkstone and Dodsworth branches. The split in capital apportioned to the construction of the line was $450,000 for the northern part and £350,000 for the southern part. The M&LR withdrew from the <b>capital</b> <b>subscription</b> arrangements, and instead agreed to take a lease on the line.|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} between PICS and hedge funds are the investors themselves. PICS investors {{are not required}} to have a large net worth and the number of subscribers is limited to thirty-five subscription members, who invest a maximum of One-hundred and fifty thousand dollars each. The total amount raised by a Private Investment Capital Subscription’s initial private offering is limited to Five million dollars. PICS commonly sell 33 subscriptions each worth One hundred and fifty thousand dollars to only thirty-three individuals (no family trusts, partnerships, corps. Etc. are permitted to participate), which raises $4,950,000.00. The two remaining subscribers of the 35 originally subscriptions available are sold to the expert money managers, who add $50,000.00 to the pool. In exchange for their expertise, the money managers share in the profits equally. Unlike hedge fund managers who generally do not contribute any money to the hedge fund but are compensated by the performance of the hedge fund, PICS managers contribute to the private investment <b>capital</b> <b>subscription</b> and are compensated only after the other thirty-three $150,000-subscription-investors are paid a guaranteed $15,000.00 or a 10% annual return on their investment. After the 10% payment has been made the PICS money managers may choose to keep, distribute or reinvest any additional profits earned from the $5,000,000.00 raised in initial offering.|$|E
50|$|The Articles of Agreement for the IMF and IBRD signed at Bretton Woods did {{not come}} into force until {{ratified}} by countries with 80 at least percent of the <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions</b> ("quotas"). The threshold was reached on December 27, 1945.|$|R
50|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission, and state-level {{departments}} of corporations, business, and commerce or state {{secretaries of state}} does not regulate Private Investment <b>Capital</b> <b>Subscriptions,</b> because PICS do not raise more than Five million dollars and PICS {{limit the number of}} subscriptions sold to participating investors to a total of thirty-five people.|$|R
50|$|Investors prefer Private Investment <b>Capital</b> <b>Subscriptions</b> to mutual funds, {{equity funds}} and hedge funds because real estate PICS focus on highly secured real estate {{products}} such as 70% loan to value loans, government backed tax lien certificates and under valued foreclosure properties. New PICS that invest in cellular phone and Internet industry, title insurance and finance market are now available.|$|R
30|$|Another problem {{associated}} with Federal Law No. 217 is the uncertainty concerning {{intellectual property rights}} after a small innovative enterprise has been created. As in stands, the universities use the following procedure to protect intellectual property: the organization tries to get patents for as many results of the research as possible by patenting the inventions, utility, models or designs. Under these, the institution is the rights holder and the employee is the author. This means the educational or research institution is responsible for payment of patent taxes {{as well as of}} royalties to the inventor, if the patent brings commercial profit. Further use of the patent is regulated by license agreements. That is, if the author wants to develop the innovation himself, the patent is transferable to a small innovative enterprise affiliated to the university under the conditions of a share <b>capital</b> <b>subscription.</b> Otherwise, the organization seeks to find a customer interested in using the patent in the production process.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> the NCBs {{of the member}} states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40 billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB's subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in US dollars and Japanese yen.|$|R
50|$|After three years, PICS {{management}} reserves {{the right}} to buy back the subscription at the original price of $150,000.00 after the 10% annual earnings have been paid to the subscriber. However, money managers frequently elect to pay the investors substantially higher returns than the contracted 10% thus allowing the investors to participate in profit sharing distributions. The reason PICS managers often choose to distribute profits among the subscribers is to reward investors and to distribute the capital gains tax burden among the pool of investors. Because many investors use their self-directed IRAs to invest in private investment <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions</b> these investors are not required to pay any capital gains taxes on the profits they receive until they withdraw the money from their self-directed IRA.|$|R
50|$|The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a {{regional}} development bank established on 19 December 1966, which is headquartered in the Ortigas Center located in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines. The company also maintains 31 field offices {{around the world to}} promote social and economic development in Asia. The bank admits the members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP, formerly the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East or ECAFE) and non-regional developed countries. From 31 members at its establishment, ADB now has 67 members, of which 48 are from within Asia and the Pacific and 19 outside. The ADB was modeled closely on the World Bank, and has a similar weighted voting system where votes are distributed in proportion with members' <b>capital</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> ADB releases an annual report that summarizes its operations, budget and other materials for review by the public. The ADB-Japan Scholarship Program (ADB-JSP) enrolls about 300 students annually in academic institutions located in 10 countries within the Region. Upon completion of their study programs, scholars are expected to contribute to the economic and social development of their home countries. ADB is an official United Nations Observer.|$|R
30|$|Ours is {{an event}} study, so we {{collected}} data daily, weekly, and monthly. Sampled firms offered shares to the public via the fixed price method.

500|$|The closing {{decade of}} the seventeenth century saw the {{generally}} favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end. There was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France from 1689–91, caused by French protectionism and changes in the Scottish cattle trade, followed by four years of failed harvests (1695, 1696 and 1698–99), known as the [...] "seven ill years".

40|$|Substantiating {{the concept}} of equity {{is an issue of}} {{interest}} to specialists in accounting, taxation and finance. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present three of the sensitive issues generated by {{the concept of}} equity. One aspect considered is the demarcation of financial liabilities from the equity instruments. The distinction between equity and debt instruments is necessary because it has consequences on financial reporting. A second part of the study focuses on the fiscal side, trying to find the answer to the question: Are there deferred taxes recognized in equity? Deferred tax liabilities will be presented at the end of the year in equity and not debt, because they are related to gains recorded directly in equity.

50|$|The Parliament of Scotland of 1695 enacted {{proposals}} {{that might help}} the desperate economic situation. Three acts of parliament passed in 1695 allowed the consolidation of runrigs and the division of common land, {{which would be the}} basis of the agricultural improvements of the eighteenth century that would make Scottish farming highly productive. These changes would ensure that people could be fed in extreme conditions, even with the population growth. Other changes included the setting up the Bank of Scotland. The Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies received a charter to raise <b>capital</b> through public <b>subscription.</b> The Company of Scotland invested in the Darién scheme, an ambitious plan to build a colony on the Isthmus of Panama in the hope of establishing trade with East Asia, almost entirely funded from Scottish investors. The scheme was a disaster, with the colonists abandoning their project in 1700. Only 1,000 of 3,000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland. The cost of £150,000 put a severe strain on the Scottish commercial system and led to widespread anger against England, but also highlighted the problems of maintaining two economic policies, increasing pressure for full union, which occurred with the Acts of Union, 1707 that created the Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|R
40|$|The Romanian Capital Market Law (Law no 297 / 2004) {{lays down}} rules {{regarding}} public offers (to buy or sell) of securities admitted to trading on a regulated market.

Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower orders volunteered as colonists.

50|$|The Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies also {{received}} a charter to raise <b>capital</b> through public <b>subscription.</b> The Company of Scotland invested in the Darién scheme, an ambitious plan devised by William Paterson, the Scottish founder of the Bank of England, to build a colony on the Isthmus of Panama {{in the hope of}} establishing trade with the Far East. The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotland's economy. Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower orders volunteered as colonists. However, both the English East India Company and the English government opposed the idea. The East India Company saw the venture as a potential commercial threat and the government were involved in the War of the Grand Alliance from 1689 to 1697 against France {{and did not want to}} offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of New Granada and the English investors withdrrew from the project. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised £400,000 in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; suffering from disease; under attack by the Spanish from nearby Cartagena; and refused aid by the English in the West Indies, the colonists abandoned their project in 1700. Only 1,000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland. The cost of £150,000 put a severe strain on the Scottish commercial system and led to widespread anger against England, but also highlighted the problems of maintaining two economic policies, increasing pressure for full union. The resulting Acts of Union of 1707 that created the Kingdom of Great Britain were largely concerned with economic matters. Scotland gained access to English markets and colonies, concessions were give to a number of Scottish interest groups and there were generous cash payments to compensate for recent Scottish losses. It was full monetary union and the Bank of Scotland supervised the reminting of Scottish coins into sterling denominations.|$|R
