5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail {{has gone too far}} to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E

50|$|Poland entered another {{economic}} crisis, {{causing the}} government again to attempt reduction {{of its budget}} deficit by cutting public expenditure other than for military purposes. Despite <b>cutting</b> <b>spend</b> by a third, deficit persisted. Tax income {{that should have been}} used to lead the country out of crisis was instead financing the debt burden. Money required to stimulate the economy was devoted by the government to creditors and foreign banks. Further spending cuts necessitated Poland importing less and exporting more. Import tariffs were increased again for foreign products, while subsidies were given to exporters.|$|R
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the State Bank in 1992 resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, <b>cutting</b> <b>spending,</b> which was a setback to the further economic development {{of the city and}} state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.|$|E

His political career began in earnest on the New Castle County Council in 2000, where he served as council president. He was elected county executive in 2004 and served for six years.

In his six years in office as county executive, Coons balanced the budget with a surplus in fiscal year 2010 by <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> and raising taxes. As New Castle county executive, Coons raised taxes despite having campaigned on a promise not to increase them. New Castle County maintained a AAA bond rating throughout his tenure.|$|E

25|$|Having vowed not {{to raise}} taxes, Romney found he could not {{completely}} close the budget deficits by <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> and raising fees alone. He sought additional revenue by pursuing changes in the business tax code to prevent businesses from evading payment of taxes. Businesses called these changes tax increases, but Romney defended them as the elimination of “loopholes.” Examples of specific changes and 'loophole' closures included blocking corporations from transferring intellectual property assets to shell companies in states with lower corporate tax rates, preventing banks and some corporations from avoiding taxes through paper restructurings, eliminating tax breaks for direct mail advertising, and taxing sales of software downloaded over the internet (which had previously gone untaxed) the same as identical software purchased in brick-and-mortar stores. The Romney administration even sought an exemption {{to avoid having to}} comply with a federal law passed in 2004 that mandated that states like Massachusetts lower their corporate tax rates.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{accession}} of Prince Faisal's elder brother, King Saud, to {{the throne}} in 1953, Prince Faisal was appointed Crown Prince. King Saud embarked on a lavish and ill-considered spending program that included {{the construction of a}} massive royal residence {{on the outskirts of the}} capital, Riyadh. He also faced pressure from neighboring Egypt, where Gamal Abdel Nasser had overthrown the monarchy in 1952. Nasser was able to cultivate a group of dissident princes led by Prince Talal, who defected to Egypt (see Free Princes). Fearing that King Saud's financial policies were bringing the state to the brink of collapse, and that his handling of foreign affairs was inept, senior members of the royal family and the ulema (religious leadership) pressured Saud into appointing Faisal to the position of prime minister in 1958, giving Faisal wide executive powers. In this new position, Faisal set about <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> dramatically in an effort to rescue the state treasury from bankruptcy. This policy of financial prudence was to become a hallmark of his era and earned him a reputation for thriftiness among the populace.|$|E
500|$|The {{shrinking}} provincial {{economy and}} increasing relief payments {{brought about the}} return of public deficits to Alberta. [...] Brownlee, a fiscal conservative in good times, became still more aggressive in <b>cutting</b> <b>spending.</b> [...] In 1931 the government closed {{all but two of}} the province's agricultural colleges, the creation of which by the Liberal government of Arthur Sifton had been a major UFA victory. [...] The civil service shrank from 2,566 at the beginning of 1930 to 1,600 at the end of 1931. [...] Government spending on advertising fell from $36,000 in 1929 to less than $8,000 in 1932. [...] In 1932 the government disbanded the Alberta Provincial Police and asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to take over policing in the province. [...] The same year, government employees earning more than $100 per month took 10% pay cuts; in Brownlee's case, this translated into an annual reduction of nearly $1,500.|$|E

Baldwin was joined by Bob Barr, Alan Keyes and Tom Tancredo at the [...] "Rally Against Illegal Immigration" [...] during {{the first day of the}} convention. Later in August, Baldwin campaigned in Spartanburg, South Carolina where he criticized both parties' presidential nominees as [...] "globalists". He declared his opposition to the Federal Reserve, which he stated has [...] "subjugated" [...] the nation to [...] "foreign dependence". He railed against the use of the National Guard in the Iraq War remarking that the forces should be used to [...] "repel" [...] the [...] "invasion" [...] of illegal aliens from the southern border, and described the United Nations as [...] "a sinister organization run by Marxists, socialists and communists." [...] Baldwin criticized both major parties for not <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> stating that [...] "the only difference between Democrats and Republicans is Democrats want to tax and spend and Republicans want to borrow and spend." [...] He promised that slashing spending would be a priority in his administration.|$|E
500|$|In an April 21, 1975, {{letter to}} Pinochet, Friedman {{considered}} the [...] "key economic problems of Chile are clearly... inflation {{and the promotion}} of a healthy social market economy". He stated that [...] "There is only one way to end inflation: by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money..." [...] and that [...] "...cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit, because it... strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth". As to how rapidly inflation should be ended, Friedman felt that [...] "for Chile where inflation is raging at 10–20% a month... gradualism is not feasible. It would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive." [...] Choosing [...] "a brief period of higher unemployment..." [...] was the lesser evil.. and that [...] "the experience of Germany,... of Brazil..., of the post-war adjustment in the U.S.... all argue for shock treatment". In the letter Friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with [...] "...a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress" [...] and [...] "...for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal... to be taken as illustrative" [...] although his knowledge of Chile was [...] "too limited to enable [...] to be precise or comprehensive". He listed a [...] "sample proposal" [...] of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including [...] "the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market. For example, suspend... the present law against discharging employees". He closed, stating [...] "Such a shock program could end inflation in months". His letter suggested that <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, {{with the}} number of {{parliamentary}} seats increased to 31, another election saw a repeat of the 1961 votes. Due to the layout of the constituencies, which were gerrymandered by the ZNP, the ASP, led by Abeid Amani Karume, won 54 {{percent of the popular vote}} but only 13 seats, while the ZNP/ZPPP won the rest and set about strengthening its hold on power. The Umma Party, formed that year by disaffected radical Arab socialist supporters of the ZNP, was banned, and all policemen of African mainland origin were dismissed. This removed a large portion of the only security force on the island, and created an angry group of paramilitary-trained men with knowledge of police buildings, equipment and procedures. Furthermore, the new Arab-dominated government made it clear that in foreign policy, the Sultanate of Zanzibar would be seeking close links with the Arab world, especially Egypt and had no interest in forging relationships with the nations on the African mainland as the black majority wished. Slavery had been abolished in Zanzibar in 1897, but much of the Arab elite who dominated the island's politics made little effort to hide their racist views of the black majority as their inferiors, a people fit only for slavery. In Parliament, the Minister of Finance Juma Aley responded to questions from Karume by insultingly saying he need not answer questions from a mere [...] "boatman". Aley further explained in another speech in Parliament that if Arabs were over-represented in the Cabinet, it was not because of racism, but rather it was only because the mental abilities of blacks were so abysmally low and the mental abilities of Arabs like himself were so high, a remark that enraged the black majority. [...] Memories of Arab slave-trading in the past (some of the older blacks had been slaves in their youth) together with a distinctly patronizing view of the Arab elite towards the black majority in the present meant that much of the black population of Zanzibar [...] had a ferocious hatred of the Arabs, viewing the new Arab-dominated government as illegitimate. The government did not help broaden its appeal to the black majority by drastically <b>cutting</b> <b>spending</b> in schools in areas with high concentrations of blacks. The government's budget with its draconian spending cuts in schools in black areas was widely seen as a sign that the Arab-dominated government was planning to lock the blacks in a permanent second-class status.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{covering}} most of {{the events}} that occurred during the Reagan presidency (19811989), the book's most notable omission is the rejection of Robert Bork as a Supreme Court justice, with very little mention made of Reagan's judicial appointments.
