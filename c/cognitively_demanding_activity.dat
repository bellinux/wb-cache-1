40|$|An {{important}} and valued {{part of the}} skill of musical improvisation {{is to be able}} to play what we hear in our head (audiation). Improvisation is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activity,</b> involving the production of musical material in real time. This requires the simultaneous involvement and coordination of many different skills, and places demands on working memory, memory retrieval, auditory and sensory-motor systems. Some recent studies support a cognitive model of improvisation which posits the deployment of stored rhythmic and melodic patterns via motor programmes. According to the theory of event coding, actions and their perceptual consequences share the same cognitive representation and behavioural and fMRI studies have offered evidence supporting this theory. Since musical actions have sounds as perceptual consequences and sensorimotor coupling is bidirectional, this is compatible with improvisers imagining the sounds as they play them. However, phenomenological accounts and interview studies suggest musicians use different strategies to generate ideas in improvisation, such as musictheoretic ideas and motor patterns or ‘muscle memory’. So questions remain regarding the precise role of audiation in improvisation: what is musicians’ experience of musical imagery as they improvise? Is auditory imagery cognitively prior to action or post hoc? How accurate is auditory imagery? What proportion of musical output involves audiation and how sensitive is this to context? The aim of this paper is to offer a coherent explanatory framework for improvisation from the perspective of cognitive psychology and to propose experimental paradigms to begin to answer some of these questions. On the basis of a review of the literature, it is concluded that two approaches offer a way forward: altered auditory feedback (AAF) and a blocking paradigm in which interference conditions seek to disrupt the tonal loop in working memory...|$|E

A beneficial effect for fluid intake was strongest when athletic performance involved continuous exercise tasks. Further, the magnitude of improvement appeared greater when the continuous exercise was performed at elevated environmental temperatures and over longer exercise durations. Whilst the volume of fluid consumed (relative to BM lost) did not appear to influence the size of the treatment effect, fluid intake at levels complying with current recommendations for completely replacing lost fluid (1.25 – 1.50  L kg BM lost− 1) [16, 17] are yet to be thoroughly investigated. Evidence for a beneficial effect of fluid intake on intermittent, resistance and sport-specific exercise performance and cognitive function or mood is less apparent and requires further elucidation.|$|R

In an exploratory study, we examined whether patterns of computer mouse movements obtained from routine home computer use discriminated between older adults with and without MCI.

Mouse pointer movement variables were computed during one week of routine home computer use using algorithms that identified and characterized mouse movements within each computer use session. ResultsMCI was associated with making significantly fewer total mouse moves (P < . 01) and making mouse movements that were more variable, less efficient, and with longer pauses between movements (P < . 05).

40|$|In {{cognitive}} aging research, the “engagement hypothesis” {{suggests that}} the participation in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities</b> helps maintain better cognitive performance in later life. In differential psychology, the “investment” theory proclaims that age differences in cognition are influenced by personality traits that determine when, where, and how people invest their ability. Although both models follow similar theoretical rationales, they differ in their emphasis of behavior (i. e., activity engagement) versus predisposition (i. e., investment trait). The current study compared a cognitive activity engagement scale (i. e., frequency of participation) with an investment trait scale (i. e., need for cognition) and tested their relationship with age differences in cognition in 200 British adults. Age was negatively associated with fluid and positively with crystallized ability but had no relationship with need for cognition and activity engagement. Need for cognition {{was positively related to}} activity engagement and cognitive performance; activity engagement, however, was not associated with cognitive ability. Thus, age differences in cognitive ability were largely independent of engagement and investment...|$|R
40|$|Typical Intellectual Engagement (TIE) {{comprises}} the preference {{to engage in}} <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities</b> and has been proposed as a potential explanatory variable of individual differences in cognitive abilities. Little is known, however, about the factorial structure of TIE, its relations to socio-demographic variables, and its influence on intellectual functioning in old age. In the present study, data of 364 adults (65 - 81 years) from the Zurich Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging (ZULU) were used to investigate the factorial structure of TIE and to examine the hypothesis that TIE is associated more strongly with crystallized intelligence than with fluid intelligence in old age. A measurement model of a second order factor based on a structure of four correlated first order factors (Reading, Problem Solving, Abstract Thinking, and Intellectual Curiosity) evinced an excellent fit. After controlling for age, sex, and formal education, TIE was more strongly associated with crystallized intelligence than with fluid intelligence, comparable to results in younger persons. More detailed analyses showed that this association is mostly defined via Reading and Intellectual Curiosity...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive reserve (CR) {{is thought}} to reflect the {{cumulative}} brain potential derived from various <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities</b> throughout the entire life. It seems to mediate both one's cognitive performance and clinical expression of different brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease. Many researchers have tried to assess CR by using proxies, such as educational and occupational level, participation in leisure time activities and intelligence, alone or in various combinations. Recently, a new tool for measuring CR status was constructed, the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), comprising of all known CR proxies. CRIq also {{takes into account the}} amount of time spent during each of these activities, thus capturing the core idea behind CR theory: its active day to day formulation during all age stages. Aim of the present study was to adapt CRIq for the Greek population. The questionnaire was administered to 591 participants (age range 18 - 89) stratified in three age groups (young adults, middle-aged, elderly). The middle-aged group showed higher total CRI as well as CRI-Education, CRI-WorkingActivity and CRI-LeisureTime scores compared to both other groups, reflecting more years of engagement in all activities. Gender also influenced CRI scores, with men scoring higher than women, again resulting from historical and social perspectives. Overall, the CRIq showed satisfactory internal consistency, was easy to administer and its adaptation process provided solid and interpretable results.

40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) {{is characterized by}} a level of {{cognitive impairment}} that is lower than normal for a person 2 ̆ 7 s age, but higher functioning than a demented person. In the majority of cases people with mild cognitive impairment revert back to normal cognitive functioning. However MCI often evolves into other more serious etiologies such as but not limited to: Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Much effort has been made in determining the prognosis of a person with mild cognitive impairment. While treatment options are still in their exploratory stages (much of the work in this area has been fruitless) early intervention is considered to be imperative. Evidence does suggest that engaging in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities</b> (such as reading a book or playing a game of chess) can have a protective effect against the symptoms of dementia. Furthermore there are dietary changes that are correlated with better outcomes in many of the possible etiologies associated with mild cognitive impairment.

Here in, diagnostic techniques and methods are reviewed including: neuropsychological assessment, biomarkers in blood plasma, functional imaging (FDG PET 2 ̆ 6 fMRI), Volumetric and morphological imaging (using MRI), dynamical analysis of EEG and MEG data, and spontaneous speech analysis. Also explored is the link between mild cognitive impairment and depression, as well as the evolution of the construct of MCI. Through investigation of these techniques and areas of interest it becomes clear that mild cognitive impairment is a complex clinical construct arising from a variety of causes and circumstances...|$|R

40|$|M. A. (Anthropology) Thus far, the {{earliest}} convincing {{evidence for the}} production and use of bow-and-arrow technology {{has been associated with}} Homo sapiens who lived ~ 64 ka in southern Africa. In contrast to a single-component wooden spear or a composite stone-tipped spear, bow-and-arrow utilisation – where one composite tool is required to effectively use another – could signify higher levels of cognitive complexity and behavioural flexibility. Lombard and Haidle (2012) postulate that a novel cognitive component is evident in technological symbiosis, i. e., the ability to focus simultaneously and actively on manipulating a complementary set of tools that are independent from one another, but are used as an effective unit to obtain a single goal. For example, when a bow is used to fire an arrow to obtain meat. In the current pilot study, I investigated the validity of Lombard and Haidle’s (2012) hypothesis of technological symbiosis from a neurological perspective. Electroencephalography (EEG) equipment recorded cortical activity (within the parietal, frontal midline and orbitofrontal cortices), when each of the participants (n. = 4) engaged in three non-symbiotic and symbiotic tasks. The purpose of the pilot experiment was to measure levels of cortical activity with non-symbiotic and symbiotic tool use in an attempt to assess whether greater ‘neural effort’ was needed for the symbiotic tasks. These results suggest that executive functions (attention, active-inhibition, context updating, reinforcement learning and memory rehearsal) were enhanced when the participants engaged in the symbiotic bow-and-arrow task, as opposed to the non-symbiotic spear task. Furthermore, an increase in white matter (found within the prefrontal cortex), as opposed to changes in brain structure size, might be responsible for the complex executive functions that are identified in our species. Future research on the effects that task practice has on cortical dynamics (patterns of cortical activity) might be beneficial – for instance, it might help us understand the ways in which neural pathways are restructured, rewired or altered with repeated exposure to <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that cognitive abilities decline with normal aging. At {{the same time}} it is also recognized that there is variability in the magnitude and rate of decline among aging individuals. A similar phenomenon exists for dementia, where individuals with similar neuropathologic burden present with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Of importance is determining what factors account for this variability, and whether individuals can modify these factors in order to preserve their cognitive abilities with aging or delay the onset of dementia. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine three potentially modifiable lifestyle factors 2 ̆ 7 association with age-related differences/change in cognitive performance and risk for dementia by conducting three separate studies. The first study examined the association between engagement in lifestyle activities and concurrent cognitive speed performance. The second study examined whether there are differential associations between social resource factors and change in cognitive performance. The final study estimated the risk of late-life dementia in Swedish twins as a function of fruit and vegetable consumption in midlife. Taken together, the results of these studies provide evidence that individuals may be able to protect themselves against age-related cognitive decline or dementia by modifying their lifestyle. Specifically, individuals may benefit their cognitive speed performance by engaging in more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities.</b> Declines in episodic memory performance may be alleviated by being more satisfied with social support, and declines in general cognitive performance and speed and attention in young-old adults may be attenuated by having a larger social network of friends. Finally, the risk of all types of dementia and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease may be reduced by consuming a moderate amount of fruits and vegetables in the diet, especially for females, those with self-reported angina, and those who consumed alcohol in midlife. These findings contribute to the literature on potential strategies to maintain cognitive health with aging and serve as groundwork for future intervention studies...|$|R
40|$|Individuals do {{not only}} show large {{differences}} {{with regard to}} the judgments and decisions they make, but also {{with regard to the}} strategies they use to arrive at their decisions. However, individual differences in decision strategy selection have gained insufficient attention so far. For this reason, I investigate individual differences with respect to the application of the fast-and-frugal heuristics of the adaptive toolbox – a framework that has become increasingly important within the field of decision making. In particular, I address {{one of the most prominent}} examples of the adaptive toolbox: the recognition heuristic (RH), that is, a decision strategy for paired comparisons which bases choice solely on recognition while ignoring any additional information. The overarching aim of my thesis is to enhance the understanding of the cognitive and personality traits underlying individual differences in use of the RH. However, so far, there has been a deficiency in the methods relating individual traits to RH-use. For this purpose, I extend a measurement model of the RH to a hierarchical version incorporating individual traits directly into the estimation of RH-use. This methodological advance allows detection of the dispositional determinants of variation in strategy selection regarding the RH in a straightforward and unbiased way. Equipped with the required methods, the first project reported in this thesis investigates temporal and cross-situational stability in use of the RH. By demonstrating these important preconditions, I ensure that it is principally possible to find reliable relations between individual traits and RH-use. Building upon these results, the second project addresses the effect of (fluid and crystallized) intelligence on individual differences in adaptive RH-use. In sum, there is supportive evidence that adaptive application of the RH to the decision context is moderated by fluid but not crystallized intelligence. Extending this line of research, the third project aims at explaining individual differences in RH-use free of any interaction with the situation. In brief, RHuse is found to decrease with need for cognition (i. e., inclination towards <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities)</b> but not to increase with faith in intuition (i. e., trust in feelings). To conclude, by means of the three projects reported herein and with the aid of the newly developed hierarchical measurement model of RH-use, I demonstrate that RH-use represents a person-specific decision making style that is temporally and crosssituationally stable, and that is affected by fluid intelligence and need for cognition...|$|R

Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers participated in a crossover design in which each participant completed a simulated driving task on 2 days, separated by a 1 -week washout period. On the mobile phone day, participants performed the simulated driving task under each of 4 conditions: no phone usage, a hands-free naturalistic conversation, a hands-free <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> conversation, and texting. On the alcohol day, participants performed the simulated driving task at four different blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels: 0. 00, 0. 04, 0. 07, and 0. 10. Driving performance was assessed by variables including time within target speed range, time spent speeding, braking reaction time, speed deviation, and lateral lane position deviation. Results: In the BAC 0. 07 and 0. 10 alcohol conditions, participants spent less time in the target speed range and more time speeding and took longer to brake in the BAC 0. 04, 0. 07, and 0. 10 than in the BAC 0. 00 condition. In the mobile phone condition, participants took longer to brake in the natural hands-free conversation, <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> hands-free conversation and texting conditions and spent less time in the target speed range and more time speeding in the <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding,</b> hands-free conversation, and texting conditions.

In order to fill in this gap, two studies using a brain-imaging technique, near-infrared spectroscopy, were conducted in order to determine a cerebral basis for the effectiveness of reading aloud activities. Study 1 investigated learners with high L 2 proficiency to show the difference in cerebral activation between L 2 and L 1 learners as they read a passage aloud.

Study 2 then examined learners with both high and low L 2 proficiency to show the effect of material difficulty vis-à-vis the learners’ L 2 proficiency. The effect of repeated reading aloud activities was also investigated in this study. These studies show that (a) reading aloud in L 2 results in a higher degree of cerebral activation than reading aloud in L 1 does; (b) reading material beyond learners’ L 2 ability aloud results in low brain activation; (c) repetition of the same normal reading aloud activity in L 2 does not necessarily increase (or decrease) the level of cerebral activation; however, (d) including a repetitive <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> reading aloud <b>activity</b> does cause high brain activation.
