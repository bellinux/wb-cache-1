The immune self-adjusting contour error coupled control method based on grating ruler sensors is developed to improve machine tool <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy</b> in the paper. Firstly, measure and convert the feed axis actual displacement into pulse signals with grating ruler sensors on each sampling period; then calculate the contour error and contour error compensation control quantity.

40|$|Flexure-based micro-motion {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} widely utilized in modern precision industry due to their inherent merits, while model uncertainty, uncertain nonlinearity, and cross-coupling effect will obviously deteriorate their <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy,</b> especially in the high-speed application. This paper aims at improving the contouring performance of a flexure-based micro-motion stage utilized for tracking repetitive trajectories. The dynamic characteristic of the micro-motion stage is first studied and modeled as a second-order system, which is identified through an open-loop sinusoidal sweeping test. Then the iterative learning control (ILC) scheme is utilized to improve the tracking performance of individual axis of the stage. A nonlinear cross-coupled iterative learning control (CCILC) scheme is proposed to reduce the coupling effect among each axis, and thus improves <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the stage. The nonlinear gain function incorporated into the CCILC controller can effectively avoid amplifying the non-recurring disturbances and noises in the iterations, which can further improve the stage’s <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy</b> in high-speed motion. Comparative experiments between traditional PID, ILC, ILC & CCILC, and the proposed ILC & nonlinear CCILC are carried out on the micro-motion stage to track circular and square trajectories. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme outperforms other control schemes much in improving the stage’s <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy</b> in high-speed motion. The study in this paper provides a practically effective technique for the flexure-based micro-motion stage in high-speed contouring motion...|$|E

40|$|Friction is an {{inevitable}} nonlinear phenomenon existing in servomechanisms. Friction errors often affect their motion and <b>contour</b> <b>accuracies</b> during the reverse motion. To reduce friction errors, a novel time-varying friction compensation method is proposed {{to solve the}} problem that the traditional friction compensation methods hardly deal with. This problem leads to an unsatisfactory friction compensation performance and the motion and <b>contour</b> <b>accuracies</b> cannot be maintained effectively. In this method, a trapezoidal compensation pulse is adopted to compensate for the friction errors. A generalized regression neural network algorithm is used to generate the optimal pulse amplitude function. The optimal pulse duration function and the pulse amplitude function can be established by the pulse characteristic parameter learning and then the optimal friction compensation pulse can be generated. The feasibility of friction compensation method was verified on a high-precision X-Y worktable. The experimental results indicated that the motion and <b>contour</b> <b>accuracies</b> were improved greatly with reduction of the friction errors, in different working conditions. Moreover, the overall friction compensation performance indicators were decreased by more than 54 % and this friction compensation method can be implemented easily on most of servomechanisms in industry...|$|R
40|$|Various Methods for {{parametric}} interpolation for NURBS curves {{have been}} proposed in the past. However, the errors caused by the approximate nature of the NURBS interpolator were rarely taken into account. This paper proposes an integrated look-ahead algorithm for parametric interpolation along NURBS curves. The algorithm interpolates the sharp corners on the curve with the exact Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) interpolation. This will minimize the geometric and interpolator approximation errors simultaneously. The algorithm consists of three different modules: a sharp corner detection module, a jerk-limited module, and a dynamics module. Simulations are performed to show correctness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the developed method improves tracking and <b>contour</b> <b>accuracies</b> significantly compared to previously proposed adaptive-feedrate and curvature-feedrate algorithms...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine two aspects of sight-singing instruction: (1) solfège syllables versus the syllable loo for singing patterns and (2) the use of related songs (songs that began with tonal patterns being studied) as compared with unrelated songs. Second-grade students (N = 193) enrolled in general music classes participated in 25 minutes of sight-singing instruction for 16 sessions. In each session a new four-note pattern and song were introduced, and previously learned patterns were reviewed. Four levels of instructional treatment were examined as the independent variable: (1) related songs/solfège, (2) related songs/loo, (3) unrelated songs/solfège, and (4) unrelated songs/loo. Pitch and <b>contour</b> <b>accuracy</b> of familiar and unfamiliar patterns were examined as dependent variables on sight-singing pre-, post-, and retention tests. Results indicated significant pre- to posttest improvement in sight-singing skills. Most post- to retention test differences were nonsignificant, indicating skill retention.

Such pixel-free representations have many advantages and are amenable to operations which are dicult or imprecise with pixels.

We explore an approach in which images are decomposed into structural regions that correspond to specied image characteristics. This is done using relaxation labelling. Information taken at dierent stages during the relaxation is used to extract sub-pixel accurate continuous structural <b>contours.</b> This <b>accuracy</b> is obtained by using snakes as well as the blur present in images (because of the acquisition process). We propose solutions, adapted to our context, to often mentioned problems of snakes, namely initialisation, parameter determination, and instability.

For example, the Melodia melody extraction algorithm employs a pitch con-tour selection stage that relies {{on a number of}} heuristics for selecting the melodic output. In this paper we explore the use of a discriminative model to perform purely data-driven melodic contour selection.
