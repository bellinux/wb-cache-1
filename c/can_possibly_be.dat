Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E

Nothing further is known of him with certainty, although he <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> identified with the patricius Germanus, a leading senator in the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Michael Whitby identifies the younger Germanus with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.|$|E

Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot {{be shown to be}} related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.|$|E

5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E

Some authors have shown that this process of NO reduction to N2O takes place in hepatocytes, specifically in their cytoplasm and mitochondria, and suggested that the N2O <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> produced in mammalian cells. It is well known that N2O is produced by some bacteria during process called denitrification.|$|E

25|$|It is now {{believed}} {{that many of}} the Schumann resonances transients (Q bursts) are related to the transient luminous events (TLEs). In 1995 Boccippio et al. showed that sprites, the most common TLE, are produced by positive cloud-to-ground lightning occurring in the stratiform region of a thunderstorm system, and are accompanied by Q-burst in the Schumann resonances band. Recent observations reveal that occurrences of sprites and Q bursts are highly correlated and Schumann resonances data <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> used to estimate the global occurrence rate of sprites.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s, feral cats {{inhabited}} the Western Australian wheatbelt; they targeted {{a number of}} larger rodents throughout Western Australia. However, extinction occurred before the red fox came to Western Australia (Burbidge, 618). The big-eared hopping mouse had no defenses against Australia's introduced species. Its extinction <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> shown as a ramification of environmental alteration by humans, and predation is another likely possibility, but the true reason for the extinction is uncertain. The presumed decade of extinction is unknown, but is possibly the 1860s, which was soon after {{the date of the}} last known specimen (Burbidge, 618).|$|E
25|$|Gradually, the Gauleiter (English:Gau Leader) {{took control}} over their territories, {{reducing}} the local Minister Presidents, nominally the highest office in the German states, to figureheads. As such, {{the development of the}} Gau from a form inner-party administration to a political and administrative sub-division of the country was gradual, not sudden, but completed by 1934. The process termed Gleichschaltung took care of all political opposition and the Law concerning the reconstruction of the Reich from 30 January 1934 <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> seen as the final date for the transfer of power from the states to the Gaue.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{responses}} to relativity were also expressed by proponents of Neo-Kantianism (Paul Natorp, Bruno Bauch, etc.), and Phenomenology (Oskar Becker, Moritz Geiger etc.). While {{some of them}} only rejected the philosophical consequences, others rejected also the physical consequences of the theory. Einstein was criticized for violating Immanuel Kant's categoric scheme, i.e., it was claimed that space-time curvature caused by matter and energy is impossible, since matter and energy already require the concepts of space and time. Also the three-dimensionality of space, Euclidean geometry, {{and the existence of}} absolute simultaneity were claimed to be necessary for the understanding of the world; none of them <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> altered by empirical findings. By moving all those concepts into a metaphysical area, any form of criticism of Kantianism would be prevented. Other pseudo-Kantians like Ernst Cassirer or Hans Reichenbach (1920), tried to modify Kant's philosophy. Subsequently, Reichenbach rejected Kantianism at all and became a proponent of logical positivism.|$|E

The number eight refers to the cardinal and ordinal directions, and the four-character idiom sei tùng baat daaht (...) , a common expression loosely translated as [...] "reachable in all directions". It is also considered a lucky number in Chinese culture, and the phrase baat daaht <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> associated with the similar-sounding faat daaht, which means [...] "getting wealthy" [...] (...) in Cantonese.|$|E

In 1937, Gandhi discussed Zionism with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach. He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that [...] "the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration {{under the protection of}} arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs.

500|$|English theologian Richard Holt Hutton {{summarized}} the poem as Tennyson's [...] "friendly {{picture of the}} insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when {{under the control of}} a luminous reason and a self-controlled will." [...] The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech [...] "the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] A bit later, journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting {{to the heart of the}} remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home." ...|$|E
