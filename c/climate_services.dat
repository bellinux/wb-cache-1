Further, NOAA formally asked the Panel to provide an independent assessment of how NOAA should organize its climate capabilities and make recommendations for a <b>Climate</b> <b>Service</b> line office structure that would integrate NOAA's climate science and research with service delivery. Main Findings The Panel strongly supports {{the creation of a}} <b>Climate</b> <b>Service</b> to be established as a line office within NOAA. The Panel concluded that a NOAA <b>Climate</b> <b>Service,</b> properly configured and implemented, would be uniquely qualified to serve {{the public and private sectors}} as a lead federal agency for <b>climate</b> research and <b>services,</b> and to provide an ongoing accessible, authoritative clearinghouse for all federal science and <b>services</b> related to <b>climate.</b> The report also includes the Panel's observations and recommendations regarding the larger federal climate enterprise, key elements of support needed by the NOAA <b>Climate</b> <b>Service</b> and the importance to the new organization of a clear strategic plan and a comprehensive implementation plan.

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>climate</b> has {{attracted}} attention from both academics and practitioners in recent years. However, there exist two major research gaps in this literature domain. First, <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> research {{to date has}} predominantly focused on its outcomes, with few studies investigating its antecedents. These few studies have primarily relied on a resource-based approach and have focused on certain organisational resources and practices that can enhance <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> Second, there is limited knowledge of how service firms foster a <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in emerging markets {{where much of the}} economic growth is currently occurring. Therefore, this study seeks to gain a more comprehensive understanding of (1) the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> and (2) the extent to which service firms, both local and foreign-owned, create a favourable <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in an emerging market. The broad research problem investigated in this study is: How do service firms, local and foreign-owned, create a favourable <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in an emerging market context? To examine the broad research problem, this study draws upon the resource-based view, social exchange theory and the eclectic paradigm to address the following two research questions: Research question 1 : What are the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in an emerging market context? How do the antecedents interact and influence <b>service</b> <b>climate?</b> Research question 2 : How do <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> and its antecedents differ between local and foreign service firms in an emerging market context? How do the antecedents influence <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> differently across the ownership types? To address these research questions, this study was conducted in two phases: exploratory and explanatory. The exploratory phase yielded new insights into the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> of local and foreign service firms in an emerging market context. It also helped clarify the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> and the potential relationships among them. Based on the findings of this exploratory phase, a conceptual framework was developed and hypotheses were derived. The conceptual framework and hypotheses were then tested in {{the second phase of the}} study using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Survey data from a total of 549 usable responses from service employees in both local and foreign service firms in Vietnam allowed the researcher to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings for the first research question suggested that three groups of antecedents contribute to creating a favourable <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in an emerging market context: firm-based, market-based and culture-based. In terms of firm-based antecedents, the study identified five antecedents positively related to service climate: (1) leadership commitment to service quality, (2) internal customer service, (3) internal processes and service standards, (4) service-oriented human resource management (HRM) and (5) work facilitation resources. In addition, there are significant inter-relationships among these firm-based antecedents in fostering a <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> The data analysis also demonstrated that competitive intensity in emerging markets and employees’ cultural orientation moderate the impacts of the firm-based antecedents on <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> Findings for the second research question showed that there are significant differences in the antecedents and <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> between local and foreign firms. Foreign-owned service firms outperformed local firms on all firm-based antecedents and in <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> In addition, the influence of leadership commitment to service quality and service-oriented HRM on <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> was found to be greater in foreign firms than that in local firms. In contrast, the influence of internal customer <b>service</b> on <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in local firms was greater than that in foreign firms. This study contributes in several ways to our knowledge concerning <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> First, it proposes and tests an integrated model of the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in an emerging market context, which have not been fully examined in prior literature. Second, the study contributes to knowledge about the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> from a market perspective by suggesting the impact of competitive intensity in emerging markets. Third, it extends the literature on the antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> from a cultural perspective by investigating the impact of employees’ cultural orientation on their perception of <b>service</b> <b>climate.</b> Fourth, this study enriches international services research by investigating the factors associated with <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> in internationalised <b>service</b> firms (versus those of domestic ones) from an Asian emerging market perspective. Finally, this study has practical implications because it provides a framework that enables managers of service firms to take action and invest resources to improve their <b>service</b> <b>climate</b> and enhance their competitive advantage in the global marketplace.
