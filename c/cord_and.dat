5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>and</b> by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E

50|$|Historically knotwork {{is divided}} into <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> knots. In the dynastic periods, {{a certain number of}} {{craftsmen}} were stationed in the court and outside the court to produce <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> knots {{in order to meet the}} increasing demand for them at various places of the court. <b>Cord,</b> knot <b>and</b> tassels were made separated and combined later.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corded</b> <b>and</b> woven {{strapping}} {{are available}} in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, <b>corded</b> <b>and</b> woven strapping can have a larger system strength than steel banding. Corded polyester strapping also has a higher elongation than other strapping systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because <b>corded</b> <b>and</b> woven polyester straps are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to steel banding.|$|R
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E

50|$|The galero {{continues}} to appear today in ecclesiastical heraldry {{as part of}} the achievement of the coat of arms of an armigerous Catholic cleric. The ecclesiastical hat replaces the helmet and crest, because those were considered too belligerent for men in the clerical state. The color of the hat and number of tassels indicate the cleric's place in the hierarchy. Generally, priests and ministers have a black hat with <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> tassels, the number depending upon their rank. Bishops generally use a green hat with green <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> six green tassels on each side, archbishops have likewise a green hat with green <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> ten green tassels on each side, and cardinals have a red hat with red <b>cords</b> <b>and</b> fifteen red tassels on each side. Depiction in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style.|$|R
5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>and</b> directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp.

As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E

Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>and</b> an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>and</b> stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, {{one on the left}} and one {{on the right side of}} the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower <b>cord,</b> <b>and</b> these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E

5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> reaches into the head, sustaining the whole body. Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (goodness), Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the whole body, and nourish it.|$|E
5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. <b>Cord</b> <b>and</b> Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. <b>Cord</b> <b>and</b> Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. They {{take care of the}} guards, and hear messages about problems with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only one}} minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return to the deck and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
