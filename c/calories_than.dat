5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more <b>calories</b> <b>than</b> this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

25|$|Body weight {{regulation}} {{requires a}} balance between food intake and energy expenditure.

40|$|Open access, freely {{available}} online Dietary restriction (DR) extends life span in diverse organisms, including mammals, and common mechanisms {{may be at}} work. DR is often known as calorie restriction, {{because it has been}} suggested that reduction of <b>calories,</b> rather <b>than</b> of particular nutrients in the diet, mediates extension of life span in rodents. We here demonstrate that extension of life span by DR in Drosophila is not attributable to the reduction in calorie intake. Reduction of either dietary yeast or sugar can reduce mortality and extend life span, but by an amount that is unrelated to the calorie content of the food, and with yeast having a much greater effect per <b>calorie</b> <b>than</b> does sugar. <b>Calorie</b> intake is therefore not the key factor in the reduction of mortality rate by DR in this species...|$|R

25|$|This verse {{has caused}} some {{to ask if}} meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has more <b>calories</b> <b>than</b> fruits and vegetables, which some {{individuals}} may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often {{did not have enough}} other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the use of meat is sparingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{profound}} {{weight loss}} which occurs after bariatric surgery {{is due to}} taking in much less energy (<b>calories)</b> <b>than</b> the body needs to use every day. Fat tissue must be burned to offset the deficit, and weight loss results. Eventually, as the body becomes smaller, its energy requirements are decreased, while the patient simultaneously finds it possible to eat somewhat more food. When the energy consumed {{is equal to the}} calories eaten, weight loss will stop. Proximal GBP typically results in loss of 6080% of excess body weight, and very rarely leads to excessive weight loss. The risk of excessive weight loss is slightly greater with distal GBP.|$|E

500|$|Rhythm {{games have}} been used for health purposes. For example, {{research}} has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they burn more <b>calories</b> <b>than</b> walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which {{has one of the highest}} rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools' physical education classes. According to The New York Times, more than [...] "several hundred schools in at least 10 states" [...] have used Dance Dance Revolution (along with In the Groove) in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country's obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game's use in schools. In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing Dance Dance Revolution, which drove sales of the game's home console version. Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.|$|E

However, a carrot has only 23 mg protein per kcal or twice the minimum recommendation, a banana meets the minimum, and an apple is below recommendation.

40|$|This paper {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} economic status, as represented by income or total expenditure, and nutrition, as represented by calories consumed. We use the Bolivian 2003 - 2004 income and expenditure survey to estimate nonparametric and parametric elasticities of calorie consumption and price per calorie with respect to total expenditure. Our estimates control for potential correlated measurement error problems in both, the dependent and independent variables. We find significant non-linearities in both relationships. Poor people, whose income {{is not enough to}} buy sufficient food, have a much higher elasticity of calorie consumption and a lower elasticity of price per <b>calorie</b> <b>than</b> their counter parts whose income is enough to eat. Consistent mean estimates for the calorie consumption elasticity are between 44 and 48 and between 32 and 33 for the price per calorie elasticity.

50|$|In {{recent years}} it has been {{hypothesized}} that the increase of high-fructose corn syrup usage in processed foods {{may be linked to}} various health conditions, including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and obesity. However, there is to date little evidence that high-fructose corn syrup is any unhealthier, <b>calorie</b> for <b>calorie,</b> <b>than</b> sucrose or other simple sugars. The fructose content and fructose:glucose ratio of high-fructose corn syrup do not differ markedly from clarified apple juice. Some researchers hypothesize that fructose may trigger the process by which fats are formed, {{to a greater extent than}} other simple sugars. However, most commonly used blends of high-fructose corn syrup contain a nearly one-to-one ratio of fructose and glucose, just like common sucrose, and should therefore be metabolically identical after the first steps of sucrose metabolism, in which the sucrose is split into fructose and glucose components. At the very least, the increasing prevalence of high-fructose corn syrup has certainly led to an increase in added sugar calories in food, which may reasonably increase the incidence of these and other diseases.|$|R
