50|$|An {{intuitive}} {{sense of}} the response of a saturated elastic porous medium to mechanical loading can be developed by thinking about, or experimenting with, a fluid-saturated sponge. If a fluid- saturated sponge is <b>compressed,</b> <b>fluid</b> will flow from the sponge. If the sponge is in a fluid reservoir and compressive pressure is subsequently removed, the sponge will reimbibe the fluid and expand. The volume of the sponge will also increase if its exterior openings are sealed and the pore fluid pressure is increased. The basic ideas underlying the theory of poroelastic materials are that the pore fluid pressure contributes to the total stress in the porous matrix medium and that the pore fluid pressure alone can strain the porous matrix medium. There is fluid movement in a porous medium {{due to differences in}} pore fluid pressure created by different pore volume strains associated with mechanical loading of the porous medium.|$|E

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la 1 st International Conference on Truffle Research celebrada en Vic (España) del 9 al 12 {{de marzo de}} 2014. At present, {{researchers}} are facing new challenges {{in the development of}} new extraction techniques/processes {{that can be used to}} both, analyze and obtain valuable compounds from natural sources. Up to now, traditional extraction methods (mainly solid-liquid extraction) have been used to extract bioactives; these methods have several drawbacks including time consuming, laborious, low selectivity and/or low extraction yields. New challenges involve the development of processes that are fast, selective, efficient, sustainable, green (without using toxic organic solvents), with high yields and low cost. The techniques able to meet these requirements are, among others, those based on the use of <b>compressed</b> <b>fluids</b> such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and subcritical water extraction (SWE), which are among the more promising processes. Depending on the polarity of the green compressed f﻿luid, different “green” or environmentally clean technologies can be used, as can be seen in Figure 1. The use of such technologies in different fields related to truffle research and applications will be presented and proposed to the audience; for instance, <b>compressed</b> <b>fluids</b> could be used: 1) as sample preparation technique for authenticity control of the raw materials and samples; 2) as extraction process to recover valuable compounds from low quality truffles or by-products; 3) as a new tool to develop new flavors and textures in molecular gastronomy.
