500|$|On 26 September, the CEDA {{announced}} {{it would no longer}} support the RRP's minority government. It was replaced by an RRP cabinet, again led by Lerroux, that included three members of the CEDA. A UGT general strike was unsuccessful in most of Spain. [...] Lluís <b>Companys</b> (leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia and the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia) saw an opportunity in the general strike and declared Catalonia an independent state inside the federal republic of Spain; the Esquerra, however, refused to arm the populace, {{and the head of the}} military in Catalonia, Domingo Batet, charged with putting down the revolt, showed similar restraint. In response, Lluís <b>Companys</b> was arrested and Catalan autonomy was suspended. This aggrieved Franco, who was directing the military from Madrid. Franco was put in informal command of the military effort against the revolt in Asturias, the only place where it had succeeded. Around 30,000 workers were called to arms in ten days. [...] Atrocities were carried out by both sides. Franco's men, some brought in from Spain's Army of Africa, killed men, women and children and carried out summary executions after the main cities of Asturias were retaken. About 1,000 workers were killed, with about 250 government soldiers left dead. The failed rising in Asturias marked the effective end of the Republic. Months of retaliation and repression followed; torture was used on political prisoners. Even moderate reformists within the CEDA became sidelined. The two generals in charge of the campaign, Franco and Manuel Goded Llopis, were seen as heroes. Azaña was unsuccessfully made out to be a revolutionary criminal by his right-wing opponents. Gil Robles once again prompted a cabinet collapse, and five positions in Lerroux's new government were conceded to CEDA, including one awarded to Gil Robles himself. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the military was purged of republican members and reformed. Those loyal to Robles were promoted, and Franco was made Chief of Staff.|$|E
