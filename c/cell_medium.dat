40|$|In {{this study}} we {{compared}} some common Bartonella culturing methodologies using four diverse species causing human illnesses. Based on {{a review of the}} literature, we focused on three major inconsistencies between protocols: base <b>medium,</b> <b>cell</b> coculture, and temperature. Our data showed that Bartonella tamiae demonstrated temperature-dependent growth limitations between common culturing conditions only 2 °C apart. Additionally, growth of B. quintana was significantly enhanced by the presence of mammalian cell coculture under mammalian cell culture conditions; however, when the medium was modified to incorporate insect <b>cell</b> culture-based <b>medium,</b> coculturing with mammalian cells was no longer needed. In this study, we were able to overcome these temperature- and cell-dependent limitations and accommodate all of the strains tested by combining mammalian <b>cell</b> culture-based <b>medium</b> with insect <b>cell</b> culture-based <b>medium...</b>|$|R

30|$|During the NRU assay, the Zn {{content of}} the <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> was {{quantified}} to check the level of ZnO dissolution in the cell media. In order to assess the release of Zn within {{the first half of}} the 7 -day exposure, the <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> was sampled after 3  days of cell exposure, then the <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> was replaced with a fresh one and again sampled after another 4  days (at the end of the exposure). The selection of the sampling time was in line with the cell viability assessment (NRU assay). Prior to the analysis, 0.75 mL of concentrated nitric acid (65  % HNO 3, pro analysis, Carlo Erba Reagenti, Arese, Italy) was added to 0.75 mL of the <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> from each of the test vessels. The samples were digested in the Milestone Ethos E (Bergamo, Italy) microwave lab station equipped with an SK- 10 high-pressure segmented rotor and 3  mL quartz microsampling inserts.

30|$|FMNPs were {{successfully}} prepared by improved reverse micro-emulsion method. The prepared FMNPs possess strong fluorescent signal and high magnetization saturation intensity. FMNPs exhibited good biocompatibility to human normal cells with {{the concentration of}} 50 μg/ml FMNPs in <b>cell</b> <b>medium,</b> and to mice injected within the dose of 60 μg(2 mg/kg. body weight) FMNPs. Conversely, when the dose of FMNPs reach or overrun 100 μg/ml in <b>cell</b> <b>medium,</b> or 60 μg to be injected into mice, cells and mice exhibited obvious toxic signs. Therefore, we strongly suggest that FMNPs can be safely used for cell labeling and in vivo tracking and imaging within 60 μg, and do not affect cell function and mice lifespan.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{problems}} with overhead irrigation systems for cell transplant production, uniformity of water supply by a boom spraying system was investigated. Furthermore, uneven water soaking into individual <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> caused by plant cover growing in such cells was investigated. The amount of water supply from a boom spraying system varied considerable with {{the arrangement of the}} nozzles. Although a larger number of nozzles was set on the boom, the maximum amount of supplied water in {{the central part of the}} boom was about twice as much as that at each end of the boom. When no plant was grown in the cells, uniform water supply to individual cell mudium was obtained by a downright sprinkler system. However, when stock (Matthiola incana R. Br.) plants were grown in cells, variation in the amount of water soaking into the medium increased noticeably with increase in the plant size growing in the cells and with a decrease in the amount of supplied water. Plant covers with overlapped leaves may disturb the uniformity in the amount of water soaked into individual <b>cell</b> <b>medium.</b> As twice the water consumption may be required for uniform water supply into individual <b>cell</b> <b>medium</b> with an overhead irrigation system, a subirrigation system may be desirable for economical and ecological automatic irrigation to produce cell transplants on a large scale. セル育苗における灌水方法として用いられている頭上散水法の問題点を明らかにするため，実際の苗生産施設において，ブーム式の頭上散水装置による育苗ベンチ内の散水むらを調べた．また，苗齢（ 23 ， 42 日齢区）の異なるストックセル苗に散水ノズルによって散水（１/２セルトレイあたり０， 150 ， 300 ， 450 ）した場合のセルごとの水分吸収量の変動を調べた．ブーム式の頭上散水装置による散水量は，ノズルからの散水の重なり程度によって大きく異なり，散水量の最大値は最小値の約２倍であった．ブームの中央部においても散水量にばらつきがみられ，最大 30 %程度異なった．均一な散水を行った場合であっても，セルで植物が生育している場合には，散水量が少ないほどセルあたりの灌水量の変動が大きくなった．また，植物体（葉面積）が大きいほど，変動が大きくなった．以上のことから，頭上散水法ですべてのセルに必要量散水するには，蒸発散量の２倍以上の散水が必要と推定され，セル育苗の灌水自動化にあたっては，灌水の均一化，養水分の利用効率の面から，頭上散水法より底面給水法を採用することが望ましいと考えられた...|$|E
