5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} game {{was largely a}} defensive battle with little scoring from either team. New York scored the game's first {{points in the first}} quarter on a 21-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but the Browns went into the lead in the second quarter when Marion Motley ran for a touchdown after a 70-yard drive. The Yankees retook the lead in the third quarter, marching 80 yards down the field for a Sanders touchdown. Cleveland reached the New York 18-yard line {{at the end of the}} third, but the drive stalled and Lou Groza missed a short field goal, his third failed attempt of the game. Groza had suffered a sprained left ankle, and Chet Adams substituted for him. Adams, however, missed another field goal in the fourth quarter. The Browns took the lead again in the fourth quarter when Graham passed to Lavelli for a 16-yard touchdown. Groza came back in and kicked the extra point, giving Cleveland a 14–9 advantage with 4:31 to play in the game. Sanders returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards, and the Yankees started the drive at the Browns' 45-yard line. The Yankees appeared poised for a comeback, but Graham intercepted a pass on a third down and Cleveland was almost able to run out the <b>clock.</b> <b>Time</b> expired after a Tommy Colella punt and one short Yankees completion.|$|E

5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the <b>clock.</b> <b>Time</b> expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this process, the mean solar day, which is {{nominally}} 86,400 seconds long, is actually getting longer when measured in SI seconds with stable atomic clocks. (The SI second, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) The small difference accumulates over time, which leads to an increasing difference between our <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> (Universal Time) on the one hand, and Atomic Time and Ephemeris Time on the other hand: see ΔT.

2500|$|A {{familiar}} use of modular arithmetic {{is in the}} 12-hour clock, {{in which}} the day {{is divided into two}} 12-hour periods. If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be , {{but this is not the}} answer because <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> [...] "wraps around" [...] every 12 hours. Because the hour number starts over after it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12. According to the definition below, 12 is congruent not only to 12 itself, but also to 0, so the time called [...] "12:00" [...] could also be called [...] "0:00", since 12 is congruent to 0 modulo 12.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} definitely verified {{use of a}} differential was in a clock made by Joseph Williamson in 1720. It {{employed a}} differential to add the equation of time to local mean time, {{as determined by the}} clock mechanism, to produce solar time, which would have been the same as the reading of a sundial. During the 18th Century, sundials were considered to show the [...] "correct" [...] time, so an ordinary clock would frequently have to be readjusted, even if it worked perfectly, because of seasonal variations in the equation of time. Williamson's and other equation clocks showed sundial time without needing readjustment. Nowadays, we consider clocks to be [...] "correct" [...] and sundials usually incorrect, so many sundials carry instructions about how to use their readings to obtain <b>clock</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) {{was another}} major {{precursor}} of modernism, with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the [...] "will to power" [...] (Wille zur Macht), was of central importance: [...] "Nietzsche often identified life itself with 'will to power', that is, with an instinct {{for growth and}} durability." [...] Henri Bergson (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> and the direct, subjective, human experience of time.

50|$|There is a {{tendency}} to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their meridians. The main {{reason for this is that}} similar working day schedules around the world have led to people rising on average at 07:00 <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> and going to bed at 23:00 <b>clock</b> <b>time.</b> Another reason is that it can allow the more efficient use of sunlight. This means that the middle of the period that people are awake ("awake time noon") occurs at 15:00 (= + 23/2) <b>clock</b> <b>time,</b> whereas - if using as <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> the time of the nautical time zone to which the location concerned geographically belongs - solar noon occurs at 12:00 (+/- 30 min) <b>clock</b> <b>time.</b> To make solar noon coincide more with awake time noon (i.e. make the sun reach its highest point closer to 15:00 <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> rather than 12:00 <b>clock</b> <b>time),</b> the time of one or even two nautical time zones to the east is chosen. Many of these locations also use DST, adding yet another nautical time zone to the east. As a result, in summer, solar noon in the Spanish town of Muxía occurs at 14:37 <b>clock</b> <b>time,</b> indeed very close to awake time noon (15:00). This westernmost area of continental Spain never experiences sunset before 18:00 <b>clock</b> <b>time,</b> even in midwinter, despite its lying more than 40 degrees north of the equator.
