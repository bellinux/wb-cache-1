By Ado traditions, descendants in the male line have exclusive rights to land in perpetuity subject to communal rights of hunting and the Ewi’s right as Sovereign ruler to certain trees and game. Grant of land to non-indigene requires permission of Ewi and his Chiefs to forestall subtle arrival of unknown strangers who could end up as agents of hostile communities or invaders planning to attack the realm.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, nine {{companies}} {{headquartered in}} the Croatia proper {{ranked among the}} largest by income among Croatian companies, and 27 {{out of the top}} 30 companies were based in the region. The largest were INA, Konzum (a part of Agrokor <b>corporate</b> <b>group),</b> Hrvatska elektroprivreda, and T-Hrvatski Telekom—all of them headquartered in Zagreb. Deloitte ranked these four among the top 500 Central European companies, along with a further nine Croatian companies, all of which are headquartered in the region. Deloitte ranks Agrokor as the largest business among Croatia's enterprises. The largest company by income in the Varaždin County is the 15th-ranked food processing industry company Vindija, while the 17th-ranked petrochemical plant Petrokemija, based in Kutina, is the largest company in the Sisak-Moslavina County. Podravka, a Koprivnica-based food processing company, ranks as the 26th-largest by income in Croatia; it is the largest in the Koprivnica-Križevci County. The largest company by income in the Zagreb County is PIK Vrbovec, a meat processing company headquartered in Vrbovec, which ranks 36th in Croatia. Karlovačka pivovara, a brewery headquartered in Karlovac, is the largest company in the Karlovac County. It ranks 115th in Croatia.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> in Japan and elsewhere, and offers a comparison of Japan's <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> with groups in other developed and developing countries. It then proceeds to examine the evolution of <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> in Japan since the mid- 1970 s. The main conclusions that emerge are that: 1. Empirical evidence on the economic roles of <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> in Japan is limited. 2. Japanese groups are, in some respects, quite similar to groups in other countries, but their risk and return characteristics differ substantially. 3. There is little to suggest {{that over the past}} thirty years groups have had a major impact on Japan's industrial structure. In view of these findings, and because {{there is no evidence that}} Japanese groups (unlike those in some other countries) enjoy any particular political clout, it is unlikely that <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> will constitute an impediment to structural change in Japan. ...|$|R

40|$|Holding {{company as}} {{matter of fact}} In the 19 th century the concept of {{artificial}} legal persons as independent legal entities separate from their shareholders was created.

5000|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>groups</b> {{also created}} their own laws and systems of jurisprudence. Specifically, the concept of ācāra in the Hindu legal texts (i.e. the Dharmaśāstra) legitimized these {{localized}} laws. Ācāra allowed localized <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> {{to create their own}} laws, especially in the situations where Hindu legal texts were vague, ambiguous, or completely silent. In particular, ācāra of specific <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> plays out in practice as [...] "norms accepted and imposed by the leaders of various social institutions". The key to the legitimization of these norms created and accepted by the leaders of <b>corporate</b> <b>groups</b> is the concept of the ‘good person’ in ācāra. This principal allows for the dissemination of sastric and Vedic control over practice through the mediation of experts who are learned in the texts. Through this, the Dharmaśāstra is connected to real life in a [...] "mediate" [...] way. Ācāra is also recognized and validated in a legal sense through the device of paribhāṣā, which deemed the conventional rules of ācāra as technical supplementary refinements of the rules of the śāstra.|$|R
