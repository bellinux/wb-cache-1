40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fires</b> are {{a common}} and serious problem in most coal-bearing countries. Thus, it is very {{important}} to monitor changes in <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> Remote sensing provides a useful technique for investigating coal fields at a large scale and for detecting <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> In this study, the spreading direction of a <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> in the Wuda Coal Field (WCF), northwest China, was analyzed using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) data. Using an automated method and based on the land surface temperatures (LST) that were retrieved from these thermal data, <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> related to thermal anomalies were identified; the locations of these fires were validated using a <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> map (CFM) that was developed via field surveys; and the cross-validation of the results was also carried out using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared images. Based on the results from longtime series of satellite TIR data set, the spreading directions of the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> were determined and the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> development on the scale of the entire coal field was predicted. The study delineated the spreading direction using the results of the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> dynamics analysis, and a <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> spreading direction map was generated. The results showed that the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> primarily spread north or northeast in the central part of the WCF and south or southwest in the southern part of the WCF. In the northern part of the WCF, some <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> were spreading north, perhaps coinciding with the orientation of the coal belt. Certain <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> scattered in the northern and southern parts of the WCF were extending in bilateral directions. A quantitative analysis of the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> was also performed; the results indicate that the area of the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> increased an average of approximately 0. 101 km 2 per year...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fires</b> {{are common}} and serious {{phenomena}} in most coal-producing {{countries in the}} world. <b>Coal</b> <b>fires</b> not only burn valuable non-renewable coal reserves but also severely affect the local and global environment. The Rujigou coalfield in Shizuishan City, Ningxia, NW China, {{is well known for}} being a storehouse of anthracite coal. This coalfield is also known for having more <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> than most other coalfields in China. In this study, an attempt was made to study the dynamics of <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> in the Rujigou coalfield, from 2001 to 2007, using multi-temporal nighttime Landsat data. The multi-temporal nighttime short wave infrared (SWIR) data sets based on a fixed thresholding technique were used to detect and monitor the surface <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> and the nighttime enhanced thematic mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) data sets, based on a dynamic thresholding technique, were used to identify the thermal anomalies related to subsurface <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> By validating the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> identified in the nighttime satellite data and the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> extracted from daytime satellite data with the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> map (CFM) manufactured by field survey, we found that the results from the daytime satellite data had higher omission and commission errors than the results from the nighttime satellite data. Then, two aspects of <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> dynamics were analyzed: first, a quantitative analysis of the spatial changes in the extent of <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> was conducted and the results showed that, from 2001 to 2007, the spatial extent of <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> increased greatly to an annual average area of 0. 167 km 2; second, the spreading direction and propagation of <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> was analyzed and predicted from 2001 to 2007, and these results showed that the <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> generally spread towards the north or northeast, but also spread in some places toward the east...|$|R

In this study, <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> temperature is retrieved based on Landsat 5 TM images and Generalized Single-Channel Algorithm (GSCA), in Wuda coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fires,</b> {{including}} both underground and <b>coal</b> waste pile <b>fires,</b> result in large losses of coal resources and emit considerable amounts {{of greenhouse gas}}es. To estimate the annual intensity of greenhouse gas emissions {{and the loss of}} coal resources, estimating the annual loss from fire-influenced coal seams is a feasible approach. This study assumes that the primary cause of coal volume loss is subsurface <b>coal</b> seam <b>fires.</b> The main calculation process is divided into three modules: (1) <b>Coal</b> <b>fire</b> quantity calculations, which use change detection to determine the areas of the different <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages (increase/growth, maintenance/stability and decrease/shrinkage). During every change detections, the amount of <b>coal</b> influenced by <b>fires</b> for these three stages was calculated by multiplying the coal mining residual rate, combustion efficiency, average thickness and average coal intensity. (2) The life cycle estimate is based on remote sensing long-term <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> monitoring. The life cycles for the three <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages and the corresponding life cycle proportions were calculated; (3) The diurnal burnt rates for different <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages were calculated using the CO 2 emission rates from spontaneous combustion experiments, the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> life cycle, life cycle proportions. Then, using the fire-influenced quantity aggregated across the different stages, the diurnal burn rates for the different stages and the time spans between the multi-temporal image pairs used for change detection, we estimated the annual coal loss to be 44. 3 × 103 tons. After correction using a CH 4 emission factor, the CO 2 equivalent emissions resulting from these fires was on the order of 92. 7 × 103 tons. We also discovered that the centers of these <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> migrated from deeper to shallower parts of the coal seams or traveled {{in the direction of the}} coal seam strike.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fires</b> {{cause severe}} {{environmental}} and economic problems. Although satellite remote sensing has been used successfully to detect <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> a satellite data based concept that can quantify {{the majority of the}} detected <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> is still missing. Recently, the determination of fire radiative energy (FRE) has been introduced as a new remote sensing tool to quantify forest and grassland fires. This thesis tests the concept of remotely measured FRE, with a view to ascertaining its potential applicability to <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> It contains an investigation {{of a new generation of}} satellite instruments, including the operational Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) instrument, the experimental Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) satellite sensor and the experimental Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which explores the potential of these sensors to determine <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> radiative energy (CFRE). Additionally, based on the results of this analysis, the thesis presents a new, automated ETM and ASTER data based algorithm, adapted to quantify <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> in semi-arid to arid regions in northern China. Field observations carried out in September 2002 and 2003 in three coalfields in northern China (the Wuda, Gulaben and Ruqigou coalfields) demonstrate that <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies are significantly cooler than forest and grassland fires. The theoretical investigation of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instruments outlines the fact that the thermal infrared (TIR) or mid infrared (MIR) spectral channels of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instrument are particularly effective in registering these ‘warm spots’, whilst the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range is, however, insufficiently sensitive to be able to register spectral <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> radiances. The commonly used bi-spectral fire quantification method (Dozier, 1981) can be applied to BIRD data in order to quantify relatively large and / or hot <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> However, existing FRE retrieval approaches fail to quantify <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> via ASTER and ETM instrument data. In this thesis, a new CFRE retrieval method is presented, which links the fire and background TIR spectral radiances to the CFRE through an empirical relationship. This newly developed TIR method is applied to visually detected fire clusters from night-time ASTER data, and from both day- and night-time ETM data, taken from the three study coalfields in northern China. The ASTER and ETM CFRE values, calculated via the TIR method, are compared to CFRE estimates from BIRD data, calculated via the existing bi-spectral method. Despite the different spatial resolution and spectral properties of the ETM, ASTER and BIRD instruments, CFRE computed from ASTER, ETM and BIRD data show good correlations with one another. However, CFRE retrievals from daytime data appear to be very undependable to background temperature variations, while CFRE, estimated from night-time data, appears to be relatively stable. A comparison between night-time ETM-derived CFRE and the figures given by local mining authorities for total <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> induced, <b>coal</b> loss estimates in the Wuda coalfield gives a clear indication that the overall dimension of the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> problematic can in fact be approximated via satellite data CFRE retrievals. It is thus expected that CFRE derived from night-time satellite data will become a crucial tool in obtaining reliable, quantitative information for <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> A multi-temporal comparison of CFRE retrievals from night-time BIRD and ETM data, covering the Ruqigou and Wuda coalfields, indicates that only major shifts or activity changes in <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> induced, surface anomalies can be observed by means of these data. These results, which could only partially be verified by field observations, indicate that ETM or BIRD data can be used to monitor major changes in <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies. These data however cannot entirely replace detailed field observations, especially in case of smaller and / or cooler <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies...|$|R

The method was detailed by our previous work “Self-Adaptive Gradient-Based Thresholding Method for <b>Coal</b> <b>Fire</b> Detection Based on ASTER Data—Part 1, Methodology”. The current study evaluates the performance of SAGBT and validates its results by using ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images and ground temperature data collected at the Wuda coalfield (China) during satellite overpass. We further analyzed algorithm performance by using nighttime TIR images and images from different seasons. SAGBT-derived fires matched fire spots measured in the field with an average offset of 32. 44 m and a matching rate of 70 %– 85 %. <b>Coal</b> <b>fire</b> areas from TIR images generally agreed with coal-related anomalies from visible-near infrared (VNIR) images.

40|$|The {{mission of}} the <b>Coal</b> <b>Fire</b> Gang (CFG) is to spread {{awareness}} about the global issue of uncontrolled <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> and to highlight them as a low-hanging fruit of immediate emissions reduction. This report summarizes CFG’s research for the WERC competition, for which this topic was chosen as an open task. Beyond raising awareness, CFG modeled, developed and built an experimentation apparatus meant to prove the validity of a relatively cheap extinguishing method which was also novel to the regions in which it could be employed. The apparatus, which simulated an underground <b>coal</b> <b>fire,</b> {{was used to test}} a sand and water extinguishing method. CFG’s results on the experimental research side suggest that the sand and water approach to extinguishing <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> though requiring attention and labor {{for long periods of time}} (up to a few years depending on how long the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> has been burning prior to extinguishing activities), is very cost effective. Exact economics of a particular <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the size and age of the fire, but those costs include only sand, water, labor, and heavy equipment to transport the sand around. The proposed extinguishing technique involves capping all exhaust vents of a fire with sand, and then saturating the sand with water. The steam created by the water on contact with the heated ground and coal then expands and flows through the cavity, flowing out of what were originally combustion air influent vents. This flow reversal could significantly reduce the oxygen intake while also removing heat. Over time, as more vents are discovered or created, they can be capped in the same manner. On the economics side, CFG proved that even at conservative estimates of the cost to extinguish fires and the cost of alternative CO 2 sequestering methods, extinguishing <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> is the for immediate global emission reduction.

This study deals mainly with coal safety requirements in the cement industry which accounts for {{a very small percentage of}} coal usage in pulverized <b>coal</b> <b>firing</b> systems. It also deals with the safety requirements associated with coal grinding, drying, blending. transporting, and storing.
