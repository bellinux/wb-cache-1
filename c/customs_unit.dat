Its duties as a <b>customs</b> <b>unit</b> meant that the unit was garrisoned in Germany for over forty years from 1950 until 1990, never seeing action in the American operations in the Korean War, Vietnam War, or the Persian Gulf War. It was deactivated during the post-Cold War drawdown of the U.S. military.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the impact of}} risk {{analysis}} and assessment training of the customs officers on improvement of their operational performances at Nikola Tesla airport in Belgrade is presented. The {{aim of the research}} is to measure the perception of the customs officers at the airport about the operational effectiveness of the risk analysis training program. The research was conducted through survey, by collecting data from the questionnaire disseminated to the customs officers who were divided into experimental (the officers who attained the training) and control group (the officers who have not attained the training). Both groups of the officers evaluated the statements about their performance contribution in effective collection of revenue, facilitation of trade and passengers, border control and protection level and reputation of the <b>customs</b> <b>unit</b> at the airport. The results of the research show that there is {{a significant difference between the}} groups, which confirms the hypothesis that the risk analysis and assessment training has a positive impact on the customs officers’ operational efficiency...|$|E

'Mechs in BattleTech {{vary from}} one another in many ways, {{including}} mass, speed, chassis configuration, armor and armament, resulting in a practically limitless array of legal 'Mech designs.

Warhammer {{was one of the}} first newly developed miniature wargames to enjoy popularity after role-playing games came to market in 1974.

CGU notes circulated alongside ordinary legal tender notes until 1948, when both were replaced by the gold yuan at the rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 Chinese legal tender dollars = 150,000 <b>customs</b> gold <b>units.</b>|$|R
