It has exhibited sculptures by Thomas Schutte, Scott Burton, Sol Lewitt, and Isamu Noguchi amongst others. The Claes Oldenberg sculpture Giant Three-Way Plug (<b>Cube</b> <b>Tap)</b> was donated and installed opposite the western entrance, as a memorial to d'Harnoncourt.Following her death, the museum renamed the western entrance roadway between 25th and Kelly Drive to the Spring Garden Bridge, from [...] "Art Museum Drive" [...] to [...] "Anne d'Harnoncourt Drive".|$|E

In this test, <b>cubes</b> are <b>tapped</b> by the examiner in novel sequences of increasing length after which participants are required to reproduce each sequence immediately. Objectives: To evaluate spatial working memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: 30 elderly control subjects (21 women, 9 men) and 30 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (15 women and 15 men), with 8 {{or more years of}} schooling, were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), digit span and Corsi block-tapping test. Proportions were compared using Chi-Square, and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney tests. Results: AD patients were older than controls (p= 0. 014), but there were no differences regarding gender or educational level between these groups. The performance on the Corsi block-tapping test differed between AD and control individuals (p= 0. 010), and between patients with moderate dementia and controls (p= 0. 032), but not between control individuals and patients with mild dementia (p= 0. 090). Conclusions: In the present study, AD patients with moderate dementia showed impairment in spatial working memory while those with mild dementia did not. This finding {{may be due to the}} relatively small sample size, but it is also possible that spatial memory may be normal in the initial (limbic) phase of AD...|$|R

Methods A matched case control study was conducted, on 19 July 2005, for investigating risk factors, using a structured questionnaire on food consumption. A multivariate analysis was conducted to estimate the adjusted Odds Ratios. Laboratory and environmental investigation were also performed. Results On {{the day of the}} study 41 cases were identified and 41 controls were enrolled. Controls were matched for age and gender. The mean age of the cases was 26 years old, and 58 % were female. The clinical pattern of the disease was characterised by the presence of diarrhoea (95 %), vomiting (70 %), abdominal pain (51 %) and fever (32 %). Of the 41 cases included in the study, the majority (65 %) were residents of Northern Italian regions. No food samples were available for testing. The matched univariate analysis revealed that cases {{were more likely to have}} consumed raw mussels, eggs or ice <b>cubes</b> made of <b>tap</b> water than controls. In the multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, having eaten raw mussels or ice became more strongly associated with illness. All of the 20 faecal samples collected were tested for NoVs. Eighteen stools (90 % of total examined) were positive by RT-PCR, and sequence analysis performed onto 3 samples confirmed the presence of a GGII NoV. No test specific for NoV was performed on water or food samples. Conclusion The most likely hypothesis supported by the findings of the epidemiological investigation was that illness was associated with raw mussels and ice, made with tap water. These hypothesis could not be confirmed by specific microbiologic testing for NoV in food or ice. The lack of clear knowledge of NoV as a major causative agent of epidemic outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Italy is due to the absence of timely reporting of the cases to the local public health offices and the uncommon practice of saving clinical samples for virological analysis after bacteriological testing. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} on urban flows, two trends can be distinguished: some studies based on real urban environments, either in the field or on reproductions; and some on simplified models. One such model, a staggered cube array, has been investigated extensively, both experimentally in wind tunnels and numerically using LES and DNS, but always with a flow direction normal to {{the faces of the}} cubes. We are here investigating the effects of different wind directions on the flow within and above the cube array. As no other study has been published on the subject, both numerical and experimental investigation methods have been used. For the numerical side, large-eddy simulations were conducted using the finite volume method implemented in commercial software (StarCD, CD-adapco). The half-channel flow simulated was driven by a momentum source equiva- lent to a pressure gradient. The results are shown to agree well with those of wind-tunnel experiments conducted in parallel. For the experimental side, the boundary layer flow is measured in two dimensions using particle-image velocimetry and the drag using pressure <b>tapped</b> <b>cubes</b> and a drag balance. The results show that the mean flow field within the canopy is only weakly dependent on the direction of the flow above. Above the canopy, the mean velocity profile, time av- eraged and spatially averaged in horizontal layers, is shown to include an inertial sublayer where a logarithmic profile can be fitted. The fit proves to be best by considering for zero-plane displacement the height at which the mean drag acts and points arguably {{in the direction of a}} flow dependent value of the Von Karman constant. At the top of the numerical domain, the mean flow is also deviated from the direction of the forcing. We show that this deviation is directly related to previously unseen lift forces applied on the cubes. On balancing the different forces in the numerical domain, the viscous contribu- tions to both the lift and the drag forces are shown to be larger than anticipated from previous studies. Although these results could not be validated by the experiments as the viscous forces remain small compared to the experimental errors, such contributions raise concerns with regards to the Reynolds number independence of the flow and to the need for more complex wall conditions for LES. Overall, the variations of the flow pa- rameters are not negligible and prove to be non-linear and non-monotonic with the flow angle which highlights the importance of considering the flow direction when studying or parameterising urban landscapes. 1.
