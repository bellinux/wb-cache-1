5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E

5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions independently and repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Counting {{symmetry}} partitions valid Band1 permutations into {{classes that}} place the same completion <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> lower bands; {{all members of}} a band counting symmetry equivalence class must have {{the same number of}} grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes was established.|$|E

Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> development to be liberalised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures {{featured}} in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> breeding behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic. While Pozdniakov {{has not been able to}} assign any phonetic values with any certainty, statistical results do place <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> which values are possible.|$|E
5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely {{consistent with the}} modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes {{been referred to as}} orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E

Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> the Hubble constant.|$|E
40|$|Shah, N. The Philosophical Quarterly, 56, 481 – 498 (2006) has defended evidentialism on {{the premise}} that only it (and not pragmatism) is {{consistent}} with both (a) the deliberative <b>constraint</b> <b>on</b> reasons and (b) the transparency feature of belief. I show, however, that the deliberative <b>constraint</b> <b>on</b> reasons is also problematic for evidentialism. I also suggest a way for pragmatism to be construed so as to make it consistent with both (a) and (b) and argue that a similar move is not available to the evidentialist. Thus, far from settling the debate in favour of evidentialism, considerations concerning the deliberative <b>constraint</b> <b>on</b> reasons support pragmatism...|$|R

5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and <b>constraints</b> <b>on</b> pairs of variables as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E

Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
