25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, <b>cola</b> <b>nut,</b> bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E

Materials and Methods: Thirty-two male albino wistar rats weighing 180 - 220 g were used for this study and were divided into 4 groups of eight animals each. Group 1 served as control, group 2 received 2 mg/kg Cola nitida extract (Test 1), group 3 received 6 mg/kg Cola nitida extract (Test 2) and group 4 received 10 mg/kg Cola nitida extract (Test 3). After 6 weeks of treatment, reproductive hormonal assay was carried out using the rat serum. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected and sperm count determined. Results: Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced in test 2 and 3, compared with control. Sperm count was significantly lower in test group 1 (P < 0. 05), 2 (P < 0. 001) and 3 (P < 0. 001) compared with control, with test 3 significantly (P < 0. 05) lower compared with test 1. There was no significant difference in testicular and epididymis weight in the different experimental groups studied. Conclusion: Aqueous seed extract of Cola nitida rubra resulted in reduced serum reproductive hormone concentrations and sperm count in male wistar rats, and may therefore be detrimental to reproductive health, hence the need for regulation of its consumption...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{cultural}} identity and preference to treat cultural bound ailments with herbal medicine are motivations for migrants to continue using medicinal plants {{from their home}} country after moving to Europe and the USA. As it is generally easier to import exotic food than herbal medicine, migrants often shift to using species that double as food and medicine. This paper focuses on the trade in African medicinal plants in a Congolese neighborhood in Brussels (Belgium). What African medicinal plants are sold in Matonge, where do they come from, and to which extent are they food medicines? Does vendor ethnicity influence {{the diversity of the}} herbal medicine sold? We hypothesized that most medicinal plants, traders, and clients in Matonge were of Congolese origin, most plants used medicinally were mainly food crops and that culture-bound illnesses played a prominent role in medicinal plant use. We carried out a market survey in 2014 that involved an inventory of medicinal plants in 19 shops and interviews with 10 clients of African descent, voucher collection and data gathering on vernacular names and uses. We encountered 83 medicinal plant species, of which 71 % was primarily used for food. The shredded leaves of Gnetum africanum Welw., Manihot esculenta Crantz, and Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam were among the most frequently sold vegetables with medicinal uses. <b>Cola</b> <b>nuts,</b> shea butter, Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f., and Mondia whitei (Hook. f.). Skeels were the main non-food medicines sold. Women’s health, aphrodisiacs, and rituals were the most important medicinal applications, but culture-bound ailments did not entirely dominate the plant uses. While most clients in Matonge were Congolese, most vendors and plant species were not. The Pakistanis dominated the food trade, and typical Congolese plants were sometimes replaced by West African species, creating confusion in vernacular names. African-managed shops had significantly more species of medicinal plants in stock than shops managed by Pakistanis. Almost all non-food herbal medicine was sold by Africans. Apart from informal shops, non-food herbal medicine was also sold from private homes and by ambulant vendors, probably to reduce costs and escape taxes and control by the authorities. We expect that in the future, increasing rent, strict regulations, and decreasing investments by the Congolese community will force the medicinal plant trade in Matonge to go even more underground...|$|R
40|$|Antibacterial {{activity}} of Garcinia kola (Bitter Kola) and <b>Cola</b> nitida (Kola <b>nut)</b> against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was studied. Results showed that alcohol extract of Garcinia kola was active against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae at various concentrations, {{with the latter}} displaying the lowest sensitivity. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi were completely resistant. Hot water extract of the same plant was however, active against Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The other organisms showed sensitivity to the alcohol extract of Cola nitida, but higher sensitivity was observed with the hot water extract of the plant. Some of the results provided scientific evidence {{for the use of}} the plants by traditional herbalists in the treatment of microbial infections...|$|R
40|$|Improved health {{associated}} with frequent eating of nuts {{as one of}} the most unexpected nutritional discovery of the 1990 s formed the basis of this study. Hence, the evaluation of some selected nuts commonly consumed as snacks in the South West of Nigeria for antioxidant activity (AA) and total phenolic content (TPC) using ferric-ion reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay and Folin-Coicalteau method. Results show that AA of nuts such as kola <b>nuts</b> (<b>Cola</b> acuminata; Cola nitida), coconut (Cocos nucifera), bitter kola (Garcina cola), African walnut (Plukenetia conophora), and cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale) ranged from 13. 0 to 53. 21 µmol Trolox Equivalent/ 100 g dry weight while the total phenolic content ranged from 204. 95 to 1955. 14 mg Gallic acid Equivalent/ 100 g of dry sample. Statistical analysis of the relationship between AA and TPC showed a random, nonlinear relationship between the two parameters, suggesting that the antioxidant activity of the nuts is not dependent on phenolics. The result also indicates that the nuts can be utilized as scavenger/mopping agents of free radicals, which are usually generated by essential metabolic processes in the body and environmental pollutions; thereby alleviating the symptoms of chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension and any other age-related diseases reported to be on the increase in developing countries...|$|R
