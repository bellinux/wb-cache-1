40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two <b>chilling</b> methods, {{combined}} (aerosol) and water <b>chilling,</b> {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in <b>chilling</b> of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight and <b>chilling</b> methods into five categories. The first four categories were <b>chilled</b> using combined <b>chilling</b> method and fifth category was <b>chilled</b> with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before and after <b>chilling</b> and microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined <b>chilling</b> method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> up to a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses <b>chilled</b> by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine <b>chilling.</b> Thus <b>chilled</b> poultry carcasses were frozen up to - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories and <b>chilling</b> techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before and after <b>chilling</b> was in the lowest category and the difference before <b>chilling</b> was significantly lower comparing with all other categories. Conversely TVC after <b>chilling</b> by water was decreased. In comparing the number of Enterobacteriaceae before and after <b>chilling,</b> a similar pattern of contamination as above was found.
