40|$|Abstract. In a separably <b>connected</b> space any {{two points}} are {{contained}} in a separable <b>connected</b> subset. We show a mechanism that takes a <b>connected</b> bounded metric space and produces a complete <b>connected</b> metric space whose separablewise components form a quotient space isometric to the original space. We repeatedly apply this mechanism to construct, as an inverse limit, a complete <b>connected</b> metric space whose each separable subset is zero-dimensional. A topological space is separably <b>connected</b> iff any two of its points {{are contained in}} a separable <b>connected</b> subset. A separablewise component is the union of all separable <b>connected</b> subsets containing a given point. Since the closure of a separable <b>connected</b> set is again separable and <b>connected,</b> it follows that separablewise components are closed. A <b>connected</b> space whose all <b>connected</b> separable subsets are singletons will be called nonseparably <b>connected.</b> The first example of a nonseparably <b>connected</b> metric space was given by Pol in 1975, [4].

40|$|For any vertex x in a <b>connected</b> graph G {{of order}} p ≥ 2, a set S of {{vertices}} of V is an x-detour set of G if each vertex v in G lies on an x-y detour for some element y in S. A <b>connected</b> x-detour set of G is an x-detour set S {{such that the}} subgraph G[S] induced by S is <b>connected.</b> The minimum cardinality of a <b>connected</b> x-detour set of G is the <b>connected</b> x-detour number of G and is denoted by cdx(G). For a minimum <b>connected</b> x-detour set Sx of G, a subset T ⊆ Sx is called a <b>connected</b> x-forcing subset for Sx if the induced subgraphG[T] is con-nected and Sx is the unique minimum <b>connected</b> x-detour set contain-ing T. A <b>connected</b> x-forcing subset for Sx of minimum cardinality is a minimum <b>connected</b> x-forcing subset of Sx. The <b>connected</b> forcing <b>connected</b> x-detour number of Sx, denoted by cfcdx(Sx), is the cardi-nality of a minimum <b>connected</b> x-forcing subset for Sx.
