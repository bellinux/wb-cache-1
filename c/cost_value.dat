25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower <b>cost</b> <b>value</b> menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E

The study {{is based on}} almost 3000 activities carried out from 2003 to 2007 on a typical characteristic housing stock in Germany. The stock is managed by a strategically positioned housing company. First {{the state of the}} art in the research field is presented. The research concept is introduced. Using the methods of descriptive statistics key <b>cost</b> <b>values</b> of the investment activities are presented in accordance with the company 9 ̆ 2 s strategic factors.

In compliance with the obligations of the technical management, strategic recommendations are derived to control costs. The benefits of the strategic recommendations are evaluated with the identification of potential cost savings. The investment minimum of technical management is derived from the key <b>cost</b> <b>values</b> minus the <b>cost</b> saving potential. The minimum investment is discussed in comparison with the investment of other representative German housing companies.

It was found that the most of the designers are willing to change their designs when they are considering the life cycle <b>costing</b> and <b>value</b> analysis aspects for their designs.

Moreover, a lower bound for the minimal <b>cost</b> functional <b>value</b> is derived. A meaningful error quantity coinciding with the gap between the <b>cost</b> functional <b>values</b> of an arbitrary admissible control and the optimal control is introduced. This error quantity can be estimated from both sides using the estimates for the <b>cost</b> functional <b>value.</b> The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical tests.
