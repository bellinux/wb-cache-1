40|$|This {{program was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} microalloy-modified grade of standard <b>carburizing</b> <b>steel</b> that can successfully exploit the high temperature carburizing capabilities of current commercial low pressure (i. e. 'vacuum') carburizing systems. Such steels can lower {{the amount of energy}} required for commercial carburizing operations by reducing the time required for deep-case carburizing operations. The specific technical objective of the work was to demonstrate a <b>carburizing</b> <b>steel</b> composition capable of maintaining a prior austenite grain size no larger than ASTM grain size number 5 after exposure to simulated carburizing conditions of 1050 C for 8 hr. Such thermal exposure should be adequate for producing carburized case depths up to about 2 mm. Such carburizing steels are expected to be attractive for use across a wide range of industries, including the petroleum, chemical, forest products, automotive, mining and industrial equipment industries. They have potential for reducing energy usage during low pressure carburizing by more than 25 %, as well as reducing cycle times and process costs substantially. They also have potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing low pressure carburizing furnaces by more than 25 %. High temperature carburizing can be done in most modern low pressure carburizing systems with no additional capital investment. Accordingly, implementing this technology on carburizing furnaces will provide a return on investment significantly greater than 10 %. If disseminated throughout the domestic carburizing community, the technology has potential for saving on the order of 23 to 34 trillion BTU/year in industrial energy usage. Under the program, two compositions of microalloyed, coarsening-resistant low alloy carburizing steels were developed, produced and evaluated. After vacuum annealing at 1050 oC for 8 hrs and high pressure gas quenching, both steels exhibited a prior austenite ASTM grain size number of 5. 0 or finer. For comparison, a control alloy of similar composition but without the microalloy additions exhibited a duplex prior austenite grain size with grains ranging from ASTM grain size 3 down to ASTM grain size 1 after similar processing and thermal exposure. These results confirm the potential for using microalloy additions of Ti, B, Nb, Al, rare earths and/or N for austenite grain size control in Cr-Mo (i. e. 4000 -series) low alloy carburizing steels. They also demonstrate that these microalloy additions will not compromise the processability of the steel; all three materials produced under the program could be hot worked readily using normal steel processing protocols. To fully realize the technical and commercial potential of these steels, {{there is a need to}} continue development work using larger-scale heats. These larger-scale heats are needed to provide adequate material for fatigue testing of quenched and tempered alloys, to conduct more complete investigations of potential alloy chemistries and to provide additional material for processing studies. It will also be beneficial to carefully review intellectual property issues associated with this family of steels, since existing Japanese patent literature suggests that significant microstructural and/or process characterization work may be needed on new materials to confirm that these materials fall outside existing patent claims...|$|E

This study {{is focused on the}} link between the characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the steel and the machinability of the given steel grades. For this purpose, inclusion characteristics (such as composition, number, size, morphology etc.) in steel samples were determined by common two-dimensional (2 D) observations of inclusions on polished metal surface of samples as well as by three-dimensional (3 D) investigations of inclusions after electrolytic extraction from steel samples. The inclusion characteristics were investigated in the three types of 20 NiCrMo <b>carburizing</b> <b>steel</b> grades: Steel A ‑ reference steel (410 ppm S) having a common level of mechanical properties and machinability, Steel B ‑ steel grade (having 340 ppm S) with an improved machinability due to the Ca-treatment and modification of MnS inclusions and Steel C ‑ clean steel grade (40 ppm S) having a small amount of inclusions and a higher fatigue strength. It was found that the number of inclusions in Steel B is smaller than that in Steel A and that the inclusion composition is different. At the same time, the estimated machinability (tool life) of the Ca‑treated steel was superior to that of the reference steel.

40|$|Fatigue {{behaviour}} of 22 {{industrial test}} charges of AISI  8620 <b>carburizing</b> <b>steel</b> with two different calcium treatment levels was studied. The research work consisted mainly of rotating bending fatigue tests, residual stress and surface roughness measurements, electron microscopy, different steel cleanliness level and statistical inclusion size estimation methods. There {{were no significant}} differences between the σw/Rm ratios of the casts with the large amount of calcium injection and the casts with the small amount of calcium injection. In the casts with the large amount of calcium injection, the fatigue cracks initiated mostly from the surface and interior inclusions. In the casts with the small amount of calcium injection, the fatigue cracks initiated mostly from the surface discontinuities. The inclusions responsible for fatigue crack initiation were in the most cases calcium aluminates encapsulated in calcium sulfide containing small amounts of magnesia and/or silica. The fatigue crack initiation from cracked and non-cracked inclusions resulted in similar fatigue life on the same ΔK level. The fatigue strength scatter was larger in the casts with the large amount of calcium injection. In rotating bending fatigue the σw/Rm ratio was almost independent of inclusion size in the average fatigue crack initiating inclusion size region smaller than ∼  70 - 90  µm. The results of DIN  50   602 and SFS-ENV  10247 inclusion rating methods and ultrasonic tests in immersion did not correlate with the inclusions that were responsible for fatigue failure in these steels. The results may, however, suggest guidelines for the fatigue properties and the machinability of these steels when the contents of certain alloying elements are taken into account. Ultrasonic tests in immersion provide more relevant information about the fatigue properties and machinability of these steels than the conventional inclusion rating methods do, but its resolution capability still needs improvement. In most casts the maximum inclusion sizes predicted by the statistics of extreme value method were much smaller than the size of the inclusions found at the fatigue crack initiation sites of the fatigue specimens. The studied steels seemed to have two different inclusion size distributions, i. e., the inclusions detected at the polished microsections and the inclusions at the fatigue crack initiation sites. Both distributions had similar morphology and chemical composition, which was contrary to the earlier findings of the bilinear nature of inclusion distribution in some steels. The successful application of the Murakami-Endo model with these steels requires quite a large inspection area, approximately 8400  mm 2 at least, to enable the detection of the population of the largest inclusions, which are responsible for fatigue failure. reviewe...|$|E

It is interesting to see that, when H is around 18 Oe, the differential permeability increases more-or-less in the sequence of case depth d in induction hardened samples. Differential permeability measurements give a good indication of case depth in induction hardened rods, but not carburized rods. The saturation magnetization decreases as the case depth increases.

Especially in the low-frequency range of the real part of the normalized impedance, there is very good distinction between the case depths of the samples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) on mechanical properties of two commercial steels is analysed. Hardened AISI 302 stainless steel and 18 NiCrMo 5 <b>carburized</b> <b>steel</b> specimens were subjected to DCT after standard treatments. For both materials, the fatigue behaviour is a key property considering their usual applications requirements. Surface hardness, tensile properties and axial fatigue resistance of both materials were measured and compared with and without DCT. From {{the analysis of the}} experimental results and from their interpretation {{in the light of the}} previous literature, some useful indications are obtained about the DCT potential fallout on design and construction of structural components...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to evaluate the}} power dissipation of gears was performed. Three low-loss gear models were manufactured using standard 20 ° pressure angle tools. Austempered ductile iron (ADI) and 20 MnCr 5 <b>carburized</b> <b>steel</b> gears were tested in an FZG gear test machine using mineral, ester and polyalphaolephine (PAO) -based oils. The results compare power dissipation, the influence of different tooth flank geometries, materials and lubricants. This work concludes that conventional power-transmission gears can be replaced by these improved and more efficient low–loss models, which can be produced using common tools and that steel gears can be successfully replaced by austempered ductile iron gears...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{residual}} stresses developing in carburized and only quenched steel of SAE 8620 (21 NiCrMo 2) which {{is widely used}} as a <b>carburized</b> <b>steel</b> (shafts, gears etc.) was investigated. Carburizing programs {{was carried out in}} gas atmosphere for 45 minute at 940 °C. X-ray analysis was used to determine residual stress in the microstructures of the only quenched and carburized specimens. The results of x-ray analysis have shown that while the carburized specimens have a residual compressive stress at the surface - 551 N/mm 2, the only quenched specimens have a residual compressive stress at the surface - 125 N/mm 2...|$|R
