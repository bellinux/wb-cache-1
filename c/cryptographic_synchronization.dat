S. {{government is to}} respond effectively in a national emergency or in a joint military operation. This ability to talk securely and immediately across agency and military service boundaries is often overlooked. One way to ensure interoperability is to develop and promote federal communication standards (FS). This thesis surveys one ares of the proposed FS 1024 for LMRs; namely, the error detection and correction (EDAC) of the message indicator (MI) bits used for <b>cryptographic</b> <b>synchronization.</b> Several EDAC codes are examined (Hamming, Quadratic Residue, hard decision Golay and soft decision Golay), tested on three Fortran programmed channel simulations (INMARSAT, Gaussian and constant burst width), compared and analyzed (based on bit error rates and percent of error-free super-frame runs) so that a best code can be recommended. Out of the four codes under study, the soft decision Golay code (24, 12) is evaluated to be the best. This finding {{is based on the}} code's ability to detect and correct errors as well as the relative ease of implementation of the algorithm. Civilian, U. S. Department of Defens...|$|E
