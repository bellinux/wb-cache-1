40|$|AbstractBuildings {{account for}} about 40 % of total {{electricity}} use {{in the world for}} artificial cooling and artificial day lighting and they are also responsible for 40 % CO 2 emissions. This work reports a comprehensive investigation of thermal performance characteristics which include thermal transmittance, thermal admittance, decrement factor and the time lag for both homogeneous and composite building walls. A computer program with the <b>cyclic</b> <b>admittance</b> method was developed to study unsteady thermal performance characteristics. The Five building materials such as, cellular concrete, mud brick, concrete block, burnt brick and fly ash bricks were selected for the study. The heat transfer characteristics of five homogeneous building walls and their five composite walls were studied in detail. From the results, it is observed that fly ash brick homogeneous walls and their composite walls are energy efficient from the lowest decrement factor and the highest time lag perspective among five homogeneous and five composite walls studied. The decrement factor and time lag values of homogeneous fly ash bricks were observed to be 0. 401 and 8. 159 h, respectively, whereas the values of composite fly ash brick walls were observed to be 0. 342 and 9. 199 h, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the comprehensive {{investigation of the}} effect divided air space thickness within the wall on unsteady heat transfer characteristics such as thermal transmittance, thermal admittance, decrement factor and time lag of five building material walls for energy efficient building enclosure design. The five building material composite walls such as laterite stone, mud brick, cellular concrete, dense concrete and cinder concrete with total thirty configurations were studied. A computer simulation program was developed to compute unsteady heat transfer characteristics using the <b>cyclic</b> <b>admittance</b> procedure. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the decrement factor decreases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Dense concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from the lowest decrement factor point of view among five studied building materials. Dense concrete decrement factor decreases by 23. 65 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space. It is also noticed that the time lag increases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Cellular concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from highest time lag perspective among five studied building materials. Cellular concrete time lag increases by 6. 23 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space. The results of the study help in designing energy efficient building enclosures...|$|E
40|$|The {{space cooling}} systems {{account for nearly}} 30 % of energy {{consumption}} in India. The highly insulated external walls are essential prerequisites for low energy consumption of buildings. Filling shell of the brick with insulation material {{is one of the}} methods to reduce cooling loads in buildings. This paper aims to investigate the dynamic thermal parameters of various insulation filled bricks. The dynamic thermal parameters highlighted in the study include thermal transmittance, admittance, decrement factor, time lag and areal thermal heat capacity. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>admittance</b> method was employed in computer simulation program to compute dynamic thermal parameters of stuffed bricks. The four brick materials such as mud bricks, burnt bricks, concrete blocks and fly ash bricks were selected. The insulation materials used for filling shells of the brick are foam glass and asbestos fibre. The total forty eight stuffed bricks were investigated. The shell of the brick is filled by the insulation and the each layer of insulation is separated by a brick web. The shell and web thickness of the brick were maintained as per the Indian standards. The six configurations of the stuffed bricks were investigated (1. Solid brick, 2. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with single layer of insulation, 3. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with two layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated with a brick web, 4. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with three layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web, 5. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with four layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web and 6. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with five layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web). From the results, it is observed that the stuffed bricks significantly improve time lag values as compared to the conventional solid bricks. The decrement factor decreases, admittance increases and areal thermal heat capacity increases with {{the increase in the number}} of insulation layers in the bricks. The concrete blocks with the shell of the bricks filled with five layers of asbestos fibre insulation offer the highest admittance (3. 11 W/m 2 K), the lowest decrement factor (0. 435), the highest time lag values (8. 26 h) and the highest areal thermal heat capacity (57366 J/m 2 K) among all insulation filled bricks studied. The results of the paper help in designing energy efficient stuffed bricks which can be used for construction of buildings and thereby reducing cooling loads...|$|E
40|$|The voltage induced {{assembly}} and photoreactivity of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoparticles protected by mercaptosuccinic acid are {{studied at the}} polarisable interface between water and 1, 2 -dichloroethane electrolyte solutions. <b>Cyclic</b> voltammograms and <b>admittance</b> measurements show an increase of the interface excess charge associated with the adsorption of CdSe nanoparticles as the Galvani potential difference is tuned to negative values {{with respect to the}} potential in the organic phase. Within the potential range where the nanoparticles are adsorbed, band-gap illumination leads to heterogeneous electron transfer from CdSe nanoparticles to electron acceptors located in the organic phase. The interfacial Galvani potential difference {{plays an important role in}} these phenomena, as it affects the interfacial density of the nanoparticles, as well as the driving force for the electron transfer. The photocurrent efficiency also strongly depends on the formal redox potential of the electron acceptor, indicating that the heterogeneous photoreaction is kinetically controlled. The interfacial electron transfer occurs via depopulation of the deep trap states in the band gap. Analysis of the photocurrent transient responses reveals that the magnitude of the instantaneous photocurrent upon illumination is determined by the kinetics of heterogeneous electron transfer, while photogenerated holes are swiftly captured by species present in the aqueous phase. The photocurrent decay upon constant illumination is associated with the diffusion of the acceptor to the interfacial region. From the phenomenological point of view, the photoelectrochemical behaviour of CdSe nanoparticles can be compared to a self-assembled ultrathin p-type semiconductor photoelectrode...|$|R
