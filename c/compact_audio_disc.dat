40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} various forms of optical disc systems for the storage and dissemination of patent and trademark information. It analyses the storage and transmission requirements and outlines the development of optical disc technologies, covering video disc, <b>compact</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc,</b> CD-ROM (compact Disc [...] Read Only Memory), CD-I (Compact Disc [...] Interactive), LV-ROM (Laservision [...] Read Only Memory), Digital Optical Discs and Digitalization and Vectorization. The article concludes that recent improvements in data storage and transmission open new opportunities for vendors and users of patent databases. One problem, however, is that patents are seen only as a specialized information source {{and not as a}} part of the overall body of scientific and technical information, and international coordination and cooperation are essential if the best use is to be made of optical disc technologies. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{reverse the}} {{downward}} {{trend in the}} balance of trade, American companies must concentrate on increasing research into new products, boosting productivity, and improving manufacturing processes. The Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina State University is a multidisciplinary research and graduate education program dedicated to providing the new technology necessary to respond to this challenge. One extremely demanding manufacturing area is the fabrication and assembly of optical systems. These systems {{are at the heart of}} such consumer products as cameras, lenses, copy machines, laser bar-code scanners, VCRs, and <b>compact</b> <b>audio</b> <b>discs</b> - products that the Japanese and other East Asian countries are building dominance. A second critical area is the fabrication of VLSI and ULSI circuits. The tolerances required to produce the next generation of components for such systems have created the need for new approaches - approaches that could either make or break America`s competitive position. This report contains individual reports on research projects grouped into three broad areas: measurement and actuation; real-time control; precision fabrication. Separate abstracts for these articles have been indexed into the energy database...|$|R
