50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSC) were {{detected}} adhering firmly to the ventral endothelium of the dorsal aorta. These cells {{have been identified}} to originate from haematogenic endothelium, a precursor of both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. This is where HSC differentiate from the endothelial lining of the dorsa aorta. VE-cadherin, a specific marker for endothelial cells is found on the luminal side of the aortic endothelium. Cells clustered {{on the wall of}} the dorsal aorta also expressed VE-cadherin as well as CD34, a common hematopoietic and endothelial marker; and CD45, a marker present on hematopoietic cells. When these special endothelial <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> <b>cultured</b> <b>in</b> vitro, they were able to generate haematopoietic stem cells at a higher rate than cells from a haematopoietic origin. Thus the co-expression of cell surface markers from both lineages suggests that hematopoietic stem cells differentiate from endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta in the AGM.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of Dolly the Sheep and also Megan and Morag, the two sheep {{that led to}} the {{production of}} Dolly, demonstrated that viable sheep can be produced by nuclear transfer from a variety of somatic cell types which have been cultured in vitro. Polly and Molly represented the further step in which somatic <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> <b>cultured</b> <b>in</b> vitro, just as in the case with the previous sheep. However, in this case they were transfected with foreign DNA, and the transfected cells which stably integrated this new piece of genetic information were selected. The nuclei of these somatic cells was then transferred into an empty oocyte, as in the procedure of nuclear transfer, and this was used to produce several transgenic animals. A cell type PDFF was used. PDFF5 would produce male animals and were not transduced. Cell type PDFF2 produced female animals and were transduced. Of the gestations that occurred, three PDFF2 animals were born, two of which survived birth, 7LL8 and 7LL12. These animals were transfected but contained a marker gene not the cloned gene of interest. These were named [...] "Holly" [...] and [...] "Olly". Two more subsets of female-producing PDFF2 cells, PDFF2-12 and PDFF2-13, also produced animals which had the cell of interest together with the marker. Of these lambs, 7LL12, 7LL15, and 7LL13 were born alive and healthy. Two of these were named Polly and Molly.|$|E
