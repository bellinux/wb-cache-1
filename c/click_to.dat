To examine the effectiveness of social media in engaging physicians in non-industry-sponsored CME. We tested the effect of different media platforms (e-mail, Facebook, paid Facebook and Twitter), CME topics, and different "hooks" (e. g., Q&A, clinical pearl and best evidence) on driving <b>clicks</b> <b>to</b> a landing site featuring non-industry sponsored CME. We modelled the effects of social media platform, CME topic, and hook using negative binomial regression on <b>clicks</b> <b>to</b> a single landing site.

To understand how physicians interact with CME content on social media, we also conducted interviews with 10 physicians. The National Physicians Alliance (NPA) membership.

The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site's users.

40|$|På senare tid har en ny trend inom multikanalförsäljning uppmärksammats, där renodlade e-handlare inser vikten av att finnas tillgängliga för kunden i flera försäljningskanaler och därför adderar en fysisk butik som försäljningskanal. Den nya trenden benämns i studien för <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks. När flera försäljningskanaler opererar under samma varumärke kan svårigheter uppstå i att förmedla en enhetlig bild av varumärket, vilket lyfts fram i befintlig litteratur kring multikanalförsäljning. Det finns dock inga tidigare studier som undersöker utmaningar i att förmedla en enhetlig bild av varumärket specifikt för företag som går från <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks. Baserat på att <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks är ett relativt nytt fenomen som växt fram är forskningen inom området bristfällig och ytterligare studier krävs därför för att ge en ökad förståelse för fenomenet. Background: Recently, a {{new trend}} in {{multichannel}} retailing has been growing where pure eretailersare realizing {{the importance of being}} available to the customer in several sales channelsand therefore adds a physical store to its existing e-commerce. The new trend is further referredto as <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks. When multiple sales channels operate under the same brand difficultiesmay arise in conveying a consistent image of the brand, which is highlighted in the existingliterature on multi-channel retailing. However, there are no previous studies that examinechallenges in conveying a consistent image of the brand specifically for companies going fromClicks to Bricks. Based on the fact that <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks is a relatively new phenomenon thearea is fairly unexplored in the academic world, which means that further studies are needed toprovide a greater understanding of the phenomenon. Purpose: The study aims to provide a greater understanding of the phenomenon Clicks toBricks, by examining the reasons for pure e-tailers to add a physical store as a sales channel andhow they work to convey a consistent brand image. Completion: The study has the design of a multiple case study and has been conducted with aqualitative approach. The study's empirical data is collected from interviews with people onnine different companies that have gone from <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks. Conclusion: This study observes the fact that companies going from <b>Clicks</b> <b>to</b> Bricks haverecognized the importance of communicating a consistent brand across their sales channels. Companies have, however, started its work towards communicating a consistent image of thebrand at a late stage in the establishment process.

500|$|Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game that}} features live-action actors and cinematic footage, both during scenes between the gameplay {{and within the}} three-dimensional rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were {{at the peak of}} their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon. In this single-player game, the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who is always on the screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to [...] "talk to" [...] when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, and walk. The mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier Sierra On-Line games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can <b>click</b> <b>to</b> perform an action. Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it.|$|E
