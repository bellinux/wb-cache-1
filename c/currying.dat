5000|$|<b>Curry</b> (...) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular dishes in Japan. It is {{commonly}} served in three main forms: <b>curry</b> rice (<b>curry</b> over rice), <b>curry</b> udon (<b>curry</b> over noodles), and <b>curry</b> bread (a curry-filled pastry). <b>Curry</b> rice is most commonly referred to simply as [...] "curry" [...] (karē).|$|R

25|$|<b>Currying</b> favour with {{supporters}} was {{the other}} side of psychological warfare, and an early practitioner of such this was Alexander the Great, who successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the Greek administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind in each conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident views. His soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals in an effort to encourage assimilation.|$|E
25|$|Golf became widely popular {{during the}} {{economic}} bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for <b>currying</b> favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf {{to participate in}} golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and the ritual of playing golf with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and golf is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{may have}} seen Jerusalem, {{situated}} in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt, as worth patronising for political reasons. His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories {{as an expression of}} their legitimacy as rulers, thereby <b>currying</b> favour with the cults' devotees. Conversely, the Persian kings could, and did, destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them, as happened at Miletos in 494 BC following the Ionian Revolt. Historian Ernst Badian has noted regarding the Ionian revolt [...] " [...] Harpagus 'devastated' all of lower Asia (1.177) is obviously an exaggeration, for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities." [...] The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction, which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction. However, the Cylinder's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia; the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that [...] "it {{has nothing to do with}} Judeans, Jews or Jerusalem." [...] Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder [...] "is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire." [...] Kuhrt comments that [...] "the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof" [...] of the historicity of Cyrus's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts – an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance.|$|E

2500|$|A higher-order {{predicate}} is a predicate {{that takes}} {{one or more}} other predicates as arguments. [...] Although support for higher-order programming takes Prolog outside the domain of first-order logic, which does not allow quantification over predicates, ISO Prolog now has some built-in higher-order predicates such as call/1, call/2, call/3, findall/3, setof/3, and bagof/3. [...] Furthermore, since arbitrary Prolog goals can be constructed and evaluated at run-time, {{it is easy to}} write higher-order predicates like maplist/2, which applies an arbitrary predicate to each member of a given list, and sublist/3, which filters elements that satisfy a given predicate, also allowing for <b>currying.</b>|$|E

[...] The Greek plays often combined in one single character the elements of the parasite and the sycophant, and the natural similarities of the two closely related types led to the shift in the meaning of the word. [...] The sycophant in both meanings can also be viewed as {{two sides of the same}} coin: the same person <b>currying</b> one's favor by insincere flattery is also spreading false tales and accusations behind one's back.

Through his contacts, favorable impressions of the empire were published in a number of European newspapers and magazines, while Herzl himself attempted unsuccessfully to mediate between the Sultan and Armenian party activists in France, Britain, Austria and elsewhere. Herzl acknowledged that the arrangement with the Abdul Hamid was temporary and his services were in exchange for bringing about a more favorable Ottoman attitude toward Zionism.
