40|$|Although {{monitoring}} borrowers {{is thought}} to be a major function of financial institutions, the presence of other claimants reduces an institutional lender's incentives to do this. Thus loan contracts must be structured to enhance the lender's incentives to monitor. Covenants make a loan's effective maturity, and the ability to collateralize makes a loan's effective priority, contingent on monitoring by the lender. Thus both <b>covenants</b> and <b>collateral</b> can be motivated as contractual devices that increase a lender's incentive to monitor. These results are consistent with a number of stylized facts about the use of <b>covenants</b> and <b>collateral</b> in institutional lending. Copyright 1995 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

50|$|Of non-legal obligations, {{collateral}} assurance is a bond {{made over}} {{and beyond the}} deed itself, {{for the performance of}} an agreement, or covenant, made between two individuals; so called, for being external, and without the nature and essence of a <b>covenant.</b> A <b>collateral</b> assurance is separate but subservient to the principal contract. It usually allows for damages to be paid when the assurance is broken without allowing the principal agreement to be voided. Warranties are examples of this sort of assurance.|$|R

Hence, it confirms Smith and Warner's conjecture that severity of contractual covenants {{and ease of}} renegotiating debt contracts are positively related, in case where the <b>covenant</b> provision is <b>collateral.</b> © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to propose a}} {{financing}} structure for the selected company and then process the credit application. The first part {{is focused on the}} strategy of the bank, lending products and the risks that the bank undertakes. Also contains a description of the credit process - the calculation of a credit rating, financing structuring, <b>collateral,</b> <b>covenants</b> determination and processing of credit application. The thesis analyses the specifics of the pharmaceutical industry. Theoretical knowledge is applied to the example of financing of pharmaceutical company and the preparation of a credit application...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine how}} {{accounting}} conservatism {{relates to the}} design of private debt contracts with consideration of managerial risk preferences embedded in compensation contracts. Theoretical explanations for conservatism relate {{to the design of}} financial covenants or valuation of pledged assets in efficiently resolving asset substitution and incentive conflicts, respectively. I also consider conservatism in earnings in conjunction with other devices in signaling credit risk. I find evidence that accounting conservatism, the presence of financial <b>covenants,</b> and <b>collateral</b> are positively associated with the choice of long-term debt; with short-term debt constituting an alternative form of creditor protection. More notably, I find evidence of a predicted positive association between the use of collateral and conservatism. I fail to find a predicted positive association, however, between the presence of financial covenants and conservatism when managerial incentives indicate greater risk of asset substitution. Finally, I find no evidence of an association between conservatism in conjunction with earnings-based covenants and yield spreads as a measure of signaling content...|$|R

For example, if C^+_t> 0 then the legal owner of the amount C^+_t at time t could be either the hedger or the counterparty (depending on the legal <b>covenants</b> of the <b>collateral</b> agreement) but the hedger, as a collateral taker, is allowed to use the collateral amount for his trading purposes. If there is no default before T, the collateral taker returns the collateral amount to the collateral provider. Hence the amount C^+_t should be accounted for when dealing with the hedger’s portfolio, but should be excluded from his wealth. In general, we have the following definition of the wealth process.|$|R
40|$|We use {{different}} organizational forms of REITs (internally-advised versus externally-advised) {{as a natural}} experiment to devise a clean test {{of the impact of}} hold up versus benefits in relationship banking. Due to regulatory reasons, externally advised REITs have lower information opacity and consequently are less subject to hold up effect. Contrary to hold up and consistent with benefits accruing to borrowers, we find that the relatively more opaque internally advised REITs derive greater benefits from lending relationship for both price (loan rate), and non price terms of loan contracts (<b>collateral,</b> <b>covenants</b> and loan size). Further, relationship banks of internally advised REITs have a higher likelihood of securing repeat business from such REITs providing further evidence of the benefits of relationship lending...|$|R
50|$|CLOs are {{special-purpose}} vehicles {{set up to}} {{hold and}} manage pools of leveraged loans. The special-purpose vehicle is financed with several tranches of debt (typically a ‘AAA’ rated tranche, a ‘AA’ tranche, a ‘BBB’ tranche, and a mezzanine tranche with a non-investment grade rating) that have rights to the collateral and payment stream in descending order. In addition, there is an equity tranche, but the equity tranche is usually not rated. CLOs are created as arbitrage vehicles that generate equity returns through leverage, by issuing debt 10 to 11 times their equity contribution. There are also market-value CLOs that are less leveraged—typically three to five times—and allow managers more flexibility than more tightly structured arbitrage deals. CLOs are usually rated {{by two of the}} three major ratings agencies and impose a series of <b>covenant</b> tests on <b>collateral</b> managers, including minimum rating, industry diversification, and maximum default basket.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{corporate}} boards in bank loan contracting. We find that when corporate boards are more independent, both price and non-price loan terms (e. g., interest rates, <b>collateral,</b> <b>covenants</b> and performance pricing) are more favorable and syndicated loans comprise more lenders. In addition, board size, board diversity, audit committee structure and other director characteristics also influence bank loan price. However they do not consistently affect all non-price loan terms except for audit committee independence. Moreover, the impact of board independence on bank loans varies with borrower characteristics (e. g., leverage, tangibility and anti-takeover environments) and loan characteristics (e. g., loan types and loan structures). Overall, our study provides strong evidence that banks tend to recognize the benefits of board monitoring in mitigating agency risk and information risk, and reward borrowers with higher quality boards with more favorable loan contract terms.
