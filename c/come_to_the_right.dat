He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside.

2500|$|Views on Patlabor the Movie 2 {{have been}} very positive. One review from the Anime Cafe states that Patlabor the Movie 2 is an [...] "intellectually {{stimulating}} anime", combining the movie's mecha concept with the plot similar to a Tom Clancy novel. Anime World Order states that while the sequel {{is better than the}} first in terms of action and drama, some viewers may not understand the political aspects of the film, though its philosophical themes may be easier to understand, especially with the concept of just war and unjust peace. Japan Hero's review of the movie commented well on the side story that the movie showcased the main characters who had to let go of their past and to move on and grow up, with {{the fact that they had}} to get back together and face a threat that could make a country ruled by civilian authority or one ruled by fear and paranoia. Anime News Network has noted the background music used in the movie [...] "favors heavy, pulsing techno beats backed by airy, haunting vocals for the intense scenes and soaring synthesized scores in other places ...

[...] In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been [...] "rather deaf" [...] for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him [...] "has to shout {{at the top of his}} lungs." [...] Murphy joked at the time, [...] "I'm not much of a one to tell secrets to." [...] When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson–James Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems.
