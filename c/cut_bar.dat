40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. The use of {{nanotechnology}} {{is rapidly}} growing in various fields for different {{applications such as}} aerospace, electronics, construction, biomedicine, cosmetics etc. Nanomaterials posses unique size dependent material properties and can manipulate the host material properties {{to a greater extent}} compared to the micron sized particles of the same composition, and make them suit the requirements. Various kinds of nanomaterials with different size and shapes such as particulate, fibrous, layered, tube and foam when added to the host matrix material in composites will tailor the properties of the matrix material to a greater extent making nanocomposites a good alternative to conventional composites. In this research, more emphasis is made on improving mechanical and other physical properties of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer by adding graphene nanoplatelets at different concentrations. Recycled HDPE graphene nanocomposites were prepared using a solvent method assisted by a sonication method where samples are processed in to dog bone shaped specimens by using an injection molding process. For comparision, samples of plain recycled HDPE without graphene nanoplatelets were prepared. The samples were tested to evaluate the improvement in physical properties as function of the graphene concentrations in the polymer matrix. Physical properties of these samples were determined using different techniques: a) thermal conductivity which is found by using axial flow comparative <b>cut</b> <b>bar</b> method, b) dielectric constant is found by measuring capacitance of parallel plate capacitor setup using a capacitance bridge, c) water contact angle is found by optical angle goniometer, and d) tensile modulus is found by uniaxial tensile testing. The morphological characterization of PMN samples is performed using SEM technique to observe the type of distribution and dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in the polymer matrix. The test results showed that adding graphene into recycled matrix drastically changed the physical properties of the materials. This may improve the value of the recycled materials for various applications...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{disadvantaged}} {{people in}} South Africa are unfortunate {{by virtue of}} their financial status. It was estimated in 1992 that 20 % of the South African population live in informal settlements. The houses in these settlements are found to be very energy inefficient. This study was aimed at developing low cost thermal insulating materials {{that can be used to}} increase energy efficiency of the houses in these informal settlements. This was done by firstly studying the properties of thermal insulation materials. Furthermore, common thermal insulating materials in South Africa were studied and evaluated. Only recycled polymeric based materials were examined for selecting the raw materials that were used to investigate the feasibility of the thermal insulating materials from waste material. The experimental work was extended to construct a thermal conductivity rig that was to be used in measuring the thermal conductivity of both the developed and existing thermal insulating materials. The expanded polystyrene obtained from Sagex (Pty) Ltd and polyester obtained from Isotherm (Pty) Ltd. were evaluated and compared to the manufactured recycled polymer slabs and expanded polyethylene foams (EPEF). Expanded polyethylene foam and recycled polymer slab samples were subjected to mechanical and physical testing. A temperature comparison test and thermal conductivity determination were conducted on both the expanded polyethylene foam (EPEF) and recycled polymer slab (RPS) samples. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to reveal the micro-structures of all the developed thermal insulating material samples. The expanded polystyrene and polyester thermal insulating materials were also examined using the SEM. Optical microscopy was only used on RPS samples. It was found in this research, that the properties that govern the viability of thermal insulating materials are: thermal conductivity (k-value), thermal resistance (R-value), combustibility, moisture absorption and the presence of hazardous gases during burning. The temperature comparison test showed that the recycled polymer slab (RPS) and expanded polyethylene foam (EPEF) retards the flow of heat to levels comparable to that of the locally obtained thermal insulation. The comparative <b>cut</b> <b>bar</b> method was found to be relatively cheap to design and it was ideal for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of polymeric based materials. The k-value of all the EPEF samples was measured to be around 0. 04 W. m-¹K-¹ and the RPS k-value was found to be 0. 05 W. m-¹K-¹. This is attributed to air pockets with lower conductivities values, found within the structure of the polymeric thermal insulating materials. The porous structure is evident from the SEM micrographs of both the EPEF and RPS samples. One grade of expanded polyethylene foam, the SPX 80, had accumulated less moisture when moisture absorption was compared with other EPEF samples. The RPS material did have a propensity for absorption of water. The flammability retardant tests have showed that gypsum board has to be incorporated during service for the RPS and SPX 80. The mechanical testing results also suggest that both the EPEF and RPS need to be supported when installed in a ceiling, for example...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} the antiresonances of flexural vibrating bars to detect cracks or cuts. Two groups of bars, cracked <b>bars</b> and <b>cut</b> <b>bars,</b> were considered. The flexural vibrations of each free-free constrained bar, excited using the impulsive technique, were experimentally analysed measuring the accelerations in each excitation point. The distribution of the first antiresonance frequencies vs the position of impact/measurement points was then plotted, and the correlation with the corresponding n-th mode shape was found. The defect position corresponded to the areas in the plot where this distribution is discontinuous and it is determined with an uncertainty of ± 2 % of the bar length. These results confirm that, in laboratory experiments, the flexural behaviour of <b>cut</b> <b>bars</b> {{is similar to that of}} cracked ones. From a diagnostic point of view, this method can be used together with other methods that use resonances to detect defects...|$|R
