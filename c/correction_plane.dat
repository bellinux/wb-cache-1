40|$|Recently, a 3 D phantom {{that can}} provide a {{comprehensive}} and accurate measurement of the geometric distortion in MRI has been developed. Using this phantom, a full assessment of the geometric distortion {{in a number of}} clinical MRI systems (GE and Siemens) has been carried out and detailed results are presented in this paper. As expected, the main source of geometric distortion in modern superconducting MRI systems arises from the gradient field nonlinearity. Significantly large distortions with maximum absolute geometric errors ranged between 10 and 25 mm within a volume of 240 x 240 x 240 mm(3) were observed when imaging with the new generation of gradient systems that employs shorter coils. By comparison, the geometric distortion was much less in the older-generation gradient systems. With the vendor 2 ̆ 7 s correction method, the geometric distortion measured was significantly reduced but only within the plane in which these 2 D correction methods were applied. Distortion along the axis normal to the plane was, as expected, virtually unchanged. Two-dimensional correction methods are a convenient approach and in principle they are the only methods that can be applied to correct geometric distortion in a single slice or in multiple noncontiguous slices. However, these methods only provide an incomplete solution to the problem and their value can be significantly reduced if the distortion along the normal of the <b>correction</b> <b>plane</b> is not small.

40|$|Abstract: The {{balancing}} of rotors divides broadly {{into two}} categories: balancing in situ and balancing in a balancing machine. In the latter case, {{the most common}} practice is to arrange balance corrections on the rotor such that the net excitations {{of each of the}} four in-plane rigid-body modes of the free rotor is zero by deploying balance corrections on two independent planes. In a small proportion of cases, the net excitations of the rst pair of exural modes are also zeroed using a third <b>correction</b> <b>plane.</b> This paper proposes that, when rotors are balanced in a balancing machine (not similar to the machine stator), substantially more utility can be gained from the balancing operation by combining a suitably weighted account of the speci c balancing requirements of the machine with knowledge of the expected machine characteristics than can be achieved by ignoring this knowledge. A single cost function is established based on a numerical model of the machine. Then, depending on circumstances, either the expected value of this cost function or its worst possible value can be minimized. The methods proposed require that relatively detailed knowledge of the distribution of residual unbalance be obtained experimentally. The paper brie y discusses some practical methods for how such information might be extracted. The de nition of the cost function as a matrix quadratic form provides potentially valuable information about the necessary number and the optimal location of balance planes on a given rotor, and methods for determining an optimal set of balance planes are outlined...|$|E

40|$|Background : The {{surgical}} treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has taken great strides {{in the last}} two decades. There have been no long term reported studies on AIS from India with documented long term followup. In this study we review a single surgical team&#x 2032;s series of 235 surgically treated cases of AIS with a follow-up from two to six years. Materials and Methods : Pre operative charts, radiographs and MRI scans for 235 patients were collected for this study. The patients were grouped into three groups where anterior correction and fusion (n= 47), posterior correction and fusion (n= 123) and combined anterior release and posterior instrumentation (n= 65) was performed. Each group was divided into two subgroups based on the surgical approach and instrumentation strategy (all screw construct or hybrid construct) used. Patients were followed up for coronal and saggital <b>plane</b> <b>corrections,</b> apical vertebral translation (AVT), trunk balance and back pain. The percentage of correction was calculated in each group as well as sub groups. Results : The incidence of MRI detected intraspinal anomaly in this series is 5. 9 &#x 0025; with 3. 4 &#x 0025; of them requiring neurosurgical procedure along with scoliosis correction. Average coronal major curve correction was 66 &#x 0025; in the all screw group and 58. 5 &#x 0025; in the hybrid group. The coronal <b>plane</b> <b>correction</b> was better when the all screw constructs were employed. Also, the AVT and trunk balance was better with the all screw constructs.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPedicle screw {{constructs}} for spinal instrumentation {{in patients}} with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are effective in providing coronal <b>plane</b> <b>correction</b> but can result in loss of kyphosis, which in turn can lead to loss of lordosis. Hybrid constructs have been found superior over pedicle screw constructs in terms of thoracic kyphosis restoration. In this study, our objective was to compare outcomes with monoaxial versus polyaxial screws in an AIS population treated with hybrid constructs. HypothesisMonoaxial screws provide better correction in the coronal plane but result in loss of thoracic kyphosis, whereas thoracic kyphosis is preserved when polyaxial screws are used. Material and methodsWe retrospectively analysed data from 60  patients (mean age, 15 years) with Lenke 1, 2, or 3 AIS treated using a hybrid construct with self-retaining bilaminar hook claws cranially, pedicle screws between the last instrumented vertebra and T 11 caudally, and sublaminar universal clamps between the two extremities of the construct. Monoaxial screws {{were used in the}} first 30  patients (MS group) and polyaxial screws in the next 30  patients (PS group). Student's t test was performed to compare the two groups in terms of thoracic Cobb angle correction and T 4 -T 12 kyphosis 3 months after surgery. ResultsNo significant preoperative {{differences were found between the}} two groups. At last follow-up, the residual Cobb angle was significantly greater in the PS group than in the MS group (20. 3 ° versus 15 °) with a percentage of correction of 72. 1 % in the MS group versus 64. 8 % in the PS group. In the sagittal plane, the thoracic kyphosis was significantly greater in the PS group than in the MS group (26. 6 ° versus 23 °). DiscussionThis preliminary study shows that, even within a population managed using hybrid constructs, which are associated with less iatrogenic hypokyphosis, differences exist according to the technique used. The importance of sagittal spinal balance has been abundantly documented in the literature, and sagittal malalignment, particularly due to iatrogenic factors, is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in adults with spinal deformities. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine whether the treatment priority is optimal correction in the coronal plane or in the sagittal plane. We believe that the main focus should be sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>correction,</b> even at the expense of a slight decrease in coronal <b>plane</b> <b>correction.</b> Long-term studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings.

Therefore, these combinations allowed <b>corrections</b> of three <b>planes</b> to be made simultaneously. However, this method did not address the residual hindfoot varus.

However, the calculation of such <b>corrections</b> with <b>plane</b> wave codes is currently prohibitive for systems {{with more than a}} few hundreds of electrons.

Also, the number of conduction bands needed to reach convergence in the summations is usually an order of magnitude larger than the number of valence bands.

To assess {{the difference between}} using the correction rate and using the new fulcrum bending correction index when describing scoliosis correction. Summary of Background Data. A description {{of the outcome of}} scoliosis surgery based on the correction rate {{does not take into account}} the curve's flexibility. Methods. The fulcrum bending correction index is calculated by dividing the correction rate by the fulcrum flexibility (based on the fulcrum bending radiograph) and is expressed as a percentage. The fulcrum bending correction index was compared with the correction rate in 35 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing surgical correction. These patients were divided into a stiff and a flexible group based on a fulcrum flexibility of 50 % to show the advantage of the fulcrum bending correction index over the correction rate. Results. The difference in correction rate between the flexible (66 %) and the stiff group (45 %) was significant (P < 0. 05). The difference in the fulcrum bending correction index between the flexible (96 %) and the stiff group (107 %) was not significant (P = 0. 2). Conclusions. The fulcrum bending correction index takes into account the curve flexibility and is therefore better than the correction rate for comparing curve correction and use of instrumentation systems between different series of patients. A fulcrum bending correction index of close to 100 % suggests that the instrumentation has taken up all the flexibility revealed by the fulcrum bending radiograph.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe aim of {{treatment}} of scolioses {{is to reduce}} deformities and restore balance in the spine. HypothesesIn rigid forms of scoliosis, associating anterior release could provide greater frontal and/or sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>correction</b> and improve balance in the spine. Patients and methodsThis study compared correction and long-term balance on two planes between two homogeneous groups of idiopathic rigid scolioses treated with and without thoracoscopic release. The study included rigid scolioses with less than 35 % reducibility and a Cobb angle of more than 60 °, who all underwent posterior correction using a rod rotation technique. There were 29 patients, 14 who underwent a one-step procedure (group A) and 15 a two-step procedure (group B), with the subgroups of kyphoscolioses and lordoscolioses determined in each group. Frontal balance, Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis and the Jackson plumbline were measured on pre- and postoperative X-rays and at the final follow-up. ResultsThe mean long-term final follow-up was 144 months for group A and 54 months for group B. Frontal <b>plane</b> <b>correction</b> was identical in groups A and B. Frontal balance was preserved in all cases at the final follow-up. Sagittal balance was not modified with or without anterior release. The thoracoscopic release step resulted in an additional correction of 15. 5 ° (23 %) of thoracic hyperkyphosis in patients with kyphoscoliosis (P= 0. 003). DiscussionThoracoscopy did not improve short term results in the Cobb angle or frontal or saggital balance. Nevertheless, enhanced correction of thoracic hyperkyphosis was obtained with this procedure. In this study, the association of thoracoscopic anterior release with posterior correction by rod rotation to treat rigid scolioses {{did not appear to}} improve results, except for the correction of thoracic hyperkyphosis.
