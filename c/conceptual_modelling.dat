40|$|Abstract. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is {{one major}} topic in {{information}} systems research and {{becomes even more}} important with the arising of new software engineering principles like model driven architecture (MDA) or service-oriented architectures (SOA). Research on <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> {{is characterized by a}} dilemma: Empirical research confirms that in practice <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is often perceived as difficult and not done well. The application of reusable <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> is a promising approach to support model designers. At the same time, the IS research community claims for a sounder theoretical base for <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling.</b> The design science research paradigm delivers a framework to fortify the theoretical foundation of research on <b>conceptual</b> <b>models.</b> We provide insights on how to achieve both, relevance and rigor, in <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> by identifying requirements for reusable <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> {{on the basis of the}} design science research paradigm. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although it is {{possible}} to present XML Schema graphically, such representations do not raise the level of abstraction for XML schemata in the same way traditional <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> raise the level of abstraction for data schemata. Traditional <b>conceptual</b> <b>models,</b> on the other hand, do not accommodate several XML Schema structures. Thus, {{there is a need to}} enrich traditional <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> with new XML Schema features. After establishing criteria for XML <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling,</b> we propose an enrichment to represent the XML features missing in traditional models. We argue that our solution can be adapted generally for traditional <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> and show how it can be adapted for two popular <b>conceptual</b> <b>models.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Conceptual</b> <b>models</b> of {{information}} systems are used to capture the meaning of an application domain as perceived by someone. The important requirement for developing <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> is to reduce efforts, costs and time. This requirement can be implemented by the explicit use of enterprise knowledge for automatic generation of <b>conceptual</b> <b>model.</b> A number of methods were proposed to develop <b>conceptual</b> <b>models,</b> but only few deals with knowledge use. In this paper we present an approach for knowledge represented by ontology automatic transformation into <b>conceptual</b> <b>model,</b> which can be transformed into executable specification. The meta-models of ontology and <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> are analysed and the method of automatic transformation is proposed. The developed prototype, which realise proposed method, is described in the case study section. Key words: <b>conceptual</b> <b>model,</b> ontology, meta-model...|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> method can {{sometimes}} be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and {{shed some light on}} what to consider when selecting an appropriate <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> language when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> is developed using some form of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> technique. That technique will utilize a <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effective <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> {{requires}} a shared {{understanding of the}} concepts that are found in an application domain. Achieving such understanding, especially for large design problems, is a challenging, and long-standing problem. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>models</b> tend to be either subjective representations of individuals that require mutual knowledge sharing between members of a modeling team or externalized normative representations that require knowledge transfer from model preceptors to model receptors. Model preceptors have either created a <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> or conceived it by another preceptor. In prior studies, normative <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> were used to investigate knowledge transfer between preceptors and receptors. This research, in contrast, investigates knowledge transfer of <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> between model owners and receptors. A 2 x 2 study design with modeling novices was used that varied the type of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> language {{and the type of}} information system. Further testing investigated whether knowledge transfers were affected by additional verbal explanations given by the preceptor. Each modeler was provided access to two <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> languages that naturally support structure or process representations. The study investigated whether the use of particular <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> languages differ in their effects on shared understanding between two persons and whether additional verbal explanations might increase shared understanding. The results of this exploratory empirical study provide useful insights into the use of <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Modeling</b> Language pairs for shared understanding in <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> in small groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Whilst {{algorithmic}} modeling {{is taught}} intensively both {{in school and}} higher education, <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling,</b> or modeling of data {{to be used by}} algorithms, is less highlighted in the teaching curricula. However, understanding basic <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> principles plays a very important role in practice, as the cost of wrong solutions taken at the level of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> is usually high. Tools, accelerating learning of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling,</b> are rare, at least freely available or mentioned in the literature. We present our work in progress – a system called “Chen Worlds ” reflecting the focus on ER paradigm of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling,</b> describe its use cases, architecture and technical solutions undertaken...|$|R
50|$|Building on some {{of their}} earlier work, Gemino and Wand {{acknowledge}} some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, {{the characteristics of the}} models users, and the <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> languages specific task. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the techniques ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the models users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that systems realization. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> to convey system functionality and creating a system <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> to interpret that functionality could involve to completely different types of <b>conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> languages.|$|R

50|$|A <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> in {{the field}} of {{computer}} science is a special case of a general <b>conceptual</b> <b>model.</b> To distinguish from other types of models, it is also known as a domain <b>model.</b> <b>Conceptual</b> <b>modeling</b> {{should not be confused with}} other modeling disciplines such as data modelling, logical modelling and physical <b>modelling.</b> The <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> is explicitly chosen to be independent of design or implementation concerns, for example, concurrency or data storage. The aim of a <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> is to express the meaning of terms and concepts used by domain experts to discuss the problem, and to find the correct relationships between different concepts. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> attempts to clarify the meaning of various, usually ambiguous terms, and ensure that problems with different interpretations of the terms and concepts cannot occur. Such differing interpretations could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholders, especially those responsible for designing and implementing a solution, where the <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> provides a key artifact of business understanding and clarity. Once the domain concepts have been modeled, the model becomes a stable basis for subsequent development of applications in the domain. The concepts of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>model</b> can be mapped into physical design or implementation constructs using either manual or automated code generation approaches. The realization of <b>conceptual</b> <b>models</b> of many domains can be combined to a coherent platform.|$|R
