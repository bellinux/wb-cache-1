50|$|According to the 2000 Cobra brochure, if the 2000 Cobra {{had been}} produced, {{it would have}} been {{available}} in six exterior paint colors: Crystal White Clearcoat, Ebony (Black) Clearcoat, Laser Red Tinted Clearcoat, Medium Atlantic Blue <b>Clearcoat</b> <b>Metallic,</b> Silver <b>Clearcoat</b> <b>Metallic,</b> and (most notable) Mystic Gold. Apparently, Mystic Gold was supposed to be available in limited numbers late in the model year. After the 1996 Mystic Cobra, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra would have been the second time that a color-shifting paint was used on the Cobra. It was said that the Mystic Gold paint had a color shift from burnt orange to gold to yellow to pale green. Unfortunately, Ford made some changes to the painting process for the 2001 model year, and the Mystic Gold paint was incompatible with the new process. Thus, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra never saw the light of day, but a photograph of a prototype painted Mystic Gold will forever be memorialized in the 2000 Cobra brochure.|$|R
