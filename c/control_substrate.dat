Ten amino acids that <b>control</b> <b>substrate</b> specificity and can be considered the 'codons' of nonribosomal peptide synthesis have been identified.

5000|$|The fungus {{produces}} cytotoxic compounds {{known as}} melleolides. Melleolides {{are made from}} orsellinic acid and protoilludane sesquiterpene alcohols via esterification. A polyketide synthase gene, termed ArmB, was identified in the genome of the fungus, which was found expressed during melleolide production. The gene shares ca. 42% similarity with the orsellinic acid synthase gene (OrsA) in Aspergillus nidulans. Characterization of the gene proved it to catalyze orsillinic acid in vitro. It is a non-reducing iterative type 1 polyketide synthase. Co-incubation of free orsellinic acid with alcohols and ArmB showed cross-coupling activity. Therefore, the enzyme has transesterification activity. Also, there are other auxillary factors suspected to <b>control</b> <b>substrate</b> specificity [...] Additionally, halogen modifications have been observed. Overexpression of annotated halogenases (termed ArmH1-5) and characterization of the subsequent enzymes revealed in all five enzymes the chlorination of mellolide F.

40|$|Use of {{avoidance}} {{tests is}} a quick and cost-effective method of assessing contaminants in soils. One option for assessing earthworm avoidance behavior is a two-section test, which consists of earthworms being given the choice to move between a test soil and a <b>control</b> <b>substrate.</b> For ecological relevance, tested soils should be field contaminated soils. For practical reasons, artificial soils are commonly used as the <b>control</b> <b>substrate.</b> Interpretation of the test results compromised when the test soil and the artificial substrate differ in their physico-chemical properties other than just contaminants. In this study we identified the physico-chemical properties that influence avoidance response and evaluated the usefulness of adjusting these in the <b>control</b> <b>substrate</b> in order to isolate metal-driven avoidance of field soils by earthworms. A standardized two-section avoidance test with Eisenia fetida was performed on 52 uncontaminated and contaminated (Cu> 155 mg kg− 1, As> 19 mg kg− 1) agricultural soils from the Aconcagua River basin and the Puchuncaví Valley in Chile. Regression analysis indicated that the avoidance response was determined by soil organic matter (OM), electrical conductivity (EC) and total soil Cu. Organic matter content of the artificial substrate was altered by peat additions and EC by NaCl so that these properties matched those of the field soils. The resultant EC 80 for avoidance (indicative of soils of “limited habitat”) was 433 mg Cu kg− 1 (339 – 528 mg kg− 1 95 % confidence intervals).

The measurements suggested that import, at the specific conditions used in this study, consisted of two consecutive processes: (i) the rapid equilibration of the concentration difference across the nuclear envelope, a process involving binding and translocation of substrate by the nuclear pore complex, and (ii) the dissipation of the intranuclear concentration difference by diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{our knowledge of}} the genetic structure of human caliciviruses (HuCVs) and small round-structured viruses (SRSVs) have {{led to the development of}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based molecular tests specific for these viruses. These methods have been developed to detect a number of human pathogenic viruses in environmental samples including water, sewage and shellfish. HuCVs and SRSVs are not culturable, and no animal model is currently available. Therefore there is no convenient method of preparing viruses for study or for reagent production. One problem facing those attempting to use PCR-based methods for the detection of HuCVs and SRSVs is the lack of a suitable positive <b>control</b> <b>substrate.</b> This is particularly important when screening complex samples in which the levels of inhibitors present may significantly interfere with amplificiation.
