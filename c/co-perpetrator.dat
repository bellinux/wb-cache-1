5000|$|In a 2012 trial {{against the}} former BayernLB Chief Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky, the public {{prosecutor}} accused Ecclestone {{of being a}} <b>co-perpetrator</b> in the case. Gribkowsky confessed to the charges of tax evasion, breach of trust and for accepting bribes. In closing arguments at a Munich trial the public prosecutor told the court Ecclestone [...] "hasn't been blackmailed, he is a <b>co-perpetrator</b> in a bribery case". According to the prosecutor and defendant, Ecclestone paid about $44 million to the former banker {{to get rid of}} the lender's stake in Formula One. Ecclestone told prosecutors he paid Gribkowsky because he blackmailed him with telling UK tax authorities about a family trust controlled by Ecclestone's former wife.In November 2012 private equity firm Bluewaters Communications Holdings filed a £409m lawsuit against the 2005 sale of Formula One, alleging it was the sports rightful owners.|$|E

40|$|Ostracism and {{dehumanisation}} {{are social}} phenomena that occur {{every day with}} serious consequences. Current research of both of these social phenomena has only focused on the victim, and has therefore left {{the view of the}} perpetrator largely overlooked. Consequently, the aim {{of this study is to}} address several gaps in the literature. First-year and paid participants were recruited to participate in behavioural and pen-and-paper measures examining the dehumanising effects of ostracism from a perpetrator‘s perspective. Perpetrators of ostracism were predicted to dehumanise themselves, and also feel that their victim dehumanised them as well. Additionally, <b>co-perpetrators</b> were expected to dehumanise each other, and that perceptions of lessened humanity would prompt aggressive behaviour toward one other. As hypothesised, perpetrators of ostracism dehumanised themselves and their <b>co-perpetrators.</b> However, aggressive behaviour toward <b>co-perpetrators</b> was not significantly produced. Therefore, this paper demonstrates that perceptions of humanness are affected by the dehumanising consequences of being a perpetrator of ostracism. Further research and the theoretical and practical implications are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} an attempt to provide a coherent theory that international tribunals may use to ground the imposition of vicarious liability for collective crimes. Currently, the case law and the literature is focused on a debate between the Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE) doctrine applied by the ICTY and the co-perpetration doctrine applied by the ICC, which defines <b>co-perpetrators</b> as those who have joint control over the collective crime. The latter doctrine, influenced by German criminal law theory, has recently won many converts, both in The Hague and in the Academy, because it allegedly avoids many of the pitfalls and excesses associated with the JCE doctrine, including vicarious liability for actions that fall outside the scope of the criminal plan, the most expansive version of the JCE doctrine (JCE III). The following Article subjects the control theory, the new darling of the professoriate, to renewed scrutiny and questions whether “control” is the most important criteria for collective crimes. This Article defends the claim that the most essential aspect to ground vicarious liability for members of a criminal gang is the mens rea of its individual members. These individuals share with each other a joint intention that the group commit a collective crime, and through a series of hypothetical examples, I argue that this fact ought to be the most central aspect of the doctrine. The original version of JCE doctrine did little to analyze these joint intentions, though it implicitly relied on them, and the co-perpetration theory has sought to sidestep them entirely by emphasizing “control” instead. But this is an overreaction. The proper course is to return mens rea {{to the center of the}} debate and develop a nuanced account of joint intentions that avoids the excesses of the JCE doctrine. Instead of replacing JCE with the control theory of perpetration, international courts should reform JCE by eliminating JCE III because it fails to comply with the underlying theory supporting the doctrine...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} use of an established model, typically used for understanding male sex offenders, to understand the behaviour of a female sex offender. The Finkelhor (1984) Precondition Model of offending is used to provide a rare opportunity to explore the process of offending for a female contact and non-contact offender, whose offences were against children. It reviews the efficacy of utilising this model in the rehabilitation and collaborative risk management of a female sex offender. The results suggest that this approach can be applied to internet and contact sex offences to develop understanding of the progression of offending, including issues such as sexual arousal and the impact of a male <b>co-perpetrator.</b> In this case, the results indicate a post-intervention improvement in areas such as affect control, ability to maintain positive relationships, self-support, and reduced dissociation and dysfunctional sexual behaviour.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the other, and darker, side {{of gender}} and conflict through a critical discussion {{of women who are}} accused of orchestrating and/or perpetrating crimes defined within the Rome Statute 1998. Focus is centred on the International Criminal Court (ICC) case of Simone Gbagbo in relation to the internal political violence that occurred within the Côte d’Ivoire following the 2010 general election result. The ICC unsealed an arrest warrant for Simone Gbagbo on the 22 nd of November 2012, alleging responsibility as indirect <b>co-perpetrator</b> for four counts of crimes against humanity which includes, but is not limited to, murder, rape and other sexual violence, persecution and other inhumane acts. The paper critically examines the situation in Côte d’Ivoire within the context of Simone Gbagbo’s involvement. Furthermore, the paper outlines what role the ICC believe she played within the post-electoral violence and discuss why, and under what grounds, the ICC has sought her extradition to the Hague which has not, as of yet, occurred...|$|E
40|$|How should {{international}} courts {{distinguish between}} principals and accessories? The ICC answered this question with Roxin’s Control Theory of Perpetration; defendants should be convicted as principals if {{they control the}} crime individually, jointly with a <b>co-perpetrator,</b> indirectly via an organized apparatus of power, or as indirect co-perpetrators (via {{a combination of the}} previous doctrines). As the ICC adopted the control requirement, however, some of its decisions have allowed lower mental states such as recklessness or dolus eventualis to meet the standard for principal perpetration under the Control Theory. Other decisions have asserted that intent or knowledge is required though their definitions of knowledge include a risk of future events ç a definition uncomfortably similar to recklessness. The following essay argues that the ICC should reverse its approach: instead of combining the ‘essential contribution’ element with a weak mental requirement (its current doctrine), the ICC should deemphasize control by lowering the essential contribution requirement and reinvigorating the required mental state. In short, the ICC should take a second look at subjective theories of perpetration that define principals as those with the intention to carry out the crime (or joint intention in the case of co-perpetrators) and who contribute to the effort. The ICC’s Control Theory represents an over-correction to the perceived excesses of the subjective approach [...] excesses that could be fixed without resorting to the ICC’s current ersatz-Control Theory...|$|E
40|$|In-depth {{interviews}} and psychometric {{tests were conducted}} with 20 young, South African male, hands-on sex offenders, {{between the ages of}} seven and 15 years. These offenders were referred by both the legal system and the welfare and health system. The data was gathered for the purpose of drawing up a descriptive profile of salient psychological and sociological characteristics of this population group, the patterns of offenses, the circumstances under which the offenses occurred and victims selected. Results showed that half the sample had committed prior sex offenses. The majority of young sex offenders had a history of consenting sexual interactions, had committed a non-sexual offense and engaged in a range of other antisocial behaviours. Half the sample reported a history of physical or sexual abuse (under-reporting of such victimization experiences was suspected). Typically, the young sex offender w:~s sexually naive and had not received any suitable sex education. He was usually a scholar although his school attendance was often infrequent and he was likely to have failed one or more standards. His intelligence quotient was most likely to fall in or below the borderline range of functioning. He tended to be either socially isolated and socially anxious or alternatively reported having a number of friends and appeared to have adequate social skills. His home environment was typically characterized by overcrowding, alcohol abuse and domestic violence. A significant male relative of his was likely to have committed a criminal offense. In his community environment, he regularly witnessed violence and sexual activity. The sex offenses were usually carried out with a <b>co-perpetrator</b> in a variety of venues. The victim was usually known and younger (mean age = seven years) than the perpetrator (mean age = 12 years). The overall results suggest that young sex offenders commit an array of sexual offenses that do not represent sexual experimentation, but rather indicate a developing pattern of sexual deviance. Comparisons between the above profile and the literature findings are explored. Finally, recommendations for structural changes, assessment procedures, additional future research pessibilities and guidelines for the development of appropriate - treatment programmes are outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|On the 4 th March 2009 the International Criminal Court {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, the current sitting {{president}} of Sudan. The Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC considered that “there are reasonable grounds to believe that Al Bashir is criminally responsible under Art. 25. 3. a of the Statute as an indirect perpetrator, or as an indirect <b>co-perpetrator,</b> for war crimes and crimes against humanity” committed in the Darfur region of Sudan, in a conflict which has taken tens or {{hundreds of thousands of}} lives so far and displaced millions The arrest warrant followed the application for a warrant of arrest that, on the 14 th July 2008, the Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued against Sudanese President for the alleged crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Darfur region. The prosecution against Al Bashir is the second case initiated by the Prosecutor in relation to his Darfur investigation. The warrant of arrest for Al Bashir is particularly important because it is the first warrant ever issued for a sitting head of State and government by the ICC and the first case involving the alleged crime of genocide before the ICC. Moreover, the Darfur conflict is the first situation in which the ICC’s jurisdiction has been activated by a referral from the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The article, after an analysis of the background of the situation in Darfur, examines the ICC’s decision in the light of a lot of questions related to the following issues: (i) the role of the UN Security Council in Al Bashir’s indictment; (ii) the criminal responsibility of Sudanese President for indirect perpetration under the Rome Statute; (iii) the personal immunities of senior State officials, in particular the head of State immunity of State non parties to the Rome Statute; (iv) the cooperation among States party (and no party) to ICC about the arrest of Sudanese President; (v) the implications on future of Darfur (and Sudan) of this decision, in regard that today Al Bashir remains firmly in power: indeed he recently won the nationwide elections 7 and he was approved by the great majority of Sudanese citizens...|$|E
