60|$|I will here {{describe}} {{in more detail}} than has been as yet incidentally done, the nature, origin, and extent of the great shingle covering of Patagonia: but I {{do not mean to}} affirm that all of this shingle, especially that on the higher plains, belongs to the recent period. A thin bed of sandy earth, with small pebbles of various porphyries and of quartz, covering a low plain {{on the north side of}} the Rio Colorado, is the extreme northern limit of this formation. These little pebbles have probably been derived from the denudation of a more regular bed of gravel, capping the old tertiary sandstone plateau of the Rio Negro. The gravel-bed near the Rio Negro is, on an average, about ten or twelve feet in thickness; and the pebbles are larger than on the northern side of the Colorado, being from one or two inches in diameter, and composed chiefly of rather dark-tinted porphyries. Amongst them I here first noticed a variety often to be referred to, namely, a peculiar gallstone-yellow siliceous porphyry, frequently, but not invariably, containing grains of quartz. The pebbles are embedded in a white, gritty, calcareous matrix, very like mortar, sometimes merely coating with a whitewash the separate stones, and sometimes forming the greater part of the mass. In one place I saw in the gravel concretionary nodules (not rounded) of crystallised gypsum, some as large as a man's head. I traced this bed for forty-five miles inland, and was assured that it extended far into the interior. As the surface of the calcareo- argillaceous plain of Pampean formation, on the northern side of the wide valley of the Colorado, stands at about the same height with the mortar- like <b>cemented</b> <b>gravel</b> capping the sandstone on the southern side, it is probable, considering the apparent equability of the subterranean movements along this side of America, that this gravel of the Rio Negro and the upper beds of the Pampean formation northward of the Colorado, are of nearly contemporaneous origin, and that the calcareous matter has been derived from the same source.|$|E
60|$|The coast {{as far as}} Bahia Blanca (in {{latitude}} 39 degrees S.) {{is formed}} either of a horizontal range of cliffs, or of immense accumulations of sand-dunes. Within Bahia Blanca, {{a small piece of}} tableland, about twenty feet above high-water mark, called Punta Alta, is formed of strata of <b>cemented</b> <b>gravel</b> and of red earthy mud, abounding with shells (with others lying loose on the surface), and the bones of extinct mammifers. These shells, twenty in number, together with a Balanus and two corals, are all recent species, still inhabiting the neighbouring seas. They will be enumerated in the Fourth Chapter, when describing the Pampean formation; five of them are identical with the upraised ones from near Buenos Ayres. The northern shore of Bahia Blanca is, in main part, formed of immense sand-dunes, resting on gravel with recent shells, and ranging in lines parallel to the shore. These ranges are separated from each other by flat spaces, composed of stiff impure red clay, in which, at the distance of about two miles from the coast, I found by digging a few minute fragments of sea-shells. The sand-dunes extend several miles inland, and stand on a plain, which slopes up to a height of between one hundred and two hundred feet. Numerous, small, well-rounded pebbles of pumice lie scattered both on the plain and sand-hillocks: at Monte Hermoso, on the flat summit of a cliff, I found many of them at a height of 120 feet (angular measurement) above the level of the sea. These pumice pebbles, no doubt, were originally brought down from the Cordillera by the rivers which cross the continent, {{in the same way as}} the river Negro anciently brought down, and still brings down, pumice, and as the river Chupat brings down scoriae: when once delivered at the mouth of a river, they would naturally have travelled along the coasts, and been cast up during the elevation of the land, at different heights. The origin of the argillaceous flats, which separate the parallel ranges of sand-dunes, seems due to the tides here having a tendency (as I believe they have on most shoal, protected coasts) to throw up a bar parallel to the shore, and at some distance from it; this bar gradually becomes larger, affording a base for the accumulation of sand- dunes, and the shallow space within then becomes silted up with mud. The repetition of this process, without any elevation of the land, would form a level plain traversed by parallel lines of sand-hillocks; during a slow elevation of the land, the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined surface, like that on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. I did not observe any shells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than twenty feet; and therefore the age of the sea-drifted pebbles of pumice, now standing at the height of 120 feet, must remain uncertain.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland <b>cement,</b> <b>gravel</b> and sand).|$|R

40|$|The {{community}} of Sells {{is located in}} Pima County, Arizona, on the Papago Indian Reservation. The present study was undertaken to determine the water development possibilities of the area. The geology of the Sells area is composed of four basic units: intrusive rock, volcanic rock, <b>cemented</b> Tertiary(?) <b>gravel,</b> and valley fill alluvium. The intrusive rock is essentially dry; the volcanic rock yields small amounts of water to wells; the <b>cemented</b> Tertiary(?) <b>gravel</b> yields small amounts of water to wells (locally saline); and the valley fill alluvium yields from 10 gpm to greater than 200 gpm, depending on local thickness and permeability. Data from geophysical investigations indicate that Sells probably sets on a volcanic plateau, terminated east and west by boundary faults in the basement rocks. The valley fill alluvium is thickest and most permeable in the Baboquivari and Quijotoa valleys east and west of Sells, respectively. Well yields in the thick valley fill alluvium to the west generally exceed 200 gpm, and transmissivity values range from 50, 000 to 200, 000 gpd/ft.

Furthermore, the packing behaviour of the powders (cement, fly ash, stone powder) and aggregates (three sands and gravel) used are analysed in detail. It follows that their loosely piled void fraction are reduced to the same extent (23 %) upon vibration (aggregates) or mixing with water (powders).

40|$|SUMMARY: Extensive {{alluvial}} fans bounding {{the western}} edge of the Sharqiya (or Wahiba) Sands are characterized bycomplex palaeochannel systems now forming a series of superimposed gravel ridges. Th oldest, most extensive fan system is crossed by numerous sinuous, superimposed palaeochannel courses comprising highly weathered, chert-rich <b>gravels</b> <b>cemented</b> by clear crystalline calcite. Many of these old fan sediments have been chemically altered to depths of over 200 m to form a pink dolomitic layey deposit here termed barzamanite. The formation of this calcrete-like deposit was probably associated with rising water tables during long-term fan growth. The younger, more limited fan deposit, by contrast, comprises thin, coarse-grained, broad spreads and terrace v neers of weakly <b>cemented</b> ophiolitic <b>gravels.</b> The fans have been subject o entrenchment and deflation, resulting in extensive land-surface lowering and the xhumation ofburied palaeochannels. Although no dates are yet available, the older channel systems are likely to date from ore humid phases during the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene, whereas the younger, terraced eposits, and the period of subsequent channel exhumation, may date from semi-arid periods of lower sea level during the Pleistocene...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} survey {{has been made}} of the stable isotope composition of secondary carbonates in the Ogallala Group of western Nebraska. The {{purpose of the study was}} to ascertain whether the isotopic signatures of calcareous paleosols in the fine grained facies of the Ogallala and groundwater <b>cements</b> in <b>gravel</b> facies might provide a basis for stratigraphic correlation and/or paleoclimatic interpretation. The groundwater <b>cemented</b> channel <b>gravels</b> are modestly depicted in IRO (δ 18 O = – 10 ‰) as compared to calcareous paleo 2 ̆ 7 sols (δ 18 O = – 8. 0 to – 9. 0 ‰). Gravels of different age, however, have essentially identical isotopic signatures. The isotopic variability within paleosols is about as great as the variability between palcosols. As a result, the mean isotopic values for individual paleosols are not significantly different from one anothcr. Thus, stratigraphic correlation of paleosols based on isotopic signatures will not be possible unless intensive vertical and lateral sampling capable of distinguishing small differences among paleosols is undertaken. Nevertheless, when the mean 0180 values for individual paleosols are arranged in the stratigraphic order proposed by Lugn (1939), they increase upsection from about – 9. 0 ‰ to – 8. 0 ‰, suggesting that the pedogenic environment possibly became more arid through time.
