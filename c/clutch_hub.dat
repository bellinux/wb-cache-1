5000|$|The early model C4 (1964-1969) used a [...]788-inch 24-spline input shaft, {{which was}} {{upgraded}} in 1970 to 26-spline and [...]839-inch. The upgrade {{also included a}} matching <b>clutch</b> <b>hub</b> of 26-spline. In 1971, Ford went to a 26/24-spline input shaft, meaning the torque-converter side is 26-spline and the <b>clutch</b> <b>hub</b> is 24-spline.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the {{transmission input shaft}} and <b>clutch</b> <b>hub</b> to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Torque {{fluctuation}} {{of engine}} generate gear rattle noise of transmission and many researches {{have been studied}} to decrease rattle noise by adjusting clutch damper system. So design optimization of clutch system {{is very important to}} decrease rattle noise and need knowing clutch dynamic torque at real vehicle driving condition. This makes it possible to measure clutch dynamic torque by using a small-size magnetic sensor. We install a small-size magnetic sensor on the input shaft of the transmission and measure the relative angular displacement between <b>clutch</b> <b>hub</b> and disc plate. We can obtain the clutch torque correspond to the angular displacement in the clutch torsional characteristics test. The object of this research is to measure clutch dynamic torque on real vehicle condition. Therefore, Clutch dynamic torque is very useful for investigating operating range of clutch according to engine torque an...|$|E

The assortment contains sprocket chains, wheels and wheel discs, spur wheels, spur racks, bevel gears, chain tighteners, <b>clutches,</b> sliding <b>hubs,</b> tooth belts and discs, clamping sets and other components.|$|R
25|$|In its service, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; {{went through}} 400 tyres; its brakes were changed 100 times; and it {{required}} six new <b>clutches,</b> two new <b>hubs,</b> driveshafts, wishbones, struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror.|$|R
5000|$|The Liana {{was best}} known for its {{appearances}} as the Reasonably Priced Car in Top Gears Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment. Celebrity guests would appear on the show every week to be interviewed and to set a lap time in a saloon model Suzuki Liana. The primary car, along with spare cars, were kept stock except for a roll cage and racing seats which were added as safety measures. In its three-year tenure on Top Gear, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; its tires and brakes were changed 100 times; and it required six new <b>clutches,</b> two new <b>hubs,</b> driveshafts, wishbones, struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror. [...] The Liana was used from its first show until its replacement by a Chevrolet Lacetti in the shows spring 2006 season. Today, it enjoys a partial retirement, and is only brought back when the guest is a Formula 1 driver.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 27 - 38 A large, {{double ended}} drive {{synchronous}} motor experienced severe, limiting lateral vibration during commissioning {{of a major}} plant expansion. The motor driving a centrifugal compressor providing process air is decoupled during startup from a gearbox and steam turbine by a clutch. Steam generated by waste heat from the process drives the turbine under normal operation and the synchronizing clutch is engaged, reducing the motor load requirements. Excessive running speed (1 x) lateral vibrations came to light when the motor was run solo during field commissioning. Extreme sensitivity to small trim balance weight changes on the exciter end led to extensive field tests to identify {{the source of the}} problem. Rotordynarnic analyses and coupled running tests confirmed an overhang resonance, and revealed the only possible short term solution to be the addition of a third bearing on the motor shaft to control the overhang mode. Field installation of a 14 inch diameter tilting pad bearing, located on the <b>clutch</b> <b>hub</b> at the motor shaft end, was completed quickly to allow plant startup to proceed. In situ machining of the hub on the shaft, while the motor remained installed in the field, was required to assure proper journal shape and rapid project completion. This paper describes the process of problem identification, measurement/verification, rotordynarnic analyses, resolution, and field implementation. Before and after field vibration measurements are presented to illustrate the success of the solution and demonstrate the additional instrumentation required...|$|E
