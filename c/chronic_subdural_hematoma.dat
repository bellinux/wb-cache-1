40|$|OBJECTIVE: Most {{symptomatic}} <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> {{are treated}} by subdural drainage. However, a subperiostal (i. e., extracranial) passive closed-drainage system {{in combination with}} double burr hole trepanation is used at our institution. Therefore, we wanted to analyze our results and compare them with the alternate treatment strategies reported in the current literature. METHODS: In a retrospective single-center study, we analyzed the data of all patients undergoing double burr hole trepanation with a subperiostal passive closed-drainage system. Data analysis included general patient data, complications, postoperative seizure rate, and outcome. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients underwent surgery for 183 symptomatic <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas.</b> The perioperative mortality rate was 3. 4 %. Hematoma persistence or recurrence occurred in 13. 1 % of the cases. The postoperative seizure rate was 6. 6 %, and the infection rate was 1. 6 %, including 3 cases of superficial wound infection and 1 case with deep infection. The reintervention rate was 9. 3 %, including trepanation in 8. 2 % of the patients and craniotomy in 1. 1 %. The overall complication rate was 10. 9 %. CONCLUSION: Double burr hole trepanation combined with a subperiostal passive closed-drainage system is a technically easy, highly effective, safe, and cost-efficient treatment strategy for symptomatic <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas.</b> The absence of a drain {{in direct contact with}} the hematoma capsule may moderate the risk of postoperative seizure and limit the secondary spread of infection to intracranial compartments...|$|R
50|$|A <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> or <b>subdural</b> {{haematoma}} (alternative spelling), {{also known}} as a subdural haemorrhage (SDH), is a type of hematoma, usually associated with traumatic brain injury. Blood gathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater.Usually resulting from tears in bridging veins which cross the subdural space, subdural hemorrhages may cause an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), which can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. <b>Subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> are often life-threatening when acute. <b>Chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas,</b> however, have a better prognosis if properly managed.|$|R

50|$|In most {{head trauma}} cases, CT scans are the {{standard}} diagnostic method; {{however it is}} not ideal for imaging small lesions, so MRI is used to identify Kernohan's notch.

50|$|A {{wide range}} of serious {{injuries}} can cause an increase in intracranial pressure to trigger {{the formation of a}} Kernohan's notch. In general, this phenomenon occurs in patients with advanced brain tumor or severe head injury. In the case of severe head injury, a clot can occur over the surface of the brain and can often cause shift of the middle part of the brain against the tentorium, which creates the Kernohan's notch. <b>Chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> have been known to be a familiar cause of Kernohan's notch.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> (SDHs) on CT reports for scans of the head to be misinterpreted as subdural hygromas, and vice versa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be done to differentiate a chronic SDH from a subdural hygroma, when clinically warranted. Elderly patients with marked cerebral atrophy, and secondary widened subarachnoid CSF spaces, can also cause confusion on CT. To distinguish <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> hygromas from simple brain atrophy and CSF space expansion, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI can be performed. Visualization of cortical veins traversing the collection favors a widened subarachnoid space as seen in brain atrophy, whereas subdural hygromas will displace the cortex and cortical veins.|$|R

50|$|A {{subdural}} hygroma {{is a collection}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), without blood, located under the dural membrane.

One of the common causes of subdural hygroma is a sudden decrease in pressure as a result of placing a ventricular shunt.

In these cases the symptoms such as mild fever, headache, drowsiness and confusion can be seen, which are relieved by draining this subdural fluid.|$|R

Between April 2006 and March 2010, a total of 18 patients undergoing unilateral burr hole drainage for B-CSDH took part in a controlled clinical study. Postoperative status of the nonsurgical side was subsequently evaluated, with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) saireito administration. Two in the saireito-treated group patients and four in the control group patients ultimately required contralateral surgical intervention. The remainder, including eight saireito-treated hematomas, resolved without further surgery, generally within eight weeks of the surgical side procedure. However, two of the four resolving control lesions took longer to regress. The hydragogue and anti-inflammatory/steroid-evoking properties ascribed to saireito may facilitate hematoma resolution. After unilateral surgery for B-CSDH, saireito administration may prevent symptomatic deterioration of a contralateral low-density CSDH, preempting subsequent surgery...|$|R

40|$|Background. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the value of {{electromagnetic}} programmable shunt valves for the treatment of subdural collections. Methods. Adult patients with hydrocephalus of various causes that were treated with programmable shunt valves during the last ten years were retrospectively studied. In 127 patients, 139 electromagnetic programmable shunt valves were implanted. Results. A nontraumatic subdural fluid collection was detected in 12 patients. The treatment of these patients consisted of reprogramming of the valve’s opening pressure. In 5 patients small <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> were detected; 4 of these patients were treated by raising the opening pressure alone and one patient required surgical drainage and change of the pressure setting. Traumatic <b>chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> were detected in 6 patients. These patients were treated by surgical drainage and readjustment of the valve’s opening pressure. Conclusion. The ability to treat a shunt-related complication, such as a subdural fluid collection, by reprogramming the valve’s opening pressure to a higher setting is an advantage over nonprogrammable valves, and it enables the opening pressure to be slowly lowered once the fluid collection is reabsorbed.

40|$|Background and Importance: <b>Chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> (cSDH) are {{a common}} problem for which {{solutions}} remain imperfect. Surgery is effective, but not without risk. Recent data have suggested a role for inflammation in the genesis of cSDH and several reports have documented some benefit to steroid treatment. In this report, a possible role for tumor necrosis factor alpha blockade in the resolution of a multiply recurrent cSDH is described. Clinical Presentation: An 86 -year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab presented with a large, symptomatic, multiloculated cSDH. Infliximab was withheld and craniotomy for evacuation was uncomplicated, but recurrent symptoms were noted and a recurrence was operated upon again several weeks later.

40|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> (CSDH), {{which are}} {{frequently}} encountered in neurosurgical practice, are, {{in the majority}} of cases, ideally treated with surgical drainage. Despite this common practice, there is still controversy surrounding the best surgical procedure. With lack of clear evidence of a superior technique, surgeons are free to base the decision on other factors that are not related to patient care. A retrospective chart review of 119 patients requiring surgical drainage of CSDH was conducted at a large tertiary care center over a three-year period. Of the cases reviewed, 58 patients underwent craniotomy, while 61 pa-tients underwent burr hole washout. The study focused on re-operation rates, mortality, and morbidity, as measured by Glasgow coma scores (GCS), discharge Rankin disability scores, and discharge disposition. Secondary endpoints included length of stay and cost of procedure. Burr hole washout was superior to craniotomy with respect to patient outcome, length of stay and recurrence rates. In both study groups, patients required additional surgi-cal procedures (6. 6 % of burr hole patients and 24. 1 % of craniotomy patients) (P = 0. 0156).
