Meanwhile, the urethral plate of the glans breaks down centrally to form a median groove continuous with the primitive ostium.

5000|$|Hirsuties <b>coronae</b> <b>glandis</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "hirsutoid papillomas" [...] and [...] "pearly penile papules") are small protuberances that may {{form on the}} ridge of the glans of the human penis.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to chimpanzees, a common morphological variant found in humans called Hirsuties <b>coronae</b> <b>glandis,</b> or pearly penile papules, are substantially larger, {{appear to be}} an outpocketing of both surface and underlying connective tissue layers, and lack the rich innervation seen in other animals. These are sometimes described as vestigial remnants of penile spines. However, the relationship between the structures is still uncertain.|$|R
50|$|Vestibular papillomatosis (VP) is a {{cutaneous}} {{condition of}} the vulva, characterized by pink, asymptomatic, fine projections of the vestibular epithelium or labia minora.

50|$|The {{glans penis}} is the {{expanded}} cap of the corpus spongiosum. It is moulded on the rounded {{ends of the}} corpora cavernosa penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. At {{the summit of the}} glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice. The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the <b>corona</b> <b>glandis,</b> overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus (the coronal sulcus), behind which is the neck of the penis. The proportional size of the glans penis can vary greatly. On some penises it is much wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape.|$|E
40|$|Male {{capacity}} for spreading genes {{to a great}} number of descendents and to determine population dynamics depend directly on the genital organs. Morphological studies in pinnipeds are scarce and the functional meaning of some characteristics has never been discussed. We hypothesized that Arctocephalus australis (A. australis) shows morphophysiological adaptations in order to guarantee the perpetuation of the species in the unique annual mating season. Seven males, dead from natural causes, had their genital organs collected and fixed for morphological description. Some features differ from other described mammalian males and are closely related to the biology and reproductive cycle of this species, as the scrotal epidermis, absence of glandular portion in the ductus deferens and spermatogenic epithelium suggest a recrudescent testis period. The <b>corona</b> <b>glandis</b> exhibits a singular arrangement: its erectile border looks like a formation of petals and its association with the os penis gives a "lily-flower" form to this region. We propose the name margo petaliformis to this particular erectile border of the <b>corona</b> <b>glandis</b> because of its similarity to a flower corola. The male genital organs of A. australis show morphological features compatible with adaptation to environment requirements and reproductive efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A 23 -year-old man was {{referred}} to us with a 4 -yearhistory of flesh-coloured, spiny papules around thecoronal rim of his glans penis (Figure 1). The papules were 1 – 2 mm in diameter. The patient felt stigma-tized by their appearance. A diagnosis of pearly penile papules (also known as PPP) was made. Pearly penile papules commonly develop after puberty. The prevalence of this condition {{is estimated to be}} 14 %– 48 %, and the incidence is higher among black people and uncir-cumcised men. 1, 2 Many terms have been used to describe pearly penile papules, including Tyson glands, hirsutoid papillomas, papilla in the <b>corona</b> <b>glandis,</b> hirsutis papillary corona of the penis, corona capilliti and pink pearly papules. The papules are smooth, measure 1 – 4 mm in diameter and are asymptomatic. Commonly, they occur in a single or double row on the corona of the glans. Structurally, they are related to acral angiofibromas. Pearly penile papules need to be differen...|$|E
40|$|A 55 -year-old {{male with}} {{carcinoma}} in situ of urinary bladder was treated with weekly intravesical injections of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Three days after the sixth injection, he developed low grade fever and multiple grouped punched out, 2 - 3 mm ulcers around meatus and <b>corona</b> <b>glandis.</b> In addition, multiple, firm, indurated, nontender papules and few deeper nodules were present on the proximal part of glans penis, along with bilateral enlarged, matted and nontender inguinal lymph nodes. There was no history suggestive of sexually transmitted diseases and high risk behavior. Chest X-ray was within normal limits, and Mantoux, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and HIV antibody tests were negative. The biopsy from the penile ulcer revealed epithelioid cell granuloma with Langhans giant cells. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the lymph node also revealed epithelioid cell granuloma and acid fast bacilli on Ziehl Neelsen&#x 2032;s stain. The tissue biopsy grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The BCG immunotherapy was stopped and patient was treated with four drug antitubercular therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide in standard daily doses along with pyridoxine. The edema resolved and the ulcers started healing within 2 weeks, and at 6 weeks after starting antitubercular therapy almost complete healing occurred. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we describe the first case of an Indian patient with BCG induced primary tuberculosis of penis after immunotherapy for carcinoma urinary bladder and review the previously described cases to increase awareness of this condition in dermatologists and venereologists...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Application of {{constriction}} over penis {{by means}} of various objects for autoerotic purpose is a practice {{that may lead to}} dangerous consequences. A large variety of objects have been used for this purpose leading to a spectrum of complications. Management of such cases poses a great challenge to the treating surgeon, as it often requires teamwork involving not only doctors but also technical experts from engineering department. We report a case where a man presented with acute retention of urine with two metallic rings over his penis. CASE REPORT: A 50 years old man presented to the surgical emergency ward with complaint of acute retention of urine. He had pushed two metallic rings over his penis about two hours back in a bid to get sexual pleasure while he was under influence of alcohol. The rings later got impacted over the penis because of congestion of distal part of penis. Soon the patient developed the complaint of mild pain and swelling of penis and inability to pass urine and was brought to the hospital. The physical exam revealed that the part of penis distal to the rings was congested, swollen and slightly discolored. We started with urinary bladder emptying by putting a wide bore needle suprapubically and connecting it to a urobag through a drip set. Penile block was given. Blood was then aspirated from both corpora cavernosa distal to the rings and the rings were manipulated after generous application of lubricant jelly. This way, rings could be moved almost up to <b>corona</b> <b>glandis</b> obstructed only by a band of edematous skin. Now multiple needle punctures were given in this skin and the area was kept compressed for a while using a tape-gauze wrapped tightly over it. On removing the gauze, rings could be moved up to corona. Now the distal ring was placed with its wide stone bearing part against the ventral aspect of glans. Glans was then decongested {{by means of}} needle punctures and digital compression. Ring was rotated with traction while glans was compressed to negotiate through it. The attempt was successful and both rings were removed in this fashion. The post operative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration and puncture technique facilitates the removal of constricting objects from the penis. This technique is safe and does not require sophisticated equipment...|$|E
