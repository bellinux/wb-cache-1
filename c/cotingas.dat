25|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the New Zealand wrens {{has been a}} subject of considerable debate since their discovery, although they have long been known to be an unusual family. In the 1880s, Forbes assigned the New Zealand wrens to the suboscines related to the <b>cotingas</b> and pittas (and gave the family the name Xenicidae). Later, they {{were thought to be}} closer to the ovenbirds and antbirds. Sibley’s 1970 study comparing egg-white proteins moved them to the oscines, but later studies, including the 1982 DNA-DNA hybridization study, suggested the family was a sister taxon to the subocines and the oscines. This theory has proven most robust since then, and the New Zealand wrens might be the survivors of a lineage of passerines that was isolated when New Zealand broke away from Gondwana 82–85 million years ago (Mya), though a pre-Paleogene origin of passerines is highly disputed and tends to be rejected in more recent studies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cotingas</b> {{vary widely}} in social structure. There is a roughly 50/50 divide {{in the family}} between species with biparental care, and those in which the males play no part in raising the young. The purple-throated fruitcrow lives in mixed-sex groups in which one female lays an egg and the others help provide insects to the chick.|$|E

50|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} {{consists of}} mammals, toads, squamates {{and in particular}} {{a wide variety of}} birds. Among the latter, it is known to prefer tree-living species, such as oropendolas, aracaris, tanagers and <b>cotingas.</b> But ground- and waterbirds like tinamous, chachalacas, cormorants and the highly threatened Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus) have also been recorded as its prey. The black-and-white hawk-eagle has been known to attack small monkeys, though it is not clear with which intent. For as it seems, it has not been recorded to actually kill and eat a monkey.|$|E
50|$|Sharpbills {{are most}} {{commonly}} found in tall dense forests but occasionally venture to the forest edge. Their diet consists of primarily of fruit, but they will also take insects, hanging upside down in from twigs to obtain insect larvae. They will also travel in mixed-species feeding flocks with ovenbirds, tanagers, woodpeckers and <b>cotingas.</b> The breeding system employed by this species is polygamous with losely grouped males displaying in from a lek. The nest of the sharpbill is built by the female and is a small cup built on a slender branch. Chicks are fed by regurgitation.|$|E
50|$|It is a large, {{fast-growing tree}} growing up to 50 m tall with a trunk up to 1.3 m diameter, often buttressed {{at the base}} up to 2 m diameter, with rough, silvery-grey to reddish-grey bark. It is usually evergreen, but can be {{deciduous}} in the dry season. The leaves are alternate, broad lanceolate, with an entire margin and a petiole with a complex vascular system. The flowers are small, yellow-green, with five sepals and petals; they are produced in clusters, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is an orange-red berry-like drupe 5 mm diameter, containing 5-10 seeds; it is eaten by various birds (including <b>cotingas,</b> pigeons, tanagers, thrushes, and trogons), which disperse the seeds in their droppings.|$|E
5000|$|The purple-throated fruitcrow (Querula purpurata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cotingidae, the <b>cotingas.</b> It is the only species of the genus Querula.

It is a glossy black, medium-sized bird and the male has a purple-red throat patch. It nests in close vicinity with other birds of its species. Its population is in decline, but it is a common species with a very wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|Here David Snow {{began his}} {{studies of the}} oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis), and their {{echolocation}} abilities which enabled them to navigate to their nests in complete darkness using high-pitched clicks audible to humans (unlike the echolocation sounds of many bats). Barbara joined him in 1957 {{and from then on}} they worked together as a close-knit partnership. He and Barbara also began detailed studies of three bird families, the hummingbirds, the <b>cotingas</b> and the manakins, all associated with plants. This work extended over many years in Central and South America and led to important discoveries on the co-adaption between the birds and plants, providing food for the birds while ensuring the fertilising of the plants' flowers and dispersal of their seeds - [...] "an early breakthrough in the integration of behaviour and ecology." ...|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is found}} in humid {{tropical}} forests from southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, to Trinidad and Tobago, south to Peru and Argentina. They are able to tolerate some degree of habitat fragmentation, breeding successfully near cities and in forest fragments as small as 200 ha. Despite a slender build and a body weight no greater than a large Buteo hawk, the ornate hawk-eagle is a notably powerful predator which, like other booted eagles, can take prey up to five times its own weight. Birds are the principal prey. Prey items have ranged in size from 180 g to 8 kg when taken. Prey species have included little blue herons, curassows, toucans, wood quail, pigeons, macaws, parrots, <b>cotingas,</b> chickens, and even a black vulture. Mammals are also significant prey, with agoutis, squirrels, rats, procyonids, and monkeys often taken. Reptiles are also occasionally hunted.|$|E
50|$|Icterids are {{variable}} in size, and often display considerable sexual dimorphism, with brighter coloration and greater size in males being typical. While such dimorphism is widely known in passerines, the sexual dimorphism by size is uniquely extreme in icterids. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% {{heavier than the}} female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and 18 g in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures 52 cm and weighs about 550 g. This variation is greater {{than in any other}} passerine family (unless the kinglet calyptura belongs with the <b>cotingas,</b> which would then have greater variation). One unusual morphological adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull is configured to allow them open their bills strongly rather than passively, allowing them to force open gaps to obtain otherwise hidden food.|$|E
50|$|Gnateaters are {{notable for}} their absence from these flocks, while swifts and {{swallows}} rarely join them, but will {{if there is}} for example an ant or termite swarm. Cotingidae (<b>cotingas)</b> are mainly opportunistic associates which rarely join flocks for long if they do so at all; {{the same holds true}} for most Muscicapoidea (mockingbirds and relatives), though some thrushes may participate on more often. And though most Tityridae rarely join mixed flocks, becards do so regularly. Tapaculos are rarely seen with mixed flocks, though the collared crescentchest, doubtfully assigned to that family, may be a regular member. Icteridae (grackles and relatives) are also not too often seen to take part in these assemblages, though caciques like the golden-winged or red-rumped cacique join mixed flocks on a somewhat more regular basis. Cuculiformes (cuckoos and allies) are usually absent from mixed feeding flocks, but some - for example, the squirrel cuckoo - can be encountered not infrequently.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} list of plant species whose fruits are eaten by eight cotinga species (Carpornis cucullatus, C. melanocephalus, Laniisoma elegans, Lipaugus lanioides, Oxyruncus cristatus, Phibalura flavirostris, Procnias nudicollis, and Pyroderus scutatus) at Parque Estadual Intervales (PEI), an Atlantic Forest reserve in {{southeast}} Brazil. Besides providing a list of fruits eaten by <b>cotingas,</b> {{our goal is to}} allow insights into fruit use by these birds whose ecology is poorly known. From 1990 to 2001 four sites located within PEI were regularly visited. These sites form an altitudinal gradient (70 - 800 m a. s. l.) and also a gradient of forest disturbance (second-growth to old-growth vegetation). Feeding records were made along several trails and dirt roads that crossed the study sites. <b>Cotingas</b> ate a variety of fruits (99 species in 34 families) that ranged from small (< 5 mm diameter) to large (up to 37 mm) and included some non-ornithochorous ones. With the exception of P. nudicollis, <b>cotingas</b> exploited not only fruits typical of the forest interior but also fruits of secondary vegetation, suggesting that concerning fruit exploitation early successional vegetation does not represent a barrier for the survival of these <b>cotingas...</b>|$|E

Here, we present an analysis of DNA sequence data obtained from two nuclear exons, three introns, and one mitochondrial gene for 26 genera of Tyrannida and 6 tracheophone outgroups. The analysis resulted in well-supported hypotheses about the earliest evolution within Tyrannida...|$|E
40|$|Manakins {{are small}} suboscine passerines renowned for {{elaborate}} courtship displays and pronounced sexual dichromatism. We extracted and identified the carotenoid pigments {{found in the}} bright yellow to red feathers of 15 Neotropical manakin species. Rhodoxanthin (4 ', 5 '-didehydro- 4, 5 '-retro-beta,beta-carotene- 3, 3 '-dione) of a deep red hue was widely found in the plumages of these birds. The 4 -keto-carotenoids typically found in red plumages (alpha-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, etc.) were found in only the Flame-crested Manakin (Heterocercus linteatus) and the Red-headed Manakin (Pipra rubrocapilla). Rhodoxanthin was recently identified in the Pin-tailed Manakin (Ilicura militaris). Hudon etal. (2007) suggested that the Pin-tailed Manakin produces rhodoxanthin endogenously from dietary carotenoids, and this suggestion now finds some support in the pigment's wide and specific distribution in manakins. It is possible that this capacity arose in a common ancestor of manakins and <b>cotingas,</b> given that rhodoxanthin also occurs in the feathers of red <b>cotingas</b> (Phoenicircus spp.). Feathers with rhodoxanthin absorbed longer wavelengths of light than those with 4 -keto-carotenoids, but not in Pipra, which has species with {{one or the other}} type of keto-carotenoids. We found that feathers with rhodoxanthin also contained epsilon,epsilon-caroten- 3 (3 ') -ones (e. g., canary-xanthophyll B and the recently described piprixanthin), which are believed to be intermediates along the rhodoxanthin pathway. Manakins thus have the capability to produce a wide range of carotenoid pigments and bright yellow to red colors, on which natural and sexual selection may act.

40|$|Most {{tree species}} rely on {{vertebrates}} for seed dispersal, and many vertebrates use fruits as food resources in tropical forests. Therefore, plant-frugivore interactions affect population dynamics and persistence in ecological communities. Plant-frugivore interactions often involve many species, forming networks of interacting {{plants and animals}} that play different roles in determining network organization. The network organization is the way interactions are structured in the community, which may have consequences for its ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Some species have greater influences on network organization and may be particularly important to species persistence. We identified the frugivores most important to the organization of networks of plants and frugivorous birds in three contiguous Atlantic forest sites in southeastern Brazil. We found that the species that contributed most to network organization were at higher risk of extinction. Among the main contributors to network organization were two <b>cotingas</b> and a toucan, large-bodied species that disperse seeds from many plants and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting. As a consequence, ongoing extinctions may significantly affect the organization of plant-frugivore interactions in the studied system. We hypothesize that the crucial role of some threatened frugivores may occur in other seed dispersal systems in tropical communities, although the association between structural importance and degree of threat may be contingent on peculiarities of local communities and disturbances...|$|E
