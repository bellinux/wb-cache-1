40|$|In {{trying to}} get {{products}} out to the market in promotional or display packaging, companies {{have the option of}} turning to a contract packager. The purpose of this thesis is to present the area of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging,</b> specifically discussing the internal factors that make a contract packager an attractive actor to outsource packaging of products to and also to find out how a contract packager can affect the supply chain of the company outsourcing to such an actor. The questions posed in this thesis are: - When is it appropriate to outsource? - Why is a supplier of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> successful? - How is the supply chain affected when outsourcing to a contract packager? In addressing these questions a systems approach has been used, because a systems approach allows the researcher to see properties of the whole, rather than seeing the sum of parts as the collective properties of a system. The empirical data were collected through a case study of one company performing <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> Literature was studied in the areas of outsourcing, supply chain/supply chain management, third-party logistics and <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> Each of the questions posed was answered through the papers appended in this thesis. The first paper uses complexity theory in order for managers to be able to view outsourcing situations from a balanced perspective, providing guidance from two important functions – relative power and interface complexity. The conclusion reached in this paper is that in order for an outsourcing situation to be appropriate, the outsourcing company, vis-à-vis the supplier of the activity/process, needs to have high relative power while keeping interface complexity low. V The second and third papers discuss why a contract packager is successful and how it affects the supply chain of the company engaging it. In reference to the contract packager, it is ascertained that important activities to offer, besides the packing of products, are design and manufacturing of packaging and warehousing of the product of the customer. In using a contract packager, the company engaging it can utilize certain characteristics of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> The characteristics displayed by <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> are the “one-stop shop”, flexibility and warehousing. These characteristics give an outcome in the supply chain that can be used by the company to achieve effectiveness — from manufacturing of the product to the delivery of the product in display packaging to the store. The company’s supply chain is enabled to reduce uncertainty, reduce time-to-market of the promotions, and increase responsiveness. The company can also realize other benefits including consolidation of products and postponement of manufacturing of packaging and packing...|$|E

40|$|The {{environment}} in which companies operate is constantly changing thereby changing the parameters determining whether {{they are to be}} successful in business. One of the strategies that have been popular in ensuring profitability for companies is outsourcing – traditionally done in order to lower cost. In past years the initiative for outsourcing has shifted from simple cost reductions to involving more strategic issues, such as focusing on core competence and strategic re-positioning. This shift towards strategic initiatives will create demands on the suppliers who provide the outsourced activities. This requires that the supplier can provide the right composition of activities needed by the customer. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the importance for a supplier to choose the right composition of activities to make it as favourable for the company outsourcing as possible. Characteristics of the activities, which jointly constitute the offer, are presented. A case study of a company working in the area of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> was conducted together with a literature study considering the area of outsourcing. The paper focuses on a discussion of which activities should be chosen and the internal relationships between these, in order to make a supplier, specifically a contract packer, successful...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{imbalance}} existing between the perceived importance of communication, communication channels, {{and the actual}} attention and resources given toward it. Communication is rarely recognised as a required principal competency. Therefore, the paradox exists, because, although, increasing awareness {{about the importance of}} communication can be observed in the organisations, the knowledge relating to communication has been rarely translated into practice (Kalla 2005). The most common mistake made by managers is that they often forget that message sent does not equal message received (Hargie & Tourish 2009). Thus, there has been an enormous growth of interest in the field of organisational communication that attracts the academic interest. This dissertation reviews the literature on communication in a workplace and incorporates theories applied in the field of Business and Cultural Studies alike. The author presents the study of the relationship between organisational communication and job satisfaction in multicultural, Irish-owned pharmaceutical <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> company. The research conducted in the production and office departments describes and analyses the similarities and differences between responses given by both groups of employees in terms of perceptions relating to internal communication within the organisation. Additionally, the researcher presents her observations made during the appointment organised in the company, and her own organisational communication related experience gained in the Irish company of similar profile. Therefore, the paper aims at exploring whether the positive relationship between organisational communication and job satisfaction within a given company exists. It also describes the quality of organisational communication in the organisation...|$|E
