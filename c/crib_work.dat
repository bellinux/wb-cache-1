50|$|The Erie City Iron Works was {{contracted}} in December 1867 {{to erect}} a 5 ft standpipe, which eventually reached a height of 233 ft, {{thought to have been}} the tallest standpipe in the world. John M Kuhn, Esq was hired in 1868 to build the standpipe tower, and Captain James Dunlap was contracted that year to construct the <b>crib</b> <b>work.</b> The foundation for the water works was excavated beginning on 7 April 1868.|$|E
50|$|To {{the right}} corner of the {{entrance}} is the opening to the Presepe Monumentale (Monumental <b>Crib),</b> <b>work</b> of Fulgencio Mart√≠nez, situated in the older inferior crypt (11). In this crypt was the old parish before the inauguration of the Basilica. In it, among other events, were baptized a few members of the Spanish Royal Family, Mons. Oscar Romero, the martyr of El Salvador, celebrated his first Mass and was the place where Claretians celebrated the beatification of Saint Anthony Mary Claret.|$|E
50|$|Lock No. 1 and {{a section}} of the {{original}} North Branch Canal in Northumberland were intact in 1986 as was Lock No. 2 below Bloomsburg. Occasional sections of canal bed remained between Shickshinny and West Nanticoke, and the West Nanticoke guard lock was intact. Canal bed was visible from the Lackawanna River toward Ransom and largely intact above Vosburg between Lackawanna Campground and Horse Race Falls. At Laceyville a museum known as the Oldest House was once a lockkeeper's house. Other remnants such as <b>crib</b> <b>work,</b> canal embankments, iron spikes, and timbers could be found here and there along the full length of the canal.|$|E
5000|$|Noskwith's biggest {{accomplishment}} {{was breaking}} the Naval Enigma Offizier settings. He created a crib {{based on the}} letters 'EEESSSPATRONE' and had placed into cue to be crunched by Bletchley's bombe analogue computers. The letter pairings referred to colour-coding used by German ships' flares as [...] "friend or foe" [...] detection. When the <b>crib</b> <b>worked,</b> it allowed the Allied forces to read German messages sent to and from Kriegsmarine officers.|$|R

50|$|In 1718 {{an early}} settler and ferry owner, Cornelius Claes Vandenburgh, built a {{landmark}} stone {{house on the}} Mohawk west of Crescent. Cornelius Claes Ferry was later called Dunsbach Ferry.Dunsbach Ferry originated, as the name suggests, as a ferry crossing over the Mohawk River. The ferry was replaced {{for a short time}} by the Dunsbach Ferry Bridge, a bridge that had an unusual pier construction method involving cylinders with piles driven inside with heavy <b>crib</b> <b>work</b> outside. This bridge was constructed by the Dunsbach Ferry Bridge Company in 1898 in three spans, two were carried away by ice in 1903, and the third in 1905. When the creation of the New York State Barge Canal moved the Erie Canal to the Mohawk River in 1910 the hamlet became home to many barge captains and as a stop for provisioning the barges. A gauging station was established at Dunsbach Ferry in 1898 by D.J. Howell for measuring the discharge flow of the river and the record continued on at the West Troy Water Company dam and pumping station at the hamlet, it was located roughly 200 feet south (upstream) of the bridge. The dam was built in order to supply West Troy (later Watervliet) with water, and was partially removed in 1912.|$|E
40|$|In 1972, I was apprenticed to {{an elderly}} {{mountain}} man {{steeped in the}} traditions of log crib construction. Cyrus Paul Lewis taught me the skills of 18 th and 19 th century rough and finish carpentry as it pertained to folk architecture. The craft training of log construction added on top of several years experience as a modern day carpenter enabled me to build a company that restored houses and other log buildings all over the United States from 1974 to 2006. In 1978 I continued my formal education in anthropology and preservation specializing in log structures at George Washington University in Washington, D. C. Having read all the authoritative works on log buildings and compared them to what I was learning in the field, it was obvious there were many gaps in the collective body of knowledge concerning the development and dissemination of log crib structures. During a brief first trip to Europe, {{it was easy to}} see that the log crib buildings in Alpine and northern Europe in no way resembled the American log cribs erected for three centuries by the settlers arriving on the American shores and those pushing west to establish their farms and build their houses. It became clear American scholarship had a long way to go in understanding the log crib, its development, technology and dissemination throughout the world much less in America. In 2009 a quest to fill in some of the gaps was begun. After four years of intense research with field trips to Turkey, southern Europe and ranging all the way north to the Scandinavian and Baltic countries ringing the Baltic Sea two findings became very clear. First, no one person can possibly conduct the massive research needed to fully understand origins, technology and dissemination of the world's log cribs. Secondly, it was apparent, contrary to what had been declared in former publications, that Europeans did not transfer their log crib technologies intact to the eastern shores of the US. Rather only a small number of scattered details mixed with a few processes of material manufacturing and building commonly used in Europe were configured into what was to become an American log crib style almost from the first settlements. These discoveries bore witness to the fallacy of single or two person research efforts that resulted in broad, sweeping declarations of origins and disseminations concerning log crib technologies. Most authors were not familiar with the professional training needed to fully understand the hands-on traditions of building with logs and have largely missed the facts concerning the developmental history of log buildings in a specific country and the world. Far more collaborative research between the multiple disciplines and experienced master craftsmen is needed. Even in Estonia further studies are needed to determine how the dual-purpose barn-dwelling developed and where it originated. With seven centuries of multiple foreign occupations responsible for bringing in many different types of technologies form their occupiers' homelands, Estonia is a perfect research area for studying and tracking details of development within the country and tracing them back to their origins. Estonia is not the only country where a rich tradition of log construction needs further research. Further Continental and world-wide log crib studies are needed on a global basis. National surveys must be completed and all resulting data shared to a central data base and collated for developmental research to take place. This work is vital to the understanding of the origins, development and disseminations of log crib technologies throughout the world much less the US and the European Continent. The results of multiple global log crib research efforts will have far reaching effects in craft training, log crib technology training, and in reintroducing relative millennia's old technologies in a modern day world rife with toxic fixes that do not work very well in new construction. New restoration techniques of wooden buildings will be learned and culled from the research. Environmental considerations that reduce CO 2 levels, green house effects and increase local community cohesiveness all will benefit from global in-depth research efforts to fill in the missing information gaps in log crib development and technologies. In order for all this research to be coordinated, collated and disseminated, a single global organization dedicated to the study of log crib development must be formed. A new organization focused solely on ferreting out log construction histories, developing techniques of restoration, forest management and timber conservation is necessary in part to provide continued introductory and higher level job training for a log <b>crib</b> <b>work</b> force. The research and training is imperative if the world is to maintain and develop additional higher paying jobs, lower taxes, maintain existing log structures, wisely use limited natural resources in an efficient manner and better living conditions for millions of people...|$|E

50|$|After the {{promulgation}} of Environmental Protection Act (EPA) for {{the first}} time during the basic design of section II Sindhulibazar Khurkot section, a Complete Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted. Extensive discussion on various aspects on environmental issues was discussed with the local people and their concerns are properly addressed. Furthermore, various slope stabilization techniques has been adopted, this includes use of retaining and breast walls, <b>crib</b> <b>works,</b> gabion works, geotextiles and most interesting being the bio-engineering works which includes the locally available techniques like plantation of trees, shrubs including turfing and the soil seeding method imported from Japan. Though initially this technique has been found little expensive because most of the materials used in this method being imported from Japan and for making this method economical effort has been made to use the locally available materials so that this method could be extensively used in Nepal.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. BS 7988 {{is the new}} British Standard Code of {{practice}} {{for the use of}} information technology (IT) for the delivery of assessments. It was developed by a panel of experts in the field of computerised assessment. They included representatives from government, business, education and exam boards. The BS 7988 standard itself is being covered in another session at the conference. This paper addresses how Questionmark Perception users can use Perception to be compliant with the standard. You can get a copy of the document from the British Standards Institution (www. bsi-global. com). It introduces guidelines and requirements for any organisation that uses computers to create assessments. It also explains how organisations can establish a good code of practice for delivering them. To comply with the new standard, organizations running exams need to have effective methods to verify online candidates who may be at remote locations. The publication also gives guidelines on providing practice tests for candidates, taking mandatory breaks from the screen, and preventing screen-snooping, <b>cribbing</b> <b>work,</b> sending emails, and accessing websites. This paper will explain how authors and administrators can use Questionmark Perception in the correct way to enable them to follow the various technical recommendations in the standard. It explains that compliance with the standard is {{not simply a matter of}} installing the software. Rather, recommendations on using the software must be followed, both on procedural and technical issues. In fact Questionmark has contributed a key part in developing the standard. Managing director John Kleeman also stood as the BSI committee chairman...|$|R
50|$|After announcing Marr's {{departure}} from the group on 11 April 2011, The <b>Cribs</b> started <b>work</b> on writing the follow up to Ignore the Ignorant, mooted for a spring 2012 release. During this time, they recorded a cover of original 70's Canadian punk band The Dishrags 'Death In The Family' for a Canadian Mint Records compilation. Over the summer they played several headlining slots at UK festivals in 2011, {{as well as a}} show at Le Zenith in Paris with The Strokes. In June 2011 they made their first trip to Brazil, playing two shows in S√£o Paulo. In December 2011 they headlined the Clockenflap festival in Hong Kong, debuting new songs 'Come On, Be A No-One', and 'Anna' for the first time.|$|R

5000|$|Cribbing {{is often}} used in the repair of heavy {{equipment}} or farm equipment. Subassemblies that have been disconnected are supported by cribbing until reassembly. In such <b>work,</b> <b>cribbing</b> is often safer than jack stands because it {{is less likely to}} tip over. And if the metal parts bite into the wood, this helps to keep sliding from happening. These factors are especially true in field repairs, because most ground is not perfectly level and hard, like a concrete garage floor would be. Even on concrete, cribbing is often preferred.|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{is dedicated}} to our long-suffering 442 students, and to the excellent authors from whom I shamelessly <b>cribbed</b> this <b>work.</b> It is a pure cut-and-paste job from my favorite sources on this material.

If this presentation helps you, good. If not it at least helped me sort a few things out. I assume knowledge of all necessary linear systems theory, differential equations, statistics, control theory, etc. We start with the ideas of filtering, smoothing, prediction, and state estimation. Wiener filtering and its associated intellectual framework follows, with a brief foray into ARMA filtering. The idea of recursive estimation is introduced to give some motivation for the slog ahead, and then we start with basic concepts in maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori, and least-squares estimatio [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The PHD {{thesis is}} focused on the {{transcription}} and analysis of an unpublished manuscript nineteenth-century, preserved in a private collection, which recounts events about Piedmontese Giuseppe Verani, became a court painter during the long roam through Italy in the wake of Duca d'Aosta, then King Vittorio Emanuele I, in exile because of the Napoleonic invasion of Piedmont. Particular attention is devoted to the period in which the royal family stayed in Cagliari, from 1806 to 1815, much prolific abut multifaceted activities by Verani. Educated to drawing from his father, the Turin artist Agostino Verani, Giuseppe developed a special aptitude for the landscape painting, a genre that allows him to combine an interest in landscape, so the soul of artist, with rigor topography of the scientific and technical design, assimilated through the attendance of the military environment. The views are flanked by the most varied activities, from decorations in the royal residences to designs for flags and uniforms, until the creation of the figures for the <b>crib.</b> These <b>works</b> are described in detail in the manuscript to witness the maturation of a long professional experience. On the strength of the manuscript and of discovery of works signed by Verani we are advancing a number of attributions of decorative works made in Cagliari until now considered to Anonymous. ...|$|R
