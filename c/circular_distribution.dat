5000|$|The von Mises {{distribution}} is a <b>circular</b> <b>distribution</b> which, {{like any other}} <b>circular</b> <b>distribution,</b> may {{be thought of as}} a wrapping of a certain linear probability distribution around the circle. The underlying linear probability distribution for the von Mises {{distribution is}} mathematically intractable; however, for statistical purposes, there is no need to deal with the underlying linear distribution. The usefulness of the von Mises distribution is twofold: it is the most mathematically tractable of all circular distributions, allowing simpler statistical analysis, and it is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution, which, analogously to the linear normal distribution, is important because it is the limiting case for the sum of a large number of small angular deviations. In fact, the von Mises distribution is often known as the [...] "circular normal" [...] distribution because of its ease of use and its close relationship to the wrapped normal distribution (Fisher, 1993).|$|E

40|$|In Fernández-Durán (2004), a {{new family}} of <b>circular</b> <b>distributions</b> based on nonnegative {{trigonometric}} sums (NNTS models) is developed. Contrary to {{the great majority of}} families of <b>circular</b> <b>distributions,</b> this family allows to model datasets that present multimodality and/or skewness. Initially, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the NNTS family were obtained by algorithms based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that were difficult to implement in R and {{take a long time to}} converge. Because the parameter space of the NNTS family is the surface of the hypersphere, an efficient Newton-like algorithm on manifolds is generated in order to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. This algorithm is implemented in the R package CircNNTSR.

40|$|We study {{spectra of}} {{directed}} networks with inhibitory and excitatory couplings. We investigate in particular eigenvector localization properties of various model networks for different value of correlation among their entries. Spectra of random networks, with completely uncorrelated entries show a <b>circular</b> <b>distribution</b> with delocalized eigenvectors, where as networks with correlated entries have localized eigenvectors. In {{order to understand}} the origin of localization we track the spectra as a function of connection probability and directionality. As connections are made directed, eigenstates start occurring in complex conjugate pairs and the eigenvalue distribution combined with the localization measure shows a rich pattern. Moreover, for a very well distinguished community structure, the whole spectrum is localized except few eigenstates at boundary of the <b>circular</b> <b>distribution.</b> As the network deviates from the community structure there is a sudden change in the localization property for a very small value of deformation from the perfect community structure. We search for this effect for the whole range of correlation strengths and for different community configurations. Furthermore, we investigate spectral properties of a metabolic network of zebrafish, and compare them with those of the model networks. Comment: revised version as accepted in Phys. Rev.

30|$|In this article, we have {{introduced}} a new transmuted wrapped distribution named TWE distribution, for modeling the circular data. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the transmutation of a <b>circular</b> <b>distribution</b> is a new attempt to obtain more flexible <b>circular</b> <b>distribution.</b> In the paper, the pdf and the cdf of the introduced distribution are derived and their behaviors are illustrated. Rényi and Shannon entropies of the distribution are obtained in an open form. Furthermore, explicit forms of the basic characteristics of the introduced distribution such as mean, trigonometric moments, characteristic function, quantile function and others are obtained. To estimate the unknown parameters of the introduced distribution, the maximum likelihood, the least squares and the weighted least squares estimators are obtained. By a conducted Monte Carlo simulation study, the efficiencies of these estimators are comparatively illustrated. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation show that when the sample size increases, both Bias and MSE values decrease for all estimation methods. Finally, we apply the introduced distribution to a real-life dataset named turtles dataset. Using the log-likelihood, AIC and Watson’s statistic criteria, the modeling performance of the introduced distribution is compared with wrapped exponential distribution and wrapped Lindley distribution. According to the obtained results, we can say that the TWE distribution is a better model to the turtle data than WE and WL distributions.|$|E
