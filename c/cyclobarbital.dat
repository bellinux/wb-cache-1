40|$|The authors {{present a}} gas chromatographic method {{which allows for}} the rapid {{identification}} and assay of barbiturates and antiepileptics in body fluids. The Kupferberger procedure for extraction is used. The identification is obtained on 2 different columns: 10 % Dexil 300 GC on Chromosorb W HP and 3 % OV 17 on Chromosorb G AW DMCS (80 - 100 mesh). A considerable and interesting reduction of the barbiturates adsorption in the columns is obtained by preliminary conditioning with tetraethylorthosilicate. In this way, phenobarbital and <b>cyclobarbital</b> may also be assayed up to 1 μg/ml in blood. For the simultaneous assay of therapeutic levels of phenobarbital and hydantoins methyl derivatives are better employed: blood concentrations as low as 0. 1 μg/ml are easily detected...|$|E
40|$|This report {{concerns}} 70 patients {{admitted to}} the Chiba National Hospital on account of hypnotic poisoning {{during the period of}} six years from 1949 to 1954. Most of them have ingested 2 ̆ 2 brovarin 2 ̆ 2 (bromvalerylures) or 2 ̆ 2 adorm 2 ̆ 2 (<b>cyclobarbital),</b> and of these patients nine died. Examinations of temperature, blood picture, plasma protein, blood sugar, and liver and kidney functions were performed in these patients. The results are summarized as follows: (1) In 47 cases (or 68 percent), the temperature rose to 37. 5 - 41. 3 ℃ within 48 hours after the onset of the coma. (2) Erythrocyte and hemoglobin contents of the blood showed an increase during the comatose stage, due mostly to the hemoconcentration due to plasma loss. (3) At the same time, leucocyte count increased markedly as the result of neutrophilic leucocytosis. After the 3 rd day, however the number of leucocyte tended to fall below normal. On the other hand neutrophilia was usually accompanied by lymphopenia and eosinopenia. (4) Plasma protein, particularly albumin-concentration, was gradually decreased after about 24 hours 2 ̆ 7 latent period. At the same time, fibrinogen was increased and blood sedimentation rate accelerated. (5) Examinations of the meulengracht 2 ̆ 7 s value of the blood serum as well as urine, bromsulphalein and phenolsulfonphthalein tests revealed, in many cases impairments of liver and renal functions for several days. (6) In 12 of 14 patients, in whom the examination of blood sugar were performed an increase in the blood sugar content occurred in the comatose stage, (7) The above-mentioned various changes paralleled the grade of seriousness of the illness, not the kinds of hypnotics...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} pyridine- 2 -, pyridine- 3 -, pyridine- 4 -, {{pyrazine}} and quinoline- 2 -carboxamidrazone derivatives and new classes of carboxamidrazone were prepared. Over nine hundred synthesized compounds were screened for their antimycobacterial activity against M. fortutium (NCTC 10394) {{as a surrogate}} for M. tuberculosis. The new classes of amidrazones were also screened against tuberculosis H 37 Rv. Fifteen tested compounds were found to provide 90 - 100 % inhibition of mycobacterium growth of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv in the primary screen at 6. 25 μg mL- 1. The most active compound in the carboxamidrazone amide series had an MIC value of 0. 1 - 2 μg mL- 1 against M. fortutium. The x-ray structure of DHFR from M. tuberculosis and human DHFR {{were found to have}} differences in substrate binding site. The presence of glycerol molecule in the X-ray structure from M. tuberculosis DHFR provided opportunity to design new antifolates. The new antifolates were designed to retain the pharmocophore of pyrimethamine (2, 4 -diamino- 5 (4 -chlorophenyl) - 6 -ethylpyrimidine), but encompassing a range of polar groups that might interact with the M. tuberculosis DHFR glycerol binding pockets. Finally, the research describes the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers for the recognition of 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine for the binding of the target. Having proven that 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine interacts strongly with the model 5 -(4 -tert-butyl-benzylidene) -pyrimidine- 2, 4, 6 -trione, 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine-imprinted polymers were prepared using a novel <b>cyclobarbital</b> derived functional monomer, acrylic acid 4 -(2, 4, 6 -trioxo-tetrahydro-pyrimidin- 5 -ylidenemethyl) phenyl ester, capable of multiple hydrogen bond formation with the 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine. The recognition property of the respective polymers toward the templates and other test compounds was evaluated. The polymers showed dose dependent enhancement of fluorescence emissions.

40|$|Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating {{diseases}} in the world primarily due to several decades of neglect and an emergence of multidrug-resitance strains (MDR) of M. tuberculosis together with the increased incidence of disseminated infections produced by other mycobacterium in AIDS patients. This has prompted the search for new antimycobacterial drugs. A series of pyridine- 2 -, pyridine- 3 -, pyridine- 4 -, pyrazine and quinoline- 2 -carboxamidrazone derivatives and new classes of carboxamidrazone were prepared in an automated fashion and by traditional synthesis. Over nine hundred synthesized compounds were screened for their anti mycobacterial activity against M. fortutium (NGTG 10394) as a surrogate for M. tuberculosis. The new classes of amidrazones were also screened against tuberculosis H 37 Rv and antimicrobial activities against various bacteria. Fifteen tested compounds were found to provide 90 - 100 % inhibition of mycobacterium growth of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv in the primary screen at 6. 25 μg mL- 1. The most active compound in the carboxamidrazone amide series had an MIG value of 0. 1 - 2 μg mL- 1 against M. fortutium. The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been a drug-design target for decades. Blocking of the enzymatic activity of DHFR is a key element in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer, bacterial and protozoal infection. The x-ray structure of DHFR from M. tuberculosis and human DHFR were found to have differences in substrate binding site. The presence of glycerol molecule in the Xray structure from M. tuberculosis DHFR provided opportunity to design new antifolates. The new antifolates described herein were designed to retain the pharmcophore of pyrimethamine (2, 4 - diamino- 5 (4 -chlorophenyl) - 6 -ethylpyrimidine), but encompassing a range of polar groups that might interact with the M. tuberculosis DHFR glycerol binding pockets. Finally, the research described in this thesis contributes to the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers for the recognition of 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine for the binding the target. The formation of hydrogen bonding between the model functional monomer 5 -(4 -tert-butyl-benzylidene) -pyrimidine- 2, 4, 6 -trione and 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine in the pre-polymerisation stage was verified by 1 H-NMR studies. Having proven that 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine interacts strongly with the model 5 -(4 -tert-butylbenzylidene) - pyrimidine- 2, 4, 6 -trione, 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine-imprinted polymers were prepared using a novel <b>cyclobarbital</b> derived functional monomer, acrylic acid 4 -(2, 4, 6 -trioxo-tetrahydro-pyrimidin- 5 - ylidenemethyl) phenyl ester, capable of multiple hydrogen bond formation with the 2, 4 - diaminopyrimidine. The recognition property of the respective polymers toward the template and other test compounds was evaluated by fluorescence. The results demonstrate that the polymers showed dose dependent enhancement of fluorescence emissions. In addition, the results also indicate that synthesized MIPs have higher 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine binding ability as compared with corresponding non-imprinting polymers...|$|E
