In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard.

5|$|In July 2003 Rambhadracharya deposed as {{an expert}} witness for {{religious}} matters (OPW 16) in Other Original Suit Number5 of the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute case in the Allahabad High Court. Some portions of his affidavit and <b>cross</b> <b>examination</b> are quoted in the final judgement by the High Court. In his affidavit, he cited the ancient Hindu scriptures including the Ramayana, Rāmatāpanīya Upaniṣad, Skanda Purana, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and others describing Ayodhya as a city holy to Hindus and the birthplace of Rama. He cited verses from two works composed by Tulsidas which, in his opinion, {{are relevant to the}} dispute. The first citation consisted of eight verses from a work called Dohā Śataka, which describe the destruction of a temple and construction of a mosque at the disputed site in 1528CE by Mughal ruler Babur, who had ordered General Mir Baqui to destroy the Rama temple, considered a symbol of worship by infidels. The second citation was a verse from a work called Kavitāvalī, which mentions a mosque. In his <b>cross</b> <b>examination,</b> he described in some detail the history of the Ramananda sect, its Mathas, rules regarding Mahants, formation and working of Akharas, and Tulsidas' works. Refuting the possibility of the original temple being {{to the north of the}} disputed area, as pleaded by the pro-mosque parties, he described the boundaries of the Janmabhoomi as mentioned in the Ayodhya Mahatmya section of Skanda Purana, which tallied with the present location of the disputed area, as noted by Justice Sudhir Agarwal. However, he stated that he had no knowledge of whether there was a Ram Chabootra ("Platform of Rama") outside the area that was locked from 1950 to 1985 and where the Chati Poojan Sthal was, nor whether the idols of Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and Sita were installed at Ram Chabootra outside the Janmabhoomi temple.|$|E

40|$|The Laming Inquiry {{into the}} {{death in the}} UK of eight year old Victoria Climbié {{was not simply a}} review of failings in a single case of child abuse. Reporting to both the Home Office and the Department of Health, the Laming Report (2003) of the Inquiry set in motion a major re-evaluation of the child {{protection}} system in England and Wales. Its recommendations set the direction for major changes in organisation, legislation, policy and practice, as proposed in the British Government’s Green Paper ‘Every Child Matters’.

The data consists of the detailed examination of fieldworkers, managers and policymakers about all aspects of child protection practice and policy in three local authorities in London, amounting to 68 days of testimony.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{discipline of}} the study is the sociolinguistics of law in which the analytical methods of discourse, genre and narrative analysis are brought together in the enterprise of describing language in its social context. The issues addressed in this study relate to communication processes {{in a court of law}} in Gaborone, Botswana. These have been identified as issues relating to the various stages of the trial process that some writers have labelled sub-genres of the courtroom genre and some have simply labelled discourses. The process typical to the Botswana courtroom are the administrative processes of Mentions Reading of Charge Sheets and Readings of Facts and the substantive processes of Direct and <b>Cross</b> <b>Examinations,</b> Submissions and Judgements. The study also includes the description of the bilingual nature of the Botswana courtroom including code switching and courtroom interpreting. The views and awareness of the legal practitioners - police prosecutors and lawyers - on and of the uses of language in the courtroom were sought and tested by a short questionnaire. These are cross-referred with observations and recordings of the court's proceedings with the aim of revealing the nature of bilingualism in this court. Many studies have described and critique different aspects of the trial such as courtroom questioning and jury summations, but few have attempted to describe the trial as a whole as this study has done. This broad focus has enabled the perception of the trial as a site for interlocking discourses, which together bring about the outcomes of trials. It has found out, for example, that while some processes are, ordinarily, unacceptably coercive of witness, like <b>cross</b> <b>examinations,</b> some are empowering, for instance, direct examinations. In which witnesses are allowed longer turns at talk where they give narrative accounts.

40|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for specifically structural alignment (the apparent tendency for speakers to repeat {{their own or}} others syntactic or structural choices in conversation) in dialogue comes from experimental studies of task-oriented dialogue (e. g.

However, the data used in these studies is not adequately representative of ordinary dialogue; in the experiments, the confederate is scripted and Gries (2005) ’s corpus is biased towards written and spoken monologue, with {{a significant proportion of}} the dialogues it samples involving specialised institutional settings, e. g. legal <b>cross</b> <b>examinations</b> and broadcast interviews. Lexical similarity is also known to increase structural alignment, though the relative contribution of the two effects in genuine dialogue has not been thoroughly examined.
