40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} advance our {{understanding}} of the <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> phenomenon in the UK, specifically how students draw on a credit as a form of institutional cultural capital. Drawing on interviews with twenty-six part-time mature learners this paper examines the progressive and retrospective orientations to study that surfaced in students’ accounts of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> and their life-long learning journeys. A common theme of “unfinished business” appeared to dominate these accounts and a narrative-oriented analysis of the findings revealed the role of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> in enabling students to complete varied personal projects or forms of “unfinished business”. The findings of this work suggest that in an increasingly complex higher education market {{there is a need to}} understand students’ strategic use of the credit they accumulate.
