2500|$|According to a 2008 World Bank {{study in}} 10 Indian states, Swajaldhara results in lower capital costs, lower {{administrative}} costs and better service quality {{compared to the}} supply-driven approach. In particular, {{the study found that}} the average full cost of supply-driven schemes is [...] per cubic meter, while it is only [...] per cubic meter for demand-driven schemes. These costs include <b>capital,</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance costs, administrative costs and coping costs incurred by users of malfunctioning systems. Coping costs include travelling long distances to obtain water, standing in long queues, storing water and repairing failed systems. Among the surveyed systems that were built using supply-driven approach system breakdowns were common, {{the quantity and quality of}} water supply were less than foreseen in designs, and 30% of households did not get daily supply in summer. The poor functioning of one system sometimes leads to the construction of another system, so that about 30% of households surveyed were served by several systems. As of 2008 only about 10% of rural water schemes built in India used a demand-driven approach. Since water users have to pay lower or no tariffs under the supply-driven approach, this discourages them to opt for a demand-driven approach, even if the likelihood of the systems operating on a sustainable basis is higher under a demand-driven approach.|$|E

5000|$|The {{greatest}} casualties for {{his army}} were suffered at the three-day Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. To deal {{with more than}} 14,000 Union wounded, along with 6,800 Confederate wounded who were left behind, a vast medical encampment was created northeast of Gettysburg off the York Pike on the George Wolf farm, named [...] "Camp Letterman." [...] Of the Battle of Gettysburg and his system for treating casualties, Jonathan Letterman on October 3, 1863 reported to Brig. Gen. S. Williams, A.A.G., Army of the Potomac, “Surgeon John McNulty, medical director of that corps, reports that ‘it is with extreme satisfaction that I {{can assure you that}} it enabled me to remove the wounded from the field, shelter, feed them, and dress their wounds within six hours after the battle ended, and to have every <b>capital</b> <b>operation</b> performed within twenty-four hours after the injury was received.’ I can, I think, safely say that such would have been the result in other corps had the same facilities been allowed—a result not to have been surpassed, if equaled, in any battle of magnitude that has ever taken place.’” Maj. McNulty, the Medical Director of the XII Corps (Union Army), either “had not received” or more likely had outright disobeyed orders to leave behind medical baggage wagons and, therefore, unlike many other Union medical commanders at Gettysburg had sufficient medical equipment and supplies to adequately implement Letterman’s systems at Gettysburg for the XII Corps.|$|E

[...] It is known from Hill’s later writing that Young was a powerfully influential figure to his young apprentice during the latter's formative professional years.Hill, like many Edinburgh surgical apprentices attended lectures at Surgeons’ Hall but like the majority of apprentices of the period did not prceed to a surgical diploma or a medical degree in the newly established University of Edinburgh Medical School. [...] During Hill’s apprenticeship there was no teaching hospital in Edinburgh. He later wrote “There was no infirmary in Edinburgh when I served my apprenticeship there, so that I never had an opportunity of seeing a cancerous breast extirpated or any other <b>capital</b> <b>operation</b> performed till I performed them myself.” The first teaching hospital (the “Little House”) opened opposite the head of Robertson’s Close on 6 July 1729.Hill joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon in 1730.
