25|$|GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new {{consolidated}} {{electronic system}} {{that uses a}} two <b>control</b> <b>box</b> system {{to reduce the number}} of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and user-friendly.|$|E
500|$|The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> for the {{automatic}} pilot was {{recovered from the}} wreckage. [...] The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED warning flag was in view even though the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that {{the automatic}} pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and automatic pilot were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the cockpit control console.|$|E
500|$|The ECTunes system, {{and most}} others so far disclosed, use a <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> with software, digital {{amplifiers}} and weather-friendly external speakers. ECTunes' system {{connects to the}} car, and reads speed and acceleration, shutting down when the car reaches Cross-over speed as set by existing regulation as well as regulation under development such as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTV), {{at which point the}} tires and wind are making noise of their own. The company is currently selling products to OEM's, mainly small series production, and to the after market, and has also a new mass production unit in prototype stage ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike earlier systems, {{none of the}} AN/ARC-5 <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> have audio jacks for the microphone, headphone, or key. A {{separate}} {{jack box}} is used instead. AN/ARC-5 transmitter <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> contain no Morse key.|$|R

500|$|Mennekes:On {{the right}} hand {{side of the car}} is the “fast” and “slow” AC {{charging}} point, accessed in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin [...] point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a control circuit. This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” [...] <b>control</b> <b>box</b> {{in the middle of this}} lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts) ...|$|E
500|$|John Watkins, {{chairman}} of the investigation panel, told the inquiry the evidence supporting the theory that inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot caused the accident was that its <b>control</b> <b>box</b> was recovered from the wreckage and its gyroscope was still caged. The speed valve unit was also recovered and it indicated the automatic pilot was operating {{at the time of}} impact. [...] Inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged could explain a sudden descent by a DC-3. Watkins also said the panel's report to the Director-General made several recommendations and they were already being actioned. [...] These included one recommendation that operation of the automatic pilot on-off control on Australian-registered DC-3 aircraft should be made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|The Arrow's thin wing {{required}} aviation's first [...] {{hydraulic system}} to supply enough {{force to the}} control surfaces, while using small actuators and piping. A rudimentary fly-by-wire system was employed, in which the pilot's input was detected {{by a series of}} pressure-sensitive transducers in the stick, and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls. This resulted in a lack of control feel; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system, the variations in back-pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick. To re-create a sense of feel, the same electronic <b>control</b> <b>box</b> rapidly responded to the hydraulic back-pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick, making it move slightly; this system, called [...] "artificial feel", was also a first.|$|E

2500|$|A {{feature of}} most PR Spitfires were the {{specially}} modified [...] "Blown" [...] canopies which incorporated large lateral teardrop shaped blisters, allowing the pilots a much clearer {{view to the}} rear and below, vital for sighting the cameras. The lateral cameras were aimed by lining up a tiny +, marked {{on the side of}} the blister, with a fine black line painted on the port outer aileron. On all unarmed PR conversions the gunsight was replaced by a small camera <b>control</b> <b>box</b> from which the pilot could turn the cameras on, control the time intervals between photos and set the number of exposures.|$|E
2500|$|By about 1940, most {{configurations}} of the F24 included a Dallmeyer Pentac lens with focal length 8", aperture f/2.9, {{with either a}} Type 21 hand adaptor with two side handles, or a Type 25 fixed mounting and Type 35 <b>control</b> <b>box</b> and motor drive. Weight of a typical hand-held version is about 20lb. Prior to 1940, available lenses included focal lengths of 3.25" [...] (f/5.6), 5" [...] (f/2.8), 6", 10.5". In 1937, a 14" [...] (f/5.6) lens was introduced, followed in late 1940 by a 20" [...] (f/5.6) lens, and in 1942 by a 36" [...] lens. Longer lenses, and larger image formats, offered more detailed images from extremely high altitudes.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Sea Fury {{had been}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} pure air superiority fighter, the Royal Navy viewed the solid construction and payload capabilities of the airframe as positive attributes for ground attack as well, accordingly Hawker tested and cleared the type to use {{a wide range of}} armaments and support equipment. Each aircraft had four wing-mounted 20mm Hispano V cannon, with up to 16 rocket projectiles, or a combination of 500lb or 1000lb bombs being carried too. Other loads included 1000lb incendiary bombs, mines, type 2 smoke floats or 90 gallon fuel tanks. [...] The Sea Fury could also be fitted with both vertical and oblique cameras and a dedicated <b>control</b> <b>box</b> in the cockpit, for photo reconnaissance missions. Other ancillary equipment included chaff to evade hostile missile attack and flares.|$|E

5000|$|The Cobalt Flux dance {{platform}} itself {{connects to}} a [...] "control box", which contains {{the start and}} select buttons for the dance controller. The connection to the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> uses a 15-pin serial connector which hangs {{out of the top}} of the pad as a dongle. This <b>control</b> <b>box</b> also handles the wiring needed for different gaming console connectors, which lead off of the <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is removable.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>control</b> <b>box</b> shipped with Cobalt Flux pads {{was designed}} to work only with the PlayStation 2; many home players {{wanted to use the}} pad with an Xbox or PC, but running this <b>control</b> <b>box</b> through converters for standard PS2 controllers usually caused an unacceptable amount of latency during play. Cobalt Flux has since released a new <b>control</b> <b>box</b> with built-in connectivity for PS2, Xbox, and the PC.|$|E
50|$|It is possible, with {{knowledge}} of the dance platform's pinout, to build your own <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> This is especially popular for the Xbox, as a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> built with the electronics from a soft dance pad will be properly recognized as a dance pad, not a controller.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} is to embed the control electronics into a solenoid valve enclosure removing {{the need for}} additional <b>control</b> <b>boxes.</b> In addition {{there is no need to}} change the control schematic as no dedicated components are required.|$|R
5000|$|The {{last two}} known {{original}} [...] "Sensurround Model-1" [...] <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> {{are owned by}} Dolby Laboratories. They are loaned on occasion for revival screenings of films using the process. At least one replica system exists, as it was custom built for a 2004 London revival screening of Earthquake. Sensurround Mod-II and Mod-III boxes are common and relatively easy to find from old theater equipment dealers and can be bought for $50 or so. The Mod-II and Mod-III boxes were mostly just modifications of the original <b>control</b> <b>boxes,</b> but the changes are not easily undone to make them capable of running Earthquake because MCA did all the modifications themselves and never released any documentation about the changes made to each circuit card in the unit.|$|R
