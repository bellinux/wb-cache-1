40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an early warning system that can predict the likelihood of the occurrence of financial stress events within a given period of time.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the applicability of methods {{that are based on}} the employment of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> when evaluating the 'sustainable development' and 'quality of live' indexes. The first issue observed in here is whether the <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> as such even represent a suitable tool for assessing the above mentioned area of analysis; if the answer is yes, then, secondly, under which conditions the <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> may be applied in the context of our analysis. After answering the questions above, it is crucial to find suitable methods for the particular steps of constructing the <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> for the sustainable development and quality of life categories, whereby it is also necessary to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the application of the selected <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> {{for the purposes of the}} respective analysis. Within this thesis, the comparison of individual methods of constructing the indicators was performed by means of applying the individual indicators on the established set of data, as well as a subsequent comparison of results and the assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the individual methods has been done with respect to the factual side of the particular <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> (i. e. with respect to the sustainable development and quality of life in our case). Various <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> for the quality of life and sustainable development have already been established; the necessity of composing additional <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> for the above mentioned categories reflects the problematic nature of finding a suitable tool that would be generally accepted in this case. This thesis provides for relevant conclusions and recommendations that should contribute to establish a suitable approach towards the construction of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> for the sustainable development and quality of life assessment. Furthermore, the thesis provides for the comparison of methods as employed in practical construction of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> in our context with methods based on a professional theory. The professional theory/literature addresses and recommends certain methods for the construction of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> in the relevant context, however, these methods are typically not applied in the practical construction of the most frequently/commonly used <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> for measuring the sustainable development and quality of life. The critical aspects that have been observed within comparison of the individual methods are transparency of calculation, interpretability of results, robustness of the <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> closely linked to the nature and character of the data, and the level of applicable compensation of the individual parameters within the respective indicator that is allowed by the particular aggregation mechanism employed. The thesis concludes on a rather questionable use of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> in case of assessing the sustainable development, whereby deduces on recommending the application of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> only in case of assessing the quality of life, which may also be understood as a part (sub-item) of the sustainable development and which is easier to be quantitatively expressed. In parallel, the circumstances of the quality of life are better to be compared across various items, e. g. regions. The results indicate that it is not possible to establish a uniform recommendation when selecting the most suitable method; in case of every construction of the particular <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> it is necessary to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of all the considered methods. At the same time, the results lead to consideration of relevancy of conclusions resulting from the evaluation of quality of life by means of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators,</b> especially by means of a single number...|$|R

40|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>indicators</b> play an {{essential}} role for benchmarking higher education institutions. One of the main sources of uncertainty building <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> and, undoubtedly, the most debated problem in building <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> is the weighting schemes (assigning weights to the simple indicators or subindicators) together with the aggregation schemes (final <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> formula).

The proposed methodology is general enough to be applied no matter the weighting scheme used for the <b>composite</b> <b>indicator.</b> The immediate benefit achieved is a reduction of the uncertainty associated with the assessment of a specific rank which is not representative of the real performance of the university, and an improvement of the quality assessment of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> used to rank.

40|$|This thesis {{brings a}} {{comprehensive}} {{view on the}} construction, usage and interpretation of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators.</b> Methods and techniques, {{which can be used}} for constructing <b>composite</b> <b>indicators,</b> are introduced. The focus is on their contribution to the transparent solution of the problem of correlation and compensability among underlying indicators. Transparency in construction of <b>composite</b> <b>indicators</b> is a crucial requirement for obtaining reliable results and their correct interpretation. The thesis consists of two main parts. The first part is theoretically oriented. First, the problem of adequacy and subsequently a measurement of the phenomenon by means of statistical indicators are discussed. Different methods for data normalization, setting a weighting scheme and aggregation are introduced and compared. These three steps are considered to be crucial in a process of constructing a <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> and thus, they are the core of the thesis. The aim is to investigate an interaction of normalization methods, weight-setting and aggregation methods, since these steps are not separate. The second part of the thesis consists of two comprehensive cases. Theoretical findings are applied and empirically verified in these cases. I investigated a robustness of the <b>composite</b> <b>indicator</b> depending on a combination of selected methods of normalization, setting weights and aggregation on a set of Europe 2020 indicators. Whereas this first case dealt with the comparative analysis of methods, the second case is focused purely on one issue [...] university ranking.
