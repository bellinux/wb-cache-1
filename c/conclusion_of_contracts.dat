5000|$|Under Article 102(d) [...] "tying" [...] {{is defined}} as [...] "making the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> subject to {{acceptance}} by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts." [...] Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in Microsoft v. Commission leading to an eventual fine of €497 million for including its Windows Media Player with the Microsoft Windows platform. A refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named Commercial Solvents. When it set up its own rival in the tuberculosis drugs market, Commercial Solvents was forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of private rules in exercising power in {{asymmetric}} business relationships. In asymmetric business relationships, the stronger party {{is likely to be}} able to dominate and exercise power over the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and, thereby determine the processes and outcomes of the relationship. The study demonstrates how companies exercise their power in asymmetric relationships through private rules. Private rules are typically expressed in the General Terms and Conditions of Trade (GTCT) of the more powerful actor in a business relationship and are continually adapted to changing business and market requirements. Drawing on an empirical investigation in the German grocery retail business conducted in the years between 2011 and 2013, the present study demonstrates that power is exercised by the stronger parties through intervention-enforcement-sanctioning practices that are codified in private rules. Private rules frame, standardize and legitimize the terms and conditions under which exchanges among counterparts may take place thus institutionalizing the inherent power asymmetry...|$|E
