40|$|We {{describe}} a real-time component-based system for an inspection application. We chose the inspection application {{and the accompanying}} task (or scenario) so that we might fully exercise and test our theories about real-time complex systems, system architectures, design methodologies, and software tools. We will describe the application, give a history and description of our system architecture and design methodology, describe the real-time software tools we used, and conclude {{with a discussion of}} real-time and object-oriented issues we faced. 1 The Inspection Application Our inspection workstation consists of a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), an analog 3 D <b>contact</b> <b>probe,</b> a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with frame grabber, and control computers. The CMM is Cartesian in the sense that axis motion and axis position sensing are along the three orthogonal axes. The <b>contact</b> <b>probe</b> and camera are mounted on the CMM arm. The software controller sends velocity commands to each of the three axis motors every 5 ms and it reads each of three axis positions every 2 ms. The axis velocity commands are converted to voltages by a digital-to-analog converter. The voltages drive the motors. Figure 1 shows the CMM arm, the part to be measured, the camera mounted on the arm, and the analog <b>contact</b> <b>probe.</b> The application is more fully described in [Messina 99].

40|$|In many delay {{tolerant}} applications, {{information is}} opportunistically exchanged between mobile devices who encounter each other. In order to effect such information exchange, mobile devices must have knowledge of other devices in their vicinity. We consider scenarios {{in which there}} is no infrastructure and devices must probe their environment to discover other devices. This can be an extremely energy consuming process and highlights the need for energy conscious <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> mechanisms. If devices probe very infrequently, they might miss many of their contacts. On the other hand, frequent <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> might be energy inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the probability of missing a contact and the <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> frequency. First, via theoretical analysis, we characterize the trade-off between the probability of a missed contact and the <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> interval for stationary processes. Next, for time varying contact arrival rates, we provide an optimization framework to compute the optimal <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> interval as a function of the arrival rate. We characterize real world contact patterns via Bluetooth phone contact logging experiments and show that the contact arrival process is self-similar. We design STAR, a <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> algorithm which adapts to the contact arrival process. Via trace driven simulations on our experimental data, we show that STAR consumes three times less energy when compared to a constant <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> interval scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Opportunistic mobile {{networks}} {{consist of}} mobile devices which only communicate when they opportunistically contact each other. Periodic <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> {{is required to}} facilitate opportunistic communication, but seriously reduces the limited battery life of mobile devices. Current research efforts on reducing energy consumption of <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> are restricted to optimize the probing interval, but are insufficient for energy-efficient opportunistic communication. In this paper, we propose novel techniques to adaptively schedule wakeup periods of mobile nodes between their inter-contact times. A node stays asleep during inter-contact times when <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> is unnecessary, and only wakes up when a contact with another node is likely to happen. Our approach probabilistically predicts node contacts in the future, and analytically balances between energy consumption for <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> and performance of opportunistic communication. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our approach significantly improves energy efficiency of opportunistic communication compared to existing schemes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In many {{potential}} {{wireless sensor network}} applications, {{the cost of the}} base station infrastructure can be prohibitive. Instead, we consider the use of mobile devices carried by people in their daily life to collect sensor data opportunistically. As the movement of these mobile nodes is, by definition, uncontrolled, <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> becomes a challenging task, particularly for sensor nodes which need to be aggressively duty-cycled to achieve long life. It has been reported that when the duty-cycle of a sensor node is fixed, SNIP, a sensor node-initiated probing mechanism, performs much better than mobile node-initiated probing mechanisms. Considering that the intended applications are delaytolerant, mobile nodes tend to follow some repeated mobility patterns, and contacts are distributed unevenly in temporal, SNIP-RH is proposed in this paper to further improve the performance of <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> through exploiting Rush Hours during which contacts arrive more frequently. In SNIP-RH, SNIP is activated only when the time is within Rush Hours and there are enough data to be uploaded in the next <b>probed</b> <b>contact.</b> As for the duty-cycle, it is selected based on the mean of contact length that is learned online. Both analysis and simulation results indicate that under a typical simulated roadside wireless sensor network scenario, SNIP-RH can significantly reduce the energy consumed for <b>probing</b> the <b>contacts,</b> that are necessary for uploading the sensed data, or significantly increase the <b>probed</b> <b>contact</b> capacity under a sensor node’s energy budget for <b>contact</b> <b>probing.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|In many {{emerging}} wireless {{sensor network}} scenarios, {{the use of a}} fixed infrastructure of base stations for data collection is either infeasible, or prohibitive in terms of deployment and maintenance costs. Instead, we consider the use of mobile devices (i. e. smartphones) carried by people in their daily life to collect data from sensor nodes opportunistically. As the movement of these mobile nodes is, by definition, not controlled for the purpose of data collection, synchronization through <b>contact</b> <b>probing</b> becomes a challenging task, particularly for sensor nodes, which need to be aggressively duty-cycled to conserve energy and achieve long lifetimes.

Hyperspectral remote sensing data and {{state of the}} art very high spatial resolution satellite data of- fer a great potential for assessing tree vitality. How- ever, {{a better understanding of the}} effects of vitality decrease and its impact on the spectral behaviour of needles is needed. Filling this knowledge gap can make a significant contribution to improve the in- terpretation of remote sensing data. However, it is still unclear which method for needle spectra col- lection is most suitable. In this work, two methods for spectral reflectance measurements of Norway spruce needles using portable spectroradiometers were tested and analysed: using a classical fore op- tic and a so-called <b>contact</b> <b>probe.</b> The spectral re- flectance data were evaluated with different statis- tical similarity measure techniques.

40|$|Evapotranspiration models require {{thermodynamic}} temperatures as a {{state variable}} characterizing the surface energy balance. The thermodynamic temperature is calculated using the brightness temperature and the emissivity because no effective method exists to measure thermodynamic temperatures in space and time. A method was therefore developed to measure thermodynamic temperatures in time using <b>contact</b> <b>probes</b> and spatial variations of the thermodynamic temperature using a thermal camera. Using an extraction scheme, the brightness temperatures of canopy and soil were extracted from the thermal images and compared with the contact temperatures. The contact temperatures had similar amplitudes and time-variability as the brightness temperatures for both components. The slope and offset parameters of a scatter plot were calculated. The slope of the scatter plot was lower than unity for canopy, and higher than unity for soil. Because of the spread in the scatter plot, the emissivities of the components could not be calculated. We conclude that kinematic temperature measurements by <b>contact</b> <b>probes</b> can be a valuable extension to current techniques for measuring continuous component temperatures. The extraction scheme could be {{a useful tool for}} extracting the component brightness temperatures for low-resolution imagery...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{ultrasonic}} techniques provide distinct {{advantages over}} conventional contact methods for process monitoring and on-line material characterization applications. 1 The {{most important of}} these is non-contact measurement capability. Non-contact measurement is particularly desirable in industrial environments where high temperatures or hazardous materials are involved. This latter subject is especially significant concerning the types of materials handled, processed, and inspected at Los Alamos National Laboratory where collateral contamination and generation of secondary low-level waste is a major issue. An important ramification of non-contact laser ultrasonic methods is the ability to probe materials that are in motion such as on a conveyor belt or a part being turned on a lathe. Indeed, this all-optical technology can allow corrective action to be taken during a material removal process before the ideal component geometry is irretrievably altered. Also, optical post-process inspection of fabricated parts are not subject to dimensional measurement errors typical associated with conventional <b>contact</b> <b>probes</b> such as probe wear and probe inclination relative to the surface. In contrast, laser generation of ultrasound offers relative insensitivity of the measurement to the incident optical beam inclination, and has the added benefit of averaging surface roughness effects; <b>contact</b> <b>probes</b> usually ride on the outermost surface profile...|$|R

Using this variation, we perform numerical simulations and find a larger sensitivity on random resistance variations for tandem- (pairs of current- and sense probes) compared to triplet (one sense- between two current probes) configurations.
