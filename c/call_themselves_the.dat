5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus that makes them aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E

25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|On 17 June, the Third Estate, {{led by the}} comte de Mirabeau, {{began to}} <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly.

25|$|The Fourth International {{split in}} 1953 into two public factions. The International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was {{established}} by several sections of the International as an alternative centre to the International Secretariat, in which they felt a revisionist faction led by Michel Pablo had taken power, and recommitted themselves to the Lenin-Trotsky Theory of the Party and Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution. From 1960, led by the US Socialist Workers Party, a number of ICFI sections began the reunification process with the IS, but factions split off and continued {{their commitment to the}} ICFI. Today, national parties committed to the ICFI <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Socialist Equality Party.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} home of {{the more}} vocal fans is considered the Gallowgate End, {{in the same vein}} as The Kop for Liverpool FC. The Gallowgate End was the end that the team attacked in the second half if they win the coin toss. In recent years there has been unofficial fan movement to create a singing section in the Leazes End upper tier, partly to counter the away fans, and partly to recreate some atmosphere lost since the recent expansion over 36,000. This group of fans <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> 'Toon Ultras'. Level 7 of the Milburn Stand houses the official Family Enclosure. Due to the expansion of the Family Enclosure, many fans from the singing section have relocated to the Strawberry Corner.|$|E
25|$|The Greening of Harlem Coalition {{is another}} example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is {{responsible}} for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities {{to be in touch with}} nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.|$|E
25|$|Around 1848 a {{group of}} volunteers from the Mexican–American War were {{eventually}} discharged and settled in San Francisco. Many of them were from New York City gangs from the Five Points and Bowery districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the Hounds, paraded around {{as if they were}} military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street. In 1849, these thugs began to <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Regulators as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services. Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after {{a group of}} 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, {{there are}} many new age {{travellers}} who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Peace Convoy. They started the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1974, but English Heritage later banned the festival in 1985, resulting in the Battle of the Beanfield. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual Glastonbury Festival. Today, hippies in the UK {{can be found in}} parts of South West England, such as Bristol (particularly the neighborhoods of Montpelier, Stokes Croft, St Werburghs, Bishopston, Easton and Totterdown), Glastonbury in Somerset, Totnes in Devon, and Stroud in Gloucestershire, as well as in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, and in areas of London and Brighton. In the summer, many hippies and those of similar subcultures gather at numerous outdoor festivals in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|Amber and Dal {{wander the}} streets when they stumble upon Cloe, Salene, Patsy and Paul. They are {{attacked}} by Lex, Ryan and Zandra and {{take refuge in}} a shopping mall where Jack has been living since his father died. Seeing the advantages the mall offers, they all decide to stay. Lex and Ryan agree to defend the newly formed tribe in exchange for shelter and food. They are soon joined by Bray and a heavily pregnant Trudy. Lex {{and the rest of}} the tribe members want Trudy gone, however Bray will not let them throw her out. Though the majority is against letting them stay, they change their mind once the baby is born. Everyone thinks that Bray is the father of Trudy's baby; however, Bray's brother, Zoot, is the father. Lex decides to <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Mall Rats in a bonding ritual performed by the newly arrived, spiritual Tai-San.|$|E
25|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{was born in}} Ohio and New York State in 1873 when local women, concerned about alcohol's influence on home life, met in churches for prayer and then embarked on visits to saloons to confront those they felt responsible. During {{the next couple of}} years, the movement caught fire, with women demanding that saloons cease selling alcohol. The women of Fredonia, New York were the first credited with visiting local saloons under the aegis of their leader Mrs. Esther McNeil and, on December 22, 1873 were the first to <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>the</b> Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Two days later, following a lecture at the Hillsboro, Ohio Music Hall the night before, the Crusade was born when Mrs. Eliza Thompson, a judge's wife and the daughter of a former governor, gathered 70 women in prayer at the Presbyterian Church and marched to the local saloons. Singing hymns as they went, the women demanded the saloons cease selling alcohol.|$|E
