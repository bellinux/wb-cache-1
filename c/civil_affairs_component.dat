50|$|During the 1990s small <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> were {{included}} {{in a number of}} missions, including those in Cyprus, Tajikistan and Georgia. At the end of that decade, major <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> were deployed to Kosovo and East Timor, to implement the executive mandates that were given to peacekeeping operations at that time. In these cases <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> found themselves mandated to establish effective administrations and to support capacity-building for self-government.|$|R
50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> are {{deployed}} in most peacekeeping missions {{led by the}} UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and are also a feature of many special political missions led by the Department of Political <b>Affairs.</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> Officers are usually deployed at the local level, where they serve as {{the link between the}} UN mission and local authorities and communities. <b>Civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> work countrywide to strengthen the social and civic conditions necessary to consolidate peace processes and are a core function of multi-dimensional peacekeeping operations. As of mid-2013, there were approximately 700 <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> Officers in 13 UN Peacekeeping Operations worldwide.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, for {{the first}} time, the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support {{developed}} and disseminated a policy directive that defines and conceptualizes the diverse work of <b>civil</b> <b>affairs.</b> This has provided {{the foundation for the}} development of this Handbook, as well as training and recruitment profiles to ensure that <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> are strong, well-trained and well planned, ready to address the challenges ahead.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the 2000s saw a surge in the {{deployment}} of large <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> to peacekeeping missions. Each one had its own unique focus and contribution to make in implementing peace mandates at the local level, but each was there to strengthen links to ordinary citizens, {{as well as to}} support the development of social conditions conducive to peace and provide an overall facilitation role locally.|$|R
50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>components</b> perform {{one or more}} {{of three}} core roles, {{depending}} on the UN Security Council mandate given to a particular peacekeeping mission. In each role the work of <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> intersects with, supports and draws upon the work of a variety of other actors. Depending on the mandate, the three core roles are 1) Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level; 2) Confidence-building, conflict management and support to reconciliation; and 3) Support to the restoration and extension of state authority.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{identified}} in the review of civilian capacities {{is the need to}} be able to better identify and support national capacities. As the review states: “The United Nations has seen success in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping, built on a strong partnership with Member States. But the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential for an enduring peace.”19 <b>Civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> have a key role to play in identifying and supporting national capacities, within civil society and local government, including through helping to ensure that voices from the local level are heard in nationally led peacebuilding processes.|$|R
50|$|Overall, in the {{evolving}} environment of {{international peace and}} security, a key asset of <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>components</b> is their agility and their capacity to respond flexibly to {{the wide range of}} demands and expectations within Security Council mandates. One aspect of this flexibility is their ability to direct their focus depending on the availability and presence of other international partners at the local level, particularly those with expertise in highly specialized areas. <b>Civil</b> <b>affairs</b> can {{play an important role in}} mobilizing these partners in places and at times where they are most needed. This is a cost-efficient model, given the prohibitive and unnecessary expense of having a full complement of specialized expertise available in each locality around the country at all times. It also helps to ensure that local-level support is need-driven, rather than simply provided because a particular service or resource happens to be available.|$|R
50|$|The {{qualification}} {{course is}} approximately one year long consisting of language training, culture training, and MOS specific training. Following graduation, officers {{are assigned to}} the 95th <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> Brigade (Airborne) or to the 85th <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> Brigade. Reserve <b>Component</b> officers are assigned directly to a Reserve <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> unit and attend language training, Airborne school, and other military schools through their home station unit.|$|R

50|$|Typically, a <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> {{battalion}} of any component will contain a headquarters company, and one <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> company for each maneuver brigade (four to six <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> tactical companies). Each <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> company contains <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> teams (known as CATs) which integrate at the maneuver battalion level. There will usually be one <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> team per maneuver battalion. In this manner, the division will have operational {{control over a}} <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> battalion, a brigade will have operational control over a <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> company and an infantry battalion will have tactical control over a <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> team.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Beginning with the United States (U. S.) Mexican War in 1846 {{and continuing to}} the most recent combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, United States military history has repeatedly shown the importance of <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> operations: that is, shaping the civil component of the operational environment. During this span, <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> operations have evolved from operations conducted only by combat units to those conducted by a dedicated <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force. The demand for <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> has increased significantly since September 11, 2001, and in response to that demand, the Army has attempted to grow the <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force in both the active and reserve components. The rapid growth in demand for <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> has {{led to the creation of}} a <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force composed of one active-duty <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> special-operations brigade, one active-duty <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> brigade for conventional forces, and nine reserve <b>civil</b> <b>affairs</b> brigades. The current <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force structure is subordinate to three commands: the U. S. Army Special Operations Command, U. S. Forces Command, and the U. S. Army Reserve Command. This thesis analyzes the current <b>Civil</b> <b>Affairs</b> force structure within the active and reserve components by using three metrics: training efficiency, organizational efficiency, and operational efficiency.
