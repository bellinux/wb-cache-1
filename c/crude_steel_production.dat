40|$|Production of {{iron and}} steel is an {{energy-intensive}} manufacturing process. The energy efficiency of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> has {{a direct impact on}} overall energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a methodology for accurately comparing the energy-related CO 2 emissions intensity of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in different countries and to demonstrate the application of this methodology in an analysis of the steel industry in China, Germany, Mexico, and the U. S. Emissions intensity values are often sought by policy makers who must decide questions related to energy, greenhouse gases, and competitiveness. Our methodology addresses the industry's boundary definition, conversion factors, and industry structure. The results of our analysis show that, for the entire iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> process, the base-case (2010) CO 2 emissions intensity was 2, 148 kilogram (kg) CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in China, 1, 708 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in Germany, 1, 080 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in Mexico, and 1, 736 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in the U. S. One of the main reasons that Mexico has the lowest CO 2 emissions intensity is Mexico's large share of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> using electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (69. 4 %). EAF <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> has lower CO 2 emissions intensity than production using blast furnaces/basic oxygen furnaces. China, by contrast, has the smallest share of EAF production among the four countries – 9. 8 % in the base-case year 2010. In one scenario, we applied the Chinese share of EAF production to the other three case-study countries; the result was an increase in CO 2 emissions intensity of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> of 19 % (2, 036 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in Germany, 92 % (2, 074 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in Mexico, and 56 % (2, 703 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in the U. S. compared to these countries' base-case analyses. In another scenario, we applied the Chinese national average grid electricity CO 2 emissions factor from 2010, which is the highest emissions factor among the four countries, to the other three countries. In that scenario, the CO 2 emissions intensity of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> increased by 5 % in Germany, 11 % in Mexico, and 10 % in the U. S. Additional scenarios were analyzed showing that when comparing the CO 2 emissions intensities of the steel industry in different countries, it is necessary to take into account the industry structure, especially the share of EAFs and the effect of electricity grid CO 2 emissions factors.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} how {{a global}} climate target may influence iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> technology deployment and scrap use. A global energy system model, ETSAP-TIAM, was used and a Scrap Availability Assessment Model (SAAM) {{was developed to}} analyse the relation between steel demand, recycling {{and the availability of}} scrap and their implications for <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> technology choices. <b>Steel</b> <b>production</b> using recycled materials has a continuous growth and {{is likely to be a}} major route for <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in the long run. However, as the global average of in-use steel stock increases up to the current average stock of the industrialised economies, global steel demand keeps growing and stagnates only after 2050. Due to high steel demand levels and scarcity of scrap, more than 50 % of the <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in 2050 will still have to come from virgin materials. Hydrogen-based <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> could become a major technology option for production from virgin materials, particularly in a scenario where Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is not available. Imposing a binding climate target will shift the <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> price to approximately 500 USD per tonne in the year 2050, provided that CCS is available. However, the increased prices are induced by CO 2 prices rather than inflated production costs. It is concluded that a global climate target is not likely to influence the use of scrap, whereas it shall have an impact on the price of scrap.

40|$|Analyses and/or {{scenarios}} of future industrial production, {{especially in the}} field of energy-intensive industries, can be useful for a variety of different task e. g. policy advice, energy demand modelling, resource availability/sustainability, and other. Especially future projection of the physical production differentiated on process level including the modelling of structural change and material strategies are of major importance to generate comprehensive and transparent scenario projections/results. In this context, another challenge is the modelling of this physical production in a hybrid model system, which means to link economic and demographic information provided by a macroeconomic model to the projection of physical production units, e. g. tonnes of an industrial branch. In this paper a short analysis of the historic <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> for selected European countries has been made, selected literature on material efficiency and recycling potentials is reported, and a methodology for the hybrid modelling of future <b>steel</b> use and <b>production</b> on process level as well as scrap availability is described. The paper shows that steel is an old energy-intensive product, facing a decreasing GDP intensity, with a trend to secondary production. This trend to secondary production makes the domestic scrap availability, but also trade in scrap and scrap quality an important factor which has to be considered when modelling future <b>steel</b> <b>production.</b> The developed methodology describes a comprehensive approach to translate macroeconomic sector information, e. g. economic value of an industry (gross value added), into apparent steel use/true steel use of a country and calculate its physical <b>production</b> of <b>crude</b> <b>steel,</b> electric steel, and oxygen steel considering structural change, prompt scrap availability, and end-of-life scrap availability on European level.
