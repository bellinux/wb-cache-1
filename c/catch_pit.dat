50|$|In Arådalen is the Swedish Tourist Association (STF)'s oldest tourist station. The first small {{building}} was already erected on 1895. The current tourist station was then built In 1909 {{and it is}} now open only in summer time. The land is owned by the Swedish Church, but the tourist station is operated by the STF. Along the station there is a chapel built in the 1970s and two huts. The chapel is of the Church of Sweden, which also owns a large area of Arådalen. The tourist station and the chapel are located very near the Angelika dammed lake. The name suggests that there are plenty of angelica (Angelica archangelica) in the area. In Arådalen there are private recreation houses, but not a lift system. In the western part lies the sameby (lapp camp) Glen with 4 four or five families. In {{the northern part of the}} valley is a long fence bulkt by the laps to handle the reindeers. The road to Arådalen was built years from 1964 to 1965. Prior to that time the area had no road. It is common to see reindeer with calves in the area. Glens lapp camp belongs to the Tossåsens sameby. The Glen Lake is reached by a short hike of 4 km in the unique natural landscape. The path to Glen Lake is lined by small cottage places where Sami long ago lived before they built their houses in Glen. You can also discover the old <b>catch</b> <b>pits</b> in the area. On the western side of the Glen Lake there is the beautiful mountain Baltere. The area lies in the prohibition zone for driving with scooters in winter time. Glen Lake is known for its fine trout stocks with a record of over 9 kg. Sizes around the 3-5 kg is not uncommon. The lake is about 4 km long with some deep holes of 40 - 50 m. The main fishing season is from the ice freezing up to the melting of the ice.|$|R
40|$|Background: Malaria is endemic {{in southeastern}} Iran {{including}} Jiroft district and in favorite epidemiological condition could threaten the people health. Anopheles fluviatilis complex is a malaria vector in Iran {{and consists of}} three species of S, T, and U and 7 genotypes of S, U, T 1, T 2, Y, X and V which are different in vectorial capacity. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify species composition of An. fluviatilis complex using D 3 and ITS 2 sequences in Jiroft district. Materials and Method: Mosquitoes of An. fluviatilis have been captured using total <b>catch,</b> <b>pit</b> shelter, and human/animal night baits. PCR amplification was done against the 28 S D 3 and ITS 2 -rDNA and the products were sequenced. The specimens were identified to species and genotype level using phylogenetic trees and comparison of sequences with entries available in GenBank. Results: Both ITS 2 and D 3 loci were successfully amplified and produced 514 bp and 376 bp bands respectively. Sequence analysis of ITS 2 and D 3 regions revealed that the specimens of Jiroft district were matching to the Y and T 2 haplotypes of species T of the complex. Conclusion: Anopheles fluviatilis T is the only species in the region and based on the previous studies can be incriminated as the main malaria vector in the regio...|$|E
40|$|District of Jiroft is {{situated}} in south-east of Iran {{which is one of}} the malarious regions. Anopheles stephensi is considered as one of the main malaria vector in this region. Ecology of this species was studied in the area to understand its vector behavior for implementation of effective vector control measures. Different methods like total <b>catch,</b> <b>pit</b> shelter, night bite collection on human and animal, larval dipping methods were used for species identification, seasonal activity, anthropophilic index and egg morphological characteristics. Anthropophilicity index was assessed by ELISA test. Activity of Anopheles species started at the beginning of April, and its peak occurs in late spring. The larvae were found in the river bed with pools, stagnant streams, slow foothill streams, temporary pools, and slowly moving water with and without vegetation, drainage containers of air conditioner and palm irrigation canals. From different methods of adult collection, it was found that spray sheet collection is the appropriate method. ELISA testing of 144 blood meals of females revealed the anthropophilicity of 11. 8 % indicating host preference on animal, mainly cow. Ridge length and their number on the egg floats confirmed Anopheles stephensi mysorensis form. This study showed that Anopheles stephensi is the main vector of malaria in the region, although some other species may play a role. Our findings could provide a valuable clue for epidemiology and control of malaria in the southeast of Iran...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Adult malaria vector {{sampling}} is {{the most}} important parameter for setting up an intervention and understanding disease dynamics in malaria endemic areas.

40|$|Part I Introduction and {{justification}} of the Monitor Building with Nature This report describes the Monitor Building with Nature in the IJsselmeer region. When {{it comes to}} implementing the concept of building with nature the main issue is not how it is technically possible, but whether stakeholders consider it possible and desirable. The monitor gives insight into perceptions of stakeholders and provides possibilities for improvements in decision making and in generating societal support for Building with Nature projects. The project that developed this monitor {{is part of the}} Building with Nature research and innovations programme. The monitor has the following goals: Describe the (changes in) perceptions and actions related to ‘building with nature’ in hydraulic engineering projects. Among which: 1. Describe the situation of the project {{at the start of the}} monitoring, include the history of the project, the broad context, the assignment of the project, and the (formal) involvement of stakeholders. 2. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities at project level (design, project management, process). 3. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities for building with nature within the external field of force. 4. Make an inventory of perceptions related to improvements and the involvement of the different stakeholders. The focus of the monitor is on perceptions of people who are involved in hydraulic engineering projects. For the development of the monitor, existing monitor approaches are used. The focus of the monitor is gathering of information and has characteristics of constructivist monitoring. However, the monitor aims to show the diversity of the available perceptions and actions. The focus of the monitor is not merely on ‘learning’, although when the monitor is used in meetings or workshops, it can contribute to learning about building with nature. The monitor is qualitative of nature, with implicit use of indicators. The monitor is one of the initiatives of monitoring within the Research programme Building with Nature. One other initiative is for example the monitoring of the Community of Practice in the IJsselmeer region. Part II The Monitor – Questionnaire In preparing for the use of the monitor, three main questions are to be asked. The first question is: what is the focus in the project? The second question is: who are the respondents and why? There are no universal criteria, nor are these desirable. And the third question is: how do we use the questionnaire? Are we interested in doing face to face interviews, or interviews by phone? How the questionnaire is used depends largely on the goal of the monitor and the resources (i. e. time, money, people) availableThe questionnaire consists of four different parts. Part A discusses issues related to building with nature within the project and deals with stakeholders’ perceptions of the concept. Part B discusses factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature. Part C is about placing issues on the agenda and possibilities for improvements. Part D rounds up the questionnaire. For analysing the results of the monitor the following elements compromise the framework of analysis: 1. Aspects perceived as characteristic for building with nature 2. Aspects of building with nature in the project 3. Best practices of building with nature according to respondents 4. Perceptions of factors and conditions which stimulate or obstruct building with nature. 5. Perceptions of the future and future possibilities for realizing building with nature 6. Perceptions of action perspectives to realize building with nature on large scale in multiple 7. projects in the IJsselmeer region. Part III The Monitor tested To test the monitor two projects were selected as pilots: the dike strengthening project Edam- Amsterdam and the silt <b>catch</b> <b>pit.</b> Applying the monitor in these projects has lead to an improved version of the monitor and lessons learned on how to apply the monitor. It was not possible to apply the monitor itself in the dike strengthening project, although the process was very useful. We found that interesting projects to apply the monitor also are subject to sensitive issues. Great concern is necessary to deal with these issues. Therefore, sensitive issues require more preparation time. In the project ‘silt catch pit’ we were able to apply the monitor and make a case description of the project. Applying the questionnaire and developing the case description lead to improvements of the monitor and recommendations on its use. On the development of the monitor, the following is concluded: •Applying the monitor results in a broad insight into the feasibility of the building with nature concept, factors which are of influence and insight into the decision making in building with nature projects. •It is recommended to have an exploratory interview before using the questionnaire. This is necessary to gain enough information relevant for the case description, gain permission to apply the monitor and get in contact with the relevant stakeholders. •Applying the monitor in the silt <b>catch</b> <b>pit</b> showed that it is very suitable to find factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature in projects. Because it was only possible to develop one pilot, we recommend to again reflect critically on the monitor when applied. •Sensitive issues may make a project an (more) interesting one for applying the monitor. However, it may be more difficult to acquire permission for application and it may require more time. During application of the monitor one should be aware of the issues. Demarcation of concepts is important for the sake of comparing results, as the questionnaires are used for different persons and in different moments in time •The questionnaire can be combined with workshops or meetings to stimulate the realization of the building with nature concept. •The case description is based on a monitor that is incomplete and is part of developing the monitor. Therefore the case description should not be used as a complete example and should be considered together with the conclusions and recommendations made...|$|E

Malaria {{transmission}} by anopheline mosquitoes was {{studied in}} a traditional tank-irrigation–based rice-producing village in the malaria-endemic low country dry zone of northcentral Sri Lanka during the period August 1994 –February 1997. Adult mosquitoes were collected from human and bovid bait catches, bovid-baited trap huts, indoor <b>catches,</b> and <b>pit</b> traps. Mosquito head-thoraces were tested {{for the presence of}} Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, and blood-engorged abdomens for the presence of human blood by ELISAs. House surveys were done at two-day intervals to record cases of blood film–confirmed malaria among the villagers. A total of 7, 823 female anophelines representing 14 species were collected. Trends in anopheline abundance were significantly correlated with rainfall of the preceding month in An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. subpictus, An. vagus, and An. varuna, but were not significant in An. culicifacies and An. peditaeniatus.

Abundance trends in other species did not correlate significantly with malaria. It was concluded that An. culicifacies was epidemiologically the most important vector in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} {{durability}} {{and efficacy of}} long lasting bed nets and distribution of malaria vector mosquitoes was conducted in the West district of Zanzibar between January-June, 2011. Mosquito collection and insecticide resistance testing was extended to Pemba island following initial work done by the Zanzibar Malaria Control Programme (ZMCP) indicating the occurrence of pyrethroid resistance on Pemba. Mosquito collections were done using indoor and outdoor methods (pyrethrum spray <b>catches,</b> artificial <b>pit</b> traps, and CDC light traps) from four randomly selected sites. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were used to conduct resistance testing on the mosquitoes and cone bioassays for bed nets evaluation. The study revealed that malaria vector mosquitoes collected on Pemba and Unguja islands from January – April, 2011, belonged to the Anopheles gambiae complex. Molecular identification showed that Anopheles arabiensis was the most prevalent sibling species followed by An. merus. Longitudinal studies with a wide geographical coverage are recommended to monitor changes over time on malaria species composition. Pyrethroid resistance was confirmed from Pemba island {{for the first time}} in the region following ZMCP assays. However, this was not the case on Unguja island where malaria vectors were found to be almost fully susceptible against the pyrethroids used for malaria control in Zanzibar. The results demand that a routine, systematic monitoring campaign for insecticide resistance is implemented so that the impact of control efforts across the islands can be predicted and understood. As a part of resistance management, the Zanzibar Malaria Control Programme has recommended a shift to bendiocarb (carbamate) for indoor residual spraying in a rotation system. Again the rotation of the insecticides may allow a reduction of selection pressure on pyrethroids. Following an evaluation of long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) in the field, > 66...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{find the}} fauna of Anopheles {{mosquitoes}} for control implementation in Jiroft, a {{southern city of}} Iran with subtropical climate and seasonal malaria transmission. Methods: Anopheles specimens from the various mountainous and plain villages in Jiroft area were collected during malaria transmission from 2006 to 2007. Different methods of collection including hand catch, night biting catch using animal and human bait, total <b>catch</b> and shelter <b>pit</b> and larval collection were performed using WHO methods. Results: In total, 365 larvae and 871 adult mosquitoes were colleted and identified using morphological characters and DNA sequence data. Faunistic investigation showed that Anopheles species including Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles superpictus (An. superpictus), Anopheles fluviatilis, Anopheles sergenti (An. sergenti), Anopheles pulchrrimus (An. pulchrrimus), Anopheles turkhodi and Anopheles dthali {{were found in the}} study area. An. sergenti, An. pulcherrimus and An. superpictus were reported {{for the first time in}} Jiroft. Conclusions: It can be concluded that several malaria species can be found in this region. In addition to the fauna, further investigation is required on the ecology and bionomics of Anopheline mosquitoes for the implementation of vector control as well as malariological survey in the region...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Biting {{behaviour}} of Anopheles funestus in Mutare and Mutasa districts, Zimbabwe, {{is little}} understood. An investigation {{was conducted to}} primarily compare indoor and outdoor biting behaviour of the mosquito, as well as blood meal sources and sporozoite rates. Methods: Monthly adult anopheline sampling was conducted from October 2013 to September 2014 using Centers for Disease Control light-traps, pyrethrum spray <b>catch</b> and artificial <b>pit</b> shelter methods. Mosquitoes sampled by light-traps {{were divided into two}} cohorts. In one cohort, traps were left overnight and mosquitoes were collected the following morning, while in the other set, mosquitoes were collected hourly from 1800 - 0600 hrs. Collected females were identified using morphological characters and categorised according to their abdominal status. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify An. funestus sibling species and blood meal sources. Infection rate was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Morphological identification showed that indoor and outdoor catches comprised Anopheles funestus (98. 3 %) and Anopheles gambiae s. l. (1. 7 %). Of the 2268 mosquitoes collected, 66. 2 % were caught by light-traps, and 33. 8 % were caught resting indoors and outdoors. Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae s. l. were trapped more abundantly indoors (68 %) than outdoors (32 %). Both indoor and outdoor An. funestus densities were higher in wet (4. 3) than dry season (1. 8). In Burma Valley and Zindi areas, An. funestus demonstrated variable nocturnal indoor and outdoor flight activity rhythms, with two peaks during the night; between 2200 - 2300 hrs and 0200 - 0400 hrs. Human blood index in An. funestus was 0. 64, with Plasmodium falciparum infection rate of 1. 8 %. Interpretation & conclusion: The present work highlighted important information on the host-seeking behaviour, blood meal sources and infection rates in An. funestus. The information would be helpful in improving the vector control strategies...|$|R
60|$|The {{thing was}} this: a wife he wanted, or rather money; for {{as for a}} woman, he could have whores enow at his whistle. But, as I said, he wanted money, and that must be got by a wife or no way; nor could he so easily get a wife neither, except he became an artist at the way of dissembling; nor would dissembling do among that people that could {{dissemble}} as well as he. But there dwelt a maid not far from him, that was both godly, and one that had a good portion, but how to get her, there lay all the craft. Well, he calls a council {{of some of his}} most trusty and cunning companions, and breaks his mind to them; to wit, that he had a mind to marry: and he also told them to whom; but, said he, how shall I accomplish my end; she is religious, and I am not? Then one of them made reply, saying, Since she is religious, you must pretend to be so likewise, and that for some time before you go to her. Mark therefore whither she goes daily to hear, and do you go thither also; but there you must be sure to behave yourself soberly, and make as if you liked the Word wonderful well; stand also where she may see you, and when you come home, be sure that you walk the street very soberly, and go within sight of her. This done for a while, then go to her, and first talk of how sorry you are for your sins, and show great love to the religion that she is of, still speaking well of her preachers and of her godly acquaintance, bewailing your hard hap that it was not your lot to be acquainted with her and her fellow-professors sooner; {{and this is the way}} to get her. Also you must write down sermons, talk of scriptures, and protest that you came a-wooing to her, only because she is godly, and because you should count it your greatest happiness if you might but have such a one. As for her money, slight it, it will be never the further off, that is the way to come soonest at it, for she will be jealous at first that you come for her money; you know what she has, but make not a word about it. Do this, and you shall see if you do not entangle the lass. Thus was the snare laid for this poor honest maid, and she was quickly <b>catched</b> in his <b>pit.</b>|$|R
