5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds.

Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the PPV show saw reDRagon (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish) {{defending}} the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero), Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida), and the Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Romero performed the Forever Clothesline (multiple corner clotheslines) and double clotheslines on his opponents. A series of dives {{out of the}} ring culminated in Kushida diving from the turnbuckles onto his opponents on the floor. Although Time Splitters followed with a neckbreaker-moonsault combination on Nick, the three-count for a pinfall was stopped at two. The Young Bucks started a Superkick Party (multiple superkicks) and continued with a Meltzer Driver (assisted Tombstone piledriver) on Koslov, but the pin was again broken up. ReDRagon took over with a backbreaker and diving knee drop on Shelley, a double arm DDT and wheelbarrow suplex on Matt, and a super falcon arrow by Fish on Nick. The first <b>Chasing</b> <b>the</b> Dragon kick/brainbuster combination attempt was countered by an inside cradle by Koslov for a two count, but the second <b>Chasing</b> <b>the</b> Dragon attempt succeeded; O'Reilly pinned Koslov to retain the title at 13 minutes and 1 second.|$|E
5|$|By October 1950, the United Nations (UN) {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of the}} Pusan Perimeter in the extreme south of Korea and begun an aggressive northward advance towards the Sino-Korean border, <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> retreating Korean People's Army (KPA). The US 1st Cavalry Division entered Pyongyang on 19 October, while the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) were rushing towards the Yalu River in all directions. As part of the Thanksgiving Offensive to end the war, Major General Frank W. Milburn, commander of the US I Corps, ordered the ROK 1st Infantry Division to secure the Sup'ung Dam on the Yalu River by advancing through Unsan.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E
5|$|French privateering {{attacks against}} American vessels, begun a year prior, caused the {{conflict}} between the United States and France. An American squadron under Commodore Thomas Truxtun had been sent to patrol the Caribbean waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in Constellation, his flagship, he met and engaged L'Insurgente. After <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> French ship through a storm, Constellation forced L'Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low.|$|E
5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were {{taking place in the}} United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field coursing of jackrabbits, which are members of the hare family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is said by the North American Coursing Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> hare.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{with the}} greater Hollywood tradition, every Bond film {{features}} chase scenes, usually {{more than one}} per film. Bond and his allies evade their pursuers {{in a wide variety}} of vehicles, including custom air- and watercraft, to trucks and even tanks and moon-buggies. Although most chase sequences feature Bond getting chased by the villains, such as the Aston-Martin DB5 in Goldfinger and the ski sequence in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, some feature Bond <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> villains, such as the tank pursuit in GoldenEye and all sequences in Casino Royale. As the Eon series has progressed, the chases have repeated themselves with some variations and have all increased in extravagance.|$|E
5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from a hunter who chased the earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables and grain instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> earth-cow as a hunter and finally milking her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{productions}} {{were intended}} to be shot in 16mm film, but both were shot in 8mm film instead and were completed only the morning before their debut. In order {{to pay off the}} debts of the productions, video copies of the animation were sold. Eng declares this as the first example of original video animation (OVA) predating Dallos. Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue originally designed the mecha that appears in the Daicon III clip <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> little girl for a Japanese edition of the military science fiction novel Starship Troopers novel in the early eighties.|$|E
5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: {{one who has}} been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle to escape from the police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E
5|$|The British commander, Captain George Martin, {{succeeded in}} <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> Spanish vessels into the rocky Conil Bay, where they {{surrendered}} {{after a brief}} engagement in which the Spanish suffered significantly higher casualties than the British. One of the Spanish ships, the Santa Elena, was subsequently wrecked on the shore, while the other, the Ninfa, was captured and later recommissioned into the Royal Navy. The treasure carried on board the frigates, however, had been removed by a Spanish fishing boat before the battle and so did not fall into British hands.|$|E

Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for his silence. Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents. Before returning to work, he murders the agent who arranged the accident. Mahone returns to his FBI field office, where he is informed by Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) that Internal Affairs is investigating him.|$|E
5|$|Pierce largely {{fell from}} the movie industry's public eye shortly {{after the release of}} Boggy Creek II. In 1987, he {{directed}} Hawken's Breed, a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman. While shooting that film, Pierce met the woman who became his second wife, Beth Pulley. In 1996, he directed Renfroe's White Christmas, an adaptation of the classic children's book Renfroe's Christmas. Starting in 1997, he began production on his western film <b>Chasing</b> <b>the</b> Wind (1998), a gritty epic about a mountain man. It proved to be Pierce's final directorial effort, although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver, Remington Steele, The Twilight Zone and Fresno, a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas. Pierce's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 9 July 1806 {{was a minor}} {{engagement}} {{between a}} French privateer frigate and British forces off Southern Ceylon during the Napoleonic Wars. French privateers operating from the Indian Ocean islands of Île Bonaparte and Île de France were {{a serious threat to}} British trade across the Indian Ocean during the Wars, and the British deployed numerous methods of intercepting them, including disguising warships as merchant vessels to lure privateers into unequal engagements with more powerful warships. Cruising near the Little Basses Reef on the Southern coast of Ceylon, the 34-gun privateer Bellone was sighted by the 16-gun British brig HMS Rattlesnake, which began <b>chasing</b> <b>the</b> larger French vessel. At 15:15, a third ship was sighted to the south, which proved to be the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Powerful, disguised as an East Indiaman.|$|E
