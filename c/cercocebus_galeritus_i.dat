40|$|ABSTRACT The {{morphology}} of the humerus and femur {{was examined}} in three mangabey species (Cercocebus albigena, <b>Cercocebus</b> torquatus, <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus)</b> and three guenon species (Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus mona, Cercopithecus aethiops). Cercocebus albigena, Cercopithecus mitis and Cercopithecus mona are strictly arboreal whereas <b>Cercocebus</b> torquatus, <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus</b> and Cercopithecus aethiops are more frequently utilize terrestrial substrates. Morphological differences, which presumably reflect different positional behaviors, were found within both Cercocebus and Cercopithecus genera. The arboreal Cercocebus albigena {{differs from the}} more terrestrial Cercocebus torquatus and <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus</b> in having more mobile joints and more gracile bones. In Cercocebus torquatus and <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus,</b> joint movements tends to be restricted to the parasagittal plane emphasizing the economy of parasagittal excursion of the limbs. Similar tendencies were observed between the arboreal Cercopithecus mitis and Cercopithecus mona and the semi-terrestrial Cercopithecus aethiops.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the humerus and femur {{was examined}} in three mangabey species (Cercocebus albigena, <b>Cercocebus</b> torquatus, <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus)</b> and three guenon species (Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus mona, Cercopithecus aethiops).

Morphological differences, which presumably reflect different positional behaviors, were found within both Cercocebus and Cercopithecus genera. The arboreal Cercocebus albigena {{differs from the}} more terrestrial Cercocebus torquatus and <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus</b> in having more mobile joints and more grecile bones. In Cercocebus torquatus and <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus,</b> joint movements tends to be restricted to the parasagittal plane emphasizing the economy of parasagittal excursion of the limbs. Similar tendencies were observed between the arboreal Cercopithecus mitis and Cercopithecus mona and the semi-terrestrial Cercopithecus aethiops. However, the morphological distinctions, associated to arboreality vs. terrestriality, are not identical between Cercopithecus and Cercopithecus. Semi-terrestrial mangabeys exhibit stronger adaptations for terrestrialiy by comparison with the semi-terrestrial guenon. While the postcrania of the arboreal mangabey seem to be adaptive for deliberate movements in trees, those of the arboreal guenons suggest more rapid and agile activities. In addition, the arboreal Cercopithecus mona exhibits features related to leaping, which are {{not found in the}} more deliberately moving Cercopithecus mitis. Despite these differences, the common morphotype of the humerus and femur in the Cercopithecinae is exhibited in both Cercocebus and Cercopithecus, contrasting with the morphology shown by other primates (Colobinae, Hominoidea and Cebidae). The cercopithecine morphotype is characterized by the restriction of joint movements for economical fore-aft excursions of the limbs. Both the large-bodied cebids and apes exhibit a morphotype that allows greater mobility of the joints involving axial rotations and abduction. The humerus of apes is further characterized by specializations for suspensory positional behaviors. The morphotype of the limb bones of the Colobinae differs from that of the Cercopithecinae in having less restricted joint movements. However, the morphotypes of these two subfamilies show a greater similarity to each other than to those of large-bodied cebids and apes. It is presumed that positional behaviors of ancestral cercopithecids involved parasagittal excursions of the limbs...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigated}} the ecological correlates of abundance in the Tana mangabey (<b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus),</b> {{one of the}} world’s most endangered primates, {{with the goal of}} recommending management strategies. I systematically selected 31 forest fragments throughout the mangabey’s 60 -km distribution along the lower Tana River in southeastern Kenya. Within the 31 fragments, I measured vegetation structure, food abundance, and human forest product use in 107 belt transects, and conducted 370 mangabey surveys. I used a weighted multiple regression analysis to determine whether there was a dependence between the selected forest attributes and the mean number of mangabey groups per fragment. Fragment area and density of treesZ 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were the only variables that significantly correlated with the variation in mangabey abundance. No additional variables were significant when the analysis was limited to forest fragments inside the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) or to fragments outsid...|$|R
50|$|Density {{estimates}} of apes and elephants have been {{calculated from the}} park. Comparison of these results and of data obtained elsewhere using the same methodology shows that Odzala has high densities of both of these species; the open canopy Marantaceae forests have a particularly high gorilla density, and closed canopy Marantaceae forests have a high chimp density. It is probable that the Marantaceae itself is an important keystone resource in Odzala, as has already been proposed for Lopé National Park in Gabon. The riverine forests are used by all eight monkey species which occur in the park, and four of these are never or rarely seen in forests of terra firma (Cercopithecus neglectus, Miopithecus talapoin, Colobus guereza, <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus).</b> The rivers and marsh forests are also important for other species such as hippo, chevrotain, sitatunga, Nile monitor, dwarf forest crocodile and Crocodylus cataphractus, and the marshy clearings mentioned above are also {{very important for the}} large mammals of the region.|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} on a free ranging group of Tana River mangabeys (<b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus)</b> indicates that this endangered primate species, which {{has previously been}} regarded as a seed predator, {{plays an important role}} in seed dispersal and do contribute to the regeneration of a highly fragmented gallery forest. We observed fruit handling behavior and the post-dispersal fate of seeds ingested by the mangabeys. The two main fruit handling behaviors observed, fruit swallowing and processing fruits in cheek pouches, positively contributed to seed disper- sal. Seed predation was not common during this study, apart from a few particular plant species such as Acacia robusta and Alangium salviifolium with non-fleshy fruits. We found a correlation between seed predation and fruit availability, respectively seasonal differential specific dispersal efficiency. The role of the mangabeys in dispersing seeds and facilitating forest regeneration is enhanced by their movement across forest patches through non-forested matrix, which contributes to the deposition of seeds and regeneration in these habitat gaps...|$|R
40|$|Many {{individual}} {{researchers have}} used line transect counts to estimate forest primate abundance. They have devoted {{less attention to}} the interpretation of line transect data obtained by several observers, {{as is often the}} case in long-term monitoring programs. We present primate relative abundance data that 5 observers collected over 6 yr (not continuous) along 4 different transects each 4 km long in the Mwanihana Forest, Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Total distance walked during transect repetitions is ca. 700 km. The species we saw most frequently was the endemic Udzungwa red colobus Procolobus gordonorum (mean 0. 59 groups/km walked), followed by the Angolan black-and-white colobus Colobus angolensis (0. 43 groups/km) and Sykes's monkey Cercopithecus mitis (0. 35 groups/km). We sighted the endemic Sanje mangabey <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus</b> sanjei and the yellow baboon Papio cynocephalus infrequently, the latter being confined to the deciduous forest parts of the transects. We analyzed sighting frequency by gross habitat type, transect, season, and observer. Interobserver differences in the relative abundance of each species were moderate and the few cases of significant variations were due to discordance of only 1 observer from the others. Estimated distances of primate group sightings differ significantly among observers, thus preventing us from deriving estimates of absolute density. Frequency distributions of distance-class intervals are not significantly different among observers, which may indicate gross interobserver consistency in the width of the area sampled. We conclude that unless consistency in data collection is checked, as we did for 2 observers who collected data simultaneously, potential interobserver differences remain an underlying source of variance in the results that cannot be separated from other sources of variance. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based in Tana River National Primate Reserve (TRNPR), Kenya. The reserve, {{established}} in 1976 to protect remnant patches of riverine forests from increasing human pressure is home to two endemic endangered primate subspecies, Tana River Red colobus (Colobus badius rufomitratus) and Tana River Crested mangabey (<b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus</b> galeritus). Habitat encroachment through indigenous farming and forest uses {{was thought to be}} one of the causes of drastic colobus and mangabey population decline after 1975. This study aimed at; generating information on the impact of these human land-uses on the habitat, this would facilitate the preparation of management recommendations which would improve the chances of survival of primate habitats without compromising the welfare of indigenous people. Using 3 sets of aerial photographs and a geographic information system, information on land-use changes over time has been generated. A 3 month field work generated information on agriculture, forest uses and other relevant socio-economic information. Results from the study indicate that: (i) human population has increased by more than two-folds between 1969 and 1991; (ii) this has not corresponded to a net increase in forest area decrease or farm area increase; (iii) there has been a net increase in area under forest and decrease in area under agriculture; (iv) spatial and temporal changes in forest area explain colobus population crash observed between 1975 and 1985, (v) indigenous farmers interviewed prefer a compromise, where they are allowed controlled access to land within the reserve. They showed a keen knowledge of conservation costs and benefits and cause-effect processes between humans and the environment. Management recommendations advocate measures that encourage indigenous people to be partners in conservation...|$|R
40|$|WOS:A 1985 ASN 8900003 International audienceA one-month {{survey was}} carried out in Zaïre in order to clarify the {{distribution}} of Allenopithecus nigroviridis and describe the main ecological features ofthe area. The species was abundant in the districts of Mbandaka, Géména, Mondombé and Lisala. Moreover it is known from the Kasongo-Lundo district : consequently its southern limit should be extended to 6 ° 30 S instead of the previously quoted limit of 3 ° S. Allenopithecus troops were observed in swamp forests near Mbandaka. Troops were large (more than 40 members) and had a multi-male structure. Their sleeping sites were situated on river banks and the same sites appeared to be occupied regulariy. Alle nopithecus troops associated with Cercopithecus ascanius troops. Moreover commensal troops are known near villages. These monkeys are semi-terrestrial and exhibit a strong size dimorphism in favor of males. Apart from these two latter characteristics, the main socioecological features of Allenopithecus are strongly reminiscent of those of M. talapoin. The species composition of Cercopithecine communities living in inundated forests in N-E Gabon and Central Zaïre are very similar. In both areas,Cercopithecus neglectus is abundant and equivalent species belonging to the same superspecies are generally found in each habitat. However in the study area, we did not find any member of the superspecies nictitans nor of <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus,</b> while A. nigroviridis seemed to replace M. talapoin. The local absence of the s:'mi-terrestrial mangabey raises the question of its sympatrywith Allenopithecus : although their distributions overlap extensively, the twospecies may not in fact occupy the same habitat.

40|$|Aim Phylogenetics has an {{important}} role in conservation biogeography. However, there are few data on the phylogenetic diversity of African primates. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a species is a measure of its taxonomic distinctness and can be estimated by looking at the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Species-specific metrics on PD can then be used to determine conservation priorities at various biogeographical scales. We used PD metrics to rank 55 African primate species according to their conservation priorities at the country level and within six African biogeographical regions. We also addressed the following question: are there differences in conservation rankings between the IUCN Red List and our PD metrics? Location Africa. Methods We created a consensus phylogeny for all African primate clades based on genetic studies. Analyses of species distributions were determined using presence/absence scores at two levels: country and biogeographical region. A node-based method that standardizes for widespread taxa and endemicity was used to calculate PD indices. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to convert one of the standardized, phylogenetic indices into three clusters that could be ranked and compared with the main IUCN conservation rankings of endangered, vulnerable, and lower risk. Results At the country and region levels, the top-priority species in terms of PD are Pan paniscus, Macaca sylvanus, Arctocebus calabarensis, Gorilla beringei, Arctocebus aureus, Allenopithecus nigroviridis, Gorilla gorilla, Procolobus verus, Cercopithecus solatus, <b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus,</b> Colobus angolensis, Theropithecus gelada, Galagoides zanzibaricus, Galagoides granti, and Procolobus (Piliocolobus) badius. Geographic rankings were highest for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (country level) and Central Africa (region level). Although there were no overall differences between IUCN conservation ranks and the PD rankings, there were {{significant differences between the two}} systems for vulnerable and endangered primate taxa. Main conclusions There are few ecological and behavioural data on populations of some of the African primates that represent the highest levels of phylogenetic diversity. Studies of primate taxa with high PD rankings should focus on identifying sites suitable for intensive studies of population densities, feeding ecology, and reproductive behaviour. We suggest that PD metrics can serve as {{an important}}, complementary data set in the IUCN ranking system for primates...|$|R
50|$|The {{most diverse}} class of prey {{in the diet}} as known are mammals, with over 90 {{mammalian}} prey species reported. In the Cape Province, the 2.1 kg cape hare (Lepus capensis) reportedly dominates the prey selection, comprising about 53% of the foods selected. Other lagomorphs, namely the slightly smaller Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupestris), mildly larger African savanna hare (Lepus microtis) and the much larger 3.6 kg scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), are not infrequently taken both in {{and outside of the}} Cape area, but lagomorphs are not typically the main prey elsewhere. For the most part rodents are ignored as prey as they are probably too small despite martial eagles taking at times appreciable numbers of Cape (Xerus inauris) and unstriped ground squirrels (Xerus rutilus). However, rodents selected as prey have ranged in size from the 0.14 kg Southern African vlei rat (Otomys irroratus) to the 3.04 kg South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) and the 4 kg greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). There are records of predation on 0.28 kg (the second largest African bat) straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and galagos of various sizes (usually weighing a kilo or less) but otherwise mammalian prey they pursue tends to be relatively larger.Locally, large numbers are taken of any species of hyrax. The attractiveness of hyraxes as a prey resource may encourage martial eagles to vary their hunting techniques to potentially more time-consuming perch hunting so that they may capture rock hyraxes from rock formations and tree hyraxes from trees, contrary to their usual preference for capturing prey {{on the ground in the}} open after soaring high. Ranging in average mass from 2.2 to 3.14 kg, hyraxes can comprise a healthy meal for a family of martial eagle and are probably among the larger items that male eagles will regularly deliver to nests. Another miscellaneous mammal known to fall prey to martial eagles is the ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), although it is not clear the age pangolins that are preyed on and how they are dispatched, considering that adults weigh some 11.6 kg and have a hard keratin shell that is capable of withstanding lion (Panthera leo) jaws when in its rolled-up defensive posture. Although far less accomplished and prolific as a predator of monkeys than the crowned eagle, the martial eagle has been known to prey on at least 14 species of monkey. The monkeys to turn up most often as martial eagle prey are grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and malbroucks (Chlorocebus cynosuros), with mean body masses of 2.8 kg, 4.12 kg and 4.53 kg, respectively, because of their savanna-woods dwelling habits, tendencies to forage on the ground and their primarily diurnal activity. Similarly, the larger Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), at 8.13 kg, also dwells in similar habitats and so may be subject to occasional predaceous attacks. There’s evidence that these monkey species have specific alarm calls, distinct from those uttered in response to the presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) for example, specifically for martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to prey on mangabeys, Cercopithecus sp., colobus monkeys and guerezas, presumably around forest clearings, but these are probably quantitatively rare as prey given their forest-dwelling habits. Predatory attacks by martial eagles have been reported as well for every species of baboon, although either mostly or entirely on young ones, and even on young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). It has been claimed that juvenile monkeys are the most often selected as prey by martial eagles, even for species as small as vervet monkeys but little comprehensive analysis is known on this (the most accomplished primate predator, the crowned eagle, in Uganda, selects adult monkeys 52% of the time, juveniles 48% of the time). On the hand, at times, martial eagles may at times be able to dispatch adult male monkeys weighing 9 kg or more, such as patas monkeys and Tana River mangabeys (<b>Cercocebus</b> <b>galeritus),</b> in seldom cases.|$|R
