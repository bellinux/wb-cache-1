25|$|Iron smelting—the {{extraction}} of usable metal from oxidized iron ores—is {{more difficult than}} tin and copper smelting. While these metals and their alloys can be <b>cold-worked</b> or melted in relatively simple furnaces (such as the kilns used for pottery) and cast into molds, smelted iron requires hot-working and can be melted only in specially designed furnaces.

40|$|Effect of {{different}} levels of oversize element, cerium, on radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in type 316 stainless steel was investigated. The effect of prior <b>cold-work</b> on RIS was also investigated. Samples with 0. 00, 0. 01, and 0. 04 wt. % cerium were irradiated to 0. 70 dpa using 4. 8 MeV protons at 300 A degrees C. Characterization of proton-irradiated specimens was carried out using electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) test followed by atomic force microscopic examination. The specimen with prior <b>cold-work</b> (without cerium addition) showed the lowest EPR values indicating the lowest chromium depletion in this material. The specimen with 0. 04 wt. % cerium showed the lower EPR value {{as compared to the}} specimen with 0. 01 wt. % Ce. The irradiated specimen with prior <b>cold-work</b> showed linear features after the EPR tests and such features were attributed to decoration of dislocations, generated due to prior <b>cold-work,</b> by point defects produced during irradiation.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} is {{the main}} indicator of technological performances of a component for electrical discharge machining (EDM). EDM process of manganese alloyed <b>cold-work</b> tool steel was modelled. In this paper we used the fuzzy logic (FL) and neural network (NN) to predict the effect of machining variables (discharge current and pulse duration) on the surface roughness of manganese alloyed <b>cold-work</b> tool steel {{in order to improve}} and increase its range of application. The experiments are carried out on manganese alloyed <b>cold-work</b> tool steel, processed with electrodes made of copper.

25|$|Between 10,800 and 9500 BCE, the {{continental}} glaciers retreated {{north of the}} Great Lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods occurred during the melt outflow. Flooding disturbed archaeological layers of lithics and ceramics in the alluvium of the south branch of the Potomac at the Romney bridge replacement archaeological site. Early Lake Erie, which was Lake Michigan and Lake Erie combined, flowed west out from Little River (Great Black Swamp proglacial lake's drainage embayment) and the Wabash River, before changing direction to the east into Glacial Lake Iroquois. Earlier sediments built up event outbursts, near the Little River, more than once which altered the drainage direction and the remaining Great Black Swamp. 3000 years ago, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie assumed their present shapes. Lake Erie's water level was similar to Lake Nipioing phase of Lakes Michigan and Huron basins 5,000 years ago. By 3500 years ago, the level had lowered by four meters and by 2000 years ago the level had increased to possibly five meters above today's levels. The Hopewell culture arrived from the north in west central Ohio and Indiana at least 2000 years ago. Earlier trading peoples also from the north, a vanguard Armstrong variant, in southwest West Virginia mingled peacefully with Late Adena peoples. <b>Cold-worked</b> copper from the pits in Wisconsin Old Copper Complex region {{have been found in}} some Adena mounds. The Upper Ohio Valley was experiencing the Sub-Atlantic climatic phase (3000–1750 years ago) of warm and moist climatic conditions and stable stream levels upon the occurrence of the Hopewell culture. This climatic phase began after the much earlier appearance of indigenous Early Adena Culture (1735 BCE) in West Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{was born}} to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border {{of the state of}} Georgia. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by <b>Cold-Worked</b> and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, <b>cold-worked</b> and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are [...] "rather imperfect", that annealing caused [...] "no appreciable change" [...] in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the mass absorption coefficient of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using Compton's empirical formula.|$|E

Because dislocation motion is hindered, plastic deformation cannot occur at normal stresses. Upon application of stresses just beyond the yield strength of the non-cold-worked material, a <b>cold-worked</b> material will continue to deform using the only mechanism available: elastic deformation, the regular scheme of stretching or compressing of electrical bonds (without dislocation motion) continues to occur, and the modulus of elasticity is unchanged.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pre-ageing}} deformation {{on the size}} and distribution of beta-prime precipitates and subsequently on the resulting strength and ductility have been measured in a Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn- 0. 5 at. %Y alloy. The alloy was extruded and then subjected to a T 8 heat treatment comprised of a solution-treatment, <b>cold-work</b> and artificial ageing. Extrusion was used to introduce texture, ensuring that deformation occurred via slip rather than twinning. Samples were subjected to controlled uniaxial deformation and then isothermally aged to peak hardness. Precipitate length, diameter and number density were measured and evaluated {{in terms of the}} strength and ductility of the alloy. The nucleation of the beta-prime precipitates in peak-aged condition without pre-ageing deformation (i. e. T 6 treatment) was poor, with only 0. 5 % volume fraction, compared to approximately 3. 5 % in T 6 treated binary Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn alloy. The microstructure of the Mg-Zn-Y alloy was less refined, with larger diameter precipitates and lower beta-prime number densities compared to a binary Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn alloy. Deformation to 5 % plastic strain increased the volume fraction of beta-prime precipitates to approximately 2. 3 % and refined the beta-prime precipitate length and diameter. The combination of these effects increased the yield strength after isothermal ageing from 217 MPa (0 % <b>cold-work)</b> to 287 MPa (5 % <b>cold-work).</b> The yield stress increased linearly with reciprocal interparticle spacing on the basal and prismatic planes and the alloy showed similar strengthening against basal slip to Mg-Zn. The elongation increased linearly with particle spacing. The ductility of Mg-Zn-Y alloys was similar to that of Mg-Zn for equivalently spaced particles.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>cold-work</b> and of 3 MeV {{electron}} irradiation {{on the internal}} friction and the shear modulus of polycrystalline copper was measured at 1 Hz. The general features of {{the results will be}} briefly discussed. Figure 1 a gives the decrement as a function of temperature for the undeformed sample, the sample after 7 % <b>cold-work</b> at 78 °K, and the annealed sample. The main structure of the curve after deformation (filled circles) is the peak P 2 at about 160 °K. The peak temperature is shifted to lower values by increasing plastic deformation and can be related to the dislocation density of the samples. For temperatures above 200 °K there is no pronounced structure, several damping processes seem to increase the background without yielding well-defined peaks. In particular, we cannot resolve that relaxation process, that was interpreted to be due to the relaxation of the -split interstitial. Figure 1 b gives the corresponding decrement curves for a sample irradiated with 3 MeV electrons at 100 °K up to a defect concentration of 3 x 10 - 7. Between 120 °K and 330 °K the difference between the irradiated and the unirradiated sample gives a very broad peak. A 10 min. anneal at 360 °K reduces the radiation-induced increase of decrement completely above 100 °K, and the curve of the unirradiated sample is reproduced. The fact that here the irradiation increases the internal friction does not fit the commonly accepted views on dislocation damping. It must be assumed that the point defects themselves or in interaction with dislocations produce this very broad peak. This smeared-out increase of internal friction due to electron irradiation is very similar to that after <b>cold-work,</b> as can be seen by comparing the full-circle-curves in figure 1 a and 1 b...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cold-work</b> {{tool steel}} is {{considered}} to be a nonweldable metal due to its high percentage content of carbon and alloy elements. The application of a new process of the semisolid joining of two dissimilar metals is proposed. AISI D 2 <b>cold-work</b> tool steel was thixojoined to 304 stainless steel by using a partial remelting method. After thixojoining, microstructural examination including metallographic analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Vickers hardness tests was performed. From the results, metallographic analyses along the joint interface between semisolid AISI D 2 and stainless steel showed a smooth transition from one to another and neither oxides nor microcracking was observed. Hardness values obtained from the points in the diffusion zone were much higher than those in the 304 stainless steel but lower than those in the AISI D 2 tool steel. The study revealed that a new type of nonequilibrium diffusion interfacial structure was constructed at the interface of the two different types of steel. The current work successfully confirmed that avoidance of a dendritic microstructure in the semisolid joined zone and high bonding quality components can be achieved without the need for force or complex equipment when compared to conventional welding processes...|$|R
