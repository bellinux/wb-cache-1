Reportedly, King Philip VI of France wanted to execute Salisbury and Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, who {{was captured}} with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> handy in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released on parole in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E

For example, from the 1910s to the 1970s, use of a {{turnbuckle}} cast, which used metal turnbuckles to twist two halves of the cast so as to forcibly straighten the spine before surgery, was common. The turnbuckle cast had no single configuration, and could be {{as small as a}} body jacket split in half, or could include the head, one or both legs to the knees or feet, and/or one arm to the elbow or wrist depending on the choice of the doctor.|$|E

When the Frenchman viewed the heaped-up corpses of his familiars and friends, he asked Menéndez to send a gentleman to Ribault to inform him of what had occurred; and he even requested Menéndez to go in person to treat about securities, as the Captain-General was fatigued. Menéndez told him to tell Ribault that he gave his word that he <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> safety with five or six of his companions.|$|E
25|$|Policarpa's {{operations}} ran {{smoothly and}} undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information {{back to the}} insurgents outside Bogotá. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers desert the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in Machetá. They had hoped their connection with La Pola <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> handy {{in the event of}} a revolt in the city.

25|$|At the 1884–85 Berlin Conference {{and related}} {{bilateral}} negotiations between Britain and Belgium, the land west {{and north of}} the Luapula River−Lake Mweru system (Katanga) was allocated to the Congo Free State while the land {{to the east and}} south was allocated to Britain and the BSAC. However the agreements included a Principle of Effectivity under which each colonial power had to set up an effective presence in the territory—by obtaining treaties from local tribal chiefs, flying their flag, and setting up an administration and police force to keep order—to confirm the claim. If they did not, a rival <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and do so, thereby 'legally' taking over the territory {{in the eyes of the}} civilized powers. In 1890 neither colonial power had treaties or an effective presence in Katanga, and as reports came of gold and copper being found in Katanga, the stage was set for a race between the BSAC and Free State.|$|E

When Éxarchos' mother heard the news she was infuriated. On Easter Sunday when {{everyone}} in Skoutari was at church she started calling the men women for not avenging her son's death. So the men of Skoutari under the command of Zanet dressed up as priests went to the Ottoman castle of Passavas, and asked the commander if they <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and bless the castle. The commander agreed, and once all the men were inside, they took out their hidden weapons and slaughtered everyone inside the walls. None of the Ottomans made it out alive. After the massacre, Passavas was abandoned and never inhabited again. The Ottomans then tried to destroy Zanet in 1803 and 1807. The Ottomans tried to subdue Mani again in 1815 by capturing Skoutari but the men of Skoutari beat back the attack and in 1821 the rest of Greece declared their independence from the Ottomans.|$|E

500|$|For thunderstorms, outflow {{tends to}} {{indicate}} {{the development of a}} system. [...] Large quantities of outflow at the upper levels of a thunderstorm indicate its development. [...] Too much outflow in the lower levels of a thunderstorm, however, can choke off the low-level inflow which fuels it. [...] Squall lines typically bow out the most, or bend the most convex outward, at the leading edge of low level outflow due to the formation of a mesoscale high-pressure area which forms within the stratiform rain area behind the initial line. [...] This high-pressure area is formed due to strong descending motion behind the squall line, and <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the form of a downburst.|$|E
500|$|Every known type of {{eruption}} (Hawaiian, Strombolian, Plinian, subplinian, phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and Vulcanian) {{has occurred}} {{at some point}} in the range. Cerro Azul itself has experienced phreatic, Strombolian, and Plinian activity in human history. The type of eruption tends to correspond with lava composition. Strombolian eruptions at Llaima, Antuco, Villarrica, and elsewhere have been produced by basaltic to basaltic–andesitic activity. Dacitic to rhyolitic lavas have been linked to subplinian and Plinian eruptions, such as those at Quizapu (1932) and Hudson (1991). Because of this variability, volcanic hazards from Cerro Azul and the surrounding region <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> many different forms. Historical eruptions typically have produced lahars, lava flows, and ashfalls. Lava flows and lahars could wipe out entire cities or towns. Ashfall produced by explosive eruptions could interfere with air traffic. Most threatening of all is the risk of pyroclastic flows or avalanches, which have historically traversed as far as [...] in the region.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Roar", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it {{contains}} elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically {{it is an}} empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between [...] "Roar" [...] and [...] "Brave" [...] by Sara Bareilles. [...] "Legendary Lovers", a bhangra-based song, deals {{with the ideas of}} karma and infinity. [...] "Birthday" [...] was described by Perry as her own attempt at [...] "writing something Mariah Carey would have put on her first record". Musically, it is a [...] "fluffy" [...] pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. [...] "Walking on Air", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas Åhlund and Max Martin. [...] "Unconditionally", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a [...] "soaring" [...] power ballad with an [...] "epic chorus". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a [...] "woodblock percussion" [...] as well as [...] "a dramatic bass line" [...] and deemed it the album's [...] "most mature offering". Furthermore, he called it [...] "an ode to love that looks past all flaws" [...] and stated that the song acts as a [...] "compellingly grounded predicate" [...] to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.|$|E

500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for a couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E

That way, it had different floors for storing different items and for families. Until recently, no doors were located on the bottom floor, so the only way to access the building was by ladders made from logs. One ladder would reach from the ground to the patio (second floor) and another led through an opening through a roof and down onto the first floor. Other ladders led to higher floors. At night, ladders would be taken inside for protection, so no outsider <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> without permission.|$|E

I <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> on the punt-block team and stand behind the line and wave my arms, or something." [...] But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.|$|E
