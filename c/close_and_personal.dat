5|$|Up! <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal</b> is {{the fourth}} live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was {{directed}} by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and produced by team composed of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. Up! <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal</b> premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States.|$|E

He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And {{when was the last}} time you tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, he would have preferred the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic rated Up! <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal</b> three out of five stars.|$|E

500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008.

Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up <b>close</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby".

[...] Sylvia Chase from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her up, <b>close</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocation—all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon in spite of a shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E

500|$|Krauss was {{apprehensive}} at first, noting drastic {{differences between}} her personal acoustic style {{and that of}} Twain. She stated, [...] "It's so {{different from what we}} do, we didn't know what liberties we were supposed to take. Were we supposed to learn it off the record? Were we supposed to learn the themes?" [...] She found aid in Twain's then-husband and producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who told Krauss to perform the songs as if they were her own. While preparing for the show, Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style. While traveling on the Up! Tour, Twain decided to cover of AC/DC's [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] (1980) for the television special. However, she edited the song's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager. Krauss later expressed her opposing views, saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics. The show was modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee to a crowd of 300 attendants.

500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal.</b> He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound {{to be a very good}} thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E
