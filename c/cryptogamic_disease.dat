40|$|Fusarium {{root rot}} {{is a major}} <b>cryptogamic</b> <b>disease</b> in olive trees caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium solani. Controlling this disease {{requires}} the extensive use of chemicals. However, using BCAs such as some Trichoderma strains may be an opportune alternative to fungicides in protecting olive plantations. A new isolate (Fso 14) was isolated from young olive trees showing severe dieback symptoms. The objective of this work was to analyze the biocontrol behavior of a Tunisian strain of T. harzianum (Ths 97) on olive trees against Fso 14 by assessing both mycoparasitic activity (in planta and in vitro) and ability to locally modulate different gene-related defenses of the plant. Ths 97 was found to inhibit Fso 14 growth in vitro. Optical microscopic analysis at the confrontation zone between hyphae showed that Ths 97 grew alongside Fso 14 with numerous contact points suggesting parasitic activity. On olive trees, Ths 97 developed a strong protective role against root infestation by Fso 14, whether inoculated {{before or after the}} pathogenic agent. When inoculated alone, Fso 14 and Ths 97 did not modulate (or only slightly with inhibitions or inductions, respectively) the expression of genes involved in plant immunity (oxidative stress, phenylpropanoid pathway, PR-proteins and JA/Et-SA hormonal status). However, when Ths 97 was inoculated in combination with Fso 14, several defense-related genes were highly up-regulated, indicating probable primed-plant events. These promising results provided valuable information on using Ths 97 as a beneficial agent to control fusarium root rot disease caused by F. solani in olive trees. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

The proportion of dead or missing vines may not exceed 20% of the total number. If this percentage is exceeded, the final yield must be cut down proportionately.|$|R
