5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of British education, Indigenous Education was given higher importance from early time to colonial era. In every Indian village which has retained anything of its form.the rudiments of knowledge are sought to be imparted, {{there is not a}} child, except those of the outcasts (who form no part of the community), who is not able to read, to write, to cipher; in the last branch of learning, they are confessedly most proficient. Ludlow According to a survey done in the region of Madras, There were 11,758 schools and 740 centers for higher education in Madras Presidency. The number of students was 1,88,650..Around 1830 there exist 1,00,000 village schools in Bengal and Bihar region alone.. After {{the introduction}} of British education, the numbers of these indigenous education institutes decreased drastically..according to Minute of dissent, British government restricted indigenous education. [...] Efforts were then made by the Government to confine higher education and secondary education leading to higher education to boys in affluent, circumstances This again was done not in the interests of sound education but for political reasons. Rules were made calculated to restrict the diffusion of education generally and among the poorer boys in particular. <b>Conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> for ‘ grants ’—stiff and various—-were laid down and enforced, and the non-fulfilment of any one of these conditions was liable to be followed by serious consequences. Fees were raised to a degree which considering the circumstances of the classes that resort to schools, were abnormal. When it was objected that the minimum fee would be a great hardship to poor students the answer was—-such students had no business to receive that kind of education.Managers of private schools who remitted fees {{in whole or in part}} were penalized by reduced grants-in-aid. These rules had undoubtedly the effect of checking the great expansion of education that would have taken place. This is the real explanation of the very unsatisfactory character of the nature and progress of secondary education and it will never be remedied till we are prepared either to give education to the boys ourselves or to make sufficient grants to the private schools to enable them to be staffed with competent teachers. We are at present not prepared to do either.English education, according to this policy, is to be confined to the well-to-do classes.They, it was believed, would give no trouble to Government.For this purpose, the old system of education under which a pupil could prosecute his studies from the lowest to the highest class was altered. Sir Sankaran Nair The Jesuits introduced India to both the European college system and the printing of books, through founding Saint Paul's College, Goa in 1542. The French traveler François Pyrard de Laval, who visited Goa c.1608, described the College of St Paul, praising the variety of the subjects taught there free of charge. Like many other European travelers who visited the College, he recorded that at this time it had 3000 students, from all the missions of Asia.5 Its Library was one of the biggest in Asia, and the first Printing Press was mounted there.|$|E

While the courts have been willing to hear such cases, it has been repeatedly emphasised that judicial intervention in the decisions of sporting organisations should not occur lightly and recourse to the courts should only happen in the most exceptional of circumstances.

In Ireland there are two domestic bodies offering alternative dispute resolution in the sporting context: Just Sport Ireland (JSI) and the Disputes Resolution Authority (DRA) of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The availability of alternative forms of dispute resolution in Ireland provides a welcome alternative to the expensive, often divisive, option of judicial review proceedings.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} offered by theories of recognition and identity politics {{for a better}} understanding of religious – in this case, Christian – environmentalism. Insights related to recognition are gleaned from literature in ecological theology. Themes for further research and possibilities for practical adaptation are explored. It is argued that theories of recognition help to understand the dynamics related to processes where a certain group asks for more recognition of nature. Identity questions and developments in environmentalism are clarified by an understanding of what happens when partial recognition is granted. The role of mutuality as a basis for recognition is widened by Arto Laitinen’s proposal for recognition as “adequate regard” for something, i. e. for an ecosystem. The complex relations between humans and non-human nature are explored through such themes as reciprocity and the question of “voices” of nature. Creaturely difference and the role of seeing a “face” in nature are discussed in relation to recognition. The significance of place and environmental <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> are probed. Special attention is given to Andrew Dobson’s application of Nancy Frazer’s theory of transformative recognition to environmental matters, which offers new ways of understanding the role of non-human nature in politics, ethics and discussions on justice...|$|E

As such, {{there is a need for}} a comprehensive review of this literature. When examined, a number of discrepancies in research findings across these areas can be identified. The current literature review and empirical investigation take a first step in reconciling discrepancies in the literature and make suggestions for future investigations to bring together these disparate areas. Five-year-old children, eight-year-old children, eleven-year-old children, and adults were tested under either incidental or intentional learning <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> of distinctive and typical own- and other-race faces.

In fact, there was no evidence of a cross-race effect for the highly typical faces, while a reversal of the cross-race effect was found for the highly distinctive faces. In other words, for the highly distinctive faces, other-race faces were recognized more accurately than own-race faces, a contrast to previous research demonstrating more accurate recognition for own-race faces than other-race faces. The results from the current study suggest that the cross-race effect is more complex than previously thought and that distinctiveness is a powerful influence in face recognition across development...|$|E

However, methods of establishing rights over an employee’s intellectual property assets are relatively uncertain {{in the absence of}} international solutions. Given that increasingly more businesses establish entities in different countries and more employees co-operate across borders, it becomes essential for companies to be able to establish the conditions under which ownership subsists in intellectual property created in employment relationships in various countries. This comparative law publication describes and analyses employers’ acquisition of employees’ intellectual property rights, first in general and then in depth as manifested in 33 jurisdictions worldwide. The book was developed {{within the framework of the}} International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property (AIPPI), a non-affiliated, non-profit organization dedicated to improving and promoting the protection of intellectual property at both national and international levels.

40|$|When parents {{experience}} {{mental problems}} in their young children, they use the culturally dominant conceptions to understand. In these common-sense understandings {{of the causes of}} mental illness, the child is seen as an object and victim of parental lack of skills. The common-sense understandings are so deeply internalized that most parents experience feelings of guilt and loss of parental dignity. In search for help and facilitation for the child parents meet different professional ideas about what children with emotional disorders need. There are often major differences between the various actors in, and within, schools and services. Throughout the life with the child and working with therapists and teachers, parents will develop their understanding and their practice. They move from intuitive handling to a rational coping while they develop a multifactorial understanding of the child's difficulties. Through active participation in the management and facilitation along with appreciative professionals, parents can regain parental dignity. The positions they are placed in; included, informed or excluded, are of crucial importance for access to appreciative others. The analysis of parental power presented in this study shows that the informants have a double project in relation to the child's recovery; the ‘loveproject’ (rehabilitation of the child) and the ‘dignityproject’ (reconstructing themselves as good enough parents). By using Honneth's theory of recognition and Løgstrup’s concepts of love I discuss how recognition through love, rights and solidarity should be realized in order to meet parents of children with mental health problems, as resources. For this to be possible, the culturally dominant ideas about parenting children with mental disorders must be challenged. The focus in this thesis on the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> of parental love and parental dignity represents such a challenge...|$|E
