25|$|The diesel {{version of}} the TRAXX {{platform}} was introduced with the 2E {{version of the}} TRAXX platform. In the diesel version, the fuel tank occupies the same space as the transformer in the electric versions, centrally and below the main frame members. Installed motor power is 2.2MW. The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and <b>control</b> <b>desk,</b> body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum tractive effort is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E

50|$|One chief {{engineer}} supervised the boilers {{with two men}} directly under him. To control the boilers, there was the head operator who, from the <b>control</b> <b>desks,</b> <b>controlled</b> steam production, while the sub-head operator gave instructions {{from the top of}} the boiler. Regarding the coal burning, the operator controlled the combustion quality, while the stoker, from behind the boiler, pushed the unburnt coal to be re-burned, thereby clearing the combustion conveyor belt.|$|R

5000|$|A DMX512 {{network is}} called a [...] "DMX universe". Each OUT {{connector}} on a DMX512 controller can control a single universe. Smaller controllers may have a single OUT connector, enabling them to control only one universe, whereas large <b>control</b> <b>desks</b> (operator consoles) may {{have the capacity to}} control multiple universes, with an OUT connector provided for each universe.|$|R
50|$|In {{some smaller}} theatres, and school halls control booths can {{sometimes}} be found above or {{at the side of}} the stage. This allows space at the back of the auditorium for more seating, or a better/larger foyer area.In older theatres, this is because before the advent of thyristor dimming and compact electronic <b>control</b> <b>desks,</b> there was a limit on the distance that lighting controls could be placed away from the dimmers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cabin is}} rounder than the SBB Am841 {{from which it}} is derived. It has 2 full <b>control</b> <b>desks</b> and is {{equipped}} with air-conditioning. Bogies {{are the same as}} its predecessors and have primary (coil springs with Silentbloc, plus vertical shock absorbers) and secondary ("Sandwich" [...] blocs) suspension. There are two traction motors per bogie powered by IGBT based electronics. Brake equipment only consists of wheel brakes which are equipped with plastic brake pads.|$|R
30|$|The “Gare Lille Europe” {{railway station}} counts 4 {{platforms}} and 2 central railway lines for Eurostar trains coming from Paris and {{going directly to}} London. It has a daily traffic of 8500 passengers. It connects Lille to Paris by TGV (1  h), and to Brussels (38  min) and London (1  h 20  min) with the Eurostar trains. Since 2014 works have been undertaken on the departure concourse for the cross-Channel trains (Eurostar): it will provide new <b>control</b> <b>desks,</b> and a bigger boarding area.|$|R
5000|$|Stewart {{recalled}} {{that when the}} recording equipment had been set up, Kevin Godley set up his drum kit, Lol Creme got out his guitar and Stewart {{sat down at the}} <b>control</b> <b>desk.</b> [...] "It was the first time we'd had a real <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> with a four-track machine and we were excited to try it all out," [...] he said. [...] "The whole thing was just an experiment because Kevin wanted to lay all sorts of different drum beats down that he hadn't recorded before, and there was this crazy sort of nursery rhyme that had just got into our heads." ...|$|E
50|$|The station only {{broadcast}} on Sundays and public holidays, then in 2004 weekday broadcasts began. A new announcer operated studio {{was established to}} save {{wear and tear on}} the older <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> (vintage 1953) which uses valves which are hard to come-by and expensive.|$|E

50|$|The ferry {{terminal}} has two berths for hydrofoil {{and one for}} ferries, {{and serves}} as a port of entry into Macau, with there being passport <b>control</b> <b>desks</b> - separated into those for Macau residents, Visitors (including Hong Kong identity card holders and Mainland China visitors) and Diplomats. There is also a visa-on-arrival application office for those who require a visa to enter Macau but have not applied prior to arriving at the ferry terminal. After that, there is a customs check.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Théâtre {{technical}} staff took {{an active part}} in these refurbishments, along with external technical contractors called in on the project. House mechanics took apart and reassembled most of the essential works in the system, with their electrician colleagues refitting all the lighting equipment and rewiring it. The lighting control panel has now been replaced with computerised <b>control</b> <b>desks</b> that operate 500 electric circuits, twice as many as before the renovation work. The Grand Théâtre audio and video services completely renewed its equipment below the stage.|$|R
2500|$|On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named [...] (German for [...] "rolling ball") was {{described}} as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal {{was developed by the}} German company Telefunken. As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball. It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named [...] ) that was embedded into radar flight <b>control</b> <b>desks.</b> This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken [...] for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung as part of their TR86 process computer system with its SIG100-86 vector graphics terminal.|$|R
50|$|The Tejo Power Station is {{a highly}} complex {{industrial}} body, {{and the amount of}} workers it required demanded a hierarchical labour structure subdivided by room, with the harder work coexisting beside the more bearable tasks. Needless to say, those who worked near the boiler suffered more than those who, for example, controlled it from the <b>control</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In a 1976 {{interview}} Stewart {{described the}} studio's early days: [...] "It {{was a very}} tiny studio with some stereo equipment and the walls lined with egg boxes to provide sound insulation. There was a makeshift sort of <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> tied together with sellotape and string, but it {{was good enough for}} what I wanted to do, and it was the only studio near Manchester.|$|E
5000|$|Stewart said: [...] "It was {{the first}} thing we had ever tried to record on the new {{equipment}} that we'd had installed at the studio with the Kasenetz Katz money; for the first time we'd become a four-track studio with our own Ampex four-track machine and a real purpose-built <b>control</b> <b>desk.</b> We were all very excited about it and [...] "Neanderthal Man" [...] was something we recorded to test the equipment." ...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{significant}} problems in controlling dimmers is getting the control signal from a lighting control unit to the dimmer units. For many years this was achieved by providing a dedicated wire from the control unit to each dimmer (analogue control) where the voltage present on the wire was varied by the control unit to set the output level of the dimmer. In about 1976, {{to deal with the}} bulky cable requirements of analog control, Strand's R&D group in the UK developed an analogue multiplexing control system designated D54 (D54 is the internal standards number, which became the accepted name). Originally developed for use on the Strand Galaxy (1980) and Strand Gemini (1984) <b>control</b> <b>desks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similarly, the <b>Control</b> Panel <b>desk</b> {{accessory}} {{became the}} Control Panels folder (found in the System Folder, and {{accessible to the}} user from an alias in the Apple menu). The control panels themselves became separate files, stored within this directory. Control panels are essentially system extensions with a user interface.|$|R
50|$|They {{can also}} be used to send MIDI signals after {{processed}} by a sound module to a Light <b>Desk</b> <b>controlling</b> different lights.|$|R
50|$|The {{band and}} their entourage arrived in Lagos on 9 August 1973. EMI's studio, located on Wharf Road in the suburb of Apapa, was {{ramshackle}} and underequipped. The <b>control</b> <b>desk</b> was faulty {{and there was}} only one tape machine, a Studer 8-track. The band rented houses near the airport in Ikeja, an hour away from the studio. Paul, Linda and their three children stayed in one, while Laine, his wife JoJo, Emerick, and Wings' two roadies stayed in another.|$|E
50|$|Returning to the United States in 1943, he {{attended}} the Post Graduate School at Annapolis, where he completed the course in Aviation Ordnance in December 1944. He next reported to the Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Desk</b> in the Bureau of Aeronautics and remained there until July 1945. He was then assigned as Prospective Bomb Commander for the fourth atomic bomb at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. That bomb was never dropped due to the cessation of hostilities in August 1945.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Abacab tour started in Barcelona, on September 25, 1981, not only were there 50 active VL1's, plus spares, but also a brand new multi-processor <b>control</b> <b>desk,</b> with {{software}} written by Brooks Taylor. The electric and electronic hardware were designed by John Covington & Tom Walsh. The console operator for this tour {{was a young man}} by the name of Tom Littrell, who had been taken on for the summer during the college break, and never looked back.|$|E
5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the <b>Control</b> Panel <b>desk</b> accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|R

5000|$|Screw-locking {{versions}} of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control and professional audio. In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a bayonet locking ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone input connector and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and <b>control</b> <b>desks.</b> A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.|$|R
