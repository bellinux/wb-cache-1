40|$|This study identifies, {{tests and}} modifies factors for {{effective}} <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> using a marketing public relations (MPR) perspective. An MPR perspective entails an integrated cross-disciplinary approach {{with a strong}} product and/or service focus. The need for the study is underscored {{by the fact that}} there is undoubtedly a lack of a theoretical framework in which to practise <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> in the context of selling the organisation's products or services. In order to test the identified factors for effective <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication,</b> namely credibility, trust and long-term relationships, this study uses Q methodology as a research method and applies Q sorting as a means of data collection. Participants are asked to sort statements about <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> in their preferred order of importance on a large board in the presence of the researcher. This is known as the Q sorting process. The identified factors are tested among 20 communicators and 20 receivers of <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication.</b> The participants' sortings of statements are compared by means of Q factor analysis and then analysed. The results of the study indicate that only one factor is perceived as an absolute significant factor for effective <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> and that two of the factors necessitate modification. Consequently, based on the results, four factors are identified for effective <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication,</b> using an MPR perspective. These four factors are derived from the perspectives of both the communicators and receivers of <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> and are included in a proposed theoretical framework of <b>corporate</b> online <b>communication</b> using an MPR perspective.

500|$|During {{its first}} week of release in Japan, FireRed and LeafGreen sold a {{combined}} total of 885,039 copies, which was less than the amount sold by Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire in that time period, but IGN reasoned that the smaller sales were due to the new titles being remakes. In {{the first half of}} August before FireRed and LeafGreen were released in the U.S., the games received over 150,000 pre-orders, over twice the amount that Ruby and Sapphire received. Nintendo's Senior Vice President of Marketing and <b>Corporate</b> <b>Communication</b> George Harrison remarked, [...] "This pre-sell indicates more than twice the player interest!" [...] Over one million copies of FireRed and LeafGreen were sold in the US less than one month after their release in that region. As of March 31, 2008, the games had sold 11.82million copies worldwide. The games later entered Nintendo's Player's Choice line in North America and were re-marketed with a significantly lower retail price. However, unlike the original release, the Player's Choice edition games did not include a bundled Wireless Adapter.|$|E

2500|$|Sheckels {{contends that}} [...] "what [...] terms the ‘carnivalesque’ {{is tied to}} the body and the public {{exhibition}} of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed ‘carnivalesque’.” [...] Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in <b>corporate</b> <b>communication.</b> Steele states “that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.” Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that “in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival’s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or 'lower strata' parts, and dichotomies between ‘high’ or ‘low’.”. The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and low brow categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin’s native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as Boris Akunin have worked to change low brow communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin’s favorite subjects, Dostoyevsky.|$|E

40|$|Although {{literature}} on {{corporate social responsibility}} is vast, research into the use and effectiveness of various communications through digital platforms about such corporate responsibility is scarce. This gap is surprising; communicating about corporate social responsibility initiatives is vital to organizations that increasingly highlight their corporate social responsibility initiatives to position their corporate brands for both consumers and other stakeholders. Yet these organizations still sometimes rely on traditional methods to communicate, or even decide against communicating at all, because they fear triggering stakeholders’ skepticism or cynicism. A systematic, interdisciplinary examination of <b>corporate</b> social responsibility <b>communication</b> through digital platforms, therefore, is necessary, to establish an essential defi nition and up-to-date picture of the field. This research anthology addresses the above objectives. Drawing on marketing, management, and communication disciplines, among others, this anthology examines how organizations construct, implement, and use digital platforms to communicate about their corporate social responsibility and thereby achieve their organizational goals. The 21 chapters in this anthology reflect six main topic sections: • Challenges and opportunities for communicating corporate social responsibility through digital platforms. • Moving toward symmetry and interactivity in digital <b>corporate</b> social responsibility <b>communication.</b> • Fostering stakeholder engagement in and through digital <b>corporate</b> social responsibility <b>communication.</b> • Leveraging effective digital <b>corporate</b> social responsibility <b>communication.</b> • Digital activism and corporate social responsibility. • Digital methodologies and corporate social responsibility...|$|R
