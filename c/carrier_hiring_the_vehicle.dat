40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to find appropriate methods for creation and classification of an investment project that should be created while using these methods. The variants drawn were: purchase of the investment by a bank loan, fincial leasing with 30 % extra refund, distribution of finshed products by hiring transport or <b>hiring</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> using operative leasing and discounted cash flow method. <b>Hiring</b> of <b>the</b> transport was found the most reasonable variant for the company. The purchase of own vehicles is disadvantageous...|$|R

60|$|More {{than one}} witness had met {{them on the}} road back to Brighton, with the packing-case in the chaise. But when they {{returned}} to the livery-stables from which they had <b>hired</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>the</b> case was not to be seen. Accomplices in Brighton had, in all probability, assisted them in getting rid of it, and in shifting the plates into ordinary articles of luggage, which would attract no special attention at the railway station. This was the explanation given by the police. Right or wrong, the one fact remains that the villains were not caught, and that the assault and robbery at Oscar's house may be added to the long list of crimes cleverly enough committed to defy the vengeance of the law.|$|R
50|$|The {{three types}} of mail <b>carriers</b> are also <b>hired</b> quite differently. A new letter carrier begins as a City Carrier Assistant (CCA.) Rural <b>carriers</b> are <b>hired</b> as Rural <b>Carrier</b> Associate (RCA) carriers, without benefits. There is {{normally}} an RCA assigned to each rural route, so they usually work less frequently than city CCAs. As a result, {{there are thousands of}} RCA positions that go unfilled {{due to a lack of}} applicants, and are being covered by other RCA's until <b>hiring</b> improves for <b>the</b> <b>hiring</b> process explained). Highway Contract Route <b>carriers</b> are <b>hired</b> by <b>the</b> winning bidder for that route. They are not United States Postal Service employees, and normally receive lower pay than carriers on city or rural routes.|$|R

5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> as needed. Winter service <b>vehicles</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom are <b>the</b> only road-going <b>vehicles</b> entitled to use red diesel. Though <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service <b>vehicle</b> drivers in <b>the</b> United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|R
40|$|Field {{tests are}} {{still one of}} the most {{important}} and practical methods for bridge assessment and for better understanding on bridge behaviour so far. This paper reports some preliminary results on a series of field tests that had been carried out on the Tsing-Yi South Bridge (N 797) in New Territories West of Hong Kong in the April 2005. After the tested skew bridge is briefly introduced, the experimental modal analyses on the skew bridge and <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>the</b> corresponding calibration test of tested bridge, the subsequent moving force identification tests, and other dynamic tests are described. Some experimental results from the mentioned tests are then analyzed and discussed. In addition, some useful data were extracted from the developed data base and provided for the subsequent moving force identification, impact factor study and bridge condition assessment. The results will also be discussed...|$|R

Sir Arthur's plan {{would probably have}} been crowned with success, but it was not without peril. The French had rallied with extraordinary rapidity under the protection of their cavalry. The British artillery-carriages were so shaken as to be almost unfit for service, the horses insufficient in number and wretched in quality, the commissariat waggons in the greatest confusion, and <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> Portuguese <b>vehicles</b> had made off in every direction.

50|$|In January 1925 Inter City Motor Service {{started a}} bus service to Springfield Road, having {{recently}} discontinued its service to Papanui. The Board viewed this move {{as a threat}} to its business and responded by starting its own bus service to the area on 28 January 1925 using <b>hired</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>The</b> single bus on offer from Inter City Motors was unable to compete against the two deployed by the Board and so the Inter City Motors service was quickly withdrawn. It was not until later in the year that the Board was able to take delivery of additional buses for its own fleet and relieve itself of the considerable expense of hiring buses from private operators. Two of these contractors later established their own service to Springfield Road in competition with the Board along the route that had been used by Inter City Motors. The Board acquired their business the following year.|$|R

40|$|This paper conducts an enquiry {{into whether}} various {{regulatory}} theories {{suggest that there}} exists a legitimate rationale for regulating Uber in a New Zealand context. Uber is a company which provides an Internet-based mobile phone application that connects passengers and drivers. Uber presents regulators with many challenges, some of which this paper focuses on selectively. This paper outlines in brief Uber as a company and the service that it provides. It then describes the somewhat unique New Zealand taxi industry and associated regulations, and also the regulation pertaining to private <b>hire</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion of this discussion is that Uber is effectively a competitor in the taxi industry, {{even though it is}} regulated as a private <b>hire</b> service. <b>The</b> overarching enquiry of this paper whether there is regulatory avoidance, or instead under- or over- inclusive rules. A discussion of regulatory compliance theory provides a basis on which to assess whether Uber is legitimately or illegitimately avoiding existing regulation, or whether the existing rules are failing to meet their intended purpose(s). This issue is discussed throughout the paper in relation to the following sections. Regulatory theories relating to innovation, the sharing economy and welfare economics provide different perspectives as to whether regulatory intervention would be justified, particularly when focussing on the purposes of regulating. Then, a comparative discussion of Uber in England and California highlights how other jurisdictions are approaching Uber in various contexts. This sheds light on how other regulators perceive the challenges that Uber presents, and the rationales for imposing regulation on different areas of Uber’s operations...|$|R

They <b>hired</b> a <b>vehicle,</b> <b>the</b> only one to be had in the neighborhood, and having found the corpse, proceeded to carry it to the nearest burying-grounds, about six miles distant. The way was rough, and the driver looking behind him saw the head of the great chief, which extended beyond the car, nodding to him at every jolt, as if it had life, and were giving him directions. At the next heavy rut he looked again to please his savage soul with ferocious enjoyment. But this time the elder female, who had watched him, acted as described in the ballad, and killed the brutal driver with the chieftain's dagger. Then, along with her companion, she brought the mortal remains of Sir Lachlan to the place where they still lie buried.|$|R
