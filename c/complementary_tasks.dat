The current study used event-related functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate the neural underpinnings when participants performed a Go/Nogo task alone or complementarily with another co-actor (unseen), whom was believed to be another human or a computer. During both <b>complementary</b> <b>tasks,</b> reaction time data suggested that participants integrated the potential action of their co-actor in their own action planning.

The superior frontal gyrus of the medial prefrontal cortex was differentially activated in the human co-actor condition compared to the computer co-actor condition. The medial prefrontal cortex, involved thinking about the beliefs and intentions of other people, possibly reflects a social-cognitive aspect or self-other discrimination during the joint task when believing a biological co-actor is present. Our results suggest that action co-representation can occur even offline with any agent type given a priori information that they are co-acting; however additional regions are recruited when participants believe they are task-sharing with another human...|$|E

A pilot study demonstrates that established scales for measuring attitudes and values (variables associated with similarity effects) capture more information about desired outcomes, whereas established scales for measuring dominance (the variable most widely associated with complementarity effects) capture more information about desired strategies. Studies 1 a and 1 b demonstrate that framing the same variable as either an outcome variable or a strategic variable can predict partner preference (i. e., similar or complementary). Finally, Studies 2 a and 2 b address why complementarity may offer a strategic advantage over similarity in task pursuit: complementarity allows two individuals with contrasting strategic preferences to “divide and conquer” tasks that require multiple strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} compares two institutional {{settings in}} which individuals with <b>complementary</b> <b>task</b> abilities match to found new firms: corporate spin-offs of initially randomly matched production teams and the rational matching of such teams in an incubator organization. The alternative always consists of seeking employment in industrial firms which pay a certain wage. This wage reflects the expected team quality given that all professionals who do not found firms are randomly matched in production teams. Each institutional setting {{gives rise to a}} unique efficient competitive equilibrium such that both industrial and entrepreneurial firms coexist. The efficient incubator equilibrium always induces a larger entrepreneurial sector in the industry. However, the additional entrepreneurial firms founded are rather small. Neither of the two regimes unambiguously induces higher industry-wide investments. Ex-ante welfare comparisons then assume that individuals do not yet know their specific ability combinations.

A testing algorithm performs a <b>complementary</b> <b>task</b> to that performed by a learning algorithm, which takes a set of examples and builds a model that succinctly describes them.

In this paper we examine the problem of verifying orthogonal shapes using test points. In particular, we give testing algorithms for sets of disjoint rectangles in two and higher dimensions and for general orthogonal shapes in 2 -D and 3 -D. This work is a first step towards developing efficient testing algorithms for objects with more general shapes, including those with non-orthogonal and curved surfaces...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{finding in}} {{imitation}} literature {{is that people}} perform their actions more readily if they are congruent with the behavior of another person. These action congruency effects are typically explained {{by the idea that}} the observation of someone else acting automatically activates our motor system in a directly matching way.

In both tasks, a color-cue could be presented forcing subjects to ignore the task rule and execute a predefined grasp.

40|$|One of {{the most}} major {{advantages}} of Model checking over other formal methods of verification, its ability to generate an error trace {{in case of a}} specification falsified in the model. We call this trace a counterexample. However, understanding the counterexample is not that easy task, because model checker generates usually multiple counterexamples of long length, what makes the analysis of counterexample time-consuming as well as costly task. Therefore, counterexamples should be small and as indicative as possible to be understood. In probabilistic model checking (PMC) counterexample generation has a quantitative aspect.   The counterexample in PMC is a set of paths in which a path formula holds, and their accumulative probability mass violates the probability bound. In this paper, we address the <b>complementary</b> <b>task</b> of counterexample generation which is the counterexample diagnosis in PMC.

The ICNPO classifies non-profit establishments into 12 major groups based on their primary economic activity, and then further sub-divides these into 24 sub-groups. The result is a system that scores high in terms of five key evaluation criteria: economy, significance, rigour, organising power, and richness.

This demands new priorities in medical education, new concepts for structuring and organising responsibilities in medical care, and new <b>complementary</b> <b>task</b> definitions for the players involved. Goal setting and functional care models are conceptual innovations that can help introduce the patient-centred approach into medical practice. In the care of patients with cancer, the goals of the physician, nurse, patient, and family may change and diverge as the disease progresses, necessitating open discussion and bargaining. Functional care models stress that the quality of care can be defined differently at the four different levels of care-medical, nursing, cleaning/providing, and support from family and friends. Instruments that maintain the focus of care on the patient's quality of life can help formalise the goal-setting process. Quality of life measuring instruments should be adapted to the priorities of the clinical situation and implemented in basic practice routines.
