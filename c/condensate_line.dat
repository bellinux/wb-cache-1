As far as energy conservation during energy carrier transportation is concerned, an important task is development and application of a method to calculate gas-liquid hydrocarbons flow and heat and mass transfer in process and trunk pipelines during their design and operation. The authors have developed a physical-mathematical model of a hydrocarbon flow in the gas <b>condensate</b> <b>line</b> based on balance equations of conservation of mass, impulse and energy of the transported medium within the framework of a quasi- 1 D approach.

The 15 kHz FWHM <b>condensate</b> <b>line</b> shape is only broadened by mean field interactions, whereas the degenerate Fermi gas line shape is broadened to 75 kHz FWHM due {{to the effect of}} Pauli exclusion on the spatial and momentum distributions. The asymmetric optical line shapes are observed in excellent agreement with line shape models for the quantum degenerate gases. For ^ 4 He a triplet-singlet s-wave scattering length a=+ 50 (10) _stat(43) _syst a_ 0 is extracted. The high spectral resolution reveals a doublet in the absorption spectrum of the BEC, and this effect is understood by the presence of a weak optical lattice in which a degeneracy of the lattice recoil and the spectroscopy photon recoil leads to Bragg-like scattering.

A key feature of the CPHP {{is the use of}} capillary forces to separate the liquid and vapor phases and distribute the liquid over the evaporating/condensing surface. The liquid phase is held by capillary forces in a reservoir and is carried to the evaporating surface by a wick. The reservoir is replenished at intervals from a valved external liquid supply line. In the hot plate mode, liquid accumulates in the reservoir and is removed by an external <b>condensate</b> <b>line.</b> Performance requirements for the device were capability of handling a power density of 4 watts/sq cm, an outlet quality (percentage of vapor flow to total flow) greater than 90 percent, and operation in a 0 -g environment.

40|$|The {{substantial}} efficiency improvements {{which have}} been realized in residential refrigerators over {{the last twenty years}} due to implementation of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act and changing consumer reactions to energy savings give an indication of the potential for improvement in the commercial sector, where few such efficiency improvements have been made to date. The purchase decision for commercial refrigerators is still focused primarily on first cost and product performance issues such as maximizing storage capacity, quick pulldown, durability, and reliability. The project applied techniques used extensively to reduce energy use in residential refrigeration to a commercial reach-in refrigerator. The results will also be applicable to other commercial refrigeration equipment, such as refrigerated vending machines, reach-in freezers, beverage merchandisers, etc. The project described in this paper was a collaboration involving the Appliance and Building Technology Sector of TIAX, the Delfield Company, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Building Technologies. Funding was provided by DOE through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 41000. The program plan and schedule were structured to assure successful integration of the TIAX work on development of efficient design concepts into Delfield's simultaneous development of the Vantage product line. The energy-saving design options evaluated as part of the development included brushless DC and PSC fan motors, high-efficiency compressors, variable-speed compressor technology, cabinet thermal improvement (particularly in the face frame area), increased insulation thickness, a trap for the <b>condensate</b> <b>line,</b> improved insulation, reduced-wattage antisweat heaters, non-electric antisweat heating, off-cycle defrost termination, rifled heat exchanger tubing, and system optimization (selection of heat exchangers, fans, and subcooling, superheat, and suction temperatures for efficient operation). The project started with a thorough evaluation of the baseline Delfield Model 6051 two-door reach-in refrigerator. Performance testing was done to establish a performance baseline which, to meet end-users requirements, would have to be met or exceeded by the high-efficiency refrigerator design. Energy testing was done to establish the baseline energy use. Diagnostic testing such as reverse heat leak testing and insulation conductivity testing was done to evaluate factors contributing to the cabinet load and energy use. Modeling was done to assess the energy savings potential of the energy saving design options. Discussion with vendors and cost modeling was done to assess the manufacturing cost impact of the options. Based on this work, the following group of design options was selected for incorporation in the final refrigerator design: (1) Brushless DC evaporator fans; (2) Improved face frame design; (3) Reduced antisweat heater wattage; (4) <b>Condensate</b> <b>line</b> trap; and (5) Optimized refrigeration system. There was no net cost premium associated with these design changes, leading to a high-efficiency design requiring no payback of any initial additional investment. Delfield incorporated these design options in the Vantage line design and built a first prototype, which was tested at TIAX. Additional design changes were implemented in the transition to manufacturing, based in part on results of initial prototype testing, and a pilot production unit was sent to TIAX for final testing. The energy use of the pilot production unit was 68 % less than that of the baseline refrigerator when tested according to the ASHRAE 117 Energy Test Standard. The energy test results for the baseline refrigerator and the two new-design units is shown in Figure ES- 1 below. The resulting energy consumption is well below Energy Star and proposed Canadian and California standards levels. Delfield has successfully transitioned the design to production and is manufacturing all configurations of the energy efficient reach-ins at a rate greater than 7, 000 per year, with production quantities projected to double within a year...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Three {{companies}} namely Esko & Co Ltd, Cuttings Work Ltd and The Message Ltd {{were targeted}} {{for the purpose}} of this project study. The first one is Esko & Co Ltd. The company has diversified its production activities to produce sweets, bubble gums, chocolates, wafers and noodles both for the local market and export purposes. Cuttings Works Ltd is the second leading company in the manufacturing of top grade products using the best possible gemstones for the jewellery grade. The company is also diversifying and expanding its market. On the other hand ‘The message Ltd’ is another company involved in the designing and make up of high class casual wear. Previously the company was only designing and preparing samples and the bulk order done in another textile factory. With respect to the highly demanding market, they have now started the production of their shirts in-house. Being exposed to competition threats from other local and overseas suppliers, it is imperative for these factories to investigate on cost saving possibilities and process improvement opportunities. A walk-through audit was carried out where data were collected. The objective of the audit was to obtain energy savings through low cost improvements that optimise the building systems and process operation so that the companies operate efficiently and effectively. On the basis of observations and calculations, the following cost savings options can be suggested:’ 1.        Savings on Fuel (HFO) used at Esko & Co Ltd. A saving on fuel consumed of MUR 458 572 [PH 1] (Euro 11 464 based on exchange rate of Euro 1 = MUR 40) per year can be achieved by recovering the heat loss through the flash steam for pre-heating the feed-water to the boiler. Another saving on fuel of MUR 105 578 (Euro 2639) per year can be done by recovering the heat loss from the Wafers machine exhaust. Also by recovering the heat loss from the boiler chimney exhaust a saving of MUR 137 457 (Euro 3436) per year can be achieved. 2.        Savings on Electrical components. It was found that in a big manufacturing company like Esko & Co Ltd, a direct saving of MUR 13 278 (Euro 332) per year can easily be achieved by substituting the existing Fluorescent tube lights (18 W) by 9 W-T 8 lamp with a return on investment of 2. 8 years. However in smaller scale enterprise like The Message ltd and Cuttings Ltd, the shift on economic lamp can also lead to savings of MUR 3700 (Euro 92. 5) and MUR 1386 (Euro 34. 7) yearly. Most often large scale enterprise was found to be always paying a penalty fee for power factor. Hence the investment on an Automatic Correction Unit will also help doing savings. For instance, Esko & Co Ltd can save MUR 3200 (Euro 80) monthly on its electricity bill with a payback of 3. 1 years for the power corrector unit. Next we noticed that big companies are used to a penalty fee for power factor. As this fee is for a period of six months for every month of excess power consumed, it is worth investing on an Automatic Power Correction unit. As such foe Esko & Co Ltd we found that a saving of MUR 3200 Euro 80) per month will be made with a payback period of 3. 1 years for the equipment. Furthermore it was found that the power consumed by air conditioning units is quite significant. For instance for Esko & Co Ltd 33 % of the total power consumed are by the air conditioning units. A direct saving in this respect is achievable by only increasing the set point temperature by 1 to 2 oC. Other simple measures can be shading of windows to prevent sunlight or using wind curtains at doors and to switch on the AC when needed can largely help to decrease the air conditioning load However there is also room for future investment in variable speed drive for the compressors of the air conditioning units which is still costly at present. 3.        Steam leakage optimisation Reduction of steam leakage can be done by replacing the return <b>condensate</b> <b>line</b> from the oil heat exchanger at Esko& Co Ltd by a smaller one. It was not possible to calculate the savings as the leaks could not be measured – however results will show in the fuel bills. 4.        Reduction of heat dissipated Insulating the exhaust pipes from the Wafer machine at Esko& Co Ltd by using mineral wool of thickness 57 mm will considerably decrease the heat dissipated to the surrounding by 80 % and hence improving the working environment around the machine since no air conditioner is found in that room. Air conditioning load in other rooms are expected to reduce and once again here it is difficult to conduct any calculations on how much can be saved. But by taking this measure the effects are immediately seen. 5.        Transport Fuel optimisation Normally big companies like Esko& Co Ltd which has many lorries for their product delivery that consume around 2330 litres of diesel monthly. As the transportation fuel is continuously increasing, this area also requires monitoring and optimisation. Simple measures like smooth driving, regular tuning and servicing of your engine can help improving the fuel economy of the company. 6.        Use of solar energy To alleviate the increasing world oil prices, the use of renewable energies are becoming important. As such we found that in a country like Mauritius where there is great potential for solar energy, the latter can be an option for companies to invest on. It was found that a grid connected system will be more advantageous and depending on an agreement with the local grid, a payback of less than 5 years can be achieved for a tariff around MUR 3 (Euro 0. 08) per kWh. 7.        Avoided carbon dioxide emissions. To decrease the impact of global warming, it is important to cut down the emissions of greenhouse gases as it will be a serious threat to the third world countries and small island states in the first place as they are the most vulnerable. With the savings in the amount of HFO burned at Esko& Co Ltd, we found that the avoided amount of GHG emissions amounts to 98. 96 kg CO 2 -e/year...|$|E

Thermodynamic calculations and comparisons with liquidus phase diagrams indicate that the CAI could have been produced by direct condensation to metastable subcooled liquids that subsequently crystallized or by remelting of an equilibrium high-temperature condensate by impact.

40|$|We {{determine}} the strange quark condensate from lattice QCD {{for the first}} time and compare its value to that of the light quark and chiral condensates. The results come from a direct calculation of the expectation value of the trace of the quark propagator followed by subtraction of the appropriate perturbative contribution, derived here, to convert the non-normal-ordered mψ̅ ψ to the MS̅ scheme at a fixed scale. This is then a well-defined physical “nonperturbative” condensate that can be used in the operator product expansion of current-current correlators. The perturbative subtraction is calculated through O(αs) and estimates of higher order terms are included through fitting results at multiple lattice spacing values. The gluon field configurations used are “second generation” ensembles from the MILC collaboration that include 2 + 1 + 1 flavors of sea quarks implemented with the highly improved staggered quark action and including u/d sea quarks down to physical masses.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations. Although COPD {{is a complex}} disease, diagnosis and staging are still based on simple spirometry measurements. Different COPD phenotypes exist based on clinical, physiological, immunological and radiological observations. Cigarette smoking {{is the most important}} risk factor for COPD, but only 15 - 20 % of smokers develop the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Unfortunately, {{little is known about the}} pathogenesis of COPD, and even less on the very first steps that are associated with an aberrant response to smoke exposure. This study aims to investigate the underlying local and systemic inflammation of different clinical COPD phenotypes, and acute effects of cigarette smoke exposure in individuals susceptible and non-susceptible for the development of COPD. Furthermore, we will investigate mechanisms associated with corticosteroid insensitivity. Our study will provide valuable information regarding the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the natural course of COPD. Methods and analysis: This cross-sectional study will include young and old individuals susceptible or non-susceptible to develop COPD. At a young age (18 - 40 years) 60 'party smokers' will be included who are called susceptible or non-susceptible based on COPD prevalence in smoking family members. In addition, 30 healthy smokers (age 40 - 75 years) and 110 COPD patients will be included.

40|$|Pipeline pigging for in-line {{inspection}} {{is a fundamental}} practice in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Yet, the so-called "smart pigs" used for this purpose are expensive and delicate and the risk related to their possible blocking inside the pipeline is non-negligible, hence their deployment is rather infrequent (generally, just once in several years). In this paper, we present a new, low-cost and low-risk foam pig with inspection capabilities similar to those of a multi-channel caliper pig (i. e. able to detect, locate and size inner diameter changes and deformations) together with additional features that allow to detect internal roughness changes (e. g. due to corrosion) and perform some pH/salinity determinations, also useful for corrosion assessment purposes. One implementation of the new tool makes use of a foam pig "carrier", providing the required push with a good capability to surpass restrictions, equipped with specialized sensors and modules for data acquisition and storage.

40|$|We {{consider}} a large condensate in a rotating anisotropic harmonic trap. Using {{the method of}} matched asymptotic expansions, we derive the velocity of an element of vortex line {{as a function of}} the local gradient of the trap potential, the line curvature and the angular velocity of the trap rotation. This velocity yields small-amplitude normal modes of the vortex for 2 D and 3 D condensates. For an axisymmetric trap, the motion of the vortex line is a superposition of plane-polarized standing-wave modes. In a 2 D condensate, the planar normal modes are degenerate, and their superposition can result in helical traveling waves, which differs from a 3 D condensate. Including the effects of trap rotation allows us to find the angular velocity that makes the vortex locally stable. For a cigar-shape condensate, the vortex curvature makes a significant contribution to the frequency of the lowest unstable normal mode; furthermore, additional modes with negative frequencies appear. As a result, it is considerably more difficult to stabilize a central vortex in a cigar-shape condensate than in a disc-shape one. Normal modes with imaginary frequencies can occur for a nonaxisymmetric condensate (in both 2 D and 3 D). In connection with recent JILA experiments, we consider the motion of a straight vortex line in a slightly nonspherical <b>condensate.</b> The vortex <b>line</b> changes its orientation in space at the rate proportional to the degree of trap anisotropy and can exhibit periodic recurrences.

40|$|Steam {{has been}} widely used {{as the source of}} heating in {{commercial}} buildings and industries throughout the twentieth century. Even though contemporary designers have moved to hot water as the primary choice for heating, a large number of facilities still use steam for heating. Medical campuses with on-site steam generation and extensive distribution systems often serve a number of buildings designed prior to the mid- 1980 s. The steam is typically used for preheat as its high thermal content helps in heating the air faster and prevents coils from freezing in locations with extreme weather conditions during winter. The present work provides a comprehensive description of the various types of steam heating systems, steam coils, and valves to facilitate the engineer's understanding of these steam systems. A large percentage of the steam coils used in buildings are provided with medium pressure steam. Veterans Integrated Service Network and Army Medical Command Medical Facilities are examples which use medium pressure steam for heating. The current design manual for these medical facilities recommends steam at 30 psig be provided to these coils. In certain cases although the steam heating coil is designed for a 5 psig steam pressure, it is observed that higher pressure steam is supplied at the coil. A higher steam pressure may lead to excessive heating, system inefficiency due to increased heat loss, simultaneous heating and cooling, and increased maintenance cost. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of lowering steam pressure on the system performance. A 16 % reduction in temperature rise across the coil was found when the steam pressure in the coil was reduced from 15 psig to 5 psig. The rise in temperature with lower pressure steam was sufficient to prevent coil freeze-up even in the most severe weather conditions. Additional benefits of reduced steam pressure are reduced flash steam losses (flash steam is vapor or secondary steam formed when hot condensate from the coil is discharged into a lower pressure area, i. e., the <b>condensate</b> return <b>line)</b> and radiation losses, increased flow of air through the coil thereby reducing air stratification and reduced energy losses in the event of actuator failure. The work also involved evaluating the existing control strategies for the steam heating system. New control strategies were developed and tested to address the short comings of existing sequences. Improved temperature control and occupant comfort; elimination of valve hunting and reduced energy consumption were benefits realized by implementing these measures...|$|R
