The bulk of the collection consists of confidential summaries of applications and communications from applicant organizations.

The Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany (alternatively the Claims Conference) was founded in 1951 by representatives of twenty-three national and international Jewish organizations to advocate for the satisfaction of Jewish claims against Germany. On September 10, 1952, an agreement was signed by the Claims Conference, the West German government, and the State of Israel that initiated the development of laws concerning indemnification and restitution claims and providing the Claims Conference with DM 450 million for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts. Since this agreement, the Claims Conference has worked to obtain and distribute funds for relief and rehabilitation of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution {{as well as for the}} reconstruction of Jewish educational and cultural programs and institutions. 1 <b>catalogue</b> <b>card.</b> Processeddigitize...|$|E

Thus, it is important to cite or acknowledge the creator of resources that been used. In defining the information sources, it involved three stages which are primary sources, secondary sources and tertiary sources.

40|$|Between {{the end of}} the 1960 s and 1979, {{catalogue}} {{records for}} many of the books purchased by British Council libraries overseas were acquired in the form of printed catalogue cards produced by the British National Bibliography (BNB). The computer-produced cards were ordered from BNB {{at the same time as}} the books to which they referred were ordered from the publishers, and, in most cases, arrived at the Council library abroad at about the same time as the books. The service was by no means perfect, however, mainly due to the fact that many of the books ordered had not been catalogued by the BNB; nevertheless, Council libraries abroad were able to avoid much routine cataloguing work in this way. When BNB announced its intention of phasing out its <b>catalogue</b> <b>card</b> service, the British Council had to seek an alternative means of meeting the needs of its libraries abroad. Local experiments in automated cataloguing were carried out in some countries, such as Italy, but it soon became apparent that the best solution would be to create a centralized database at British Council headquarters in London, which would contain catalogue records for all books acquired by Council libraries abroad and from which local library catalogues could be produced. One of the first six countries chosen to test the system was Portugal; and at the end of 1980, the first print-outs of author/title and classifie...|$|E
