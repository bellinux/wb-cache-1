40|$|Background: During {{all levels}} of {{software}} testing, the {{goal should be to}} fail the code. However, software developers and testers are more likely to choose positive tests rather than negative ones due to the phenomenon <b>called</b> <b>confirmation</b> bias. Confirmation bias is defined as the tendency of people to verify their hypotheses rather than refuting them. In the literature, there are theories about the possible effects of confirmation bias on software development and testing. Due to the tendency towards positive tests, most of the software defects remain undetected, which in turn leads to an increase in software defect density. Aims: In this study, we analyze factors affecting confirmation bias in order to discover methods to circumvent confirmation bias. The factors, we investigate are experience in software development/testing and reasoning skills that can be gaine...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s Reform Judaism {{developed}} a separate ceremony, <b>called</b> <b>confirmation,</b> loosely modeled on Christian Confirmation ceremonies. This occurred because, at the time, Reform Jews {{believed that it}} was inappropriate for Bar/bat mitzvah age children to be considered mature enough to understand {{what it means to be}} religious. It was held that children of this age were not responsible enough to understand what it means to observe religious practices. As such, the reform rite of confirmation was originally a replacement for the Bar/Bat mitzvah ceremony, held at age 16. In later decades, the Reform movement modified this view, and now much of Reform Judaism in the USA encourages children to celebrate becoming Bar/Bat mitzvah at the traditional age, and then has the confirmation at the later age as a sign of a more advanced completion of their Jewish studies.|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{analogous}} ceremony also <b>called</b> <b>Confirmation</b> in the Jewish religion, {{which is not}} to be confused with Bar or Bat Mitzvah. The early Jewish Reformers instituted a ceremony where young Jews who are older than Bar Mitzvah age study both traditional and contemporary sources of Jewish philosophy in order to learn what it means to be Jewish. The age instituted was older than that of Bar Mitzvah because some of these topics were considered too complicated for 13-year-old minds to grasp. Nowadays, Confirmation has gained widespread adherence among congregations affiliated with the Reform movement, but has not gained as much traction in Conservative and Orthodox Jewish groups. The way Confirmation differs from Bar Mitzvah is that Confirmation is considered a more communal confirmation of one's being Jewish, and Bar Mitzvah is more of a personal confirmation of joining that covenant (see below section about Confirmation in Judaism) ...|$|R

5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is <b>called</b> <b>confirmation,</b> because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|R
50|$|Infant baptism is {{particularly}} illustrative of the Methodist doctrine of prevenient grace. The principle is that The Fall of Man ruined {{the human soul}} {{to such an extent}} that nobody wants a relationship with God. In order for humans to even want to be able to choose, God must empower their will (so that they may choose Christ) which he does by means of prevenient grace. Thus God takes the very first step in salvation, preceding any human effort or decision. Methodists justify infant baptism by this principle of prevenient grace, often arguing that infant baptism is God's promise or declaration to the infant that calls that infant to (eventually) believe in God's promises (God's Word) for salvation. When the individual believes in Jesus they will profess their faith before the church, often using a ritual <b>called</b> <b>confirmation</b> in which the Holy Spirit is invoked with the laying on of hands. Methodists also use infant baptism symbolically, as an illustration of God approaching the helpless. They see the ceremony additionally as a celebration of God's prevenient grace.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{compensation}} {{is widely used}} in advanced transaction models as means of recovery from a failure. Similar concepts are adopted for providing transaction-like behaviour for long business processes supported by workflows technology. In general, it is not trivial to design compensating tasks for tasks {{in the context of}} a workflow. Actually, a task in a workflow process does not have to be compensatable in the sense that the forcibility of reverse operations of the task is not always guaranteed by the application semantics. In addition, the isolation requirement on data resources may make a task difficult to compensate. In this paper, we first look into the requirements that a compensating task has to satisfy. Then we introduce a new concept <b>called</b> <b>confirmation.</b> With the help of confirmation, we are able to modify most non-compensatable tasks so that they become compensatable.

40|$|Predictions {{about the}} future and {{unrestricted}} universal generalizations are never logically implied by our observational evidence, which is limited to particular facts in the present and past. Nevertheless, propositions of these and other kinds are often said to be confirmed by observational evidence. A natural place to begin the study of confirmation theory is to consider what it means to say that some evidence E confirms a hypothesis H. Incremental and absolute confirmation Let us say that E raises the probability of H if the probability of H given E is higher than the probability of H not given E. According to many confirmation theorists, “E confirms H ” means that E raises the probability of H. This conception of <b>confirmation</b> will be <b>called</b> incremental <b>confirmation.</b> Let us say that H is probable given E if the probability of H given E is above some threshold. (This threshold remains to be specified but is assumed to be at least one half.) According to some confirmation theorists, “E confirms H ” means that H is probable given E. This conception of <b>confirmation</b> will be <b>called</b> absolute <b>confirmation.</b> Confirmation theorists have sometimes failed to distinguish these two concepts. For example, Carl Hempel in his classic “Studies in the Logic of Confirmation ” endorsed the following principles: (1) A generalization of the form “All F are G ” is confirmed by the evidence that there is an individual that is both F and G. (2) A generalization of that form is also confirmed by the evidence that there is an individual that is neither F nor G. (3) The hypotheses confirmed by a piece of evidence are consistent with one another. (4) If E confirms H then E confirms every logical consequence of H.

[...] These words, in both their Western and Eastern variants, refer to a gift of the Holy Spirit that marks the recipient as with a seal. Through the sacrament the grace given in baptism is [...] "strengthened and deepened." [...] Like baptism, confirmation may be received only once, and the recipient must be in a state of grace (meaning free from any known unconfessed mortal sin) in order to receive its effects. The [...] "originating" [...] minister of the sacrament is a validly consecrated bishop; if a priest (a [...] "presbyter") confers the sacrament — as is done ordinarily in the Eastern Churches and in special cases (such as the baptism of an adult or in danger of the death of a young child) in the Latin Church (CCC 1312-1313) — the link with the higher order is indicated by the use of oil (known as [...] "chrism" [...] or [...] "myron") blessed by the bishop on Holy Thursday itself or on a day close to it. In the East, which retains the ancient practice, the sacrament is administered by the parish priest immediately after baptism. In the West, where the sacrament is normally reserved for those who can understand its significance, it came to be postponed until the recipient's early adulthood; in the 20th century, after Pope Pius X introduced first Communion for children on reaching the age of discretion, the practice of receiving Confirmation later than the Eucharist became widespread; but the traditional order, with Confirmation administered before First Communion, is being increasingly restored.|$|R
