40|$|This {{publication}} {{is based}} in part on CTAHR Research Bulletin 158, Plumeria cultivars in Hawaii, by James T. Chinn and Richard A. Criley (1982), which is out of print. It has been reformatted from the original, edited slightly, and revised to reflect changes in botanical nomenclature. The present publication also incorporates {{a modified version of the}} author’s 1998 CTAHR publication, Plumeria, which gave a brief overview of the plant and its culture. Plumeria is known by other <b>common</b> names, including <b>frangipani,</b> melia (Hawaiian), and temple tree, and has many named cultivars. In Hawai‘i, plumeria is grown as an ornamental and is not found in the wild. The plumeria has been cultivated for its flowers in Hawai‘i since the late 1800 s. Hundreds of open-pollinated seedlings have been flowered and selections made for suitable lei flowers. These selections constitute the majority of the plumerias grown today and form the basis for further improvement through breeding. Desirable characteristics of plumeria cultivars include good keeping quality, heavy flower production, and attractive color. This publication covers 40 major plumeria cultivars grown in Hawai‘i...|$|R
