After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.|$|E
5|$|The {{daffodil}} and the leek {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} leek <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Languedoc wines <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first {{vineyards}} planted {{along the coast}} near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the fifth century BC. Along with parts of Provence, these are the oldest planted vineyards in France. The region of Languedoc has belonged to France since the thirteenth century and the Roussillon was acquired from Spain in the mid-seventeenth century. The two regions were joined as one administrative region in the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, {{which in}} turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E

5|$|Syracuse University (commonly {{referred}} to as Syracuse, 'Cuse, or SU) is a private research university in Syracuse, New York, United States. The institution's roots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded in 1831 by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York. After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian, although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|The Kačić's family <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), {{according to which}} the Kačićs {{were one of the}} twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} AAC <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> days of {{classical}} Rome and Greece, {{with the first}} recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf. The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Me and Juliet <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{early days of}} the {{relationship}} between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the backstage world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the cultural tolerance in The King and I.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Veerashaiva {{movement}} which preached {{devotion to}} the god Shiva with an insistence on a classless society and had its inspiration from the lower classes of society, the haridasa movement started from the higher echelons and preached {{devotion to the}} god Vishnu in a more flexible caste-based society, eventually becoming popular among the common people. The beginnings of the haridasa tradition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vaishnava school of Dvaita philosophy pioneered by Madhvacharya. Its influence on Kannada literature in the early 14th century {{is seen in the}} earliest known compositions written by Naraharitirtha, a prominent disciple of Madhvacharya.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's time as {{the pastor}} of Glarus and Einsiedeln was {{characterized}} by inner growth and development. He perfected his Greek and he took up the study of Hebrew. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which {{he was able to}} draw upon classical, patristic, and scholastic works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative pacifism and his focus on preaching <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of Erasmus.|$|E
