40|$|A tissue <b>culture</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{described}} which permits the quantitative {{evaluation of the}} intracellular survival of staphylococci within leucocytes. Staphylococcus aureus survived, but did not multiply, within neutrophils and monocytes of normal rabbits. The same was true of normal human blood leucocytes. Staphylococcus albus {{on the other hand}} was destroyed by these cells under the same conditions. Rat monocytes destroyed S. aureus and S. albus with equal facility. Although most experiments were carried out in the presence of 50 µg. streptomycin/ml., similar results were obtained without the use of this antibiotic. The applications of the tissue <b>culture</b> <b>procedure</b> with regard to studies on virulence and immunity in staphylococcal disease are discussed...|$|E

Objectives In this study determine of prevalence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis and identification of Candida species was investigated. Patients and Methods In this cross-sectional study study, 350 females selected and examined by wet mount and <b>culture</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results The prevalence rate, by means of <b>culture</b> <b>procedure</b> was 26 %. Candida albicans was responsible for 81. 3 % episodes of volvovaginal candidiasis.

40|$|MICROSCOPIC {{examination}} of mycobacterial specimens can rapidly provide clinically useful information without the prolonged delay inherent in <b>culture</b> <b>procedures.</b> How-ever, {{the reliability of}} the acid-fast stain is controversial (1 - 5). In 1975, Boyd and Marr (1) retrospectively re-viewed the experience with acid-fast stains at this hospi-tal and reported that 55 % of positive results of smears were false positive. Beginning in 1976, we prospectively examined the stain and <b>culture</b> <b>procedures</b> in the Barnes Hospital my-cobacteriology laboratory. The results of this analysis, which form the basis of this report, indicate that the acid-fast stain can be a sensitive, specific, and highly predictive test for mycobacterial disease.

40|$|An accelerated, direct immunofluorescent-antibody {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} the detection of Salmonella in food products. This method includes pre-enrichment and selective enrichment but eliminates many of the washing and smear treatments present in existing methods. Commercially available fluorescein-conjugated somatic antiserum was used in comparing this method with conventional culture, biochemical, and serological procedures. The 894 samples tested represented 39 different products. The fluorescent-antibody procedure detected Salmonella in 216 test samples as compared to 205 positives recovered by using the standard <b>culture</b> <b>procedures.</b> In no instance did the fluorescent-antibody procedure fail to detect a Salmonella positive which had been detected by the standard procedure. With a three-tube, most-probable-number procedure, the fluorescent-antibody method was able to detect Salmonella at a level of 0. 036 organism per g.

Cultures were raised from shoot explants of six year-old plants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and benzyladenine (BA). A sequential treatment of callus with increasing BA levels and decreasing NAA ensured shoot bud induction.

40|$|Some protozoans {{isolated}} from aquatic habitats, including domestic water supplies, can support the intracellular replication of autochthonous legionellae in vitro. We studied {{the effect of}} incubating water samples containing amoebae on the sensitivity of culture for legionellae. Samples collected during investigations of legionellosis epidemics and shown by conventional <b>culture</b> <b>procedures</b> to contain amoebae, but not legionellae, were incubated at 35 degrees C and replated. Legionellae were recovered from 59 of 144 such samples. Species isolated included L. pneumophila, L. anisa, L. bozemanii, L. gormanii, L. micdadei, L. rubrilucens, L. sainthelensi, L. steigerwaltii, and an unnamed species. Acanthamoeba polyphaga, Acanthamoeba hatchetti, a Rosculus sp., Hartmannella vermiformis, and Vahlkampfia spp. were among the autochthonous amoebae identified. Legionellae were recovered by this procedure from only 3 of 63 samples that were negative for amoebae by conventional <b>culture</b> <b>procedures.</b> These results show that water samples negative for legionellae, but positive for amoebae, by standard culture techniques should be incubated and replated to maximize the sensitivity of culture for legionellae...|$|R
50|$|Although highly specific, {{bacterial}} culture of H. influenzae lacks in sensitivity. Use of antibiotics prior to sample collection greatly reduces the isolation rate by killing the bacteria before identification is possible. Beyond this, H. influenzae is a finicky bacterium to culture, and any modification of <b>culture</b> <b>procedures</b> can greatly reduce isolation rates. Poor quality of laboratories {{in developing countries}} has resulted in poor isolation rates of H. influenzae.|$|R

40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} (Chlamydiazyme) for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis was evaluated on genital specimens from 96 men and 272 women attending a clinic for {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STD clinic). Compared with a direct immunofluorescence test for chlamydial elementary bodies, the {{enzyme immunoassay}} had a sensitivity of 58 % on specimens from men, a specificity of 90 %, a positive predictive value of 93 %, and a negative predictive value of 88 %; the assay had a sensitivity of 67 % on specimens from women, a specificity of 89 %, a positive predictive value of 63 % and a negative predictive value of 90 %. Immunofluorescence provided the most stringent test {{for the performance of}} the enzyme immunoassay as values were improved a little when a cell <b>culture</b> <b>procedure</b> was used for comparison. Further evidence for the lack of sensitivity was the detection of elementary bodies, sometimes in large numbers, in the enzyme immunoassay buffer of 13 of 19 specimens that had given a negative enzyme immunoassay result and the finding in comparative titrations of four laboratory strains that the enzyme immunoassay was at least 100 -fold less able to detect chlamydiae than either immunofluorescence or the cell <b>culture</b> <b>procedure.</b> Lack of specificity may be associated with the finding that the enzyme immunoassay antibody reacted with strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and group B streptococci.

The protoplast plating efficiency was highest on the MEM, followed by MS 2, MS 1 and AE. However, plant regeneration frequencies were highest for MS 1, followed by MS 2, MEM and AE. The protoclonal plants differed in the morphology of leaves, flowers, spikelets, and panicles in comparison to seed-derived plants. They varied in almost every phenotypic characters evaluated. In many cases, the variation was significantly different in characteristics such as plant height, flag leaf length and width and ratio, and in panicle characteristics such as panicle length, number of primary branches, and number of spikelets per panicle. The number of seeds per panicle was greatly reduced in protoclonal plants when compared with seed-derived control plants. The seeds showed also significant differences in grain length and width in comparison to the control plants. Among the 4 groups of protoclonal plants derived from the 4 different <b>culturing</b> <b>procedures</b> themselves, there were also variations in almost all the phenotypic characteristics assessed. close 91...|$|R
