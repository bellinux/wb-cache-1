The results of the investigations disclosed that higher the degree of <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorder,</b> the larger became the blood volume in circulation in the majority of cases under study, but there were some, though the number was small, that manifested no increase in the blood volume although they were suffering from high degree of <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorder.</b> They might be called 2 ̆ 2 metabolic disturbance of oligemia. 2 ̆ 2 A research into the cause of why the blood volume behaved in this manner revealed some interesting. observations. In the metabolic disturbance of high degree, a high degree of dropsy occurred both in the cases in which blood volume was increased and those in which blood volume did not increase, but in the latter serum protein levels, especially the ratio of albumin to globulin, were marked lowered. It will readily be seen that this phenomenon is due to an increase in the consumption of albumin brought about by the multiplication of acid matters in the tissues because of the high degree of disturbance. The resultant difference in the colloidosmotic pressure of the blood would have influenced the transfer of serous fluid between the blood and the tissues. To sum up, there existed close relationship between the behavior of blood volume in circulation and the gegree of metabolic disturbance and dropsy...|$|R

50|$|Results {{from animal}} and human studies {{support the use}} of Danshen for <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorders</b> to some extent because it is known to {{decrease}} the blood's ability to clot in at least two ways.

Both these effects help to improve blood circulation. In addition, chemicals in danshen may relax and widen blood vessels, especially those around the heart. In animal studies, chemicals in danshen may also have protected the inner linings of arteries from damage. Some other research suggests it may increase the force of heartbeats and slow the heart rate slightly.|$|E
40|$|Pathologic {{study of}} sepcimens {{of the lungs}} from 31 autopsy cases of dystrophia, not {{including}} those of aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis, produced the following result: There were marked congestion and edema in all the specimens examined. Microscopic study of the specimens from the cases in {{early stages of the}} disease showed atrophy and edematous thickenning of the walls of the alveoli pulmonum, congestion of the capillaries, perivascular infiltration of the round cells, edema, deposition of fibrin, diapedesis of leukocytes and erythrocytes in the alveoli pulmonum, and proliferation of the desquamative epithelial cells. These pathologic changes, which suggest the presence of <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorder</b> or the so-called serous inflammation, closely resemble the pathologic changes that are observed in uremic pneumonia. This indicates that toxemia may have been present in these cases. The alveolar sac, when its insusceptibility to noxious agents is lowered by prodromal changes like the ones described above, is liable to provide an ideal condition for multiplication of micro-organisms, developing alveolitis eventually. Many specimens under, study showed evidence of pneumonia. A lowered vital resistance was also in evidence in these specimens, where there was a tendency to necrosis and progressive inflammation of the lung tissue, with marked perifocal inflammation. Pathologic changes in the bronchi were more moderate than those in the alveoli, supporting a view that in these cases alveolitis might first occur, and pneumonia supervene, with changes in the alveoli taking place earlier than those in the bronchi. Professor Takizawa, based on the result of experiments on the effects of low caloric diet, low animal protein diet and fasting in dogs, as well as of pathologic study of various organs from cases of dystrophia, postulated that, 2 ̆ 2 besides atrophy of the tissue caused by defective nutrition, toxemia due to metabolic disturbance and <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorder</b> or the so-called serous inflammation, which is caused by toxemia, are the chief pathologic manifestations of dystrophia. 2 ̆ 2 The result of pathologic study, made by the author in the lung specimens from case of dystrophia, confirmed the presence of <b>circulatory</b> <b>disorder</b> or the so-called serous inflammation, i. e. metabolic toxemia.
