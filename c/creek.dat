5|$|A dam on Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck <b>Creek.</b> The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck <b>Creek.</b> After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck <b>Creek.</b> One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> headwaters.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the <b>creek</b> and its watershed. These include the Darby <b>Creek</b> Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby <b>Creek</b> Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for {{riparian}} restoration on Darby <b>Creek.</b> Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the <b>creek.</b> Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the <b>creek</b> and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby <b>Creek</b> Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby <b>Creek</b> Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|About {{one mile}} past Sterling Ditch, the river turns west. It {{receives}} another major tributary, Yale <b>Creek,</b> on the left. Yale <b>Creek</b> drains nearly , {{making it the}} largest of the Little Applegate's tributaries by watershed area. From Yale <b>Creek,</b> the Little Applegate flows northwest, receiving water from Sterling <b>Creek</b> on the right. The town of Buncom is located at the mouth of Sterling <b>Creek.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>creek's</b> named tributaries from {{source to}} mouth are Rebel, Jackson, and Doak <b>creeks</b> {{followed}} by Fox Hollow.

5|$|Abrahams <b>Creek</b> has a {{watershed}} association {{known as the}} Abrahams <b>Creek</b> Watershed Association. It was awarded the Watershed Stewardship Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009. The organization also received a $5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality, adding riparian buffers, and other projects. Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams <b>Creek</b> Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created. The <b>creek</b> {{was used as a}} reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon <b>Creek.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abrahams <b>Creek</b> {{is named}} after a {{historic}} Mohican chief of a village in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure {{was built in the}} watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been built over the <b>creek</b> since 1925. The Abrahams <b>Creek</b> Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was built on the <b>creek</b> in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams <b>Creek</b> is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the <b>creek</b> floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the <b>creek</b> in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the <b>creek.</b> However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The <b>creek</b> has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E

5|$|Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park, {{which is}} located at the lower extreme of Sulphur <b>Creek,</b> {{supports}} far more native species than the Sulphur <b>Creek</b> watershed (see Wildlife of Aliso <b>Creek</b> for detail).|$|E
5|$|All sub-{{watershed}}s of the Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> watershed contain {{at least}} 50 percent forest. A {{number of streams}} in the upper Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> watershed, in fact, have more than 80 percent forest coverage. Only 55 percent of the Black <b>Creek</b> watershed is covered by forest. Most sub-watersheds of Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> have {{only a small amount}} of barren land. However, the Cranberry <b>Creek</b> watershed contains 6.5 percent barren land, the Black <b>Creek</b> watershed contains 14 percent, and the Stony <b>Creek</b> watershed contains 30 percent. The Little Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> watershed contains 30 percent farmland and the Nescopeck <b>Creek</b> watershed contains 24 percent.

5|$|Buffalo <b>Creek</b> {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and Buffalo Gap. The <b>creek</b> then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the <b>creek</b> enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The <b>creek</b> then flows into southern West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo <b>Creek</b> picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo <b>Creek</b> and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo <b>Creek</b> has {{a higher}} level of {{bacterial}} contamination than the nearby Penns <b>Creek</b> and White Deer <b>Creek.</b> There is a possibility of fecal contamination in the <b>creek.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catawissa <b>Creek</b> enters Columbia County in Beaver Township. It {{immediately}} {{passes by}} Bunker Hill and makes several meanders and passes by Beaver Valley. An old Conrail railroad starts paralleling Catawissa <b>Creek</b> at this point. In {{the southern part}} of Beaver Township, the <b>creek</b> is situated between Buck Mountain to the east and Catawissa Mountain to the west. The <b>creek</b> takes a sharp turn westwards as it passes by Shumans, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses the <b>creek</b> and Beaver Run flows into it. The <b>creek</b> closely follows Catawissa Mountain for a short distance before turning northwards and passing close to McCauley Mountain. It meanders past Dry Ridge and then Full Mill Hill, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses it again. The <b>creek</b> makes a hairpin turn northwards and picks up Gap Run before exiting Beaver Township.|$|E

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} <b>creek</b> have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the <b>creek,</b> excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the <b>creek.</b> The <b>creek</b> is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso <b>Creek</b> and its neighbor San Juan <b>Creek.</b> This includes physical damage to <b>creek</b> banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|Flat <b>Creek,</b> a small southeast-flowing stream, {{rises in}} two forks and empties into the Sacramento River {{upstream}} of Spring <b>Creek.</b> The stream receives contaminated runoff from the Minnesota Flats Tailing Pile, {{but is not}} nearly as polluted or acidic as Spring <b>Creek.</b> Another stream, Rock <b>Creek,</b> rises in three forks and flows east to meet the Sacramento River downstream of Spring <b>Creek</b> and the Keswick Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Hard {{surfacing}} {{of roads}} {{in part of}} the Kettle <b>Creek</b> watershed began in 1930 to 1938. The Alvin R. Bush Dam {{was built on the}} <b>creek</b> in the late 1950s to protect against flooding. The <b>creek</b> was the subject of an Operation Scarlift study from 1970 to 1972. A USGS gauge was installed on the stream in 1972. The Kettle <b>Creek</b> Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s.

50|$|The {{region was}} {{formerly}} crossed by different <b>creeks</b> and lagoons, {{some of which}} were refilled and other tubed. Among the most important <b>creeks</b> are: Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many <b>creeks</b> were channeled and rectified, as floods were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most <b>creeks</b> were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue (north of this district).|$|R
50|$|Named tributaries from {{source to}} mouth are North Fork Mohawk River and South Fork Mohawk River {{followed}} by Log, Bette, Drury, Shotgun, Polly, Mill, and Cartwright <b>creeks.</b> Further downstream come Parsons and McGowan <b>creeks,</b> then Alder Branch followed by Spores, Stafford, and Sister <b>creeks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Harveys <b>Creek</b> {{is one of}} {{four major}} sources of {{flooding}} in Lake Township. The other three are Pikes <b>Creek,</b> Fades <b>Creek,</b> and Beaver Run. However, the floods of these creeks have not caused much damage since Lake Township is relatively undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Lenni Lenape people {{inhabited}} {{the area in}} the vicinity of Darby <b>Creek.</b> By the 17th century, the Dutch and Swedish had arrived in the area, followed some years later by the English. Numerous mills of various types were eventually build along the <b>creek</b> and several railroads traversed the watershed. In modern times, grants by various organizations have been awarded to improve the <b>creek</b> and its watershed. The Darby <b>Creek</b> Valley Association operates within the watershed. Part of the creek's length is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, part is a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Various species of fish, including redbreast sunfish, eels, and trout, inhabit it. Several areas {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>creek</b> are listed on the Delaware County Natural Areas Inventory. These include the Darby <b>Creek</b> Mouth Mudflat, the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, and the Ithan-Darby <b>Creek</b> Wetlands. A reach of the <b>creek</b> is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|Hunlock <b>Creek</b> is {{also known}} as Hunlocks <b>Creek.</b> This name appears on Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map from 1984. The <b>creek</b> was known as Massacota by the Native Americans.|$|E
