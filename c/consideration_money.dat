It is true some time had elapsed since the war of Pontiac, but some of the Indian tribes were almost ready to resume the hatchet. The Delawares, Shawnees, and Mingoes, complained that the Six Nations had not given them their full share of the <b>consideration</b> <b>money</b> of the late sale, and they talked of exacting the deficiency from the white men who came to settle in what had been their hunting-grounds. Traders, squatters, and other adventurers into the wilderness, were occasionally murdered, and further troubles were apprehended.|$|E
60|$|Another of {{the moral}} {{phenomena}} of Little Dorrit. Besides her <b>consideration</b> <b>money,</b> her daily contract included meals. She had an extraordinary repugnance to dining in company; would never do so, {{if it were possible}} to escape. Would always plead that she had this bit of work to begin first, or that bit of work to finish first; and would, of a certainty, scheme and plan--not very cunningly, it would seem, for she deceived no one--to dine alone. Successful in this, happy in carrying off her plate anywhere, to make a table of her lap, or a box, or the ground, or even as was supposed, to stand on tip-toe, dining moderately at a mantel-shelf; the great anxiety of Little Dorrit's day was set at rest.|$|E
60|$|It was in June, 1650, about {{eighteen}} {{months after the}} decapitation of his father, that Charles was ready to set out on his expedition to attempt the recovery of his rights to the English throne. He was but twenty years of age. He took with him no army, no supplies, no resources. He had {{a small number of}} attendants and followers, personally interested themselves in his success, and animated also, probably, by some degree of disinterested attachment to him. It was, however, on the whole, a desperate enterprise. Queen Henrietta, in her retirement at the Louvre, felt very anxious about the result of it. Charles himself, too, notwithstanding his own buoyant and sanguine temperament, and the natural confidence and hope pertaining to his years, must have felt many forebodings. But his condition on the Continent was getting every month more and more destitute and forlorn. He was a mere guest wherever he went, and destitute of means as he was, he found himself continually sinking in public <b>consideration.</b> <b>Money</b> as well as rank is very essentially necessary to make a relative a welcome guest, for any long time, in aristocratic circles. Charles concluded, therefore, that, all things considered, it was best for him to make a desperate effort to recover his kingdoms.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{often make}} product choices that involve the <b>consideration</b> of <b>money</b> and time. Building on dual-process models, the authors propose {{that these two}} basic {{resources}} activate qualitatively different modes of processing: while money is processed analytically, time is processed more affectively. Importantly, this distinction then influences the stability of consumer preferences. An initial set of three experiments demonstrates that, compared with a control condition free of the consideration of either resource, <b>money</b> <b>consideration</b> generates significantly more violations of transitivity in product choice, while time consideration has no such impact. The next three experiments use multiple approaches to demonstrate the role of different processing modes associated with <b>money</b> versus time <b>consideration</b> in this result.

5000|$|On February 24, 1840, Darius Starbuck {{was written}} into the will of his [...] "friend" [...] Thomas Adams of Stokes County; Starbuck was also named {{executor}} of this will. This was witnessed by Thomas J. Wilson. In the will, Starbuck was named heir to an enslaved family owned by Adams upon {{the death of his}} wife Lucy, on the condition that Starbuck would emancipate them [...] "as soon as the law will allow." [...] They were named Syphax, Letty, and their children Syphax L., Mary Addine (Mary Magdeline), and Sarah Jane (Sally). The will was notarized on 15 July 1843. On June 22, 1844, however, Starbuck purchased the family for $85.20. Mr. and Mrs. Adams were to continue using Syphax and his family for labor until both of their deaths. Under the new terms Starbuck was to instead free the family after they had [...] "worked out the <b>consideration</b> <b>money</b> and interest". This mandated that the family work as Indentured servants for Starbuck until the price Starbuck had paid for them—with interest—was returned to him either through labor or by payment. This bill of sale also mentions two more children, Emeline (Nancy Adeline) and Lewis. At the time of purchase in 1844 Syphax was aged about 26 and his wife Letty was about 30. This deed of sale was witnessed by John Hasten, who had to confirm this in court in April 1845. The estate files of Thomas Adams were probated in 1848.|$|E
40|$|Godley and Lavoie’s book {{represents}} a remarkable achievement that, on theoretical grounds, can be contrasted to the {{computable general equilibrium}} of the mainstream; furthermore, it lays down the methodological basis for realistic macroeconometric models to guide economic policy. The authors present a set of models in increasing order of complexity where the economy is split into the five institutional sectors of national accounting (households, production firms, financial institutions, government, central bank), with a systematic integration of the real and financial aspects within a comprehensive stock/flow consistent double accounting system. The book encompasses all the main characteristics of the post-Keynesian paradigm. Thus, the economy is demand-led, institutions have a life and rationality of their own (they are not a “veil”), expectations are taken into <b>consideration,</b> <b>money</b> is fully endogenous, there is no profit maximization but firms set their prices {{on the basis of}} the mark-up principle, etc. The methodological chapter 2 shows how the sectoral interdependence and the links between the real and financial components of the economy can be represented with the help of two kinds of matrices: a balance sheet matrix for stocks, and a transactions flow matrix establishing the link between flows and the ensuing changes in stocks. It is thus made apparent how the financia...|$|E
