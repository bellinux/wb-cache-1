40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} impart how Lowell Liebermann {{incorporates}} <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>tonal</b> elements into his twentieth-century Concerto for Piccolo. This {{will be shown}} through {{a detailed analysis of}} the three-movement work highlighting how the composer uses characteristics of common practice tonality as compiled by Joseph Straus in the third edition of his text, Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory. This document is organized into five sections. The first explains background information on the concerto as well as presents the parameters to be used for the analysis. The second through fourth sections provide an analysis of each movement in chronological order, detailing how the characteristics for tonality are used or if they are dismissed in favor of more contemporary compositional techniques. The final section provides an overview of the tonal attributes of the entire work based on the detailed analyses provided for each movement. The closing statement aims to round out the discussion and reiterate why this concerto is a valuable addition to the piccolo’s repertoire. Advisor: Stanley V. Kleppinge...|$|R

40|$|Allusions, Illusions and Delusions (2013) is {{an eight}} minute work for full {{orchestra}} that blends elements of lyricism with fast kinetic music, orchestral tutti with smaller groupings and solos, and familiar harmonic language with more exotic combinations. The piece {{begins with a}} bang, employing a figure that blurs the distinction between major and minor triads. After the ensuing short introduction, the flugelhorn’s lyrical theme becomes the main focus; indeed, elements of this solo line help to shape the entire piece. Following an expansive orchestral tutti built on this theme, the line and the ensemble are broken down and small groups of instruments begin a climb to the fast section of the piece. The longest portion of the score, this fast section takes the listener on a roller coaster ride with sharp turns and many ups and downs. The ride continues building more and more intensity and energy until the climax, marked in the score “huge and bombastic. ” As this cacophonous “wall of sound” dies down, four solo strings and a clarinet emerge, recalling moments of the flugelhorn solo. A solo bucket muted trumpet presents a final paraphrase of the theme, bringing the piece to a calm and soothing resolution. Allusions, Illusions and Delusions takes its title from elements of the piece itself and {{from a number of}} external influences. The lyrical flugelhorn solo beginning at measure 27, the rapidly changing harmonies of the fast section, polychordal segments (such as the Eb major/d minor simultaneous sonority found in measures 87 through 89), and the climax at J, allude to the sounds of triadic harmonies from <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>tonal</b> music. Aspects of these harmonies also create a sense of illusion: The main melodic and harmonic sounds used in the piece are intervals of seconds and thirds, and their inversions. By using minor seconds simultaneously as melodic and harmonic intervals, the quality of a triad or chord is often blurred, fooling the listener into thinking that they are hearing a triad, when five or more notes might actually be present. Delusion refers to the way a listener might react to the music. Often listeners invent a story to go along with a piece of music as a way for them to organize and understand the musical journey that they are experiencing. When there is no extra-musical idea tied to the piece at all, as in this instance, listeners might well be deluding themselves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Image mosaicing is {{stirring}} {{up a lot}} of interests in the research community for both its scientific significance and potential spinoff in real world applications. Being able to perform automatic image alignment in a <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> and spatial reference can trigger a wide range of higher level image processing tasks such as panoramic image construction, scene depth computation, resolution enhancement, motion detection and tracking using non stationary camera. In this work we propose a fully automated real time on-line mosaicing algorithm able to build high quality seam-free panoramic images. Moreover, the whole approach does not exploit any a priori information regarding scene geometry, acquisition device properties or feedback signals, thus resulting in a fully image based solution. Extensive experiments have been accomplished to assess the quality of the attained mosaics by using them as the background to perform motion detection and tracking with a Pan Tilt Zoom camera. ...|$|R

40|$|The vastly {{divergent}} {{reactions to}} twelve-tone composition of George Perle, David Del Tredici and Nicholas Thorne are a vivid reflection {{not only of}} their different generations, but of the unfolding of musical style change in America.

Thorne, born in 1953, gave little thought to twelve-tone composition. “It was the generation before me who had this monkey on its back, ” he says. Instead, Thorne came to maturity amid the welter of styles, from minimalism to neo-Romanticism, that characterized America during the 1970 s.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Liszt {{scholarship}} of recent decades has produced research along many lines of inquiry in an endeavor to increase {{recognition of the}} composer {{as one of the}} most important and influential musical figures of the nineteenth century. While a great deal of this discourse has been devoted to uncovering Liszt’s influence on the twentieth century on many fronts, there has been a noticeable lack of substantive investigation of the ways in which Liszt sowed the seeds of the musical Impressionism of Debussy and Ravel through the evocative writing of his nature pieces for piano. This study aims to fill that void by exploring the ways in which this influence came about, first through an examination of his most significant pieces of nature music, followed by an illumination of the innovative framework of suggestive writing that he pioneered through these pieces. Specifically, the study will detail the ways in which Liszt achieved vivid sensual and pictorial suggestion through a number of compositional strategies: 1) the subversion of <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> practices; 2) the manipulation of the musical canvas to influence perceptions of time and physical distance; 3) the development of a vocabulary for pictorial suggestion that was idiomatic to the piano; and 4) the use of performative gesture to enhance the meaning of such vocabulary. Finally, this framework will be applied to the Impressionistic piano pieces of Debussy and Ravel to reveal their debts to Liszt’s innovative writing, which have often been obscured by the differences in surface aesthetic. In the end, the conclusions drawn from this study suggest that Liszt’s legacy in this regard extends well beyond the music of the French Impressionists, exerting direct and indirect influence on all subsequent composers of evocative piano music...|$|R

The compositional procedures of Cantus have been subject to all the conventional rigors of counterpoint and harmony despite its seeming incompatibility with aleatory.

40|$|This exegesis is a {{document}} of my rediscovery of emotion and expression in my music. It {{is also a}} chronicle of my acknowledgement and incorporation into my methodology of my many influences. Moreover, it is a recounting of how I utilized emotion, expression, and my various influences {{in the creation of}} the folio compositions. There are two primary aspects that unify the compositions in the folio. The first aspect is the diversity of musical and extra-musical models, such as art music, popular music, literature, and films, which influence the compositional process. The second aspect is that an expressive ethos, defmed as a general affective or emotional state that expressively informs the composition, characterizes each work and affects the compositional process. There are two basic types of expressive ethos that are represented in the folio compositions. The first type I call "cinunerian" and it is concerned with what might be considered negative emotional states such as anger, grief, or fear. The second one, the "elysian" ethos, is concerned with what might be considered positive emotional states, such as happiness, excitement, or joy. Most of the folio compositions represent either the cirrunerian or elysian ethos. However, there are a few compositions that do not represent merely one expressive state, but are concerned with the transformation from one ethos to the other, typically from the cimmerian to the elysian. I refer to the transformation of the expressive ethos in these compositions as "protean. " In the exegesis, I clearly define the above features, clarify their relationship to music history, explain my compositional methodology, and demonstrate the role of each aspect throughout the process. I provide a brief discussion of my placement, literally and aesthetically, in music history (Chapter 1), focusing primarily on my relationship to three prominent trends in the twentieth century. I also discuss how I formulated compositional and aesthetic conclusions and how they informed my current praxis (Chapter 2). In the chapters focusing on the cinunerian (Chapter 3), elysian (Chapter 4), and protean (Chapter 5) works, I explain in detail each ethos and how I utilize musical and extra-musical influences in my compositions. In short, this exegesis examines, with examples from the folio, how I am incorporating more traditional affective techniques and past <b>tonal</b> <b>practices</b> as they have been filtered through and influenced by the musical environment of the last century...|$|R

40|$|Gustav Mahler {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a dramatist of music. The idea that his music can tell a story has been widely recognized. Drawing on a biographical or a biography-related approach, numerous scholastic efforts have been made to investigate the content of his narratives. However, inquiries on the content have overshadowed the very question of its formation in music. Subsequent to Seth Monahan’s extensive study on Mahler’s symphonic sonata forms, we see a comprehensive interpretive framework of Mahler’s musical drama. Monahan believed that the traditional model of sonata form can be used to account for the narratives in all of Mahler’s early- and middle-period symphonies. Nevertheless, such a paradigm is said to lose its explanatory power after the Sixth Symphony. The extended <b>tonal</b> <b>practice</b> emerging in Mahler’s late maturity has posed a challenge {{to the understanding of the}} narrative in these late works. The possibility of having more than one tonic in extended tonality diminishes much of the sense of the one and only tonal center, which results in the apparent collapse of the traditional sonata scheme. Analysts are hence reluctant to apply the concept of sonata form when addressing the narratives in Mahler’s late symphonies. This, however, does not imply that sonata form can no longer be used to understand Mahler’s late symphonic narratives. The characteristics of sonata form are still present and thus shall have their own functions in his late works. The present thesis argues that the concept of sonata form continues to play a significant role in constructing the late Mahlerian symphonic narratives. Sonata form does not withdraw all at once from being the paradigmatic musical plot, yet it assumes its function in a very different way in Mahler’s late works. It is driven below the musical surface, staying as an underlying dramatic backbone that governs the narrative of the extended tonal process. Chapter One begins by presenting issues about articulating the narrativity in Mahler’s music. Chapter Two addresses the problems in understanding Mahler’s conception of form in the late symphonies. I identify the changing notions of form and content inherent in Mahler’s compositional thought, which clarifies the ambiguous relationship between form and tonality that appears to have completely separated after the Sixth. Chapter Three offers an analysis of the first movement of the Seventh Symphony, where the disengagement from the traditional sonata scheme begins. Tension generates between the conformity to the traditional sonata form on the surface and the emergence of the new narrative engine drawn on the double-tonic complex. Chapter Four shows the full realization of a different narrative construct in the first movement of the Ninth. Sonata form is reinterpreted as a set of “tonal rhetoric” that governs the tonal drama of the double- tonic complex. The ambivalence between classical and modern practices that stretch across Mahler’s late symphonies is finally resolved with the complete integration of sonata form into extended tonality. It is in this hybridity we find Mahler’s modernist tendency towards his late life. published_or_final_versionMusicMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

However, the current methods for instructing in function still leave students confused or baffled, as they struggle to match functional concepts to labels that do not exemplify their analysis goals and methods that insist on starting from tiny detail instead of coming from a more complete musical perspective. The elaboration of each detail of my Functional Analysis system shows how each part of Functional Analysis has been designed to help make harmonic analysis quicker, easier, more intuitive, and more personalized. The greater pedagogical implications on a larger scale involving courses and curricula are also covered, informed by my experience both as a teacher of today’s standard system and from teaching Functional Analysis in the classroom...|$|R

Michael Kibbe (1945 -) (dramatic duet for baritone and cello) The music for this recital was chosen with two main criteria in mind: 1) to challenge myself in preparing music {{from some of}} the larger, collective forms of the standard vocal literature; and 2) to prepare and present music which is of special interest to me from both a musicalogical and performance viewpoint. 	The first criteria was fulfilled by selecting, for the opening half of this recital, an entire German solo cantata with instrumental accompaniment and a complete cycle of French melodies. The second criteria was fulfilled by programming solely American songs for the second half of this recital. 	Johann Sebatstian Bach???s Cantata BWV 82 (Ich habe genug) opens the recital. This work, written for the Festival of the Purification of Mary, stands at the crossroads between Bach???s earlier cantata style of arias, choruses and chorale verses and his later, more operatic style of cantata, using the da capo aria and secco recitative between arias. Using Biblical text for only the first aria, Bach paints three different musical pictures of the poet???s longing for the peace of death in the arms of Jesus while unifying them within a <b>common</b> <b>tonal</b> basis. The opening aria, in c minor, is a long and passionate cry for relief from the sufferings of the world, requiring great vocal intensity and stamina to carry the long, arching phrases to their conclusion. The second aria, in the relative E major, is a slumber song whose flowing melody requires delicacy and tenderness of presentation. The concluding aria, returning to c minor, contrasts the opening aria by requiring extended coloratura to express the ecstatic expectation of death within robust, dance-like music. 	Completing the cantata is Gabriel Faure???s cycle of four melodies, L???Horizon Chimerique, Op. 118, written in 1922 and the last of Faure???s many melodies. The theme of the cycle is much the same as the cantata ??? the desire to escape the sufferings of the earth. The poet, Jean de la Ville de Mirmont, dreams of the sea as his escape but in the end must return to land, leaving a feeling of longing and resignation not found in the cantata. The challenge of the cycle is to combine the flowing melodic lines and the syllabically set poetry with the piano accompaniment to create the moods and feelings of the breezes, the sea, and the moon and the land.

This study examines the music of mid twentieth-century jazz composer Thad Jones in light of an extended common practice, explicating ways in which this music might be best understood as tonal. Drawing from analyses of three of Jones’s big band compositions: To You, Three and One, and Cherry Juice, this study examines three primary elements in detail. First is Jones’s use of chord-scale application techniques in the orchestration over various chordal qualities represented by the symbols, revealing traditional as well as innovative methods by Jones. Second is Jones’s use of harmonic progressions, demonstrating his connection to past practice as well as modern jazz variations. Third is Jones’s use of contrapuntal connections and their traditional relationship to functional tonality, but in a chromatic scale-based environment.

No scanner can yet do this for a 500 foot colour roll. Recent improvements attempt to extend this performance on the DSW to colour, {{while at the same time}} improving image quality and control. Leica Geosystems has undertaken a number of innovations aimed at these goals, including: large format 12 -bit sensor; novel LED illumination system, to increase amount and uniformity of light, enlarge the illuminated area to maximize scanning speed, reduce cost and improve reliability; coatings on stage plate and cover glass to eliminate Newton Rings; higher performance linear encoders to optimise geometric integrity; software refinements, including ease-of-use features and JPEG 2000. These advances are incorporated in a new model, the DSW 700, but most are available to users of existing scanners by means of a well defined upgrade program. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} orthographic {{analyses of}} selected works of Musorgsky. The thesis argues that more traditional methods, such as voice-leading analysis or set-theory analysis, are, {{because of their}} particular historical and stylistic origins, limited in their application to Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music and, on this basis, it sets out to demonstrate {{the value of an}} orthographic approach. The thesis takes existing orthographic analyses of the music of later transitional, or post-tonal, figures such as Skriabin and Bartók, and extends the application of this approach to an earlier transitional notation and attempts by composers to give cogent articulation to an increasing number of non-traditional pitch structures. The thesis falls into six chapters. The first chapter reviews common perceptions of Musorgsky, especially the notion that his music is somehow technically deficient or limited by a self-didactic eccentricity. It concludes by surveying analytical approaches to Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music, and orthographic analyses of Bartók and Skriabin. The second chapter expounds the methodological principles of orthographic analysis. It examines common-practice conventions of orthography and then takes typical orthographic "problems" found in post-common-practice styles in order to show how novel structures are illuminated by the notational friction described above. The chapter concludes with a case study of Brahms 2 ̆ 7 s Intermezzo op. 118, no 6, which demonstrates how conventions of common-practice notation are sustained in a piece from the central tradition. Chapters Three and Five are dedicated to the analysis of Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music. Each takes a work, or selections from a work, leading to a discussion of several related orthographic and tonal issues. The music examined includes selected passages from Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition, and the entire song cycle Sunless. Several issues arise from these analyses, notably Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s use of octave symmetry and polymodalism, and his radical conception of relationships between individual chords and prevailing keys. The sixth chapter synthesises these findings and presents a revised view of Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s <b>tonal</b> thinking and <b>practice,</b> based on his orthography. At the centre of these findings lie key observations concerning the fusion in his music of "functional" and "non-functional" elements. This concluding chapter also speculates on the further potential role of orthographic analytical methods for musics of a traditional nature, especially those of Eastern European traditions...|$|R
