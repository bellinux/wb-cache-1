50|$|Seaworthiness is {{a concept}} that runs through {{maritime}} law in at least four contractual relationships. In a marine insurance voyage policy, the assured warrants that the vessel is seaworthy. A <b>carrier</b> of goods <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> owes a duty to a shipper of cargo that the vessel is seaworthy {{at the start of the}} voyage. A shipowner warrants to a charterer that the vessel under charter is seaworthy; and similarly, a shipbuilder warrants that the vessel under construction will be seaworthy.|$|R

Launches are conducted from the Ocean Odyssey platform anchored on the equator in the Pacific Ocean, at a point with 154°W longitude, about 370 kilometres east of Kiritimati.|$|R

50|$|The Rotterdam Rules are a set {{of rules}} {{designed}} to replace the Hamburg Rules and the outdated Hague-Visby Rules (both of which are International Conventions to impose duties upon a <b>carrier</b> of goods <b>by</b> <b>sea).</b> Should the Rotterdam Rules come into effect, they would cover not merely the sea voyage, but all parts of any contract of carriage with a sea leg. Thereafter, land carriers, warehouses, and freight forwarders would need P&I cover. This would inevitably lead to an increase in the scope and importance of P&I cover, and might diminish the prevalence of standard cargo insurance.|$|R
50|$|These {{rules of}} law, whether common law or statute law, that {{regulate}} {{the obligations of}} <b>carriers</b> of goods <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> are of most importance in cases {{in which there is}} an affreightment without any written agreement. It is, therefore, convenient to consider first cases of this kind where there is no express agreement, oral or written, except as to the freight and destination of the goods, and where, consequently, the rights and obligations of the parties as to all other terms of carriage depend wholly upon the rules of law, remembering always that these same rules apply when there is a written contract, except insofar as they are qualified or negated by the terms of such contract.|$|R
40|$|Around two- {{third of}} the world's oil trade (crude oil & refined products) moves through tankers and other <b>carriers.</b> Oil transported <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> flows through fixed routes. Also, {{in the recent years}} the growth of new oil and gas {{exporting}} countries has increased. Even then, the Gulf region remains an energy hub for the global consumers at large. However, when the importing countries undergo huge risks and investment, these imports have no longer remained safe. External threats like piracy, civil war or terrorism have threatened the secure transit of energy supplies. This paper investigates the importance of energy transits, the volume of energy traded through them and hydrocarbon as a lifeline for the world. The paper holds an opinion that the few routes in the world act as a basic infrastructure and its security is essential. However, as the global demand for energy moves up, the concerns for energy security of these tankers and carriers passing through these routes will become ever more critical. Thus, the insurance costs in the energy industry will be increasing, regardless of the volume traded. The past decade have seen serious rise in piracy and terroris...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rules of}} the common or ancient {{customary}} English law {{with regard to the}} carriage of goods were no doubt first considered by the courts and established with regard to the carriage of goods <b>by</b> common <b>carriers</b> on land.
