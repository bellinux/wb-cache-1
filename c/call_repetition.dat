40|$|Female choice {{based on}} male call {{characteristics}} has been experimentally demonstrated {{in a number}} of species of anurans. In the Majorcan midwife toad, the male performs parental care by carrying the eggs in a string around his hind legs until they are ready to hatch. Both sexes produce calls to advertise sexual receptivity and both show phonotaxis towards the calls of the opposite sex. We used two-choice phonotaxis experiments to investigate whether females assess male caretaking ability using variation in call characteristics. Both call frequency and call duration are good indicators of male size, a characteristic that potentially influences the ability of males to successfully brood a clutch. Variation in <b>call</b> <b>repetition</b> rate and call intensity may also reflect differences in male caretaking ability, given the high energetic demands of calling behaviour in anurans. We predicted that females should prefer to mate with larger males and that this would be manifest in selective phonotaxis to low frequency and/or long duration calls. We also predicted that they would prefer calls produced at a fast rate and a high intensity. Contrary to our predictions females did not prefer lower frequency calls, longer calls or louder calls. They did however, selectively approach calls produced at a faster rate. These results are discussed in the context of sexual selection theory...|$|E

The drilling operation involved a number of vessels performing various activities, such as towing the drill rig, anchor handling, and drilling. Acoustic data were collected with six arrays of directional recorders (DASARs) deployed on the seafloor over ~ 7 weeks in Aug-Oct. Whale calls produced within 2 km of each DASAR were identified and localized using triangulation. A "tone index" was defined to quantify the presence and amplitude of tonal sounds from industrial machinery. The presence of airgun pulses originating from distant seismic operations was also quantified. For each 10 -min period {{at each of the}} 40 recorders, the number of whale calls localized was matched with the "dose" of industrial sound received, and the relationship between calling rates and industrial sound was modeled using negative binomial regression. The analysis showed that with increasing tone levels, bowhead whale calling rates initially increased, peaked, and then decreased. This dual behavioral response is similar to that described for bowhead whales and airgun pulses in earlier work. Increasing <b>call</b> <b>repetition</b> rates can be a viable strategy for combating decreased detectability of signals arising from moderate increases in background noise.

In some situations, however, repetition enhances recall of the second item; Dux and Coltheart (in press) <b>called</b> this effect <b>repetition</b> advantage (RA; see also Chun, 1997). In this study, we investigated two possible contributing factors to RA, (i) inter-target distinctiveness (manipulated by presenting targets in the same colour, or two different colours), and (ii) target-distractor distinctiveness (manipulated by presenting distractors in one consistent colour or multiple colours). Two target letters (either repeated or non-repeated) were displayed in either red or green among letter distractors that were either all black or all in different colours. Item lag between targets was 2, 3, or 4 items. Results showed that both factors affected RA; same-colour targets produced more RA than different-colour targets, and all-black distractors led to greater RA than all-colour distractors. The advantage of repetition also increased with increasing lag. These results supported that RA could be found under the paradigm of RB with simple manipulation of the stimuli. Based on these results, the condition for RA and the possible relationship between RA and RB were discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Throughout the paper, we focus on the scenario of a transmitter with n = 2 antennas. The idea behind R-TSTD is to use only one antenna at a time while still ensuring that all constellation symbols are transmitted via both antennas. Thus, unlike the classical TSTD technique, R-TSTD does provide a transmit diversity effect similar to that achieved with space-time coding (STC) algorithms. The error performance of the proposed R-TSTD system is compared to that of the Alamouti STC scheme via Monte Carlo computer simulations. It is shown that, in the absence of any outer error-correcting code, Alamouti STC slightly outperforms R-TSTD. However, when a near-capacity channel code is employed as an outer code, the error performance achieved using R-TSTD is significantly better than that obtained with Alamouti STC, provided that the desired spectral efficiency is sufficiently low. © 2011 National Institute of Inform...|$|R

This phenomenon, <b>called</b> <b>repetition</b> suppression (RS), {{has been shown to}} be modulated by expectation. Typically, this is achieved by varying the probability of stimulus repetitions (Prep) between blocks of an experiment, generating an abstract expectation that 'things will repeat'. Here, we examined whether stimulus-specific expectations also modulate RS. We designed a task where expectation and repetition are manipulated independently, using stimulus-specific expectations. We investigated to which extent such stimulus-specific expectations modulated the visual evoked response to objects in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and primary visual cortex (V 1), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In LOC, we found that RS interacted with expectation, such that repetition suppression was more pronounced for unexpected relative to expected stimuli. Additionally, we found that the response of stimulus-preferring voxels in V 1 was generally decreased when stimuli were expected. These results suggest that stimulus-specific expectations about objects modulate LOC and propagate back to the earliest cortical station processing visual input...|$|R
