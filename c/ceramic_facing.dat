40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of new high-performance mechanical seals working in severe conditions requires higher material performances. Sintered silicon carbide (SSC), widely used as a hard mating material, is a potential candidate but its friction and wear properties need to be investigated in the scope of these new applications. Silicon carbide offers good mechanical properties (high hardness, high Young modulus), good corrosion resistance and good thermal conductivity, that make it suitable for tribological applications in different atmosphere (in air, argon or vacuum) and in dry or lubricated sliding. Combined with a counter-face ring made of a softer carbon-graphite, the dry sliding of SSC can be sustained even under severe conditions of pressure and speed. Graphite has been intensively studied in tribology since Bragg first described its lamellar structure. It has been thought during many years that graphite could act as a solid lubricant thanks to this structure. In fact, the environmental conditions strongly influence its tribological behavior. The hardness of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>facing</b> the carbon seal has also an impact on its friction properties. A transfer layer of carbon is generally found on the ceramic surface. In this study, a first experiment assesses the tribological behavior of SSC sliding against itself and three different carbon-graphite materials.

40|$|A {{methodology}} of multiobjective design optimization of ceramic–metal composite plates with functionally graded materials, with properties varying through the thickness direction, obtained by an adequate variation of volume fractions of the constituent materials, {{is presented in}} this paper. Constrained optimization is conducted for different behavior objectives like the maximization of buckling load or fundamental natural frequency. Mass minimization and material cost minimization are also considered. The optimization problems are constrained by stress based failure criteria and other structural response constraints or manufacturing limitations. The design variables are the index of the power-law distribution in the metal-ceramic graded material and the thicknesses of the graded material and/or the metal and <b>ceramic</b> <b>faces.</b> An equivalent single layer finite element plate model having a displacement field based on a higher order shear deformation theory, accounting for the temperature dependency of the material properties, was developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} through-the-thickness ceramic-metal functionally graded plates.

40|$|The {{activation}} of {{low pressure gas}} phases by hot filaments for chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of thin films differs considerably from that of plasma activation. The absence of electric fields and energetic particles {{in the case of}} hot filament CVD avoids any physical impact thereby resulting in gentle and conformal processes. Thus hot-filament CVD processes can also be applied to sensitive and structured substrates, respectively. We report on hot-filament CVD equipment for deposition areas of up to 0. 5 m by 1. 0 m and for 3 -dimensional film deposition. Additionally, deposition processes for polycrystalline diamond and for silicon and silicon nitride coatings are presented. Equipment and process development are discussed in the light of applications in such different fields as tools and wear parts, electrochemistry and electronics. The technology has been transferred to industry for CVD diamond tools, for the production of diamond-coated electrodes for electrochemistry and for diamond-coated <b>ceramic</b> <b>face</b> seals. Currently we are focussing on deposition rates, deposition uniformity and material properties of amorphous silicon, nanocrystalline silicon and silicon nitride films deposited on glass, silicon and polymers for different purposes.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of transient bubble clouds near a solid surface was investigated {{to test a}} scheme for mitigation of cavitation-induced damage. The target was a porous ceramic disk through which air could be forced. Transient cavitation bubbles were created using a shock-wave lithotripter focused {{on the surface of}} the disk. The dynamics of bubble clouds near the ceramic disks were studied for two boundary conditions: no back pressure resulting in surface free of bubbles and 10 psi (0. 7 atm) of back pressure, resulting in a surface with a sparse (30 % of area) bubble layer. Images of the cavitation near the surface were obtained from a high-speed camera. Additionally, a passive cavitation detector (3. 5 MHz focused acoustic transducer) was aligned with the surface. Both the images and the acoustic measurements indicated that bubble clouds near a <b>ceramic</b> <b>face</b> without a bubble layer collapsed onto the boundary, subsequently leading to surface erosion. When a sparse bubble layer was introduced, bubble clouds collapsed away from the surface, thus mitigating cavitation damage. The erosion damage to the ceramic disks after 300 shock waves was quantified using micro-CT imaging. Pitting up to 1 mm deep was measured for the bubble-free surface, and the damage to the bubble surface was too small to be detected. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

However, the method assumption {{was based on}} studies of mechanism of destruction of ballistic shields made of among others ceramics, by small arms bullets. The hard <b>ceramic</b> <b>facing</b> of the ballistic shield blunts the projectile and breaks up the projectile's hard core used for armour piercing.

The dust, containing {{the remnants of the}} projectile's energy hits the backing, but is now spread over a larger area. With backings made of fibre, energy is absorbed in stretching, breaking and delamination. With backings made of ductile metal, energy is absorbed in elastic deformation. Modification of the method consisted of taking into account the stratification of the ceramic-metal composite and the occurrence of an aircraft stiffened skin, in order to better assess the effectiveness of ballistic shields. The concept of estimating the resistance was based on the described destruction mechanism, where the object of analysis is a metal containment ring with an additional ceramic protective ballistic shield.

40|$|The {{church of}} Santa Maria Annunciata at San Carlo Borromeo Hospital in Milan {{is a prime}} example of {{contemporary}} architecture. The church was built between 1964 and 1967 by Gio Ponti (1891 - 1979), one of the main protagonists of XX Century Italian architecture. The unconventional choice of materials and shapes is the result of the architect's specific intent so their preservation is an important task in the conservation planning. The restoration project, through a careful analysis of the exterior facades degradation, highlighted a complex situation connected to contemporary art. The processes of surface alteration, synergistically caused by exposure to weathering, compositional aspects, constructive and material characteristics, show phenomena that cannot be found in historical buildings [1]. Particular attention was devoted to the external <b>ceramic</b> <b>facing,</b> made of glazed porcelain stoneware (or grès) tiles. The critical conservation status of the ceramic elements required an intervention for the consolidation of diffuse micro-cracking in the glassy coating and the protection of the still intact material. Silica thin films synthesized by sol-gel process, according to the technology developed by the Chemistry for Cultural Heritage research group (Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova), was used to perform an innovative protective treatment. This method involves a new synthetic path to obtain highly pure glassy silica thin films operating at low temperatures and in a neutral environment. The deposition of films is performed closely to neutral pH conditions, in order to avoid degradation of objects sensitive to acidic or basic environment. The slow drying process carried out at ambient temperature does not require the heat treatments necessary for the traditional sol-gel method and thus avoids possible damages to the substrate [2]. Phenomena involved in weathering, as well as chemical and morphological characteristics of the ceramic materials, were analysed and considered in planning the protective treatment. Compatibility with the glass substrate, stability to solar radiation, chemical corrosion and biological degradation resistance, durability and inalterability of the optical characteristics of the material are all features in accordance with the restoration needs. The encouraging results obtained show that this new technology can be widely used as an effective alternative to traditional methods, often based on the use of synthetic organic polymers...|$|E

Modularity in construction of the array permits upgrading and servicing of the array at sensor module level. A neoprene acoustic window without any coupling medium is used on <b>ceramic</b> <b>faces</b> in place of conventional potting. This greatly simplifies the design and maintenance of the array. Test results showed that sensors with dry-coupled neoprene perform as well as ones with conventional polyurethane-based encapsulation. A hierarchical noise reduction strategy is employed in the array design to reduce performance degradation due to rear-propagating noise and structural noise transmission. The whole array has been engineered so as to keep the cabling to a minimum. Different units, called modules, of the array can be simply plugged in or taken out {{without the need for}} soldering or using interconnecting cables. The mechanical design of the array has been optimised using FEM analysis. Signal acquisition and conditioning electronics are placed well close to the sensors to give a compact module design and it provides a digital output.

Subsequently dynamic displacements, accelerations and pressures have been characterised both in Gelatine experiments and animal experiments and used to provide test methodologies. High velocity armour consists of a ceramic plate usually backed with a composite panel, which is worn over the conventional textile body armour. The purpose of the plate is to disrupt and spread {{the energy of the}} high velocity projectile such that the resulting displacement can beaccommodated and partially absorbed by the textile armour. On its own, the textile armour isonly capable of preventing penetration by low kinetic energy density projectiles such as fragments, which are of a similar magnitude to hand gun bullets.

Investment casting molds containing multiple test pieces with the dimensions of 25 x 25 x 60 mm in dimension were used. The wax pattern of each test piece was coated with a different <b>ceramic</b> <b>face</b> coat in mold fabrication and the resulting differences on cast metal surfaces were studied. The backup layers of the shell were {{the same for all}} test pieces. Fused alumina, fused silica, molochite, zircon, yttria, zirconia and fused magnesia were the ceramics studied as face coat materials. Digital pictures of the cast surfaces were taken and an image analyzer was used to a quantitatively assess the reacted areas. The results show that fused magnesia and yttria were the best face coat materials to resist molten magnesium. Fused alumina and zircon were the next best materials. Molochite and zirconia were ranked as moderate to poor in resisting reactions. Strong mold-metal reactions were seen in the case of fused silica. Shell permeability measurements suggest that the degree of reactivity is not related to the shell permeability. It can however be correlated to the free energy of formation of the refractory. The excellent reaction resistance of magnesia and yttria observed in the experiments {{can be explained by the}} strongly negative Gibb's free energy of formation and consequent stability of these materials. HSC software was used to calculate theoretically the free energy of formation for the refractories studied in this work. The obtained results were compared to experimental values. Analysis with EDS indicated that the reaction layers consisted mostly of oxides. Ceramic test bars coated with various refractories were dipped in magnesium melt to study for reactions. It was seen that none of the tested refractories reacted with magnesium as a result of the dipping operation. It was concluded that oxygen is required for the mold-metal reactions to be initiated. It was verified that the atmosphere surrounding the shell also influenced the observed reactions. In molds containing both normal and reduced permeability shells around the test pieces, the surfaces cast in reduced permeability shells showed large reductions in reactivity. It is suggested that reactions in investment casting molds occur in two stages: 1. During pouring and filling 2. After the filling is complete by the effect of external oxygen. The cooling curves of magnesia-coated test bars were compared with those of silica-coated test bars. Analysis shows that heat is released during the mold-metal reactions. An attempt was made to incorporate the inhibitor KBF 4 in the mold structure in the form of first coat stucco. Rough cast surfaces were obtained, which indicated that the used high sintering temperature was not compatible with this inhibitor. Similarly, when the preheated investment-casting mold was placed in a bed of KBF 4 before casting, only small reductions in reactivity were obtained. Reactivity was reduced in shells buried in a bed of Croning sand. Then, however, the cast pieces contained gas holes. NaBF 4 produced better results as an inhibitor. It was first dissolved in water and then the sintered molds were dipped in this solution. Large reductions in reactivity were observed. The inhibiting effect of this chemical can be attributed to the liberation of BF 3 gas during mold preheating. reviewe...|$|R
