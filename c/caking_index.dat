30|$|The coal {{resources}} of India {{are available in}} older Gondowana formation of Peninsular India and younger to tertiary formation of North-eastern region (NER). The NER of India has a large reservoir of high sulfur (2  %– 8  %) coals with sub-bituminous in rank (Saikia et al. 2014). The majority of sulfur functionalities of these coals {{were found to be}} in the organic forms (75  %– 90  %), which are retardant to remove chemically (Baruah and Khare 2007). There are five types of organic sulfur functionalities found in these NER coals including aliphatic or aromatic thiols, aliphatic or mixed sulfides, aliphatic or aromatic disulfides, heterocyclic compounds of thiophenic and thioketonic types, etc., (Barooah and Baruah 1996); moreover, the NER coals are characterized by low ash and high <b>caking</b> <b>index,</b> suitable for use in cement plant and metallurgy as coking coal. But, these coals cannot be gainfully utilized because of their high sulfur contents as mentioned above.|$|E
40|$|Caking coal is {{difficult}} to be gasified in fluidized bed (FB) because of the inevitable particle agglomeration caused by caking in the dense bottom of the bed. Literature {{studies have shown that}} pre-oxidizing the coal can suppress its caking propensity, while quick dispersion of coal particles, for example, by gas jetting in the plastic stage of heating is critical to such a suppression of the caking agglomeration. Thus, the so-called jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) is devised in this study to gasify caking coal in FB. Coal particles usually below 5 mm are blown into the space above the bottom dense bed surface by an O- 2 -containing gas jet to disperse and meanwhile to pre-oxidize the particles. The resulting char particles with little, even without caking propensity fall into the dense bottom of the bed to allow their gasification there. After validating the destruction of caking agglomeration by jetting pre-oxidation in a laboratory FB apparatus, a 150 kg/h pilot JPFBG plant was built and the coal with the <b>caking</b> <b>index</b> of about 20 was successfully gasified in this plant using normal air and O- 2 -enriched air. The heating vale of the produced gas varied in 2. 9 - 5. 0 MJ/m(N) (3) and decreased with raising the oxygen percentage applied to the jet feeding. Raising the oxygen percentage for the jet caused more of the produced gas formed in the bottom dense bed of char gasification to burn off in the jetting zone. The optimal proportion of the oxygen applied to the jet feeding or coal pre-oxidation was found to be about 37 % against the total oxygen supply. Enriching the 02 content in the gasification agent to about 30 vol. % enhanced greatly the gasification rate of the tested low-reactivity coal in JPFB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|There is {{scarcity}} of coking coal reserve in India. Only 15 % coking coal is coking in nature. As Coking coal is costly, there arrives {{a need to}} find an alternative route for iron making. India is the world's biggest maker of DRI. The majority of which is delivered primarily through the coal based method of production. Growth in the DRI production can be attributed largely to the popularity of secondary steelmaking route, which has shown a phenomenal growth in India. This has been {{mainly because of the}} low investment cost of the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) as compared to the integrated blast furnace-oxygen converter route and because of its better flexibility of product mix. The future of coal based sponge iron industry in India is bright because of huge availability of non –coking coal (85 % of the total coal found). We are selecting different non-coking coal samples from various mines of Odisha to study and evaluate the effect of different carbonization temperatures on the physical, chemical properties, calorific value, reactivity, and <b>caking</b> <b>index</b> of the coal samples.. Present investigation deals with the study of physical and chemical properties of non- coking coal samples. The results indicated that the physical and chemical properties of coal depend on the carbonization temperature, heating rate and soaking time. It has been found that ash content and fixed carbon content increases while calorific value and volatile matter decreases as the carbonization temperatures rises from 400 °C to 1000 ° C. It is also found that coal chars reactivity towards CO 2 decreases as the carbonization temperature rises from 400 °C to 1000 ° C. Apparent porosity increases up to 400 °C and decreases thereafter as the carbonization temperature increases up to 1000 °C, while apparent density shows contradictory effect of apparent porosity. Lingraj coalmine showed higher fixed carbon content, calorific value and coal grade as compared to other coalmines. Reasons to carry out this work is to search good quality of coal for DRI plants...|$|E

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{plasticity}} of coal during pyrolysis is {{of significant}} importance, since {{it affects the}} reactivity, porosity, particle size and {{the density of the}} char and thus also the behaviour of the char during further utilisation processes. The main focus {{of this study was to}} characterize the chemical and physical changes which the thermally treated coal undergoes, in order to better understand the pyrolysis process of caking and non-caking South African coals. The pyrolysis behaviour of three South African coals with different <b>caking</b> <b>indices</b> was investigated. The coal samples included; (1) Highveld (TWD), a medium rank C coal with a free swelling index (FSI) of 0, (2) Grootegeluk (GG), also a medium rank C coal, with a FSI of 6. 5, and (3) Tshikondeni (TSH), a medium rank B coal with the highest FSI of 9. The three coal samples were classified as vitrinite-rich coals consisting of mainly aliphatic structures. Thermogravimetric experiments were used to determine the different temperatures relating to specific percentages of mass loss using set conditions. The pyrolysis process was stopped at various percentages of mass loss (thus at various stages of the reactions) to characterize the chemical structural changes that occurred at the specific mass loss percentages. The results obtained from characterization analyses indicated that the three coals differ in chemical composition and thus were expected to behave differently during pyrolysis. The coal samples consist of different amounts of macerals and minerals according to X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) results indicated that some of the functional groups within the coal samples evolved with the increase in temperature. The highly caking coal (TSH) exhibited the highest aromaticity and ring condensation. The surface areas were determined by CO 2 adsorption and an increase in surface area was observed with an increase in temperature. The surface area of the GG and TSH coal-derived char samples decreased at some stage, which is an indication of thermoplastic behaviour and subsequent swelling of the coal samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirm the plastic stage of caking coals at specific temperatures and volatile matter release via the multiple bubble mechanism. All these results are given and discussed extensively in this dissertation. Master...|$|R
40|$|India has fifth largest coal {{reserve in}} the world but has a very limited reserve of coking coal which is the key {{material}} for the production of steel. Coking coal accounts for only 15 % of the total reserve of India while non-coking coal accounts for 85 %. Since India has an abundance of non-coking coal and scarcity of coking coal, {{there is a need to}} maximize the utilization of non-coking coal in various sectors such as power generation, steel industry, and cement industry. The current project has been taken up to contribute towards the potential growth of non-coking coal and their utilization in the steel sector in sponge iron making process. Non-coking coal is exploited in sponge iron making through direct reduction of iron ore commonly known as DRI method. In the present project work different non-coking coal samples obtained from various coal mines of India namely South East Coalfields Limited (Chhattisgarh), Jindal coalfield (Chhattisgarh), Mahanadi Coalfields Limited Basundhara (Orissa), Gopalpur (Chattisgarh) and Asansol and Lingaraj coal mines. The project was undertaken with the following objectives: (i) Characterization of the selected coals for their chemical and physical properties, (ii) preparation of coal chars, and (iii) characterization of the chemical and physical properties of these coal chars. The coal and char samples were characterized for chemical properties (proximate analysis and ultimate analysis, calorific value) and physical properties (apparent porosity and density, <b>caking</b> <b>index).</b> The result was found that Basundhara (MCL) coals have highest fixed carbon content and calorific value. The reactivity of char produced at carbonization temperature 950 °C towards carbon dioxide was measured, and value was found greater than 2 gm/cc/sec which is desired in sponge iron plant. Effect of carbonization at different temperature (400 °C, 600 °C, 800 °C and 950 °C) on properties of coal char was investigated, and it was found that energy value and fixed carbon content and apparent density increases, whereas porosity decreases with the increase in carbonization temperature. Ash fusion temperature of some of the coal ashes was determined and found that these coal ashes have sufficient high ash fusion temperature to avoid ring formation. Results obtained from all the experiments conclude that most of the selected coals are suitable for sponge iron making...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was {{to carry out a}} systematic evaluation of flow of pharmaceutical powders and granules using compendial and non-compendial methods. Angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, Carr’s compressibility index, and Hausner ratios were evaluated. Additionally, flow was characterized using a powder rheometer in which a sensitive force transducer monitors the forces generated {{as a result of the}} sample displacement. The critical attributes such as cohesivity <b>index,</b> <b>caking</b> strength, and flow stability were determined for samples. The samples consisted of different grades of magnesium stearate powder including bovine, vegetable, and food grade, physical mixture powder blend consisting of a model formulation, granules prepared by various methods including slugging, high shear granulator, and fluid bed dryer. Lubricant efficiency was also determined for granules lubricated with various concentrations of magnesium stearate. It was observed that the compendial methods were often non-discriminating for minor variations in powder flow. The additional characterization such as cohesivity, and caking strength were helpful in understanding the flow characteristics of pharmaceutical systems. The flow stability test determined that the powders were not affected by the test conditions on the rheometer. The non-compendial tests were discriminating to even minor variations in powder flow...|$|R
40|$|A {{key feature}} of the biscuit {{manufacture}} is {{the combination of the}} raw ingredients. Different oils are likely to change the quality of dough. The factors important in agglomeration of starch materials are poorly understood and therefore work was carried out to try and establish the behaviour of oil and water on the material properties of starches. An understanding of particle-particle behaviour in the presence of oils and water is relevant to a food production process such as biscuit making, that requires preparation and mixing of these ingredients at ambient conditions. The way these powders pack and flow could {{have a significant impact on}} the final quality of the product. Powder flow analyser was used to measure the caking and cohesion properties for different type of starches. Besides the powder type as a variable, three levels of water and four types of oils at 5 % (d. b) concentration were also tested. The presence of water with the powder plays an important role for the way the cereals powders pack and flow. Although tapped bulk densities did not vary much the water had a great impact on the powder caking strength and cohesion index. For samples without oil, the results showed that these parameters were increased significantly as the water level increased for all starches. Plasticization by addition of water to the food powder is believed to be the major factor contributing to the results obtained. Addition of oil to starches increased the <b>caking</b> and cohesion <b>indices</b> where liquid oils showed the greatest impact compared to solid oils...|$|R
