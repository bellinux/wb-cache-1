30|$|This type of {{interactions}} in porous media {{is governed by}} the interplay between capillary, viscous and gravitational forces. Oil trapping during immiscible displacement in porous media is {{mainly because of the}} <b>capillary</b> <b>forces.</b> The trapped oil can be recovered if the amount of viscous or gravity forces acting on the trapped oil exceeds the <b>capillary</b> <b>forces.</b> The relative contribution of gravity and <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on S or is determined by the bond number (N B), which is a dimensionless number representing the ratio of gravity to <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> (Du Prey 1978). The relative contribution of viscous <b>forces</b> and <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on S or is determined by the capillary number (N C), which is a dimensionless number that determines the relative contribution of viscous and <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> (Taber 1969; Stegemeier 1977, Lake 1989).

30|$|The <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> {{have great}} {{influence}} on oil recovery efficiency, but the influence differs fundamentally for non-fractured and fractured reservoirs. In a non-fractured reservoir, strong <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> during water flooding will trap oil and cause relatively high residual oil saturation. Therefore, to remobilize residual oil, {{there is a}} need to reduce the oil water IFT. While in fractured reservoirs, spontaneous imbibition of water due to strong <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> is an important and necessary mechanism to attain high displacement efficiency [42]. Generally, <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> are overcome by either viscous or gravity forces.

As part of a demonstration conducted by Bright Idea and Webb development: Water entering a natural void, such as a pore within a synthetic mesh material, forms a film {{on the surface of}} the material surrounding the pore. The adhesion of the water molecules nearest the solid material is greatest. As water is added to the pore, the thickness of the film increases, the <b>capillary</b> <b>force</b> is reduced in magnitude, and water molecules on the outer portion of the film may begin to flow away from its source.

5000|$|When a {{hydrophobic}} {{object of}} weight [...] {{is placed on}} the surface of water, its weight begins deforming the water line. The hydrophobic nature of the object means that the water will attempt to minimize contact due to an unfavorable energy tradeoff associated with wetting. As a result, surface tension attempts to pull back on the water line in order to minimize contact with the hydrophobic object and retain a lowest energy state. This action by the surface to pull back on the depressed water interface is the source of a <b>capillary</b> <b>force,</b> which acts tangentially along the contact line and thereby gives rise to a component in the vertical direction. An attempt to further depress the object is resisted by this <b>capillary</b> <b>force</b> until the contact line reaches a vertical position located about two capillary lengths below the undisturbed water line. Once this occurs, the meniscus collapses and the object sinks.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State UniversityAt the Hanford Site, {{radioactive}} wastes have been disposed into the subsurface. These radionuclides move with infiltrating water both in solution and via adsorption on mobile colloidal soil particles. Extensive {{research has been}} directed to understand the mechanism of colloid transport: at field-scale in lysimeters, at laboratory scale in columns and by indirect field measurements. This dissertation investigates experimental and theoretical methods to determine <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on millimeter-scale particles in the subsurface. The specific objectives of this dissertation were: 1. Measure <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on irregularly shaped sediment particles and compare with theoretical estimates. <b>Capillary</b> <b>forces</b> due to a moving air-water interface were measured experimentally on three PTFE particles of standard shape (sphere, circular disc, square tent) and seven natural sediment particles (basalt, granite, hematite, magnetite, mica, milky quartz, quartz) using a tensiometer. Theoretical calculations were done to estimate maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>forces,</b> assuming the particles to be spherical, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal. The ellipsoidal model was found to give the best approximation of the <b>capillary</b> <b>forces.</b> 2. Measure <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on model particles of standard shapes and compare specific features of the force-position curves with theoretically reconstructed curves. <b>Capillary</b> <b>forces</b> due to a moving air-water interface were measured experimentally on nine model polyacrylate particles. Particles were divided into three categories (rounded, fixed, and tapered) based on cross-section. The theoretical reconstruction of the force-position curves indicated that the pinning, snap-in and snap-off of the air-water interface on sharp edges and variation of cross-section along z-axis dictated {{the shape of the}} force-position curve. 3. Develop a numerical model to predict <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on subsurface particles. Surface roughness features of basalt and quartz sediment particles were reconstructed at triangle resolutions of 3 %, 5 % and 10 % of maximum (root mean squared) dimensions using scanning electron microscopy. Force-position curves were measured experimentally and calculated theoretically for comparison to determine an optimum mesh resolution. The results provided a lower size-limit of roughness features which can affect <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> on mm-scale particles interacting with a moving air-water interface.

Magnifying the {{influence of}} <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> using methane–hexane (85 – 15  %) with 10 -nm pore throat radius showed enhanced condensate spread.

Once condensate reached the inner portion of the block, the spread evolution becomes negligible. Furthermore, the <b>capillary</b> <b>forces</b> employed limited retention on productivity. The smallest pore throat radius recorded a decrease in recoveries by a magnitude of less than 1  %. Thus, diminutive influences were witnessed to increase the residence time of condensate and impose resistance to impact productivity.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{commercial}} AFM cantilever tips have pre-measured resonant {{frequencies and}} force constants which are {{provided to the}} customer. As sampling proceeds, the cantilever tip’s position changes, which causes the scanning laser wavelength (650 nm) to deviate from its original position on the detector.

This vertical movement by the z-piezo scanner is correlated {{to a change in}} voltage. Sampling in contact mode relies upon intermolecular forces between the tip and surface as depicted by Van der Waals force. As the sampling begins, the tip is moved close to the sample which creates a weakly attractive force between them.

Therefore, the vacuum losses are less, which means the vacuum pump required is smaller than in conventional disc filters, thus minimizing operating costs.

If assembling multiple types of particles, the particles should be assembled in the order of decreasing sizes. For example, if assembling both 60 nm gold nanoparticles as well as 40 nm silver nanoparticles, 60 nm gold nanoparticles should be applied first because it is too big to enter binding sites tailored for 40 nm particles.

50|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>force</b> is a {{major problem}} in tensile force {{measurements}} since it effectively strengthens the tip-surface interaction. It is usually caused by adsorbed moisture on substrates from ambient environment. To eliminate this additional force, measurements in liquids can be conducted. With X-terminated tip and substrate in liquid L, the addition to Fad is calculated using Eq 1 with WXLX = 2γLL; that is, the extra force comes from the attraction of liquid molecules to each other. This is ~10 pN for EtOH which still allows for the observation of even the weakest polar/nonpolar interactions (~20 pN). The choice of liquid is dependent on which interactions are of interest. When the solvent is immiscible with functional groups, larger than usual tip-surface bonding exists. Therefore, organic solvents are appropriate for studying van der Waals and hydrogen bonding while electrolytes are best for probing hydrophobic and electrostatic forces.|$|E
