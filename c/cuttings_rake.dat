R becomes {{a significant portion of}} total cutting energy in microcutting, thereby influencing the phenomenon of size effect. Therefore, this work presents an evaluation of specific work of fracture for sharp and rounded-edged tools, knowing cutting forces and shear angles from LS-DYNA simulations of orthogonal microcutting of low-carbon AISI 1215 steel. The R was also evaluated as a function of process parameters such as <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>rake</b> angle, tool edge radius, and uncut chip thickness, so as to illustrate the effect of these variables on the magnitude of R and contribution of R to the specific cutting energy or size effect. It is observed that R increases with an increase in uncut chip thickness, whereas it decreases with an increase in <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>rake</b> angle, and tool edge radius. U-R defines the contribution of fracture to the specific cutting energy (U) due to specific work of fracture R.

30|$|Analytical {{models have}} also been used to predict the {{drilling}} load [9, 14 – 20]. The analytical model of drill-soil interaction was developed using the screw conveyance theory and soil shear rupture principle. The analysis of the soil rupture {{is based on the}} passive earth pressure theory, which has successfully been used to predict the bulldozing force [21, 22]. According to the shape and <b>cutting</b> <b>rake</b> angle of the blade, different cutting models have been proposed to describe the soil rupture mechanism [23 – 26]. These theories {{can be used as a}} fundamental reference for modeling drill-tool interaction. The screw conveyance calculation, which is similar to the bulk solid screw conveyor design, can predict particle screw conveyance load and efficiency [27 – 29]. According to the screw diameters and the rotary speed of an auger, the centripetal force or the weight of particles are the main causes of auger conveyance [30, 31]. The rotary speed is always less than 300  r/min, and the diameters of the drill tool are generally limited below 50  mm in extraterrestrial exploration. For such orders of rotary speed and diameters, the weight of particles could be the main component that provides cuttings conveyance [30]. This study models the screw conveyance process based on a quasi-static analysis. In addition, in a significant number of previous works, the drill-soil interaction was simply divided into screw conveyance and soil cutting processes. The boundary conditions and soil mechanical property differences between these two processes were ignored in previous modeling of the drill-soil interaction. Thus, the calculated results, i.e., the summations of the screw conveyance load and soil cutting load, must either be further verified or only used in special situations.|$|R

The development and application of green cutting depend on the machine and cutting tool technology progress, in so far as the development of cutting tool technology has quite a big influence. The study was focused on the simulation analysis model for micro milling SKD 61 tool steel developed by the finite element method. First, because the impact of the effective rake angle on the oblique cutting model is equivalent to that of the rake angle on the orthogonal cut model, the complex tool geometry of an end-mill will be simplified to the orthogonal cutting model. Using the Taguchi method, the FEM simulation of orthogonal cutting operation was performed under different cutting speeds, <b>cutting</b> depths, effective <b>rake</b> angles and relief angles were modified. The cutting force, tool maximum temperature, tool maximum temperature and tip distance, and the contact length of tool and chip are the major performance indexes of micro milling process.

Prediction of induced residual stresses in a machined component is essential in a component’s fatigue life and surface integrity approximation. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in optimizing cutting process conditions as well as cutting tool geometries. Research has found that using experimental techniques in measuring residual stresses in a machined component is both time consuming and expensive as a method. In the attempt of eliminating the post process measuring drawbacks, the finite element modeling and simulation has proven its efficiency, as a tool, in predicting mechanical and thermal variables, hence, providing a pre-process prediction of variables which may prevent future component failures.

It is proposed that material removal mechanisms may change along the cutting edge from shearing (yielding lamellar structures) to extrusion. Shearing results from structural changes related to phase transformation induced by pressure and shear deformation. Extrusion, yielding crystalline structures in the chips, may be attributed to a pressure drop (due to an increase in the contact area) from the tool tip towards the region of the cutting edge where brittle-to-ductile transition occurs. From this region upwards, pressure(stress) would be insufficient to trigger phase transformation and therefore amorphous phase would not form integrally along the chip width...|$|R

The basic principles are {{stated in the}} form of a primal optimization problem with an objective function subjected to constraints of the equilibrium equation, its static boundary conditions and a constitutive inequality. An Eulerian reference co-ordinate is used to describe the steady state motion of the workpiece relative to the tool.
