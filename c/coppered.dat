40|$|<b>Copper,</b> an old material, {{is still}} {{extensively}} used nowadays. In this paper, through extremely simple replacement reaction approach, we synthesized various <b>copper</b> nanostructures under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Pure <b>copper,</b> with splendid structures at nanoscale, {{was acquired by}} dipping iron plate into solution with <b>copper</b> ions. With different reactant, <b>copper</b> chloride, <b>copper</b> sulfate, <b>copper</b> nitrite and <b>copper</b> acetate, different <b>copper</b> nanostructures are obtained. Using <b>copper</b> chloride, dendrite structure is prepared; and <b>copper</b> sulfate leads to sponge-like structure; while both <b>copper</b> nitrite and <b>copper</b> acetate result into no <b>copper</b> structure. What&# 39;s more, we discovered that enough long reaction time {{will lead to the}} transformation of dendrite <b>copper</b> into sponge-like <b>copper,</b> no matter what <b>copper</b> salt is employed. Addition of silver ions into the reaction system demonstrated the significant influence of <b>copper</b> salt into the synthesis of dendrite silver structures. Finally, the mechanism of the nanostructures formation is investigated thoroughly. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc...|$|R

25|$|Various factors {{influence}} <b>copper</b> absorption. For example, <b>copper</b> absorption {{is enhanced}} by ingestion of animal protein, citrate, and phosphate. <b>Copper</b> salts, including <b>copper</b> gluconate, <b>copper</b> acetate, or <b>copper</b> sulfate, are more easily absorbed than <b>copper</b> oxides. Elevated levels of dietary zinc, as well as cadmium, high intakes of phytate and simple sugars (fructose, sucrose) inhibit dietary absorption of <b>copper.</b> Furthermore, low levels of dietary <b>copper</b> inhibit iron absorption.|$|R
25|$|The Royal Navy had Pandora fitted and <b>coppered</b> at Deptford between January 1796 and 6 May. Lieutenant Samuel Mason {{commissioned}} Pandora in September. She {{disappeared in}} the North Sea in June 1797, and was presumed to have foundered {{with the loss of}} all hands.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the state}} of Michigan, <b>copper</b> is found almost {{exclusively}} in the western portion of the Upper Peninsula, in an area known as the <b>Copper</b> Country.

25|$|Antigua {{began her}} career as the Galathée-class French frigate Railleuse. She was built in Bordeaux to a 32-gun design by Raymond-Antoine Haran and {{launched}} in 1779.

25|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars and {{the long}} period of {{relative}} peace that followed caused a decline in both {{the number of new}} ships demanded by the navy and the number that needed to be repaired and maintained. Deptford's location and the shallow riverine waters exacerbated the problem as work and contracts were moved to other royal dockyards. The yard had its location close to the main navy offices in London in its favour, but the silting of the Thames and the trend towards larger warships made continued naval construction there an unappealing prospect. Engineer John Rennie commented of the yard that Ships-of-the-line which are built there cannot as I am informed with propriety be docked and <b>coppered.</b> Jury masts are put into them and they are taken to Woolwich, where they are docked, <b>coppered</b> and rigged, and I have been told of an instance where many weeks elapsed before a fair wind and tide capable of floating a large ship down to Woolwich occurred.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of added <b>copper</b> on pig performance, tissue <b>copper</b> concentrations and fecal <b>copper</b> excretion. In experiment one, 18 crossbred (Yorkshire x Landrace) barrows weighing an average of 14. 271. 39 kg were housed in stainless metabolism cages for 14 weeks and fed one of three corn-soybean meal based diets (n= 6) supplemented with either 0, 125 or 250 ppm <b>copper</b> from <b>copper</b> sulfate. The total fecal collection method was used to calculate daily fecal <b>copper</b> excretion. All pigs were slaughtered and samples of tissue were collected from the central right liver lobe, left kidney cortex and left longissimus muscle at the 10 th rib. <b>Copper</b> excretion increased with increasing levels of dietary <b>copper</b> addition (p< 0. 01) and with {{the age of the}} pigs (p< 0. 01). <b>Copper</b> levels in muscle, kidney and liver were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher for pigs fed 250 ppm <b>copper</b> compared with pigs fed 0 or 125 ppm <b>copper.</b> In experiment two, 126 crossbred (Yorkshire x Landrace) barrows weighing 13. 061. 36 kg were used in a 3 x 3 factorial experiment in which the pigs were fed diets supplemented with 0, 125 or 250 ppm <b>copper</b> fed in the form of either <b>copper</b> sulfate, <b>copper</b> methionine or tribasic <b>copper</b> chloride for 24 days. The pigs were housed in groups of three with six pens of pigs fed each diet. During the first 12 days of the experiment, pigs fed tribasic <b>copper</b> chloride had significantly improved feed conversion compared with pigs fed <b>copper</b> sulfate or <b>copper</b> methionine. However, during the next 12 days and overall, {{there was no difference in}} daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion for pigs fed the three <b>copper</b> sources. Over the 24 -day experiment, pigs fed 125 ppm <b>copper</b> had the highest weight gain (p= 0. 03) while pigs fed 250 ppm <b>copper</b> had the best feed conversion (p< 0. 01). Fecal <b>copper</b> was highest for pigs fed tribasic <b>copper</b> chloride (p= 0. 02). Fecal <b>copper</b> levels increased with increasing level of dietary <b>copper</b> (p< 0. 01). The overall results of this experiment indicate little difference in the performance of pigs fed <b>copper</b> sulfate, <b>copper</b> methionine or tribasic <b>copper</b> chloride. From an environmental standpoint, there may be advantages to choosing <b>copper</b> sulfate or <b>copper</b> methionine as these sources resulted in lower fecal <b>copper</b> excretion than tribasic <b>copper</b> chloride...|$|R
