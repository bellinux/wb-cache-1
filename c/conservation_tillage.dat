25|$|A 2006 United States Department of Agriculture {{report found}} the {{adoption}} of genetically engineered (GE) soy, corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall, but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically. The use of GE soy was also associated with greater <b>conservation</b> <b>tillage,</b> indirectly leading to better soil conservation, as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed. Though the overall estimated benefits of {{the adoption of}} GE soybeans in the United States was $310million, the majority of this benefit was experienced by the companies selling the seeds (40%), followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%).

40|$|The {{extent of}} land {{affected}} by degradation in Uganda ranges from 20 % in relatively flat and vegetation-covered areas to 90 % {{in the eastern}} and southwestern highlands. Land degradation has adversely affected smallholder agro-ecosystems including direct damage and loss of critical ecosystem services such as agricultural land/soil and biodiversity. This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised multi-band satellite image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km 2 (11 %) of the 1741 km 2 of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced <b>conservation</b> farming <b>tillage</b> practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41 % in PPBs and 43 % in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced <b>conservation</b> farming <b>tillage</b> practices increased the grain yield by 78 % on average, relative to conventional practices.

40|$|An augment of soil {{organic matter}} (SUM) in {{agricultural}} lands is mandatory to improve soil quality and fertility and to limit greenhouse gases emissions. A better protection of SUM from degradation is seconded to its inclusion in aggregates and {{to the formation of}} organo-mineral interactions with the clay fraction within the soil matrix. Under Mediterranean conditions, conservation agriculture (CA) has been widely related with macro-aggregates formation, SUM protection, and to an improvement of soil fertility and crop yields. The objective of this work was to evaluate the biogeochemical properties of five aggregate-size fractions obtained by dry sieving of a Calcic Fluvisol of an experimental farm managed under three different tillages. Soil aggregates distribution, total organic carbon (TUC), labile carbon pools, and enzymatic activities were measured in 2 different periods of the same agricultural campaign. CPMAS C- 13 NMR analyses were also performed to elucidate the structure of preserved SOM. The results evidenced seasonal variability in aggregate distribution, labile carbon pools and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), whereas TOC, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POxC), and p-glucosidase activity demonstrated to be reliable soil quality indices for soil fractions. The NMR analyses showed a better SUM preservation under <b>conservation</b> <b>tillages,</b> due to higher plant litter inputs and/or higher amount of necromass derived compounds if compared with traditional tillage. Particularly interesting are the results of the circle divide 0. 5 - 1 mm fraction, in which different trends were found for beta-Glu and several organic compound classes if compared with the other fractions.
