The <b>central</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (CIS) beneath this service {{is the result of}} more than 6 years of intensive research and improvements carried out {{in the course of the}} MyOcean projects (2009 - 2013) under FP 7 and H 2020. The <b>Central</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> covers all the service needs from data discovery, download with authentication, viewing and catalogue management. This abstract focuses on the evolutions being performed on the new version of the distributed software component named MOTU for data dissemination, present in all the oceanographic data production units spread through Europe. The MOTU open-source servlet provides REST (Representational State Transfer) services to the registered users willing to download data with or without subset through a queue system and with authentication relaying on a Central Authentication System (CAS). MOTU 2. 0 presented strong limitations for the management of NetCDF 4 data and intensive memory usage. In the scope of CMEMS, MOTU 3. 0 will include several new features, being the compatibility with compressed NetCDF 4 data the most attractive one for fast download and increased disk management efficiency. Other improvements such as the OGC protocol WCS 2. 0 and better log management to gather download service statistics will be also conducted and included in this upgraded version here presented. For the design of the MOTU 3. 0 subset service, TDS (Thredds Data Server) has been considered due to its overall performance and full compatibility with NetCDF 4. However, TDS alone may present operational limitations, particularly in the handling of large volumes and number of concurrent users. Hence, MOTU 3. 0 will be based on the new NetCDF subset service (NCSS) in conjunction with the latest NetCDF Java library in order to provide geographic, temporal and depth subset of the NetCDF files. Moreover, the use of the MOTU servlet as a proxy of the subset service will add robustness and performance through the queue management system and solve the around the world subset and the depth selection limitations of the NCSS implementation. In conclusion, the upgraded MOTU software envisaged under the Copernicus Marine Service in 2016 will allow users to benefit from the compression of the files and the new OGC standard WCS with a system that will increase in robustness and performance...|$|E
40|$|Information {{systems are}} mostly {{based on a}} {{centralized}} concept creating situations in the supply chain associated {{with a number of}} vertical transactions to the <b>central</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> A major problem is linking the product information to complex supply chain activities. A solution for improving the management of items is to decentralize the information of individual products and access the relevant information directly from a carry-on information tag based on identification technologies (e. g. RFID). Distributing data needed along the goods flow in a supply chain, opens up for local decision making. In the decentralized system each system interaction point is attached to logic needed in order to handle the goods at that point. In order to make this scenario possible the goods must operate in communication with other intelligent parts and intelligent infrastructure. The goods also {{need to be able to}} interact with the appropriate resources performing value adding. In order to perform such decisions all relevant transactional intelligence needs to be brought down all the way to the execution level. In this project we identify, outline and create solutions that make goods and consignments in a perceived way smart. The technical solutions for connectivity between goods are created from a logistics point of view. In this context smart means an IT and transportation environment where local decision making for supply chains is enabled...|$|E

In a general telemonitoring scenario for motion tracking, data recorded by inertial sensors should be sent from the patient's home to a central server for medical assessment by a physician. The objective of this work is to elaborate a concept on how continuously measured motion data can be transferred according to the guidelines of the and, and which adaptations are reasonable to achieve high efficiency. For the communication between sensor systems and a smartphone, the X 73 standards family was applied. To cover the interface between the smartphone and a <b>central</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> the proposed Version 2. 6 was used as message exchange format. Because we are dealing with continually measured data, the HL 7 message construction is oriented towards the. Two variants of the transmission of binary motion data with an HL 7 message were implemented. An evaluation with regard to relevant criteria led to the decision to use REST-based web services for message transport instead of the SOAP-based variant proposed by the Continua Design Guidelines. To summarize, the developed approach uses extended standards for the transmission of motion data. The detailed results can support other work groups with comparable implementation needs. In order to achieve a fully interoperable system, the communication of motion data should be included in the guidelines of IHE and Continua Health Alliance, since motion sensors can be used in various monitoring scenarios such as in patients with multiple sclerosis or for rehabilitation in general...|$|E

The main goal of these projects was to build a system of systems offering the users a unique access point to European oceanographic data. Reaching this goal at European level with 59 partners from 28 different countries was a real challenge: initially, each local system had its own human processes and methodology, its own interfaces for production and dissemination.

To this end a conceptual data model has to be built. Furthermore, it is recommended to build a central RIVM substance information system, into which selections of data from local RIVM data banks could be recorded and from which data could be made centrally available through an intermediary. Such a system should be managed centrally and a distinct market strategy should be developed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores reifying {{the management}} science concept of organizations {{as a collection}} of decisions. Organizational management entails resource allocation activities that can be formulated in terms of elementary relational functions. All elasticity-type formulations, most generic 2 ̆ 2 production 2 ̆ 2 functions, and various projection models that organizations might require (such as sales forecasts) can all be represented by elementary relational functions. Therefore, information systems in organizations can be representative of relationships between decision requirements, as theorized in relational model bases. A relational model-base structure acts as an integrative device by relating an organization 2 ̆ 7 s elementary relational functions to each other, with all that is kept for any model being the current values for coefficients and the now prevailing parametric values for the state variables of the model. Anchoring management information systems around relational model bases is particularly appropriate for organizations that have some reliance on real-time management decision making by providing the answer to two requirements for such organizations: one being the requirement for more accurate and current real-time, operational decision making within the organization; the other being the integration of functions for decision-making purposes within an organization. Relational model bases thus enable more dynamic management and become a <b>central</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> type for organizations that have dynamic resource allocation requirements that can employ technical tactics around such relational model bases. The relational model base would reflect revealed needs in an organization as opposed to projected needs, easing an organization 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on forecasting and moving it toward real-time decision making. The case for the introduction of these information systems is further strengthened by the fact that relational model base-type structures are already operating in production environments within organizations. The methodology used in this dissertation involved modeling organizational decision requirements in particular organizational cases to determine the behavior of relational model bases within those prototypical organizations and the application of relational model bases to real-time decision making. The first organizational scenario is a recursive agribusiness e-commerce case, with the target application being precision agriculture. The second scenario is a non-recursive ecological economics case, with the target application being preservation of biodiversity through land (habitat) protection...|$|E
