40|$|Structural {{vibrations}} {{induced by}} actuators can be minimized using input shaping. Input shaping is a feedforward method in which actuator commands are convolved with shaping functions {{to yield a}} shaped set of commands. These commands are designed to perform the maneuver while minimizing the residual structural vibration. In this report, input shaping is extended to stepper <b>motor</b> <b>actuators.</b> As a demonstration, an input-shaping technique based on pole-zero cancellation was used to modify the Solar Array Drive Assembly (SADA) actuator commands for the Lewis satellite. A series of impulses were calculated as the ideal SADA output for vibration control. These impulses were then discretized {{for use by the}} SADA stepper <b>motor</b> <b>actuator</b> and simulated actuator outputs were used to calculate the structural response. The effectiveness of input shaping is limited by the accuracy of the knowledge of the modal frequencies. Assuming perfect knowledge resulted in significant vibration reduction. Errors of 10 % in the modal frequencies caused notably higher levels of vibration. Controller robustness was improved by incorporating additional zeros in the shaping function. The additional zeros did not require increased performance from the actuator. Despite the identification errors, the resulting feedforward controller reduced residual vibrations {{to the level of the}} exactly modeled input shaper and well below the baseline cases. These results could be easily applied to many other vibration-sensitive applications involving stepper <b>motor</b> <b>actuators...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} and {{potential benefits of}} high frequency alternating current (HFAC) for vehicle auxiliary electrical systems. A 100 Vrms, 50 kHz sinusoidal AC bus is compared with 14 V DC and 42 V DC electrical systems in terms of mass and energy efficiency. The investigation {{is focused on the}} four main sub-systems of an on-board electrical network, namely: the power generation, power distribution, power conversion and the electrical loads. In addition, a systemlevel inquiry is conducted for the HFAC bus and a comparable 42 V DC system. A combination of computer simulation, analytical analysis and experimental work has highlighted benefits for the HFAC power distribution sub-system and for low-torque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators.</b> Specifically, the HFAC conductor mass is potentially 70 % and 30 % lighter than comparable 14 V DC and 42 V DC cables, respectively. Also, the proposed cable is expected to be at least 80 % more energy efficient than the current DC conductor technology. In addition, it was found that 400 Hz AC machines can successfully replace DC <b>motor</b> <b>actuators</b> with a rated torque of up to 2 Nm. The former are up to 100 % more efficient and approximately 60 % lighter and more compact than the existing DC motors in vehicles. However, it is argued that the HFAC supply is not feasible for high-torque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators.</b> This is because of the high energy losses and increased machine torque ripple {{associated with the use of}} HFAC power. The HFAC power conversion sub-system offers benefits in terms of simple power converter structure and efficient HFAC/DC converters. However, a significant limitation is the high power loss within HFAC/AC modules, which can be as high as 900 W for a 2. 4 kW load with continuous operation. Similar restrictions are highlighted for the HFAC power generation sub-system, where up to 400 W is lost in a 4 kW DC/HFAC power module. The conclusion of the present work is that the HFAC system offers mass and energy efficiency benefits for the conventional vehicle by leveraging the use of compact lowtorque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators</b> and lightweight wiring technology.

Other researchers have implemented a variety of closed-loop digital controllers on FPGA’s.

There are myriad advantages to utilizing an FPGA for discrete-time control functions which include the capability for reconfiguration when SRAM-based FPGA's are employed, fast parallel implementation of multiple control loops and implementations that can meet space level radiation tolerance requirements in a compact form-factor. Generally, a software implementation on a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) device or microcontroller is used to implement digital controllers.
