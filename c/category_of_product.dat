Bernard brought the sofa bed into the living room, formerly that <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> was not thought of as a living room piece of furniture. With Bernard’s interior design background, he was able to introduce a more fashion forward concept for convertible furniture. Bernard was a genius at advertising, using all 3 mediums at once: television, radio, and print in all markets where Castro Convertibles had showrooms. Bernard’s legacy of innovation was key to the company’s success. He believed strongly in creating new and inventive products to propel the brand. A favorite innovation includes the ‘Scotch n Sofa,’ a sofa that converted into a bar with built in turntable, unlike anything else out in the marketplace. Products like this made Castro Convertibles the leader and innovator in convertible furniture. Bernard believed in making his showrooms a destination for customers, with a real “show business” experience. Bernard built a 35-foot boat in his celebrated Fort Lauderdale showroom, which attracted customers from all over the region.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{and with the}} advent of the Compact Disc, PS was one of the first American {{high-end}} audio manufacturers to modify one of the few CD players of the day by replacing its internal audio amplification stage following the internal D to A player. The first and only modified CD player introduced by the company was the CD-1 based on the Philips Magnavox line of CD players. The company engineers chose the Magnavox unit because the belief at the time was it sounded better to its only rival in the marketplace, the Sony. Inside the CD 1 PS engineers added a discrete high voltage line stage and power supply, replacing the NE 5532 op amps used as the output amplification stage of the Magnavox. This unit was a stopgap product designed to get the company [...] "in the game" [...] of this new format that would someday challenge vinyl, the company's core products addressed. In the background, PS engineers were working to figure out a way to utilize the CD player's digital output and create a standalone D to A converter. In late 1982, the company succeeded in releasing the first high-end standalone D to A converter known as the Digital Link. Other manufacturers such as Arcam and Theta were also on the same path and both companies released competing D to A processors within several months of the Digital Link's introduction. From this point onwards, the company has produced a succession of DACS with the same goal in mind - that of supplanting the built in DAC and line stage of CD players. Later advances in CD technology led the high-end audio industry to release a new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> called a CD Transport that contained no DAC and meant to use as a pair which became known as a DAC and Transport combination.|$|E

5000|$|For MRP-based {{manufacturing}} industries, {{the predominant}} cost-saving methodology in category management (CM) involves {{the integration of}} market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing - such as in an MRO environment - demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with category management but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM’s usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world {{in a manner that}} makes sense to an MRO environment. The second (and no less important) challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome - a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis. An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical category management is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to category management has been coined [...] "MCM" [...] - standing for MRO-based Category Management or Modified Category Management. Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity - including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others. Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a category management project. The fundamental adjustment made between the classical category management approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.|$|E
