50|$|Reinforced in 1886, {{the iron}} bridge was {{demolished}} in 1895 {{to be replaced}} by the current three-span steel bridge, 18 metres wide, about 58 metres long, and able to carry the new trams. The provisional bridge used during the construction was pulled down following the World's Fair in 1897. Because of post-WW2 traffic loads, the bridge had to be reconstructed in 1977, a job done in three months - the three spans wielded on the quay and lifted in place using a <b>pontoon</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commander Third Fleet's {{logistic}} {{plan for}} Operation STALEMATE II, covering {{the capture of}} Peleliu,.

25|$|The {{military}} invited Artur von Casimir, the Heinkel's last pilot, {{to witness}} the operation, which commenced on 24 August 2004. The lifting was carried out using a <b>crane</b> and eight <b>pontoons</b> from the military, and the Heinkel broke the surface on 3 September. It was then dismounted on the beach by representatives from the museum. The Ju 88 surfaced on 6 September. The operation was concluded on 15 September with the raising of a tail of a Ju 87 and three Junkers Jumo 211 engines. All the aircraft were well-preserved because of the water's constant temperature and low oxygen content.|$|R

25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using <b>cranes</b> mounted on <b>pontoons.</b> The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Argonne to Seeadler on 27 August {{were the}} {{unclassified}} vessels Silver Cloud, Caribou, Arethusa, and Armadillo, the water barge YW-90, {{and the ocean}} tug Tern towing the concrete barge YO-186. The Caribou brought 65,000 barrels of fuel oil, the Silver Cloud 85,000 and the Arethusa 65,000; the Armadillo 24,000 barrels of Diesel oil and 1,770,000 gallons of aviation gasoline. YW-90 held 280,000 gallons of water, and the concrete YO-186 55,000 barrels. The fleet tug Tawasa towed in the floating drydock ARD-19, while the auxiliary ocean tug ATA-122 arrived towing the barges YF-681, filled with boatswain's stores of manila and wire line, blocks, tackle, mooring gear, etc., and YF-787 with general stores. Bringing in the drydock also meant bringing her in full, for while being towed from port to port her docking space furnished a wealth of cargo room {{for all sorts of}} equipment. On her trip from Eniwetok the ARD-19 carried the little harbor tug YTL-208, 2 <b>pontoon</b> <b>crane</b> barges, 20 LCM's, and 20 LCVP's. Except for the crane barges all these were self-propelled, but none could have made its way across the ocean under its own power. Most of Ogden's detachment was sent down from Kwajalein and Eniwetok. Crane barges, small tugs, and landing craft were vital necessities for supply services within a harbor, and had to go forward. We shall see later how the ARD's continued their usefulness as [...] "moving vans" [...] in the shifting of a service squadron westward.|$|R
40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, <b>cranes</b> operating from <b>pontoons</b> or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.
