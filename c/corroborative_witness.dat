50|$|Louf's entire {{testimony}} was later discredited by the Belgian authorities despite various other <b>corroborative</b> <b>witness</b> statements and {{her knowledge of}} specific facts about cases {{which at the time}} were known only to the police.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} comment from Cole, {{there has never}} been any {{definitive}} proof this incident actually happened. Many of the purported details of the event are contradictory. No photographs or films have appeared, nor <b>corroborative</b> <b>witness</b> statements. Stein has since claimed he gave the Super 8 tape to Vanilla Fudge road manager Bruce Wayne and doesn't know what happened to them.|$|E
50|$|Then in 1678, {{following}} the lead of Titus Oates, he gave an account of a supposed Popish Plot to the English government, and his version of the details of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was rewarded with Â£500. Kenyon concluded that while Bedloe probably had no direct knowledge about Godfrey's murder, he had learned enough about it from his extensive contacts in the criminal underworld to tell a convincing story. His record as a confidence trickster was so notorious that he chose to dwell on it, explaining that it was his career as a criminal which enabled him to give first-hand evidence about the plotters. While some Government officials, like Henry Coventry, were wary of relying on the testimony of such a notorious criminal, the general view was that he was too valuable as a <b>corroborative</b> <b>witness</b> to Oates to be disregarded. In the event his testimony was usually of little value, apart from the trial of Berry, Green and Hill for Godfrey's murder, of which he may have had some personal knowledge: as a witness he was rambling and incoherent, and had a habit of dragging in irrelevant grievances and private feuds. At most of the Plot trials, like that of Edward Colman, his evidence was so weak that the Court largely disregarded it.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} action against someone who threatens {{violence}} is interdict or court order, but {{this can be}} refused by the court {{on the grounds of}} public interest. Since public interest (the general effects of the action on the welfare of society) is involved, <b>corroborative</b> <b>witnesses</b> may be required. Interdict may require the defender to refrain from a specific conduct. Although provisional interdicts can be granted speedily, obtaining a perpetual interdict may be very time consuming and costly.|$|R
50|$|In February 2007 Clark {{appealed the}} {{findings}} of the jury in the Stingel matter. His notice of appeal alleged the verdict to be 'perverse', that the trial judge misdirected the jury regarding failures to call <b>corroborative</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{on the part of the}} complainant, that the trial judge erred in ruling against the admission of certain evidence, and that the fairness of the trial process had been compromised by pre-trial publicity. In December 2007 he lost his appeal against the damages awarded against him. Clark never paid the $20,000 compensation to Stingel and owes more than $300,000 to her lawyers. Although Clark declared bankruptcy in 2009 which was extended by five years in June 2012, he made an unsuccessful $1.25 million bid in June 2013 for a hotel in Warrnambool.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{something}} called corroborative evidence. A typical {{example would be}} a case where a witness saw the accused leaving a crime scene, and physical evidence, like DNA taken from a bloodstain, also put the defendant at the crime scene. Another common kind of example is <b>corroborative</b> <b>witness</b> testimony evidence. One witness testifies she saw the accused leaving the crime scene, but her testimony, by itself, may not be all that strong as evidence. However, when a second witness testifies independently, saying that he also saw the accused leaving the crime scene, this new evidence corroborates {{the testimony of the}} first witness, making it stronger as evidence. Another example of corroborative evidence is the case where I check to see whether my watch is keeping the right time by asking a friend what her watch says. I may think my watch is right, but this may be corroborated by my friend showing me her watch, which shows the same time as mine. Of course, both watches may be wrong, making the point that corroborative evidence is fallible. Double counting is a fallacy that occurs where evidence, for example from counting events that support a conclusion, is counted twice, yielding an inflation of the number o...|$|E
