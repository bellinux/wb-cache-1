25|$|When {{the ancient}} Greeks adopted the alphabet, {{they had no}} use for a letter to {{represent}} the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, {{and that was the first}} phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the <b>cross</b> <b>line</b> is set.|$|E
2500|$|Aged 34, Munn {{was too old}} {{to enlist}} during the First World War, but served as {{treasurer}} of a committee established to fund the volunteer Newfoundland Regiment, which saw service in France throughout the war. By 1918, he had succeeded his step-father as managing director of Bowring Brothers. Early in that year, he booked passage from St. John's to New York City via Halifax, aboard the SS Florizel, a passenger liner employed by his company's Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Line.</b> He was accompanied by his three-year-old daughter and her nursemaid, Constance Trenchard. His wife was already in New York, and the family planned to vacation in Florida for two months. On the night of 23 February, shortly after leaving St. John's, Florizel met a blizzard near Cape Race. Due to a navigational error, the ship's captain, William J. Martin, turned westward well before passing the cape, causing her to founder [...] offshore of Horn Head Point, close to Cappahayden. Munn, his daughter, and her nurse were killed, along with 91 others.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposal}} {{is for a}} rapid rail system which will include the Budapest-Esztergom heavy railway line. The Csepel and Ráckeve HÉV lines will be connected on the surface, near the National Theatre. In Boráros Square, the metro goes underground, and at Kálvin Square it <b>crosses</b> Metro <b>line</b> 3 and line 4. At Astoria the <b>line</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>line</b> 2.

30|$|As {{automated}} {{collection of}} gap size {{has not been}} reported before in the literature, we detail on this type of data collection. To facilitate the collection of accepted and rejected gaps, we first manually drew a few lines from road markers as shown in Fig.  2. We consider that a vehicle A from the ramp entrance entered the roundabout when it <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 2. If this happened while there were other vehicles B in the other entrance (which has right-of-way) or inside the roundabout itself, we would collect one sample of accepted gap size, which is the travel time from when vehicle A <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 2 to when the other vehicle B <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 4. Similarly, to collect rejected gaps, we consider that vehicles A from the ramp entrance waited to enter the roundabout when they <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 3 but not line 2 yet. If there were vehicles B in the other entrance or inside the roundabout while vehicle A were in the waiting mode, we would collect one sample of rejected gap size, which is the travel time from when vehicle A <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 3 to when the vehicles B <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 4. If there are multiple vehicles B involved in accepted/rejected gap, {{the one with the}} shortest travel time is taken.|$|R

60|$|I took a black oblong stiff Paper {{terminated}} by Parallel Sides, {{and with}} a Perpendicular right Line drawn cross from one Side to the other, distinguished it into two equal Parts. One of these parts I painted with a red colour {{and the other with}} a blue. The Paper was very black, and the Colours intense and thickly laid on, that the Phænomenon might be more conspicuous. This Paper I view'd through a Prism of solid Glass, whose two Sides through which the Light passed to the Eye were plane and well polished, and contained an Angle of about sixty degrees; which Angle I call the refracting Angle of the Prism. And whilst I view'd it, I held it and the Prism before a Window in such manner that the Sides of the Paper were parallel to the Prism, and both those Sides and the Prism were parallel to the Horizon, and the <b>cross</b> <b>Line</b> was also parallel to it: and that the Light which fell from the Window upon the Paper made an Angle with the Paper, equal to that Angle which was made with the same Paper by the Light reflected from it to the Eye. Beyond the Prism was the Wall of the Chamber under the Window covered over with black Cloth, and the Cloth was involved in Darkness that no Light might be reflected from thence, which in passing by the Edges of the Paper to the Eye, might mingle itself with the Light of the Paper, and obscure the Phænomenon thereof. These things being thus ordered, I found that if the refracting Angle of the Prism be turned upwards, so that the Paper may seem to be lifted upwards by the Refraction, its blue half will be lifted higher by the Refraction than its red half. But if the refracting Angle of the Prism be turned downward, so that the Paper may seem to be carried lower by the Refraction, its blue half will be carried something lower thereby than its red half. Wherefore in both Cases the Light which comes from the blue half of the Paper through the Prism to the Eye, does in like Circumstances suffer a greater Refraction than the Light which comes from the red half, and by consequence is more refrangible.|$|E
