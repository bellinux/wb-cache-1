Specifically, {{we focus on the}} case in which a foreign firm has full control of a local firm through partial ownership. Cross-border ownership on the basis of both financial interests and corporate control leads to horizontal market-linkages through which tariffs and production subsidies may harm a locally-owned firm but benefit a foreign firm.

The Venezuelan government has instituted many methods of economic intervention {{during the last decade}} through exchange rate <b>controls,</b> price <b>controls,</b> <b>tariffs,</b> subsidies, etc., which have had real effects on family income distribution. The effects of these policies on unemployment, nominal wages and salaries, and price variabilities are researched and recommendations are presented. An overview of the current Venezuelan economic condition, beset with problems of past inflationary controls and measures, is assessed and presented. The Venezuelan economy, mainly supported by oil revenues, has potential for a more equitable distribution of family income, given properly controlled fiscal policy and the willingness of the government to decrease anti-competitive economic laws.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the policy reform on {{economic}} performance {{has been one of}} the stifling issues in development economics in the recent years. Since the middle 1970 s, there has been considerable progress in the trade reform in the most developing countries, turning from an import substitution strategy to export-oriented approach. Pakistan also follows export-oriented policies. Pakistan’s trade pattern and trade policy have been moving towards fewer and fewer <b>controls,</b> <b>tariffs</b> rates have come tumbling down. Export-led-growth hypothesis (ELG) suggests that due to positive correlation between export and growth, therefore, export-oriented policies contribute to economic growth. Thus, international trade and development theory suggests that export growth contributes positively to economic growth. On the basis of this framework, most empirical work on the effects of export promoting strategy followed in developing countries evaluated openness with trade. Empirical research about the effect of this liberalisation process has treated export as principal channel for growth. The relationship with exports and growth, grounded in endogenous growth theory, has been tested for Pakistan. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{emphasis}} {{in many developing countries}} on exportled growth policies that attract both domestic and foreign investment into activities for the expansion of manufacturing exports. Often the actual outcome of the policies has been very different than the intention. Among the impediments, investors often face foreign exchange <b>controls,</b> <b>tariffs</b> on imported inputs, and a costly system for the exemption or refund of sales taxes and tariffs on inputs used to produce exports. These factors have frequently discouraged foreign investment, hindered export growth and bred corruption. This paper addresses two issues related to the design and the information requirements for the administration of some of the fiscal provisions that affect the competitiveness of a country in the production of manufactured exports. The first issue is how to design a system that allows exporters to sell their output free of domestic sales and excise taxes. Under a system of VAT taxation, in order for exports to be sold free of tax, they should be taxed at a zero rate and the exporters be given a refund by the government for any tax paid on input purchases...|$|R

In this study, we also provide a synthesis of how a number of developing countries have tried to address these issues. We identify the elements of the administrative system needed to deliver effectively the VAT input tax credit refunds and to eliminate the burden of import duties on inputs used in exports. Emphasis will be placed on the information needs for their effective administration. These findings might prove helpful to policymakers who are faced with the development of institution to administer such border tax adjustments. information, corruption, foreign exchange, tariff, tax...|$|R

50|$|In Canada, {{dairy farming}} {{is subject to}} the system of supply management. Under supply management, which also {{includes}} the egg and poultry sectors, farmers manage their production so that it coincides with forecasts of demand for their products over a predetermined period - while taking into account certain imports that enter Canada, as well as some production which is shipped to export markets. Imports of dairy, eggs, and poultry are <b>controlled</b> using <b>tariff</b> rate quotas, or TRQs. These allow a predetermined quantity to be imported at preferential tariff rates (generally duty free), while maintaining control over how much is imported. The over-quota tariffs are set at levels that allow Canadian farmers to receive a price reflecting the cost to produce in a northern environment.|$|R

After China regained the right to <b>control</b> its <b>tariffs</b> in 1928, the tax imposed on Hong Kong goods rose tremendously, but the Chinese government rejected pleas from Hong Kong industrialists to lower tariffs. The United Kingdom's abolishment of the gold standard destabilised exchange rates. Japan's dumping policy also hit Hong Kong, which did not impose tariffs on exports. The consumption power of Mainland China decreased. The Great Depression further damaged the city's manufacturing sector {{and led to the}} liquidation of over 300 factories.

The focus is upon the different doctrinal perspectives taken by academic economists in New Zealand. Throughout the period under review policymakers supported an inward-looking trade and development regime buttressed by extensive interventionist trade policy. Appeals to the employment argument for industrialization through import substitution lent their policies a veneer of economic respectability. Most economists were not persuaded; they railed against quantitative import <b>controls,</b> discriminatory <b>tariffs</b> and cumbersome export incentive schemes and they offered, in vain, some constructive alternatives relying on price signals rather than administrative rules.

40|$|Using panel data on 23 countries, {{we find a}} {{positive}} and statistically significant relationship between privatization and network expansion and efficiency in the Latin American region. We also find that excess demand for basic service is strongly and negatively related to tariff rebalancing, suggesting that an increase in residential service prices can mitigate unmet demand for basic service in the Latin American region by, in the long run, increasing the supply of main lines. According to our results, a 10 percent increase from the average residential price in Latin America is likely to reduce unmet demand by approximately 4. 1 percent. Finally, we find that privatization is negatively related to unmet demand. In particular, privatization reduces unmet demand by approximately 28 percent. This indicates that, even after <b>controlling</b> for <b>tariff</b> rebalancing, there are concrete efficiency gains from privatization. Telecommunications Privatization Tariff rebalancing...|$|R
40|$|Roughly 16, 000 buses {{serve the}} 16 million {{inhabitants}} of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region; 12, 000 of them serve the Sao Paulo municipality itself, where 8. 5 million people live. Congestion is heavy at peak travel times, and traffic signal timing logic favors the flow of automobiles. Bus operations are also hampered by obsolete ticket collection systems and by poor access for bus passengers, which lengthens boarding and aligthing times. Average bus speed is about 13 kilometers per hour, headways vary greatly, and service is unreliable. But conditions are expected to improve soon as the private sector becomes involved in trunk-line bus corridors. Tender documents for ten bus corridors (one state andnine municipal) have recently been issued, defining rules for private concerns to bid for implementing and operating trunk line services. All costs to implement each service, including improvements in street systems and facilities such as transfer terminals, are to be born by the winning firm. Ten bids have now been awarded and contracts signed. This pioneer project demonstrates that private companies {{are ready to go}} deeper into public transport than they have gone before. Where the investment in busway infrastructure is to be repaid in installments to the private company which is awarded the concession, the use of multilateral agency guarantees (such as the recently approved World Bank guarantees) will probably entice private entrepreneurs. Regulatory and controlling power remain in the government hands. The government will <b>control</b> <b>tariffs,</b> preventing undue increases harmful to low-income users, and monitoring the level of service offered against the pre-agreed targets. Supervision must be very objective, however, and users must be actively involved to gauge the quality of service offered by concessionaires. Sao Paulo municipal authorities were more successful in attracting the private sector than the State, because they devoted a considerable effort to the design remuneration formulas for the concessions.

50|$|To {{understand}} evasion, it {{is imperative}} to first understand interactions between fare <b>control</b> hardware, fare <b>tariff,</b> and passengers. Evasion occurs when passengers gain access from unpaid to paid side by interacting with fare controls in manners inconsistent with tariff.

Additionally, entry procedures are not always strictly followed, though usually no actual revenue losses takes place. There are, therefore, real debates about what constitutes evasion.|$|R

This paper describes a simulation system that was developed to predict the supply and demand of treated water as well as non revenue water source and magnitude for a case study of a public treated water distribution system. The system can also be used in assisting the management of the water department in simulating future development such as demand and new construction of water distribution. In conclusion, the developed system has increased the knowledge of the distribution system and understanding of consumption patterns and non revenue water zones, which has allowed the water authority to optimize its distribution system. 1...|$|R
