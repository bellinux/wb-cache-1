50|$|The party {{stands for}} a simple tax code, low taxes, and for tax {{competition}} among the cantons. It calls for a more <b>citizen-friendly</b> state without excessive bureaucracy and excessive regulation, and for a lean state with lower government spending, which offers only those services which citizens {{and the private sector}} cannot provide. The party, which calls for a competitive and sustainable market economy, wants to strengthen Switzerland as a financial and economic hub with as little government interference as possible. It also calls for the reduction of public debt and fiscal deficits. In general, it believes that tax incentives are better than subsidies in creating incentives. The party sees in the current financial crisis an opportunity to carry out financial and tax reforms quickly to improve situation of companies in Switzerland and to create 40,000 new jobs by 2015. The main objectives of energy policy are security of energy supply and increasing energy efficiency. The party wants to support the research of alternative sources of energy for electricity production which generate no carbon dioxide. Despite this, it is against a carbon emissions tax.|$|E

Emily O'Reilly explained in her statement: [...] "The Commission has done a lot to give effect to the ECI right in a <b>citizen-friendly</b> way. However, more can be done to ensure that ECI organisers feel that their efforts to mobilise one million signatures are worthwhile and that political debate at the European level takes account of their initiatives, even if specific initiatives do not lead to new EU legislation. We need a more effective dialogue with ECI organisers at different stages of an initiative as well as more transparent decision-making as regards what action the Commission takes on ECIs."

Simultaneously, the five-percent threshold was abolished lowering entry barriers. This contribution asks whether these reforms had any effects on local fiscal policies. Based on the reforms that took place in Schleswig-Holstein, Bavaria and Hesse and drawing on a structural break test it is shown that the direct election of mayors has led to lower government spending. The introduction of direct democratic elements, on the other hand, has led to higher expenditures. The empirical results concerning direct democracy substantially deviate from the findings regarding both Switzerland and the U.

The platform is the base for realising several eServices in this special field of public administration. To ensure confidentiality of registration data the project applies digital signatures and encryption. The solution implements the transport protocol OSCI to gain authenticity, integrity and privacy of data. This application focuses on electronic data interchange between registration authorities. Background The amendment of the legal framework concerning registration of residents (the Melderechtsrahmengesetz) in 2001 is the starting point to reingeneer German administrative processes in a quicker, <b>citizen-friendly</b> and financially viable way. It opens up the way for electronic services in this part of public administration. The registration offices throughout Germany have to deal with a huge communication volume. Berlin, for example, has up to 4 million citizen register inquiries from other administrative authorities a year. Bremen, a city with 550. 000 inhabitants, has to cope with 800 to 1000 citizen register inquiries a day. Normally the inquiries are letters or faxes, so are the answers of the registration offices.

40|$|The {{research}} undertaken {{for this}} Report addresses the question: “Does {{the convergence of}} previously discrete strands of information and communications technology (ICT), {{through the medium of}} location awareness, offer an integrating framework for the implementation of <b>citizen-friendly</b> ubiquitous cities? In attempting to answer this question the report examines the different concepts of the ubiquitous city and closely aligned concepts such as the ‘digital city’, ‘intelligent city’ and ‘ambient society’, in order to explore: (i) 	how U-Cities are different to earlier technological cities, and (ii) 	what challenges and opportunities U-Cities bring. The report reviews existing city and interoperability case studies and argues that recent developments in the convergence of ICT and location-aware technology are now making the U-City vision a realisable goal. The U-City concept has been heavily predicated on the development of interoperability standards. These standards are enabling the blending of multiple strands of information and communications technology and e-services to capture and distribute rich, context-related data. The report also outlines some of the potential limitations experienced by digital, intelligent, and ambient cities that may affect U-Cities. It makes recommendations regarding the future of location-aware ICT in urban planning and management. Finally, it examines the role of ‘crowd-sourcing’ and public participation in the acquisition and sharing of data and the consequent implications for the role of government in urban governance, planning and management.

40|$|The paper emphasises {{the role}} of the market-type {{mechanisms}} within the activity of the organisations from the public sector. The end of the 20 th century was defined by the effects of the public sector reform. The public sector is placed within the cultural and political environment of each country and the reforms have aimed to redefine the structures of the state organisations in the economy and the relationships such as market-government, government-bureaucracy, government- citizens, bureaucracy-citizens, civil servants-politicians-citizens. The public sector reform, achieved at the managerial systems, organisational structures and regulations levels is accompanied by specific and structural reforms. Accepting the market-type mechanisms instead of bureaucratic mechanisms, meaning not the simple provision of public services but the creation of some governmental “actors”, functioning completely on commercial bases, supporting the development of the partnerships between the public and private sector, introducing privatisation is achieved in view of creating “the facilitating state”. We discuss about “facilities” such as citizens and society involvement in public businesses, making public administration more <b>citizen-friendly</b> and the state closer to the public need. The citizens’ involvement, as customers in the flow of the public service contributes to creating an organic ensemble characterised by two fundamental dimensions: level and type of influence of the customers and the private-public dichotomy. Synthesising, the relationships and market mechanisms enable to the public sector to get closer to the public needs and to create a modern administration based on efficiency, effectiveness and openness towards change...|$|E
40|$|Corruption {{has been}} {{identified}} as a complex, endemic, and multi-layered problem that threaten the very existence of Nigeria and various efforts have been made by Nigerian government to curb the menace. A cashless policy was recently initiated to curb corruption among other objectives. This study therefore assessed the perceptions of stakeholders on the types of corruption that can be reduced by the cashless policy; examined the effectiveness of the policy in curbing corruption; and identified critical success factors for effective implementation of the policy. This was with a view to providing information on the effect of the cashless policy on corruption in Nigeria. Primary and secondary data were sourced for this study. Primary data were sourced through the administration of unstructured questionnaire to 100 purposively selected respondents with 25 respondents each from the banking sector, government officials, government contractors, and academics. Secondary data were sourced through library research. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics. The results found out that no single strategy can address all types of corruption and that the cashless policy can only reduce petty corruption which is the lowest level of corruption as against all forms of corruption. The study concluded that the inevitability of addressing the root cause of corruption and devising compatible, systemic, and multi-pronged solutions is the most appropriate approach to addressing the menace. This will require enacting or modifying legislation, having effective punishment for corrupt individuals, and systemic changes occasioned by re-engineering processes that interface with the common man through the use of innovative technology solutions such as electronic governance, which will play the role of empowering the citizens by making governance more transparent and <b>citizen-friendly...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rebels and Robbers {{is about}} the {{political}} economy of violence in post-colonial Angola. This book provides the first comprehensive attempt at analyzing how the military and non-military dynamics of more than four decades of conflict created the structural violence that stubbornly defines Angolan society {{even in the absence of}} war. The book clearly demonstrates that the end of the civil war has not ushered in positive peace. The focus on structural violence enables the author to explore the continuities since colonial times, especially in the ways race, class, ethnicity, and power have been used by governing elites as mechanisms to oppress the powerless. Thus, although corruption as structural violence manifesting itself so ubiquitously in Angola today may have been taken to new levels after independence, its origin is unmistakably colonial. Similarly, the zero-sum character of political interactions that defined colonial Angola is yet to be fully exorcized. But there are also important discontinuities. The unabashed propensity to capture public resources for personal aggrandizement is purely post-colonial. So is the tendency toward personal, unaccountable rule. Given its rich endowments, the end of the civil war provides Angola with an opportunity to finally realize its developmental potential. This will depend on whether the wealth resulting from the exploration of natural resources is directed toward creating the conditions for the citizens' realization of their aspirations for the good life thus ensuring sustainable peace.

40|$|The {{opportunities}} and {{constraints of the}} European Commission’s policy for the participation of civil society are {{the subject matter of}} the present work. The understanding of the European Commission and different political scientists concerning “European civil society” and its participation in the context of democratic legitimation and a transnational European public sphere are described. In terms of that the analysis concentrates on the change and development of political strategies and instruments of the European Commission for the participation of civil society in the framework of the European integration history. The relevance of this dissertation is based on the assumption that the inclusion of civil society could be a feasable answer to the stated democratic deficit of the European Union and could make a contribution to the enhancement of its democratic legitimation. By means of different books and articles of political science literature, a discussion of different attitudes in political sciences about democratic theories is carried out. The research design consists of a typology of different participatory instruments of the European Commission and the development of an own analytical framework with dimensions of appropriateness to examine participatory instruments which are access, added value and inclusion. On the basis of this analytical framework the European participatory instruments are examined in terms of their appropriateness in a case study in the socio-economic hard case area of the Berlin borough of Neukölln in the German capital. The result of this analysis is that the participatory instruments employed by the European Commission are only limited appropriate to reach a broader and not only the elitist part of civil society and therefore to reduce the democratic deficit of the European Union. Participation largely depends upon the will and the individual abilities and capacities of citizens and the organisations of civil society. Solution statements and recommendations for policy design are deduced from the research results to enhance the support of these components and to develop alternative, understandable and concrete forms of participation of civil society for a <b>citizen-friendly</b> and democratically legitimated European integration policy in the future...|$|E
40|$|By {{almost every}} {{conceivable}} measure, Americans today are less positive and {{more critical of}} government. Majorities or pluralities of all demographic groups report high levels of distrust towards government and believe the federal government needs very major reform. A growing amount of literature indicates that transparency can improve governmental decision-making. Participation can also have other important effects on customer satisfaction. Research indicates that use of the Internet to transact with government has {{a positive impact on}} citizen trust as well as public perceptions of government responsiveness. Yet skeptics suggest closer examination of the concept and its application is needed. The election of Barack Obama as the 44 th President of the United States became associated with the effective use of Internet technologies during his campaign. Then {{at the beginning of his}} new administration, President Obama declared that he would work to ensure the public trust and establish a new system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. This paper compares the promises and performance of the Obama Administration to develop a set of recommendations that Common Cause North Carolina can provide to governors and state cabinet officials on transparency initiatives throughout state executive branch agencies. This research follows a review procedure combining evidence from quantitative and qualitative studies. This paper reviews the government transparency initiatives launched by the Obama Administration that resulted from his two Memoranda on Open Government as well as the recent actions federal agencies have undertaken to make public information more accessible in response to the administration’s Freedom of Information Act Memorandum. This paper also reviews the delivery models and paths for success proposed by scholars as well as other observers and incorporates their views in developing a list of ‘lessons learned’ for states. I recommend that Common Cause propose to state executives the following: 1) 	States should leverage existing federal infrastructure and national priorities as well as further cultivate state-federal relationships to foster transparency efforts; 2) 	States should provide data in frameworks that are both useful and <b>citizen-friendly</b> in addition to providing the corresponding underlying data; 3) 	States should develop new performance and outcome measurement methods to gauge the success of transparency policy initiatives; and 4) 	States executives should be careful not to overpromise on the outcomes of transparency initiatives...|$|E
40|$|Foreword As the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) {{presents}} its fi rst {{annual report}} to the nation, we {{feel a sense of}} excitement at the potential that India has to emerge as one of the leading knowledge societies in the world. The Commission was set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to prepare a blueprint to tap into the enormous reservoir of our knowledge base so that our people can confidently face challenges of the 21 st century. We are conscious that this is a daunting task, which requires not only resources and time but also a vision and a long term view. At the same time, we are happy that we have taken this fi rst important step. At the heart of the NKC’s mandate are fi ve key areas related to Access, Concepts, Creation, Application and Services. We have addressed {{the question of how to}} build a knowledge society from these perspectives with a particular focus on access to knowledge. Of the nine sets of recommendations made by the NKC in 2006, six deal directly with access. We have done so consciously in conformity with the UPA government’s philosophy of building an inclusive society. The emerging knowledge society and associated opportunities present a set of new imperatives and new challenges for our economy, polity and society. Our future prosperity depends upon the policies, programmes and people that can foster continuous generation and application of knowledge in the pursuit of learning. We have addressed a wide range of subjects including a comprehensive reform of higher education, overhaul of public libraries, creation of a Knowledge Network, setting up of national portals, transformation of vocational education, re-engineering of government processes and making E-governance <b>citizen-friendly.</b> The impact of what we have proposed would be felt over the next decade and beyond. We have taken particular care to keep the entire process democratic, transparent and participative. In doing so, we have consulted a wide range of stakeholders in government, parliament, politics, academia, industry, civil society and the media. Our recommendations refl ect and incorporate the concerns and aspirations of experts and persons from the concerned spheres. The Commission members have worked painstakingly on every aspect of our recommendations. I want to thank all members for the exceptional dedication they have brought to their mandate even though they all know that the impact of their work will be felt only in the long-term. We have had our agreements and disagreements on many issues on the table but their expression has always been in the highest traditions of democracy. I would also like to thank the members of various working groups and the secretariat for their contribution and support. I would like to particularly acknowledge the support and guidance of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Planning Commission. We hope that the work we have done during our fi rst year will be of value to the government and will fi nd the enthusiasm and support of the administration in its implementation. We also hope that our recommendations will receive the attention they deserve and create necessary public discussion, debate and dialogue to shape and mobilize public opinion. We say this with a focus on the 550 million people below the age of 25 who will benefi t the most from the new knowledge initiatives. The destiny of India is in their hands. While making the recommendations we have been guided by how knowledge will impact the lives of people, ordinary people, of India. We are conscious that knowledge is about farmers having access to accurate information about water resources, land quality and fertilizers, students having access to schools and colleges of high quality relevant education and good jobs, scientists having access to well equipped modern libraries and laboratories, industry having access to a skilled workforce and people feeling empowered with good governance in a vibrant democracy. The recommendations of the National Knowledge Commission are really a call to action. It is time to act here and now...|$|E
40|$|The Blueprint {{outlines}} {{an ambitious}} agenda to equip the Australian {{public service and}} the nation for {{the challenges of the}} future. It identifies four broad areas where performance can be improved. Nine interdependent reforms, supported by twenty-eight specific recommendations. The Government is currently considering the reform directions proposed in the Blueprint and is expected to respond through the Budget process.   The Advisory Group has identified four main components of a high-performing public service that form a framework for evaluating APS performance and a benchmark for future reviews. First, a world-class public service must meet the needs of citizens by providing high quality, tailored public services and by engaging citizens in the design and development of services and policy. In an era of rapid technological advancements, customers expect greater service quality from the public sector, just as they expect it from business. At the same time, advances in information technology enable governments to not only deliver services in a more <b>citizen-friendly</b> manner, but to incorporate citizens’ ideas and perspectives into service delivery. There are also opportunities to improve the way the APS incorporates non-government expertise and citizens’ views into the design of services and policy. Second, a high performing public service provides strong leadership and strategic direction. In particular, the best public service leaders oversee the provision of high quality strategic advice, provided to ministers in an open and honest manner. Such advice must be delivered while maintaining a clear organisational strategy to improve workforce performance, strengthen service delivery and improve regulation. There is a lack of comprehensive evidence for benchmarking current APS policy capacity. While some parts of the APS clearly provide excellent strategic advice, APS employees have concerns {{about the extent to which}} there is a focus on strategy. They suggest that more time needs to be devoted to strategic policy rather than reactive measures. Consultations also identified the importance of senior leaders in driving change and the need to improve senior leadership and management across the APS. Strengthening the leadership of the APS, by making leaders more accountable is critical to the reform process. Third, a high performing public service is distinguished by a highly capable workforce. Today’s public servants are passionate and committed to improving the lives of others. Consultation with APS employees revealed an overwhelming sense of pride and commitment in the work of the APS and a willingness to seek new and improved ways of delivering services to the Australian public. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the APS is under-investing in its talent. In the private sector it is increasingly recognised that as much as 80 per cent of a company’s worth is tied to its employees. Yet almost half of APS agencies spend less than 1 per cent of their budget on staff development. Only a small proportion spends an amount similar to the best private sector organisations. There is also a concern about whether the APS is attracting and retaining the best people. Consultations have identified, as an urgent priority, the need for better recruitment processes and mechanisms for people management. Skill gaps remain in critical fields such as information and communications technology (ICT), high level policy, research and project management. Finally, a high performing public service operates efficiently and at a consistently high standard. The APS must continually seek better ways to do business, to spend public funds efficiently and effectively, and to be accountable for its spending. Consultations identified red tape and implementation as areas for improvement. There is a lack of reliable data on the efficiency of public agencies, which needs to be remedied. Reviews of agencies are conducted on an ad hoc basis, and evidence suggests that significant red tape could be cut.  ...|$|E
