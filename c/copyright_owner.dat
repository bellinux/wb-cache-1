5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner.</b> Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Determining {{who are the}} <b>copyright</b> <b>owners</b> of a {{software}} system is important as they are the individuals and organizations that license the software to its users, and ultimately the legal entities that can enforce its licensing terms, and change its license. In this paper we describe the difficulties of identifying the explicit <b>copyright</b> <b>owners</b> of a system, and those who contribute source code to it–who could potentially claim are also <b>copyright</b> <b>owners</b> of it. The paper introduces a method to track the names of contributors, including those explicitly listed as <b>copyright</b> <b>owners</b> from licensing statements in source code file. Then, it reports an empirical study performed on four open source systems—namely ArgoUML, Mozilla, Samba, and Squid— aimed at investigating the characteristics of their contributors and how {{they relate to the}} commits recorded in the system and users who perform them (its committers). Results indicate that explicit contributors and <b>copyright</b> <b>owners</b> are not necessarily the most frequent committers. Also, they are often added during larger changes than average.

25|$|A {{copyright}} notice (©) {{is not required}} on a work to gain copyright, but only the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> is entitled to place a notice. It is useful in publishing the date of first publication and the owner.

25|$|The {{increase}} {{in terms of}} protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright, which has recently {{been the subject of}} serial extensions in the United States and in Europe. With no need for registration or copyright notices, this is thought to have led to an {{increase in}} orphan works (copyrighted works for which the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> cannot be contacted), a problem that has been noticed and addressed by governmental bodies around the world.|$|E
25|$|As a {{trademark}} {{must be used}} to maintain rights in relation to that mark, {{a trademark}} can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or estoppel when suit is finally brought.|$|E

25|$|Simon {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of {{performers}} who are named as the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This noteworthy development was spearheaded by the Bee Gees after their successful $200 million lawsuit against RSO Records, which remains the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. All of Simon's solo recordings, including those originally issued by Columbia Records, are currently distributed by Sony Records' Legacy Recordings unit. His albums were issued by Warner Music Group until mid-2010. In mid-2010, Simon moved his catalog of solo work from Warner Bros. Records to Sony/Columbia Records where Simon and Garfunkel's catalog is. Simon's back catalog of solo recordings would be marketed by Sony Music's Legacy Recordings unit.|$|E
25|$|Days of Heaven {{has been}} {{released}} on home video on various different formats over the years. Its first notable release was on home video in the early 1980s, followed by various reissues in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, the film was released on a special widescreen edition format on home video to preserve the film's original theatrical aspect ratio, which was uncommon for videotapes at the time, with majority of them being pan and scan, a technique that crops {{a portion of the}} image to focus on the more important composition. This often results in the side being cut out and the middle centre being the only remaining part. Days of Heaven premiered on DVD on March 30, 1999 with no special features. The feature itself was presented in widescreen and released by Paramount Pictures, the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> of the film itself. It was rereleased on DVD in 2004, again without special supplements.|$|E
25|$|The {{monopoly}} of the VAAP was abolished in 1989. Also during Perestroika, a work group was formed {{with the task}} to adapt the Soviet copyright law to a market economy. These efforts culminated in the passing of a profoundly revised copyright law on March 31, 1991. This new law was a radical break with the previous Socialist practice. Author's rights were exclusive again, the copyright term was increased to 50 years p.m.a., neighbouring rights were introduced {{for the first time}} in Soviet legislation, and the free uses were reduced considerably and defined much narrower. Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether. The initial <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> in a work in all cases was the natural person who created the work; the copyright of legal entities no longer existed. The provisions of the 1991 Fundamentals, which were scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992, never became effective in the Soviet Union, as the USSR was dissolved before that date.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of flexibilities in European {{copyright}} and database law, {{the mining}} of in-copyright works such as web mining without the permission of the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright, but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the Database Directive. On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception. Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Copyright Directive, the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe. The focus on the solution to this legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable network}} {{was able to}} provide a wider library of films for Best Brains to riff from. To assure {{that they would be}} able to produce a funny episode, at least one member of the staff would watch the {{suggested}} films completely, generally assuring that the movie would be prime for jokes throughout; Conniff stated that he often would have to watch twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show. In one specific case, the second-season episode with the film Sidehackers, they had only skimmed the first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovering that it contained a rape scene. They decided to stay committed to the film, but cut out the offending scene and had to explain the sudden absence of the affected character to the audience. After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the <b>copyright</b> <b>owner</b> as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E
