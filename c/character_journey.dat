5000|$|Vera's {{time on the}} {{government}} medical panels ended with her making a [...] "moral choice of enormous consequence." [...] In her retrospective of the self-penned [...] "The Categories of Life" [...] Espenson observed that the introductory scene establishes Vera as {{the main focus of}} the episode and that her arc carries the story between {{the beginning and end of}} the episode. As Espenson noted, Vera's <b>character</b> <b>journey</b> transforms her from a doctor who contributed to healthcare discussion to [...] "a crusader against this redefinition of life and death." [...] io9 correspondent Charlie Jane Anders commented that the script exposes the character's [...] "human vanity" [...] in a way characteristic of Espenson by showing her [...] "too proud to hide her feelings". Espenson felt that the death scene [...] - [...] in which Vera is burned alive in what is identified as a concentration camp [...] - [...] is both a [...] "horrible and painful death on its own terms" [...] but also meant to evoke [...] "the greatest horror of modern mankind." ...|$|E

It's inherently and inextricably linked to Tris' <b>character</b> <b>journey.</b> There {{will be plenty of}} sexual tension and chemistry, but it's important that all of that stuff doesn't just feel like it's thrown in, but that it all helps Tris grow as a character." [...] Daugherty further added, [...] "It's tricky because the book is a very packed read with a lot of big ideas. So, distilling that into a cool, faithful two-hour movie is challenging. Not only do you have to establish five factions, but you have to acknowledge that there's a sixth entity, which is the divergent, and you also have the factionless. So there's a world that really has to be built out for the big screen… the movie is going to do it a little more efficiently." [...] Author Veronica Roth said about the script of the film: [...] "Reading a script is a really interesting experience. I'd never read a script before.

40|$|This thesis draws {{attention}} to and analyzes the various choices made by James Cameron for the characterization of Rose in Titanic, which is currently celebrating its 20 th anniversary.

40|$|Theatrical {{space is}} {{characterized}} by its ability, through storytelling, to transcend death, time, and other limitations presented by every day reality. Set apart from the machinations of daily life, theatres assume a sort of sacredness that yields the conditions for Arnold van Gennep 2 ̆ 7 s rites of passage. Attending a theatrical event becomes a ritual in which the audience member enters and willingly submits to a realm of myth and inbetweenness. The liminality that defines the space also produces the effects of Victor Turner 2 ̆ 7 s communitas, a surrender of the ritual participant 2 ̆ 7 s secular identity resulting in a perfect equality based on an 2 ̆ 7 essential humanness 2 ̆ 7. While this occurs, elements of the same ritual are generally reflected in the plot or <b>character</b> <b>journey</b> found within the presented theatrical work. The coinciding rituals create a dual-inbetweenness, or metaliminality, in which both the audience members and the theatrical characters are broken down to their 2 ̆ 7 essential humanness 2 ̆ 7, blurring {{the line between the}} reality presented {{in the world of the}} play and the spectator 2 ̆ 7 s reality. The result is a ritualistic empathic link between the audience and the characters at play. This also implies that a responsibility exists on the audience 2 ̆ 7 s part to properly engage in the ritual of theatergoing...|$|E
