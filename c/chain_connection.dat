40|$|TLS {{is a vital}} {{protocol}} used {{to secure}} communication over networks and it provides an end- to-end encrypted channel between two directly communicating parties. In certain situations it is not possible, or desirable, to establish direct connections from a client to a server, as for example when connecting to a server located on a secure network behind a gateway. In these cases <b>chained</b> <b>connections</b> are required. Mutual authentication and end-to-end encryption are important capabilities in a high assur- ance environment. These are provided by TLS, {{but there are no}} known solutions for <b>chained</b> <b>connections.</b> This thesis explores multiple methods that provides the functionality for chained connec- tions using TLS in a high assurance environment with trusted servers and a public key in- frastructure. A number of methods are formally described and analysed according to multi- ple criteria reflecting both functionality and security requirements. Furthermore, the most promising method is implemented and tested in order to verify that the method is viable in a real-life environment. The proposed solution modifies the TLS protocol through the use of an extension which allows for the distinction between direct and <b>chained</b> <b>connections.</b> The extension which also allows for specifying the structure of <b>chained</b> <b>connections</b> is used in the implementation of a method that creates <b>chained</b> <b>connections</b> by layering TLS connections inside each other. Testing demonstrates that the overhead of the method is negligible and that the method is a viable solution for creating <b>chained</b> <b>connections</b> with mutual authentication using TLS. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how network structure {{can influence the}} tendency for a neuronal network to synchronize, or its synchronizability, independent of the dynamical model for each neuron. The synchrony analysis {{takes advantage of the}} framework of second order networks (SONETs), which defines four second order connectivity statistics based on the relative frequency of two-connection network motifs. The analysis identifies two of these statistics, convergent <b>connections</b> and <b>chain</b> <b>connections,</b> as highly influencing the synchrony. Simulations verify that synchrony decreases with the frequency of convergent connections and increases with the frequency of <b>chain</b> <b>connections.</b> These trends persist with simulations of multiple models for the neuron dynamics and for different types of networks. Surprisingly, divergent connections, which determine the fraction of shared inputs, do not strongly influence the synchrony. The critical role of chains, rather than divergent connections, in influencing synchrony can be explained by a pool and redistribute mechanism. The pooling of many inputs averages out independent fluctuations, amplifying weak correlations in the inputs. With increased <b>chain</b> <b>connections,</b> neurons with many inputs tend to have many outputs. Hence, chains ensure that the amplified correlations in the neurons with many inputs are redistributed throughout the network, enhancing the development of synchrony across the network...|$|R

50|$|Because {{there is}} no camshaft, there are fewer moving parts. The cam shaft rollers and push rods have been {{replaced}} by an electro-hydraulic actuator system which uses the existing fuel pumps. This reduces development risks of the new system by employing existing technology. Direction changing on older B&W MC engines was engaged by changing the direction of the cam roller. With the new cam-less engine it is controlled by a computer. This gets rid of mechanical failures that can damage the engine if there is a malfunction in the engine when changing directions. Also, {{there is no}} <b>chain</b> <b>connection</b> between the crank shaft and the cam shaft so the engine is lighter with less points of failure. Since there is no camshaft, the parasitic load on the engine output is removed. This is particularly useful in large marine engines that can produce up to 100 megawatts as it can equate to a large amount of power saving. With a cam-less engine, fuel injection and exhaust timing are directly controlled by an Engine control unit and it can be constantly changed and adjusted without stopping the engine. This allows for the engine to run at lower RPM which is useful for maneuvering as it allows slower ship speeds for safe and precise docking. Aditionally, when a ship is maneuvering, the computer controlled Fuel injection and valve timing allows for faster RPM control, hence faster stopping in emergency situations.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{being very}} common in fictional works such as cartoons, films and {{role-playing}} games as a [...] "quintessential medieval weapon," [...] historical information about this type of flail is somewhat scarce. A few doubt they existed at all due {{to the number of}} pieces sitting in museums {{that turned out to be}} forgeries, as well as the unrealistic way they are depicted in art. Archaeologically, however, a type of military flail known as a kisten, with a non-spiked head and a leather, rather than <b>chain,</b> <b>connection</b> to the haft is attested in the 10th century in the territories of the Rus, probably being adopted from the either the Avars or Khazars. This weapon had spread into central and eastern Europe in the 11th - 13th centuries and may be considered an ancestor of the ball-and-chain flail. [...] Waldman (2005) documented several seemingly authentic examples of the ball-and-chain flail from private collections as well as several restored illustrations from German, French, and Czech sources. He states that the scarcity of artifacts and artistic depictions, combined with the almost complete lack of text references, suggests they were relatively rare weapons and never saw widespread use. One of the reasons was the hazard the weapon posed to its wielder, especially the varieties with long chains and short handles. A missed swing would still retain momentum, causing the striking end to continue its arc around, potentially into the user's hand or body. [...] A miss could also throw the user off balance, and even if a blow were struck, there would be a dangerously long recovery time before the user could ready another swing or defend himself.|$|E

30|$|Estimating {{the length}} of the <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> from Host 0 to Host i as shown in Fig.  1 is called {{upstream}} detection. Similarly, estimating {{the length of}} the <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> form Host i to Host N is called downstream detection. Accurate estimation of {{the length of the}} whole <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> requires both downstream and upstream detections. Unfortunately, performing upstream detection is extremely challenging. Such a problem is still open and remains unsolved. Therefore, it is extremely hard to estimate the length of the whole <b>connection</b> <b>chain.</b> So most researchers in SSID primarily focused on using the length of downstream connection to decide whether there is a stepping-stone intrusion. Compared to using the length of the whole <b>connection</b> <b>chain,</b> this simplified method may introduce false negative errors, but it performs much better than host-based detection as well as largely reduces false positive errors.|$|R

30|$|So one {{approach}} of detecting stepping-stone intrusion is {{to estimate the}} number of compromised hosts used as stepping-stones in a <b>connection</b> <b>chain.</b> In other words, this detection method is to estimate {{the length of a}} <b>connection</b> <b>chain.</b> The longer the <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> is, the more suspicious the connection is. It makes a more reasonable sense to determine an intrusion {{based on the number of}} hosts used as stepping-stones, other than a single host detected to be used as a stepping-stone. As we mentioned before many times, detecting intrusion based on stepping-stone detection may bring false positive errors. Similarly, detecting intrusion using the length of a <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> may incur false negative detection error. The reason is that we can only estimate the length of the downstream section in a <b>connection</b> <b>chain,</b> other than the length of the whole <b>connection</b> <b>chain.</b> If a sensor happens to be close to the victim host, the length of the downstream <b>connection</b> <b>chain</b> would be trivial. In such a case, the upstream connection would dominate the length of the whole chain, but it cannot be estimated. In this scenario, the intrusion would escape from the detection. But this approach can definitely bring down false positive error because it does not count the upstream connection. If a downstream connection has more than three hosts used as stepping-stones, plus upstream connection, it would definitely be more than three compromised hosts. Obviously, if we want to minimize false negative detection error, it is necessary to know the length of the upstream connection which is currently still an open problem even though some researchers proposed several methods toward solving this problem. In the following, if we mention the length of a <b>connection</b> <b>chain,</b> it always means a downstream connection.|$|R

30|$|This paper proposes BU and PF (DPF) {{methods that}} {{consider}} the mobility in PMIPv 6 networks. The proposed dual pointer forwarding scheme can decrease {{the cost of}} BU, and solve the high signaling overhead problem generated in LMA. The dual pointer forwarding scheme is proposed with two methods in this paper. The first is the pointer <b>chain</b> <b>connection</b> method between domains (LMA), which restricts movement between domains in PMIPv 6. The second is proposed to reduce the high signaling overhead and packet delivery delays within domain that are generated by the pointer <b>chain</b> <b>connection</b> between MAGs within domain, when MNs move within the domain (LMA). The PF scheme between LMA reduces high signaling overhead, due to when the MNs move between domains. A mobility adaptive mPF scheme is used, where the length of pointer chain becomes long, or packet delivery delays occur with simultaneous signaling overhead between LMA and MAG. When the delay of response from LMA reaches a scheduled time, the packet overhead that is delivered from MN is decreased, due to registering PLCoA to MAG, where CN belongs to. Numerical analytic result is presented in this paper, after analyzing the effect of session and domain (LMA) size with between domains, and within domain, respectively. In addition, the effect from the optimal pointer chain length and SMR is analyzed. Finally, the proposed mPF scheme shows that it is excellent in performance, and reduces the total cost by comparing mPF to PMIPv 6 and PF.|$|E
