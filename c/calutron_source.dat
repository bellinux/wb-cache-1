40|$|Some {{problems}} {{relating to}} the possibility of accelerating light ions in the CERN SC are studied. Deuteron capture conditions and the optimum radio-frequency versus time curve are calculated. Internal beam currents of some micro-amperes seem obtainable when using the <b>calutron</b> <b>source</b> as for protons. The same calculations were repeated for N/sup 5 +/ taking into account the charge exchange process in the vacuum. A transmission of between 5 and 10 % has been calculated, giving some 10 /sup 10 / particles per second with a PIG source...|$|E
