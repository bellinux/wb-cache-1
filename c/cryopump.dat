50|$|Regeneration of a <b>cryopump</b> is {{the process}} of {{evaporating}} the trapped gases. During a regeneration cycle, the <b>cryopump</b> is warmed to room temperature or higher, allowing trapped gases to change from a solid state to a gaseous state and thereby be released from the <b>cryopump</b> through a pressure relief valve into the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|When {{regeneration}} {{is complete}} the <b>cryopump</b> will be roughed to 50μTorr (50 microTorr), isolated, and the rate-of-rise (ROR) will be monitored {{to test for}} complete regeneration. If the ROR exceeds 10μTorr/min the <b>cryopump</b> will require additional purge time.|$|E
50|$|Most {{production}} equipment utilizing a <b>cryopump</b> have {{a means to}} isolate the <b>cryopump</b> from the vacuum chamber so regeneration takes place without exposing the vacuum system to released gasses such as water vapor. Water vapor is the hardest natural element to remove from vacuum chamber walls upon exposure to the atmosphere due to monolayer formation and hydrogen bonding. Adding heat to the dry nitrogen purge-gas will speed the warm-up and reduce the regeneration time.|$|E

In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, cryogenic rocket engines (or, generally, all liquid-propellant engines) are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle.|$|R

The unique test apparatus and test methods developed for the investigation of <b>cryopumping</b> in cryogenic insulations are described. Panel level test specimens with various types of cryogenic insulations were subjected to a specific thermal profile where the temperature varied from - 262 C to 21 C. <b>Cryopumping</b> occurred if the interior temperature of the specimen exhibited abnormal temperature fluctuations, such as a sudden decrease in temperature during the heating phase...|$|R
50|$|The <b>cryopump</b> {{provides}} fast, clean pumping of all {{gases in}} the 10−3 to 10−9 Torr range. The <b>cryopump</b> operates {{on the principle that}} gases can be condensed and held at extremely low vapor pressures, achieving high speeds and throughputs. The cold head consists of a two-stage cold head cylinder (part of the vacuum vessel) and a drive unit displacer assembly. These together produce closed-cycle refrigeration at temperatures that range from 60 to 80K for the first-stage cold station to 10 to 20K for the second-stage cold station, typically.|$|E
50|$|Cold traps {{are also}} used in <b>cryopump</b> systems to {{generate}} hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) into their liquid or solid forms.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cryopump</b> or a [...] "cryogenic pump" [...] is {{a vacuum}} pump that traps gases and vapours by {{condensing}} {{them on a}} cold surface, but are only effective on some gases. The effectiveness depends on the freezing and boiling points of the gas relative to the cryopump's temperature. They are sometimes used to block particular contaminants, for example {{in front of a}} diffusion pump to trap backstreaming oil, or in front of a McLeod gauge to keep out water. In this function, they are called a cryotrap, waterpump or cold trap, even though the physical mechanism is the same as for a <b>cryopump.</b>|$|E

40|$|The SES (Space Environmental Simulator), {{largest of}} the Thermal Vacuum Facilities at The Goddard Space Flight Center, {{recently}} was converted from an oil diffusion pumped chamber to a <b>Cryopumped</b> chamber. This modification was driven by requirements of flight projects. The basic requirement was to retain or enhance the operational parameters of the chamber such as pumping speed, ultimate vacuum, pump down time, and thermal system performance. To accomplish this task, seventeen diffusion pumps were removed and replaced with eight 1. 2 meter (48 inch) diameter <b>cryopumps</b> and one 0. 5 meter (20 inch) turbomolecular pump. The conversion was accomplished {{with a combination of}} subcontracting and in-house efforts to maximize the efficiency of implementation...|$|R
50|$|Unlike turbomolecular {{pumps and}} <b>cryopumps,</b> {{diffusion}} pumps have no moving parts {{and as a}} result are quite durable and reliable. They can function over pressure ranges of 10−10 to 10−2 mbar. They are driven only by convection and thus have a very low energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} pumps {{may be used}} in {{sequence}} or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 Torr, 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a sorption pump would be used to bring the pressure down to 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). A <b>cryopump</b> or turbomolecular pump would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10−8 Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10−6 Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a <b>cryopump</b> or turbo pump, such as helium or hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|Sorption {{pumps are}} {{a type of}} <b>cryopump</b> that is often used as {{roughing}} pumps to reduce pressures from the range of atmospheric to {{on the order of}} 0.1 Pa (10−3 Torr), while lower pressures are achieved using a finishing pump (see vacuum).|$|E
50|$|Turbomolecular pumps {{evacuate}} the entire beam {{path of the}} SHRIMP to maximise transmission and reduce contamination. The sample chamber also employs a <b>cryopump</b> to trap contaminants, especially water. Typical pressures inside the SHRIMP are between ~7 x 10−9 mbar in the detector and ~1 x 10−6 mbar in the primary column.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>cryopumping</b> {{techniques}} {{to obtain a}} contamination free vacuum is discussed. Of those gases that are normally present in an initially air filled vacuum system, only carbon dioxide and water vapor will be effectively pumped at 77 degrees Kelvin. In order to circumvent this restriction on the types of gases that are pumped at this temperature, it is postulated that a gas which is easily condensable at 77 degrees K be injected into the system {{in the form of}} a directed stream. The stream would then entrain the normally noncondensable species by a momentum transfer mechanism. After sweeping through the volume to be pumped, the injected gas stream would then be condensed on a <b>cryopumping</b> surface maintained at 77 degrees Kelvin...|$|R

50|$|An {{entrapment}} pump {{may be a}} <b>cryopump,</b> {{which uses}} cold temperatures to condense gases to a solid or adsorbed state, a chemical pump, which reacts with gases to produce a solid residue, or an ion pump, which uses strong electrical fields to ionize gases and propel the ions into a solid substrate.

50|$|Cryopumps are {{commonly}} cooled by compressed helium, {{though they may}} also use dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or stand-alone versions may include a built-in cryocooler. Baffles are often attached to the cold head to expand the surface area available for condensation, but these also increase the radiative heat uptake of the <b>cryopump.</b> Over time, the surface eventually saturates with condensate and thus the pumping speed gradually drops to zero. It will hold the trapped gases {{as long as it}} remains cold, but it will not condense fresh gases from leaks or backstreaming until it is regenerated.

Taking the pump structural and support characteristics into consideration, the corrected pumping speed for D{sub 2 } is 30, 000 {ell}/s [1].

Test results including thermal stabilization, heat transfer effectiveness, and <b>cryopumping</b> confirm that the aerogel system eliminates free liquid nitrogen within the intertank. Physisorption (or adsorption) of liquid nitrogen within the fine pore structure of aerogel materials was also investigated.
