5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place in a year to put {{his head in the}} same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} organic acidemias, GA1 causes {{carnitine}} depletion. Whole-blood carnitine {{can be raised}} by oral supplementation. However, this does not significantly change blood concentrations of glutarylcarnitine or esterified carnitine, suggesting that oral supplementation is suboptimal in raising tissue levels of carnitine. In the field of clinical nutrition, researchers <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conclusion, that oral carnitine raises plasma levels but doesn't affect muscle carnitine, where {{most of it is}} stored and used.|$|E

25|$|Studies using PET have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{conclusions}} {{regarding the}} use of the parahippocampal gyrus for prospective memory. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be able to remember one half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal gyrus is additionally involved in monitoring the novelty of presented stimuli. If not monitored properly, new stimuli can be distracting during attempts to remember intentions for the future.|$|E

25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate {{that there was no}} significant difference in the immunogenic response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells. Furthermore, Araki et al. reported little or no immunogenic response for both cell lines. Thus, Araki et al. was unable to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conclusion as Zhou et al.|$|E

25|$|Allied {{intelligence}} did {{not fall}} for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to “cut off the Cambrai salient” (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior to a bigger offensive in Flanders or Champagne. Haig privately thought the Guards Division “our only reliable reserve”. He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he “was only afraid that the Enemy would find our front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily”. The claim {{does not appear in}} the official minutes, which merely warn of a “prolonged” German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conclusion in January. Haig thought the Canadians “really fine disciplined soldiers now and so smart and clean” compared to the Australians.|$|E

[...] Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot, but said of the episode, [...] "For now, we’ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have waited a long time for it." [...] Leitch, who called Holly the show's [...] "most beloved guest star", also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly's brief reunion: [...] "The couple and the producers seem to have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conclusion about this relationship: Holly (Amy Ryan) can’t actually stay with Michael (Steve Carell), so let’s just enjoy her while she’s here." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it [...] "doesn't really reach that high", which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes. He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game, and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam, he also said the twist was [...] "predictable and telegraphed".|$|E
