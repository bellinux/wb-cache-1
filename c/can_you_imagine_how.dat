Nor could their thoughts be kept to any one point; the wind blew with them all this while at great uncertainties, yea, their hearts were like a balance that had been disquieted with a shaking hand. But at last, as they with many a long look looked over the wall of Mansoul, they thought that they saw some returning to the town; and thought again, Who should they be too, who should they be?

Alas! for them, poor hearts! who could blame them? since their dead friends were come to life again; for it was to them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the town of Mansoul shine in such splendour. They looked for nothing but the axe and the block; but, behold, joy and gladness, comfort and consolation, and such melodious notes attending them that was sufficient to make a sick man well.|$|E
6000|$|So, at {{the time}} appointed, he makes his {{approach}} to Mansoul, and the gates were set open for him, there also the ancients and elders of Mansoul met him, to salute him with a thousand welcomes. Then he arose and entered Mansoul, he and all his servants. The elders of Mansoul did also go dancing before him till {{he came to the}} castle gates. And this was the manner of his going up thither. He was clad in his golden armour, he rode in his royal chariot, the trumpets sounded about him, the colours were displayed, his ten thousands went up at his feet, and the elders of Mansoul danced before him.[216] And now were the walls of the famous town of Mansoul filled with the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof, who went up thither to view the approach of the blessed Prince, and his royal army. Also the casements, windows, balconies, and tops of the houses were all now filled with persons of all sorts to behold how their town was to be filled with good. [217] Now when he was come so far into the town as to the Recorder's house, he commanded that one should go to Captain Credence, to know whether the castle of Mansoul was prepared to entertain his Royal Presence, for the preparation of that was left to that captain, and word was brought that it was (Acts 15:9).[218] Then was Captain Credence commanded also to come forth with his power to meet the Prince, the which was, as he had commanded, done, and he conducted him into the castle (Eph 3:17). This done, the Prince that night did lodge in the castle with his mighty captains and men of war, to the joy of the town of Mansoul. Now the next care of the townsfolk was how the captains and soldiers of the Prince's army should be quartered among them, and the care was not how they should shut their hands of them, but how they should fill their houses with them; for every man in Mansoul now had that esteem of Emmanuel and his men, that nothing grieved them more than because they were not enlarged enough, every one of them to receive the whole army of the Prince, yea, they counted it their glory to be waiting upon them, and would in those days run at their bidding like lackeys. At last they came to this result:--1. That Captain Innocency should quarter at Mr. Reason's. 2. That Captain Patience should quarter at Mr. Mind's. This Mr. Mind was formerly the Lord Will-be-will's clerk, in time of the late rebellion. 3. It was ordered that Captain Charity should quarter at Mr. Affection's house. 4. That Captain Good-hope should quarter at my Lord Mayor's. Now for the house of the Recorder, himself desired, because his house was next to the castle, and because from him it was ordered by the Prince, that, if need be, the alarm should be given to Mansoul; it was, I say, desired by him that Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction should take up their quarters with him, even they and all their men. 5. As for Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, my Lord Will-be-will took them, and their men to him, because he was to rule under the Prince {{for the good of the}} town of Mansoul now, as he had before, under the tyrant Diabolus for the hurt and damage thereof (Rom 6:19; Eph 3:17). 6. And throughout the rest of the town were quartered Emmanuel's forces, but Captain Credence with his men abode still in the castle. So the Prince, his captains, and his soldiers were lodged in the town of Mansoul.[219] Now the ancients and elders of the town of Mansoul thought that they never should have enough of the Prince Emmanuel; his person, his actions, his words, and behaviour, were so pleasing, so taking, so desirable to them. Wherefore, they prayed him, that though the castle of Mansoul was his place of residence, and they desired that he might dwell there for ever, yet that he would often visit the streets, houses, and people of Mansoul. For, said they, Dread Sovereign, thy presence, thy looks, thy smiles, thy words, are the life, and strength, and sinews of the town of Mansoul.[220] Besides this, they craved that they might have, without difficulty or interruption, continual access unto him, so for that very purpose he commanded that the gates should stand open, that they might there see the manner of his doings, the fortifications of the place, and the royal mansion-house of the Prince. When he spake they all stopped their mouths and gave audience; and when he walked, it was their delight to imitate him in his goings. Now upon a time Emmanuel made a feast for the town of Mansoul, and upon the feasting-day the townsfolk were come to the castle to partake of his banquet. And he feasted them with all manner of outlandish food, food that grew not in the fields of Mansoul, nor in all the whole Kingdom of Universe. It was food that came from his Father's court, and so there was dish after dish set before them, and they were commanded freely to eat. But still when a fresh dish was set before them, they would whisperingly say to each other, What is it? (Exo 16:15) [221] For they wist not what to call it. They drank also of the water that was made wine; and were very merry with him. There was music also all the while at the table, and man did eat angels' food, and had honey given him out of the rock. So Mansoul did eat the food that was peculiar to the court, yea, they had now thereof to the full (Psa 78:24,25). [222] I must not forget to tell you that as at this table there were musicians, so they were not those of the country, nor yet of the town of Mansoul; but they were the masters of the songs that were sung at the court of Shaddai.[223] Now after the feast was over, Emmanuel was for entertaining the town of Mansoul with some curious riddles of secrets drawn up by his Father's secretary, by the skill and wisdom of Shaddai; the like to these there is not in any kingdom. These riddles were made upon the King Shaddai himself, and upon Emmanuel his Son, and upon his wars and doings with Mansoul. Emmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddles himself, but oh how they were lightened! They saw what they never saw, they could not have thought that such rarities could have been couched in so few and such ordinary words. I told you before whom these riddles did concern; and as they were opened, the people did evidently see it was so. Yea, they did gather that the things themselves were a kind of portraiture, and that of Emmanuel himself; for when they read in the scheme where the riddles were writ, and looked in the face of the Prince, things looked so like the one to the other that Mansoul could not forbear but say, This is the Lamb, this is the Sacrifice, this is the Rock, this is the Red Cow, this is the Door, and this is the way; with a great many other things more.[224] And thus he dismissed the town of Mansoul. But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> the people of the corporation were taken with this entertainment? Oh they were transported with joy, they were drowned with wonderment, while they saw and understood, and considered what their Emmanuel entertained them withal, and what mysteries he opened to them; and when they were at home in their houses, and in their most retired places, they could not but sing of him, and of his actions. Yea, so taken were the townsmen now with their Prince, that they would sing of him in their sleep. Now it was in the heart of the Prince Emmanuel to new model the town of Mansoul, and to put it into such a condition as might be more pleasing to him, and that might best stand with the profit and security of the now flourishing town of Mansoul. He provided also against insurrections at home, and invasions from abroad; such love had he for the famous town of Mansoul. Wherefore he first of all commanded that the great slings that were brought from his Father's court, when he came to the war of Mansoul, should be mounted, some upon the battlements of the castle, some upon the towers, for there were towers in the town of Mansoul, towers new built by Emmanuel since he came thither.[225] There was also an instrument invented by Emmanuel, that was to throw stones from the castle of Mansoul, out at Mouth-gate; an instrument that could not be resisted, nor that would miss of execution; wherefore for the wonderful exploits that it did when used, it went without a name, and it was committed to the care of, and to be managed by the brave captain, the Captain Credence, in case of war.[226] This done, Emmanuel called the Lord Will-be-will to him, and gave him in commandment to take care of the gates, the wall, and towers in Mansoul. Also the Prince gave him the militia into his hand; and a special charge to withstand all insurrections and tumults that might be made in Mansoul, against the peace of our Lord the King, and the peace and tranquillity of the town of Mansoul. He also gave him in commission, that if he found any of the Diabolonians lurking in any corner in the famous town of Mansoul, he should forthwith apprehend them, and stay them, or commit them to safe custody, that they may be proceeded against according to law. Then he called unto him the Lord Understanding, who was the old Lord Mayor, he that was put out of place when Diabolus took the town, and put him into his former office again, and it became his place for his lifetime. He bid him also that he should build him a palace near Eye-gate, and that he should build it in fashion like a tower for defence. He bid him also that he should read in the Revelation of Mysteries[227] all the days of his life, that he might know how to perform his office aright. He also made Mr. Knowledge the Recorder; not of contempt to old Mr. Conscience, who had been Recorder before; but for that it was in his princely mind to confer upon Mr. Conscience another employ; of which he told the old gentleman he should know more hereafter. Then he commanded that the image of Diabolus should be taken down from the place where it was set up, and that they should destroy it utterly, beating of it into powder, and casting it unto the wind, without the town-wall; and that the image of Shaddai his Father should be set up again, with his own, upon the castle gates, and that it should be more fairly drawn than ever; forasmuch as both his Father and himself were come to Mansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore (Rev 22:4). He would also that his name should be fairly engraven upon the front of the town, and that it should be done in the best of gold, for the honour of the town of Mansoul.[228] ...|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} storyline in an American film {{is usually}} {{in the form of}} a V shape. I am oversimplifying, but we see someone tumbling down, they hit bottom, and then they rise up again and find redemption. Anyone who personally, tangentially or culturally knows anything about addiction is aware that it resembles an EKG. Up and down, up and down. Very few people ever get clean on the first or second attempt. For many people, it’s something they have to try over and over again. You get knocked down and ask all the ethical questions like how many chances do you give a person? When is the last chance? How many chances do they get? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> difficult it is to fit that in a feature-length film? But those are the questions that are worth asking... The reason why boils down to the word “dark”. It is the scariest four-letter word in American storytelling and in this culture. Our film had a strong reception in Europe and achieved distribution, but that was not the case here. We received so many responses like, “We love the film, but we cannot do anything with it or we’ll lose our shirts. We’re sorry.” The intervention comes from people like Laemmle/Zeller Films. Every couple of years, some mavericks take on this challenge of distributing so-called un-distributable films. They take those films on a small run and allow them to see the light of day. Those efforts are what give a film like Down to the Bone a chance to have a life of some kind.|$|E
5000|$|Mikhail Khodorkovsky, I {{am writing}} to you from Finland. My name is Polina Zherebtsova. I am a {{political}} refugee from Russia. From contemporary Russia, which for many, many years has been ruled by Mr. Putin. All my life I have kept a diary. And it so happened that I {{was born in the}} Caucasus, in the city of Grozny. When I was nine years old my city was surrounded by a ring of Russian tanks - and houses were turned into ruins and ashes along with their inhabitants. Has your home been shelled by a tank, Mr Khodorkovsky? Mine was. The upper floors of the apartment building were on fire, and children were screaming in unbearable pain: shrapnel tore their bodies. My grandfather, a veteran of the Second World War, was in the hospital on Pervomayskaya Street, but was killed in the shelling. He was recovering - my mother and I were going to take him home. We could not bury him for a week. There was fighting. I know you have been through a lot, have been imprisoned. But tell me - <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> the patients scream when the guns are firing at their hospital or when a jet bomber, invisible and invulnerable to their curses, drops a one-and-a-half ton bomb on them? We looked for where the snow was cleaner, gathered it up and strained it through cloth so we would drink it. It was not white snow, not at all like the snow I can see just now in Finland. It was dark gray and bitter, because there were burning buildings all around. An oil plant was on fire, and whole neighborhoods of homes were burning. Before they reached living human flesh, the bombs tore up stone and concrete. And the houses were full of people, and they had nowhere to run to. We fell from hunger, lying about in the corners of apartments, half submerged in basements. And the rats huddled against the cold at our feet and squeaked. The rats slept with me in the hallway on the icy wooden floor, and I didn't chase them away, realizing that even they were suffering from [...] "Russian democracy" [...] Our cats died, unable to withstand the diet of pickled tomatoes we fed them once every few days. To get at least some food, you had to walk about in other people's basements, where the conquerors had left thin silver threads, and if you stepped on one of those threads you would go straight to heaven. And {{do you want to hear}} how I stood near the concrete slabs under which for three days in the centre of Grozny, choking in the wreckage and cement dust, Russian old folk died? No one was able to raise the slabs and remove the debris! People wept and prayed, but could not do anything. Those who died under the ruins of their houses did not get a grave in [...] "the land we won." [...] This hell was repeated many times in ten years: as long as the war lasted in the Caucasus, in the Chechen Republic. In August 1996 rockets from a Russian military post flew into the staircase of our apartment building: our neighbours were blown to pieces. I was eleven years old at the time. I came out into the front entrance of our building and my feet sank ankle-deep in blood. Blood dripped from the walls and ceiling, and I could hear the surviving neighbours screaming in terrible agony. Since then, Mr Khodorkovsky, I do not believe Russia's rulers. I do not think that this is the price of conquering the land and preserving its integrity. This was done by [...] "weaklings" [...] - because a strong man will not assert himself at the expense of the lives of women and children. Essentially they are traitors of their own people. In 1999, when the [...] "humanitarian corridors" [...] of refugees were shelled, burning people alive in buses, we could not get out of the city. And on October 21, 1999 Grozny market was hit by a rocket. In the afternoon, when thousands of people were crowded there. It was later announced that this was a [...] "market of terrorists" [...] with whom the invaders were fighting. [...] "Terrorists" [...] was the name they gave to the children, the old folk and women who traded vegetables, sweets, bread, cigarettes, newspapers, etc. And the market was called the [...] "arms market," [...] but I never saw weapons there, although sometimes I would spend a whole day going round all the stalls with a box of stuff. During the holidays or after school I could not rest - I had to work in order to survive. I traded in that market place. There were no pensions, no salaries. People did their best to survive. For a year my mother received no salary. It was stolen. And we traded in order to survive and buy bread. They did not have to start [...] "conquering us", turning our lives into one continuous strip of hell. Our lives were already hard enough without bombs and [...] "Grad" [...] installations. When the rocket hit Grozny market I was three blocks away from the place where it landed. I saw fire from the ground to the sky, and then I heard a deafening explosion. In my legs there were sixteen fragments of shrapnel. And what happened to the people who were closer to the rocket? Severed arms, legs, heads, bodies turned to dust. The children found their mother by her hairpins or the buttons on her jacket... Did anyone get an apology? Or compensation for this hell? Did anyone? I got nothing except threats and being told to [...] "shut your mouth", as I was a true witness to these bloody events. Here is the face of the modern Russian government. Killing, slandering and grabbing. And this is called [...] "conquest"? In 2000, On January 19, the surviving neighbours and my mother and I were threatened with execution by firing squad. We were on the edge of a cliff and the soldiers fired over our heads. Our old granny neighbour fell to her knees, crying: [...] "What are you doing? We're your people! We're Russians! Don't shoot!" [...] The Caucasus is a peculiar region. In it, cultures and ethnicities, ways of life and cuisines, have been interwoven. Of the forty-eight apartments in our building ten were Chechen and the rest - Russian, Armenian, Gypsy, Azeri, Ingush, Jewish, Polish... We lived together amicably until the war began. The war swept everything away: life, friendship, love. It destroyed everything. Surviving in inhuman conditions, people from the Chechen Republic n the other regions of Russia faced and still face the most vile discrimination, persecution and threats. The authorities have no time for their stories of mass executions and extrajudicial kilings. All, regardless of ethnicity, are classed as [...] "Chechens." [...] I have come up against this, too. For about a year I was refused a passport. But you got one in a single day, and were even kindly driven to the gangway of a private jet. Double standards - those are precisely what distinguish despotism from democracy... I was very sympathetic to you when you were in prison. I considered the sentences you were given unjust, political. Even now I think that you may have been subjected to pressure. But you in your interview you said: [...] "Putin is no weakling. I am ready to fight in order to keep the North Caucasus as part of our country. This is our land, we conquered and won it!" [...] Consider: now you will have to share responsibility for those war crimes, which in the Caucasus are not the costs of [...] "conquest", but its essence. Read my diary. Read how we were conquered. How we buried our murdered neighbours under fire, having first covered the graves with branches so that the hungry dogs would not tear the bodies apart. How thousands of women and children were murdered in the Chechen Republic. Do you still want integration with such a Russia? I do not. And I do not need their citizenship. I am embarrassed by it, like the shameful brand-mark on a slave.Polina Zherebtsova23.12.2013 ...|$|E

I’m giving it all I’ve got, but I’m exhausted. ” She paused and reflected again. “And I’m the adult—the one with the longest legs in this room. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> the kids feel!” This teacher put words to what many educators feel in this era of man-dated standards and high-stakes testing. There is a mass of information she feels compelled to cover with her students—nearly always too much infor-mation for the time between the start of the race and the finish line. The effective teacher, she feels, will somehow find the stamina to cover all the ground with her students so they will be prepared when test day comes. Academic standards should not be in conflict with artful teaching. All professions have clearly articulated standards. In schools, they can help establish a common direction, ensure some equity in learning goals, provide a ready means of communication among educators as well as with parents and community, and serve as common benchmarks that allow teachers to record a student’s learning journey. As such, standards suggest positive possi-bilities for teachers and learners...|$|E
40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia has {{celebrated the}} launch of two {{important}} contributions {{to the study of}} religion and world politics by emerging scholar and respected staff member, Dr John Rees, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations. The Centre for Faith, Ethics and Society hosted the family, friends and colleagues of Dr Rees last Thursday evening when Associate Professor Steven Lovell-Jones, Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, launched Religion in International Politics and Development and Religion and Foreign Affairs: Essential Readings. 2 ̆ 2 Tonight I have the pleasure of launching two singular works which put to rest a common assertion that religion has no place in international relations, 2 ̆ 2 Dr Lovell-Jones said. In Religion in International Politics and Development, Dr Rees illustrates that the dynamics of religion must now be considered to be of central and abiding importance in the study of world politics. This is shown via a case study on the relationship between the World Bank and faith-based organisations, highlighting ways that religious actors are both included and excluded from the World Bank 2 ̆ 7 s development agenda, and by inference, from the policy agendas of international affairs more broadly. Religion and Foreign Affairs: Essential Readings is a compilation of writings that provides an introduction to the field of religion and world politics. As one of the contributors, Dr Rees has the honour of his work being included among contributions from figures seminal to the study of international politics, including internationally renowned scholars Scott Appleby and Daniel Philpott, both from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. Dr. Lovell-Jones noted that the tradition underpinning the shared intellectual culture of both Catholic Universities has left a crucial mark - and continues to do so - in this important field. Dr Lovell-Jones also commented that Dr Rees 2 ̆ 7 commitment to Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s community and ideals was demonstrated from the University 2 ̆ 7 s earliest days, when Dr Rees would offer prospective students tours of the Sydney campus while it was still under construction. 2 ̆ 2 For John, his role at Notre Dame is intimately connected to our shared understanding of vocation; specifically, a vocation oriented to serve not only our students, our respective disciplines and also our colleagues, but one which is firmly oriented towards serving the Objects of the University in the pursuit of Truth. This pursuit is an age-old and virtuous tradition, set down for the generous of heart and the tough of mind, 2 ̆ 2 said Dr Lovell-Jones. Dr. Lovell-Jones also said Dr Rees 2 ̆ 7 work has offered insights that are essential to enabling dialogue about the relationship between religion and international policy, a relationship which is so often denied by purely secular modes of enquiry. 2 ̆ 2 His work is something that can be discussed in the seminar rooms of a university as well as amongst communities of religious scholars, 2 ̆ 2 said Dr Lovell-Jones. 2 ̆ 2 These new works now help to enable these same discussions to take place amidst the halls of the Asian Development and World banks. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> important this is? A new chance to present the truth of what His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI calls 2 ̆ 2 right development 2 ̆ 2 – that is; development defined by human agency as represented in the innate dignity of each human person and not solely mediated by the entrenched economic interests of the powerful and influential. 2 ̆ 2 Dr Rees responded with gratitude and extended his warm thanks to Dr Lovell-Jones, the Notre Dame community, and his family, friends and mentors. To conclude, Dr Rees described the study of religion in world politics as something akin to Salman Rushdie 2 ̆ 7 s character of Adam Aziz in the narrative Midnight 2 ̆ 7 s Children. Aziz sets out on a journey from belief to unbelief but ends up in a psychological state somewhere in between. 2 ̆ 2 For scholars of international relations, the journey has been taken in the opposite direction to Aziz but the destination is the same, having emerged from secularist thought in the social sciences, the contemporary resurgence of religion in international affairs has knocked the discipline of international relations into a middle place where religion seems undeniably present, yet in ways that are very hard to know, 2 ̆ 2 Dr Rees said. 2 ̆ 2 So it is that the two books being launched this evening belong to the new conversation that is shaped by that simple yet complex and often terrifying question, 2 ̆ 7 So what? 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 Within this question lies an important lesson, and one that inspired Dr Rees 2 ̆ 7 approach to academic research. 2 ̆ 2 It is better to be partly wrong whilst pursuing knowledge, for knowledge is borne of an ongoing conversation, than to be right in the shallow insecurities of opinion that just want the complexities to go away, 2 ̆ 2 Dr Rees said. 2 ̆ 2 This is why we have universities; to face the hard stuff with patience and to try to move the conversation forward in a knowledgeable way, {{and in the case of}} international relations, to translate that knowledge into practice and into policy. 2 ̆ 2 For further information please contact: Communications Officer, Elizabeth FenechThe University of Notre Dame Australia, Sydney Campus T: 02 8204 4407 E: elizabeth. fenech@nd. edu. auW: www. nd. edu. au...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]: Sunday My darling Judson, Honey, I adore you so. Golly, honey, I {{miss you}} so much. The only thought that I have to cheer me up {{is that at}} the end of the ten weeks we’ll be married. Darling, I have so many things to be {{grateful}} to you for. Your love, sweetness, kindness and understanding has completely changed me. Until this last week, marriage to me was a kind of dark shadow. Something that every woman had to go through 2 ̆ 6 tolerate. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> awful that was. You probably can’t. I was so happy being in love with you but always in the back of my mind was that awful fear 2 ̆ 6 doubt. Now that’s all gone. I am so relieved 2 ̆ 6 happy now. Honey, I’m so glad that I’m in love with you. Another thing I’m thankful for is this last week. What a difference a week can make. Without that lord only knows what would have happened. Well, you’re at Spence Field now. I hope it’s a good field and that you’ll like it. What time did you get there? You weren’t late were you, honey? Sure hope not. That hospital was some place. Honestly, honey, those nurses were a bunch of absolute morons. They kept giving me ice bags that leaked 2 ̆ 6 they’d forget that they had leaked 2 ̆ 6 leave me for three quarters of an hour with a wet gown (hah, that’s a laugh—those pityful [sic] things they call gowns—Bags—probably burlap at that). I could just feel myself catching cold. This morning, (I’d just gotten to sleep at about six thirty) at the ungodly hour five o’clock one of the morons came in to wake me up—she took my temperature 2 ̆ 6 pulse. Then the parade began. You’d think I was giving away free lunch or something. Had a glass of milk for breakfast 2 ̆ 6 one for lunch. Also managed some pudding 2 ̆ 6 potatoes for lunch. Darling, I love you so. I can’t think of anything except how very much I love you, honey. You are to me everything I love. While we were at the hospital waiting to go home they played “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Gee, I love you so. That song brings back so many memories. I love you so. All the way home I kept seeing things that reminded me of you. We drove down a few streets in Brooklyn that you 2 ̆ 6 I had when we were lost. Then Daddy turned down a street. Remember how we went down the one way street, the wrong way, where the police car stopped us in New York? Daddy went down the same street the wrong way. Gee, honey, I love you so. Then we drove on that highway that you 2 ̆ 6 I always go to New York on. Gee, honey, so many things remind me of you. Golly, Judd, I’ve really got it bad. Honestly, I never knew I could love anyone the way I love you. Golly—Everytime I see you or just hear your voice I love you more. Golly, Sweetheart, it really will be something when we’re married. We really won’t have a friend left. Tonight’s New Year’s Eve. Gee, it would be marvelous to be with you. In the condition I’m in it wouldn’t be so nice but I do love you so. Wasn’t supposed to come home until tomorrow or later but I hate to stay in a hospital. What a way to spend New Year’s Eve. Wonder what you’re doing now honey? It’s six o’clock. Oh, is your time there different from the time here? I hope not. Cause when I’m trying to imagine what you’re doing at a certain time, you won’t be doing it then. Oh, honey, I love you so. Happy New Year, my darling. What a year this has been. Never dreamed when it started that I’d be engaged before the year was over. Honey, I’d better rest for a while. That doctor told me to rest a lot. Well, darling, I’ll write more later. I love you more than anything else in the world. Whatever you do, honey, remember I love you. Please don’t forget to write whenever you can. I love you so. I always think of you 2 ̆ 6 miss you loads. Monday Hello darling— This is sort of a continued story. What a life. My throat is really sore again today. Can’t even talk. Yesterday your mother 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie came down for a few minutes. Must have talked too much then or something because my throat feels as though there was a lump of something there so that I can’t say a word. In a way it’s nice not to be able to talk. Don’t have to listen to what anyone else is saying 2 ̆ 6 can just sit there and day dream about you—But, golly, I keep thinking of the funniest things I’d like to say. Gee, honey, I miss you so. You are so wonderful to be in love with—I’m so glad that you’re the one I’m going to marry. You’ll be the most wonderful person in the whole world. I love you so, Sweetheart. Oh, remember when Daddy announced our engagement 2 ̆ 6 Ronnie wanted to know if that made him a grandfather now? Well, Mother called Sis 2 ̆ 6 Walter (his mother 2 ̆ 6 father) and said that I was in the hospital. Ronnie must have been listening or something because he asked “Is Dottie in the hospital to have a baby. ” He really is rushing things. Honey, I love you so. It’s really pityful [sic]. No matter what I’m doing I think of you constantly. Happy New Year, darling—I hope that next New Year’s Eve we will be together. Golly, honey, we’ll be married then. Honey, please try to get a lot of rest 2 ̆ 6 sleep during these next ten weeks. Don’t lose any more weight. You’ll have to take care of yourself. Someone has to be healthy in our family. Harry James is playing, “I’m Beginning To See The Light. ” I like it. Just played “Stareyes. ” That’s a good song too. Gee, honey, there are so many things I’d like to say to you. Try to tell you how much I love you and miss you but there aren’t enough words, I guess. Hope that you can read this but I’m lying down 2 ̆ 6 it’s some angle to write from. Honey, I wonder if I’ll ever be sure of you. I can’t explain how I feel 2 ̆ 6 I’ll probably say the wrong thing 2 ̆ 6 give you the wrong impression—But, I just can’t believe that you love me. It’s too good to be true. It just doesn’t seem possible—was thinking about it last night for the longest time and should have written it then when my thoughts were clear. You’re going to be getting terribly conceited but, honey, you’re just perfect—I can’t find one thing that I don’t like about you. Physically you’re perfect. You’re good looking 2 ̆ 6 tall 2 ̆ 6 dark 2 ̆ 6 have beautiful eyes and curley [sic] hair. You’re nice 2 ̆ 6 strong. Mentally you’re perfect, too. You’ve got ability—talent and loads of brains 2 ̆ 6 you’ve got good sense (most of the time, except when you try to be practical at the wrong times). You have knowledge 2 ̆ 6 can use it when the need arises. You can do just about anything you put your mind to. Besides that you have a marvelous sense of humor. You’re sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and I love you. Better stop telling you how wonderful you are or there’ll be no living with you. Golly, hon, this time last week, we were eating dinner here. We didn’t want to go to Brooklyn. Golly, suppose we hadn’t gone. Things might have been so different. I don’t know about you but this week made a lot of difference to me. They’re playing “I’m Making Believe. ” That’s what I’ll be doing until you come home. How is this field? Hope it’s nice. Honey, I don’t see how these ten weeks will go fast but everyone seems convinced that they will. To me they’ll seem more like ten years. When do you start flying? What a day. It’s pouring 2 ̆ 6 the wind is blowing. Glad that you’re not at Stewart now. The weather will probably be awful. The doctor said I couldn’t go out for two weeks. Phooey. It will be horrible lying around for two weeks but good for my ankle. Mother wants me to go see Conover 2 ̆ 6 do photography instead of going back to wholesale. Can’t decide whether to do that or not. Honey, gee, you can’t imagine how lonesome it is around here without you. I’d love to have you home just for a few hours so that I could hear your voice, hear you laugh 2 ̆ 6 say “I love you. ” There are so many little things I love about you. Honey, they’re playing “Together. ” All day they’ve been playing all our songs. Especially “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Memories are wonderful things. We were really lucky to have so much time together, hon. Do you get every weekend off? Are you restricted or anything for the first two or three weeks? How was the train trip down? Do you have any Scotch left or am I kidding? I’ve written you two letters so far 2 ̆ 6 will keep them until I hear from you because they’re so long. I’d hate to have anything happen to them before you read them. Finished reading Mrs. Parkington today. She had a pretty good life. It was a very good story. It took me ages to read it because I kept thinking about you. The nurse was going to make me take my ring 2 ̆ 6 bracelet off but I explained I couldn’t 2 ̆ 6 she was very nice 2 ̆ 6 said it would be o. k. to leave them on. Had me worried for a minute though. Have my tonsils in a jar on my dressing table. They were awful the doctor said. Now I’ll probably be o. k. He said they had so much pus in them that they were breaking 2 ̆ 6 going through my system. Well, from now on I should be the picture of health. Honey, have you gotten in touch with Steve yet? Woody is madly waiting for a letter from him. I have been dying to have a long talk with her ever since you told me what happened to see if she is any different. Now I’ll be looking for her to say something while before I wasn’t. The only trouble is that I can’t talk. It’s awful—wonder if she’ll tell me. I doubt it. I’m sure if I had I wouldn’t go around telling anyone. I’ll tell you if anything happens. She’ll probably have to tell someone. Most people do. Honey, the luggage is so beautiful. I’m crazy about it. Gee, I love it. Honestly, honey, I was so surprised. You can’t imagine. The bracelet surprised me too. I wish that I could have surprised you but I knew you wanted the old pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set. That’s so unromantic, honey. I’m dying to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 sit 2 ̆ 6 look at my Christmas presents. I really haven’t seen most of them. When I first came in they were what I saw. Your luggage. Honestly, honey, I’m crazy about them. Bobbie just called 2 ̆ 6 yesterday she took home the monkey I got for Ricky. She said it looked like you 2 ̆ 6 was calling it Willy—I’ll have to murder her. Bobbie said if I don’t stop writing this letter I’ll have to send it railway express. Grandmaw said I shouldn’t give the monkey to Ricky because it would scare him—I thought he was cute. You can decide whether to be insulted or flattered when you see “Willy. ” Oh, if anyone down there calls you Bill or any other name that comes from William tell them they’ll have a battle on their hands when I get down there. Judson is such a nice name—I’ve always liked that name—ever since I first met you. I really should end this soon because it will be getting too big for an envelope. Honey, I love you so. Every day I was with you made me love you so much more. How long can this go on[?] Every weekend I was sure that I couldn’t love you any more 2 ̆ 6 yet every weekend I did love you more. That last week was wonderful. It was heaven to be with you so much. Almost as though we were married. We certainly weren’t apart for long. It was wonderful. Honey, how do you feel towards Mickey now? You know me well enough to know that I’m not asking out of jealousy. But when you thought you saw her you looked so strange I didn’t quite know how to interpret that look. Golly, I kept thinking today was Sunday 2 ̆ 6 it’s Monday. We were asleep before I guess. Remember? We were out at the base now. Sinatra’s singing “Night and Day. ” It’s so true. I think of you Night 2 ̆ 6 Day. Honey, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. You have such a wonderful way of saying what I mean. Does that make sense to you? But you do. You say what I want to but [can’t] find words for. Now he’s singing “Saturday Night Is the Loniest [sic] Night In the Week. ” Ah, yes. Hope you can read this. I’m just writing whatever comes into my mind 2 ̆ 6 it probably won’t make much sense. I love you. Honey, we won’t ever fall out of love will we, honey? That’s another thing that has worried me. After we’ve been married for a few—(oh, honey, he’s singing “If You Are But a Dream”). (Oh, honey, that’s the first time I’ve heard it since you left. Darling I love you so and miss you terribly. Honey, I hope these ten weeks hurry.) To get back to what I was writing, years to become indifferent to each other 2 ̆ 6 not be in love any more. It won’t happen to us will it, honey? Well, darling—Frankie’s singing “I Dream of You. ” I do—“And I Want You So More than You’ll ever know. ” Hope you like “East Jesus. ” I love you so. Have you started flying yet? What’s it like there? Hope you like it. I love you so. Please write as often as possible. I’ll try to write every day. Probably the rest of my letters won’t be this long, but I’ll try to keep them as long as possible. I love you more than anything else in the world. Goodnight, Sweetheart. I love you. You have all my love forever 2 ̆ 6 always. Dottie P. S. I love you— [Transcription ends...|$|E
