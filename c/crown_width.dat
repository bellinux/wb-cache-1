40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} of three-dimensional computer imaging has many applications in dentistry, including {{the analysis of}} dental casts. AIMS: To assess the validity and reliability of a dental stereophotogrammetric imaging system. METHODS: The sample consisted of 35 sets of dental casts. Maxillary and mandibular dental <b>crown</b> <b>widths</b> and selected dental arch dimensions were measured directly using digital calipers. Cast images were also captured by a stereophotogrammetric system and analysed using Australis software. Dahlberg’s formula, paired t-tests and intra-class correlations {{were used to assess}} the random error, validity and reliability of the measurements, respectively. RESULTS: Most values demonstrated {{no significant difference between the}} direct and three-dimensional measurements with mean differences ranging from 0. 05 - 0. 21 mm. Moreover, values of intra-class correlation coefficients ranged between 0. 80 - 0. 99 for intra-examiner reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Mesiodistal <b>crown</b> <b>widths</b> and dental arch dimensions may be measured accurately with relatively small error by the specially-designed 3 D system and confirms its suitability for clinical and research purposes.

40|$|Objective – To {{investigate}} tooth {{size and}} dental arch dimensions in Malays using a stereophotogrammetric system. Setting and Sample Population – The {{sample consisted of}} 252 subjects with ages ranged from 13 to 30 years. Materials and Methods –  Images of dental casts were captured by stereophotogrammetry and selected variables were measured using a three-dimensional (3 D) imaging system. Sex differences and changes associated with age were assessed, and interrelationships between different variables were explored within the study group. Results – Men had significantly larger mesio-distal <b>crown</b> <b>widths</b> and dental arch dimensions than women (p < 0. 05). None of the dental arch dimensions or mesio-distal <b>crown</b> <b>widths</b> showed a significant change because of age except the widths of the upper canine, lower first molar and central incisor. Significant correlations of tooth size with dental arch dimensions were found, particularly with arch lengths and perimeters. A principal component analysis showed interrelationships between the majority of tooth size variables with inter-canine width, arch length and perimeter distances. Conclusion – This study has established new reference data for tooth size and arch dimensions in Malays and demonstrated patterns of variation {{that are relevant to}} anthropologists interested in making comparisons within and between different populations and also to clinicians developing treatment plans for their patients. The study confirmed the accuracy of the 3 D photogrammetric method for measuring dental casts. AR Al-Khatib, ZA Rajion, SM Masudi, R Hassan, PJ Anderson, GC Townsen...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to better understand how stand fertility and allelopathic properties of adult trees influence shade acclimation of saplings. Crown growth and morphological plasticity were studied under different light, fertilization, and allelopathic conditions in a nursery experiment. We tested whether shade-acclimation capacity increases with fertilization, and is affected by autotoxicity due to pine leachates. We examined stem diameter, and <b>crown</b> characteristics (length, <b>width,</b> shape and density) in a factorial experiment with two levels for each tested factor: light (full and 20 % reduced light), fertilization (low and high rate of NPK fertilizer) and allelopathy (control and allelopathic leachates uptake). In our study, shading induced a significantly higher <b>crown</b> length, <b>width</b> and surface. Fertilization strongly increased crown length and vertical expended crown shape (the ratio <b>crown</b> length/crown <b>width).</b> Leachates uptake reduced crown length and density, highlighting an autotoxicity phenomenon.

40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} {{axial turbine}} could extract kinetic energy from both wind and tidal stream. In this paper, {{a type of}} horizontal axial turbine was designed with a crown stalled on the blade tip and the turbine was analyzed in a tidal stream. Several turbines with different geometries of the crowns were compared, whose power coefficients were numerically simulated by the CFD method. Effects of the crown design parameters, such as crown setting directions and different widths on turbine efficiency were discussed. Furthermore, when the turbine worked at different tip speed ratio, the results were discussed, either. By analysis of the results, it is could be concluded that a circular crown was sufficient to eliminate blade tip loss caused by tip leakage flow. The upstream semicircle crown modified the corresponding side foil pressure distribution to the design value, {{and so did the}} downstream semicircle crown. In the ellipse crowns testing, turbine efficiency was approximately in line with the value of <b>crowns</b> <b>width.</b> When the turbine with the circular crown worked at a little higher tip speed ratio than the design value, the crown was effective as before...|$|R

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 276 subjects with Angle's Class I normal occlusions. Three-dimensional images of the face and dental casts were captured and analyzed using stereophotogrammetric systems. Significant correlations were found between the sagittal facial variables and both upper and lower dental arch dimensions and to lesser degree with the horizontal and vertical variables. The values of correlation coefficients calculated between facial and dental crown measurements ranged from. 01 to. 50 for upper teeth and. 01 to. 49 for lower teeth. The values of correlation coefficients between facial and upper dental arch dimensions ranged from. 01 to. 55 and those between facial and lower dental arch dimensions ranged from. 01 to. 60. A principal components analysis showed that the sagittal dimensions, face height, nose, labial fissure, binocular widths were positively associated with dental arch dimensions and mesio-distal crown diameters in males. On the other hand, only the sagittal variables were associated with dental dimensions in females. The results of this study confirm that positive associations exist between facial and dental arch dimensions.

40|$|Forest fire {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} disturbance factors in boreal forests. Post-fire forest regeneration is crucial to both ecological research and forest management. Three different restoration treatments, namely natural regeneration, artificial regeneration, and artificial promotion, were adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious forest fire occurred on May 6, 1987. Natural regeneration means recovering naturally without any intervention, artificial regeneration comprises salvage logging followed by complete planting, while artificial promotion refers to regeneration by removing dead trees, weeding, and digging some pits to promote seed germination. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the effects of the three restoration treatments and determine which approach is the most suitable for local forest recovery. A field survey was conducted to collect the attribute data, specifically species composition, structural parameters, and leaf area index (LAI), which were analyzed through the analysis of variance and a post hoc test.

Mean cervico-occlusal heights ranged from 8. 31   mm (±  0. 75) on the right to 8. 38   mm (±  0. 85) on the left teeth. The mean values for the buccolingual dimension were 8. 67  mm (±  0. 70) on the right and 8. 65  mm (±  0. 54) on the left teeth. The mean enamel thickness on the mesial surfaces ranged from 1. 35  mm (±  0. 22) to 1. 40 mm (±  0. 17), on the left and right sides, respectively. On the distal surfaces, the corresponding values were 1. 44  mm (±  0. 21) and 1. 46  mm (±  0. 12). No {{significant differences were found between}} measurements for right and left teeth. However, enamel thickness was significantly greater on the distal surfaces, compared with the mesial surfaces...|$|R
