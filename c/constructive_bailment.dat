5000|$|Voluntary vs. In{{voluntary}}. In {{a voluntary}} bailment, the bailee agrees {{to accept responsibility}} for possession of the goods. In an involuntary bailment, the bailee has possession of the goods without intent to do so. A common situation that creates voluntary bailment is when a person leaves goods with someone for service (e.g., dry cleaning, pet grooming, car tune-up). The bailee must hold the goods safe for the bailor to reclaim within a reasonable time. An involuntary (or <b>constructive)</b> <b>bailment</b> occurs when a person comes into possession of property accidentally or mistakenly, as where a lost purse or car keys are found and need to be protected until properly redelivered - a bailment is implied by law.|$|E
