40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 {{requires}} the U. S. Forest Service to periodically evaluate the U. S. timber situation. An {{important part of}} such studies is the determination of forest product imports from Canada through evaluation of Canadian log and product supply conditions. Other studies have projected these conditions for Canada as a whole, but have failed to directly consider either the impacts of forest resource characteristics on costs or the capability of Canadian forests to meet predicted harvests. 	This study develops procedures for projecting Canadian log and lumber production costs that explicitly consider resource characteristics and location through the identification of fifteen Timber Supply Regions expected to have relatively uniform logging conditions and the estimation of log and lumber production costs {{for each of these}} regions. Cost projections are linked to general economic conditions in Canada through estimation of labor costs as functions of gross national product. This study also evaluates the capability of the forest resource to meet predicted timber requirements. Achievable levels of production of four forest product groups are determined by comparing predicted harvest levels with estimates of economically accessible annual allowable cuts and reducing projected production levels when accessible timber supplies are limiting. 	A baseline simulation from 1980 to 2030 indicates that future log and lumber production costs in Canada may be less than previously projected and the predicted increases in production may no be attainable because of limited timber supplies. Gross sawmilling costs are projected to increase from 99. 88 /MBF in 1980 to 4123. 66 /MBF in 2030. These costs range from 15 /MBF to 65 /MBF lower than those used in TAMM, largely due to different estimates of delivered wood costs. Harvests increased from 50. 2 million <b>cunits</b> to 73. 6 million <b>cunits</b> but were unable to meet demands from 1984 to 2030 with shortfall reaching 13. 5 million <b>cunits</b> in 2030.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} using a rubber-tired skidder to keep the landing clear by sorting and decking the logs along the road prior to loading by a self-loading truck. The evaluation was accomplished through detailed time studies conducted on a Koller K- 300 yarder, a Crown Super 3000 self-loader, and a John Deere 440 choker skidder, in a selective thinning of a Coast Range Douglas-fir stand with n average diameter range of eight to twelve inches. Production increases on the yarding cycle were observed when the skidder was used to keep the landing clear. A major factor for higher production rates was reduced landing delays. Comparisons of the loading operation from decks built by the yarder and by the skidder showed a significant time savings when loading from skidder decks. The portions of the loading cycle most affected were the sort and swing loaded elements. The analysis indicated that sorteddecks oriented at small angles to the road and decked as high as possible required the shortest loading time. The skidding cycle was evaluated frm a mechanical engineering approach and compared to regression analysis results. The results snowed that the skidder was capable of production rates in excess of 10 <b>cunits</b> per hour. The hooking and decking elements consumed the largest portion of the skidding cycle. An alternate method of hooking or investigation of a grapple attachment is suggested. Important factors influencing the harvesting of a unit were identified and a model was developed to aid in planning. The influence of landing geometry as related to log holding capabilities of a landing, log diameter, and stems removed per acre are explored. Despite an improvement in overall production, the skidder did not prove cost effective for the study when its full cost was charged to yarding production. There were indications, however, that the skidder or a loader may be a necessity for longer yarding distances, flat decking slopes, high stem removals, or larger diameter trees. The skidder cost benefit ratio may also be improved if the skidder or operator remain active in the overall harvest operation when not needed for swinging and sorting...|$|R

On the other hand, the existing structures represent also a hazardous condition for swimmers.

40|$|Cable yarding {{can reduce}} the {{environmental}} impact of timber harvesting on steep slopes by increasing road spacing and reducing soil disturbance. To determine the cost of harvesting forest biomass with a small cable yarder, a 13. 4 kW (18 hp) skyline yarder was tested on two southern Appala-chian sites. At both sites, fuelwood was harvested from the boles of hard-wood trees 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches) in dbh. The volume of pieces yarded 3 3 ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 63 m (0. 2 to 22. 4 ft). With a crew of four on a 3 small clearcut block and piece volumes averaging 0. 14 m 3 (5. 1 ft), yarding costs were $ 12. 03 per m 3 ($ 33. 70 per <b>cunit).</b> With a crew of two on a site 3 previously harvested for sawlogs, it cost $ 6. 78 per m ($ 19. 00 per <b>cunit)</b> to 3 3 yard pieces averaging 0. 21 m (7. 5 ft). Because productivity was generally constrained by the yarder's 429 kg (1, 150 lb) mainline pull capacity, the two-person crew proved the most efficient. Production and cost analyses integrating field studies with computer simulation showed that the total cost of yarding biomass with a two-person crew could range from $ 5. 50 to $ 11. 00 per m 3 ($ 15. 00 to $ 31. 00 per <b>cunit),</b> depending upon average piece volume. This analysis also revealed a tradeoff between biomass utilization and total yarding cost: costs can be reduced by limiting the minimum piece volume yarded...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Results of {{a recent}} {{production}} study indicate that a four man crew thinning young growth Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga mensiezii (Mirb.) Franco] with an Iglarid-Jones Trailer Alp can produce 1360 to 1460 cubic feet (38 to 41 cubic metres; 8160 to 8750 bd. ft.,) per eight hour day on slopes of 10 to 50 percent with average slooe distances of 150 to 300 feet (46 to 91 metres) and average lateral yarding distances of 30 to 50 feet (10 to 15 metres). The stand studied was thinned from 226 stems per acre (558 stems per hectare) to 130 stems per acre (321 stems per hectare). The average tree size removed was 19. 4 cubic feet (0. 55 cubic metres) and the average log size yarded was 12. 9 cubic feet (0. 36 cubic metres). A standing skyline system was used with a haulback line attached to hold the carriage in position during lateral yarding. The cost of a four man crew felling, bucking, and yarding this material with an average slope distance of 250 feet (76 metres) and an average lateral yarding distance of 35 feet (11 metres) is estimated at 36. 63 per <b>cunit</b> (12. 93 per cubic metre; 61. 04 per Mbf.). A three man crew operating under the same conditions would produce only 1160 cubic feet (33 cubic metres; 6950 bd. ft.) per day but the unit cost of production would be lower at 35. 30 per <b>cunit</b> (12. 46 per cubic metre; 58. 83 per Mbf.). During the study, operating delays accounted for 26 percent 0 f total study time and skyline road changes accounted for 10 percent of total study time.

40|$|Whole {{tree and}} tree length {{thinning}} are two alternatives which {{are likely to}} be more productive and may prove to be more cost effective than conventional log length thinning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning techniques in terms of productivity and harvesting costs. The thinning operation took place in a second-growth Douglas-fir stand [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] (average dbh = 12. 8 ") using a small skyline yarder (28 ' tower, 120 HP) in a gravity return configuration. The treatments were defined by the amount of work done by the faller prior to yarding. Log length implies that felling, limbing, bucking and topping occured at the stump. Tree length indicates that trees were felled, limbed and topped only, and finally, whole trees were felled only prior to yarding. A rubber-tired cable skidder was used to swing material from the landing chute to a processing area. Here the skidder operator Forest Engineering presented on April 14, 1983 completed any limbing and bucking which was necessary. He then sorted and decked the logs prior to loading. During log length thinning, logs were either cold decked in front of the yarder or swung with the skidder to a loading deck. Detailed time studies were used to evaluate the felling and yarding operations for each of the three thinning techniques. Multiple linear regression was then used to develop predictive models for felling and yarding work cycles. An analysis of the delays on this study made it possible to separate out delays which were affected by a particular thinning technique, rather than having a single prorated delay time as is usually done. By combining results from the regression and delay analyses, estimates of productivity for each thinning technique were obtained. Finally, harvesting costs in dollars per <b>cunit</b> at the loading deck were generated and used to compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning. Results indicated that where cold decking is feasible and will not overly hamper the operation it will probably still be the cheapest alternative since a skidder is not required. The cost per <b>cunit</b> for this method was 8. 24 or 11...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 11 - 30 This study {{compares the}} {{production}} rates and yarding costs of prebunching {{with a low}} investment skyline yarder and swinging with a larger skyline yarder to full-cycle thinning with the larger yarder The study analyzes two slackpulling techniques (manual and haulback assisted) and two carriages (a multi-span carriage and a clamping carriage) during the prebunching phase of the operation. The swing yarding employed a multi-span, clamping carriage requiring manual slackpulling. The full-cycle thinning employed a slackpulling carriage. All of the prebunch and swing units required multi-span skylines, while the full-cycle thinning units required single-span skylines. The study {{took place in a}} stand of young second-growth Douglas-fir and western hemlock with a mean volume of 6600 cubic feet per acre (30, 300 board feet per acre). The mean log size was 12. 3 cubic feet (55. 4 board feet). Maximum skyline yarding distances ranged from about 500 feet to 1100 feet, with lateral yarding distances up to 140 feet perpendicular to the corridor. The analysis indicates that the full-cycle thinning was significantly less costly than prebunching and swinging techniques. No significant differences were detected between the slackpulling techniques or carriage types used for prebunching. The average cost of prebunching and swinging was 46. 76 per <b>cunit</b> (103. 91 per MBF), while the average cost of full-cycle yarding was only 19. 14 per <b>cunit</b> (42. 53 per MBF). The average yarding costs increased linearly at a rate of 1. 70 per 100 feet of maximum yarding distance. Full-cycle thinning produced 3744 cubic feet per eight-hour day (16, 850 board feet per day) or 304 logs per day. Swinging produced 4305 cubic feet per eight-hour day (19, 370 board feet per day) or 350 logs per day, and prebunching produced 1882 cubic feet per eight-hour day (8470 board feet per day) or 153 logs per day. The combined production rate of prebunching and swinging was 1413 cubic feet per day (6360 board feet per day) or 115 logs per day. Prebunching production varied as a function of lateral distance and volume per acre removed in the thinning. Regression analysis was used to develop production equations which can be used to predict how each system would function over a similar range of conditions on other operations. The full-cycle thinning performed most consistently during the study. Both the prebunch and swing operations had a higher percentage of unexplained variation in the yarding cycles. The average delay-free yarding cycle for full-cycle thinning required 5. 08 minutes, with an average turn volume of 47. 4 cubic feet (213. 3 board feet). The average delay-free yarding cycle for swing yarding required 5. 01 minutes, with an average turn volume of 60. 1 cubic feet (270. 4 board feet). The average delay-free prebunching cycle was 2. 45 minutes, with an average turn volume for prebunching of 19. 1 cubic feet (86. 0 board feet). The prebunching operation was affected most seriously by delays, with only about 52 percent of the total time spent in delay-free productive yarding. Both the swing operation and the full-cycle thinning operated at about 75 percent delay-free productive yarding time. A parcel model, developed to analyze prebunching production, shows promise as a tool for analyzing time study data...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study compares {{production}} {{rates and}} costs for four ground skidding machines and for four harvesting treatments. The four machine types studied were a Caterpillar 060 crawler (060), Caterpillar 518 rubber tired skidder (RTS), FMC 200 CA (FMC), and International TD- 8 E crawler (TD- 8 E). Two treatments, conventional/whole tree and designated/tree length, were studied, and two, Conventional/tree length and designated/whole tree, were determined through {{the regression analysis}} and statistical inference. Conventional versus designated refers to skid road location and restriction to, while whole tree versus tree length refers to whether the skidded trees contained limbs and tops or not. The study took place in northern Idaho. The stand was two-storied and the overstory was removed to release the advanced understory. The overstory averaged s trees per acre and contained 23. 0 cunits (gross) per acre. Two operators were time studied {{for each of the}} four machine types to help eliminate operator influence and produce more meaningful comparisons. Eight operators, 483 hours of detailed time study, and 2, 270 cunits skidded allowed for many delays and all significant variables to be averaged over machine types and treatments. Regression analysis was used to develop equations to predict delay free elemental times. Indicator variables were employed to determine significant differences between conventional and designated skid roads and between whole tree and tree length skidding. In addition, significance was determined between independent variables. Delay free turn time was calculated by summing the predicted elemental times. At an average residual skidding distance of 530 feet, the study average, dollars per <b>cunit</b> for conventional/whole tree were calculated to be: D 6 D, 27. 60; RTS, 19. 00; FMC, 36. 30; TD- 8 E, 27. 70 and for designated/tree length: D 60, 27. 10; RTS, 21. 50; FMC, 31. 40; TD- 8 E, 29. 30. For all skidding distances and both studied treatments, the RTS was the most economical machine type. The FMC was the most expensive, and this is attributed to the low observed mechanical availability and high operating costs. The D 6 Dand TD- 8 E were midway in costs. Lower initial and operating costs made the TD- 8 E more economical than the D 6 D for distances less than 500 feet for conventional/whole tree and for distances less than 275 feet for designated/tree length. Designated/tree length was more economical than conventional/whole tree for the D 6 D and FMC but not for the RTS and TD- 8 E. The main reason was that a significant increase in pieces per turn for the D 6 D and FMC offset the additional sawyer costs required to produce the tree length pieces. The RTS and TD- 8 E showed no increase in pieces per turn. Just the restriction to skid roads (designated/whole tree versus conventional/whole tree) is expected to influence costs per <b>cunit</b> by: 060, + 0. 40; RTS, + 0. 40; FMC, - 0. 50; TD- 8 E, + 0. 20. Mortality and damage to the advanced regeneration was shown to be related to machine impact (visual signs of machine activity within an 1 / 200 th acre plot). Plots not impacted by the machine (timber impacted) averaged 37 percent mortality and damage. Plots that were machine impacted averaged 84 to 91 percent mortality and damage. The conventional/whole tree units averaged 34 percent machine impacted plots, and designated/tree length averaged 21 percent. Overall impact, mortality and damage, averaged 54 percent for the conventional units and 46 percent for the designated units. The eight percent difference was primarily mortality rather than damage. Percent of area in skid roads was calculated using parameters collected during the damage study and assuming an average skid road width of 10 feet. For all machine types, 17 percent of the conventional units and nine percent of the designated units were calculated to be roaded...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Presentation date: 1986 - 04 - 28 Western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests, where prior precommercial {{thinning}} has occurred, constitute one of {{the most}} productive young-growth management types along the Pacific Coast from Oregon to southeast Alaska. These stands are ready for a first commercial thinning entry, however, {{the costs and benefits of}} such entries and resulting impacts at final harvest are not well documented. The purpose of this study was to provide appropriate harvesting, silviculture and economic data in a comprehensive evaluation of four alternative stand management treatments (three different thinning prescriptions with a basal area per acre removal ranging from 49 percent to 67 percent and a no-thin, control prescription) conducted on a 32 year old managed western hemlock-Sitka spruce plantation. A detailed logging production/cost study of Skyline thinning showed high harvesting cost and resulting negative stumpage values. Thinning treatments influenced harvesting costs; herringbone strip thinning costs 31 percent less than a conventional selective thinning method with the same volume removal. Also, a residual tree damage study, conducted during logging, showed that damage was considerably lower for strip thinning compared with selective thinning. Various logging techniques and crew skill levels influenced stand damage. An assessment of wind damage and tree growth rates was completed two years after skyline thinning. Annual windthrow losses totalled only 0. 28 trees per acre for all treatments and was significantly lower in strip thinning than selective thinning. Windthrow also appeared to be related to specific site, tree or stand conditions. Diameter growth increment rates declined in the unthinned units. However, in all thinned units, an immediate diameter growth response occurred. In the herringbone strip thinning method, trees exhibited a growth response regardless of distance from strip edge. A stand table projection model and harvest simulation model were used for determining costs and revenues from clearcutting at rotation age. Final harvest costs and revenues per <b>cunit</b> were similar for all treatments. The unthinned stand had the highest present net worth per acre. A sensitivity analysis of real interest rate changes along with changing harvesting cost and pond values during thinning or final harvest did not alter the outcome. Results of this study suggest that managed plantations of western hemlock-Sitka spruce can receive sufficient density control from precommercial thinning to maintain adequate stand development to a rotation age harvest without commercial thinning entries...|$|E
