5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, Brant and her {{children}} left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York {{and returned to her}} native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British officials and the Iroquois. After the war, she settled in what is now Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave Brant a pension and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E

The settlement of the {{questions of}} Hong Kong and Macau is entirely within China's sovereign right and do not at all fall under the ordinary category of <b>colonial</b> <b>territories.</b> Consequently {{they should not be}} included in the list of <b>colonial</b> <b>territories</b> covered by the declaration on the granting of independence to <b>colonial</b> <b>territories</b> and people. With regard to the questions of Hong Kong and Macau, the Chinese government has consistently held that they should be settled in an appropriate way when conditions are ripe." ...|$|R

25|$|The new {{aircraft}} {{was to have}} sufficient range to fly the stage from Mirabella, Crete, to Alexandria in Egypt {{without the need for}} refuelling stops in Italian <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> due to a political row which had led the Italian Government to ban British aircraft from its ports.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{during the}} French colonial rule of Pondicherry, Yanam, Karaikal and Mahé, Kepis were worn by {{two kinds of}} policemen, the Armed and the Indigenous, {{differentiated}} by the colour of the kepis they wore.

After Indian Independence, the former French <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> was integrated into the Union Territory of Puducherry and the bright red kepi {{continues to be the}} headgear of the constabulary — both for the local and the armed police signifying the cultural and administrative legacies left by the former colonialists.|$|E

25|$|The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church {{was granted}} autocephaly by Pope Joseph II of Alexandria, {{head of the}} Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1950. At that time Eritrea was a {{separate}} <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> under British administration, but nevertheless the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was simply made {{a division of the}} Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as the British had no interest to strongly separate the Eritrean highlands from the Ethiopian highlands, corresponding to their politics of unification of the highlands (with the option of separation of the Muslim lowlands of Eritrea and their inclusion into the British Sudan).|$|E
25|$|When the Central Junta {{fell to the}} French, {{numerous}} new Juntas appeared {{all across}} the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north.

Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the Empire of Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the Japanese {{surrender}} in August 1945, Sukarno and fellow nationalist leader Hatta unilaterally declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony. Dutch forces eventually re-occupied most of the <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> and a guerrilla struggle ensued. The majority of Indonesians, and – ultimately – international opinion, favored independence, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Under {{the terms of the}} 1949 agreement, Western New Guinea remained under the auspices of Netherlands New Guinea. The new Indonesian government under President Sukarno pressured for the territory to come under Indonesian control as Indonesian nationalists initially intended. Following United States pressure, the Netherlands transferred it to Indonesia under the 1962 New York Agreement.|$|E

They killed Captain Pierce and a company of Massachusetts soldiers between Pawtucket and the Blackstone's settlement. Several colonial men were tortured and buried at Nine Men's Misery in Cumberland {{as part of the}} Indians' ritual torture of enemies.

25|$|It {{was a part}} of a {{political}} movement originating in the 1940s outside India with the purpose of allying with Axis powers to free India from British Rule. It was established by Indian nationalists-in-exile during {{the latter part of the}} Second World War in Singapore with monetary, military and political assistance from Imperial Japan. Founded on 21 October 1943, the government was inspired by the concepts of Subhas Chandra Bose who was also the leader of the government and the Head of State of this Provisional Indian Government-in-exile. The government proclaimed authority over Indian civilian and military personnel in Southeast Asian British <b>colonial</b> <b>territory</b> and prospective authority over Indian territory to fall to the Japanese forces and the Indian National Army during the Japanese thrust towards India during the Second World War. The government of Azad Hind had its own currency, court and civil code, and in the eyes of some Indians its existence gave a greater legitimacy to the independence struggle against the British.|$|E
