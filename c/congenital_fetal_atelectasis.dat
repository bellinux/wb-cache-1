40|$|Various {{methods have}} been used for the {{diagnosis}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>fetal</b> arrhythmias. Currently, M-mode echocardiography is the most widely used method. However, good tracings are often difficult to obtain because of unfavorable fetal positions, resulting in long durations of examination. In early gestation, the fetal heart is often too small for clear M-mode echocardiography. Doppler velocity waveforms of the fetal inferior vena cava represent the right atrial activity, whereas those of the aorta reflect ventricular contraction. Because of the proximity of the vessels, it is early to obtain simultaneous recording in opposite channels of Doppler waveforms from both vessels. A visual relationship between the atrial and ventricular contractions may be clearly established and a diagnosis may be made. The findings of simultaneous pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the fetal aorta and inferior vena cava were assessed in different types of <b>congenital</b> <b>fetal</b> arrhythmia: <b>congenital</b> heart block, premature atrial ectopic contractions, premature ventricular ectopic contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia.

40|$|The {{need for}} access to {{tertiary}} centre experts for those living in rural and remote areas of Queensland is well recognised. With an estimated population of 3. 3 million people of whom 55 % live outside the capital city, Queensland is ideally suited to telemedicine, as it provides a potential opportunity to improve access to specialist care. <b>Congenital</b> <b>fetal</b> abnormalities are the major causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. With only two Maternal Fetal Medicine Specialists in Queensland located in a major teaching hospital in Brisbane, the opportunity to use videoconferencing technology to develop a tertiary level tele-ultrasound service presented a challenge – that is, to find a technical and clinical solution to enable such a service.

The aim of our {{study was to determine}} teratogenicity and fetotoxicity of antiepileptics by performing systematic review of relevant papers. Systematic review was performed using PUBMED and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Original and review papers that relate to teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs were included in the analysis. Fourteen studies were found, out of which there were 7 original papers and 7 review papers. The lowest number of participants in a study was 54 and the highest 3607. Studies followed participants from 5 to 9 years. Antiepileptic drugs were used as monotherapy in 2 studies, while other studies examined both mono- and polytherapy. Doses administered varied from 600 mg (carbamazepine), 100 - 200 mg (lamotrigine) and 600 - 1000 mg (valproate), depending on kind of administration (mono or polytherapy). Among all examined antiepileptic drugs, valproate has shown the highest relation to occurrence of any degree of mental retardation or congenital malformation. Risk of congenital malformations was correlated with administration of higher drug doses and the use of polytherapy. Carbamazepine was shown to be the safest drug to use during pregnancy.

The analysis of a large series should help the pediatric cardiologist to provide this service. Methods. The notes of 1, 006 patients, where a prospective diagnosis of <b>fetal</b> <b>congenital</b> heart disease was made, were reviewed. The reason for referral, the diagnosis made, the accuracy of diagnosis, the fetal karyotype and {{the outcome of the}} pregnancy were noted.

Most fetal cardiac anomalies are now suspected by the ultrasonographer during obstetric scanning. A different incidence of abnormalities is seen compared with that expected in infants. Chromosomal anomalies were more frequent in the fetus than in live births. The accuracy of diagnosis was good. The survival rate after diagnosis was poor because of frequent parental choice to interrupt pregnancy and the complexity of disease. Conclusions. A large experience with <b>fetal</b> <b>congenital</b> heart disease allows the spectrum of disease to be described with accuracy and compared with that in infancy.

40|$|Abstract. Infection with rubella virus during {{pregnancy}} may cause fetal death or the multiple <b>congenital</b> <b>fetal</b> abnormalities {{that are known}} as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Studies have demonstrated that congenital hearing impairment is the most frequent abnormality associated with intrauterine rubella infection. In the present study, {{the first of its}} kind in Bangladesh, we inves-tigated the presence of rubella antibody in hearing-impaired children in order to understand the possible role of rubella infection in the development of hearing impairment. A total of 198 hearing-impaired children and 200 children without hearing problems were studied. After taking a detailed history from the parents, blood samples were collected from both mothers and children; sera were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-rubella IgG. Rubella antibody was detected in 74 % of the hearing-impaired children and in 18 % of those with normal hearing: this finding correlated with the presence of rubella antibody in the mothers (67 %) of rubella seropositive hearing-impaired children. In contrast, we observed rubella antibody in only 14 % of the mothers of the children without hearing problems. Consistent with the presence of antibody, 41 % of the seropositive mothers who had hearing-impaired children gave a history of fever and rash during early pregnancy. Our study indicates a strong association between rubella infection and hearing impairment in Bangladeshi children. In addition, it also indicates that infection by rubella virus is common in Bangladesh: this suggests that priority should be given to implementing appropriate measures for the control of rubella...|$|R

METHODS: A retrospective {{study was conducted in}} a University hospital to compare the difference in the pattern of use and fetal outcomes between pregnant women who took HMP and Western pharmaceutical products (WPP). RESULTS: From 1995 Jan to 2001 Dec, 61 and 372 women took HMP and WPP one month before or during their current pregnancies respectively. There was an increase in the prevalence of pregnant women who took HMP from 0 % in 1995 to 0. 8 % in 2001. Among HMP users, 51. 6 %, 82. 8 % and 58. 6 % of them had low monthly family income (< 15 000), low education level (secondary education or below) and were unemployed respectively. In comparison to WPP, pregnant women used smaller number of HMP (1. 4 vs 3. 0, P< 0. 01) at a later gestation (4. 8 weeks vs 3. 1 weeks, P< 0. 01) and within a shorter duration (11. 1 d vs 47. 9 d, P< 0. 01). The prevalence of <b>congenital</b> <b>fetal</b> abnormalities in the group of women who took HMP (3. 3 %) was not significantly higher than that who took WPP (0. 8 %).
