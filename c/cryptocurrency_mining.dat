Further, it discusses what is an IP flow, and how to monitor networks by monitoring network traffic using IP flows. It {{describes the}} Nemea framework that is used to build comprehensive system for detecting malicious traffic. It explains how the network data with communications of the <b>cryptocurrencies</b> <b>mining</b> process were obtained and then provides an analysis of this data. Based on this analysis a proposal is created for methods capable of detecting <b>mining</b> <b>cryptocurrencies</b> by using IP flows records. Finally, proposed detection method was evaluated on various networks and the results are further described...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the context}} of <b>cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining,</b> a mining pool is the pooling of {{resources}} by miners, who share their processing power over a network, to split the reward equally, according {{to the amount of}} work they contributed to solving a block. A [...] "share" [...] is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid proof of work that their miner solved. Mining in pools began when the difficulty for mining increased {{to the point where it}} could take years for slower miners to generate a block. The solution to this problem was for miners to pool their resources so they could generate blocks more quickly and therefore receive a portion of the block reward on a consistent basis, rather than randomly once every few years.|$|E
40|$|The {{monetary}} {{policies of}} states and systems built upon them do not naturally allow transactions of a very small value, as the transaction costs exceeds the actual value of the transaction. These types of transactions are called micropayments. This is problematic as it removes the possibility to monetize content that has a valuation that is so low {{that the costs of}} the transaction exceeds the value of the content. In this thesis we aim to create a system that allows micropayments to monetize low value content. We do so by developing a design theory based on Gregor and Jones conceptual model for design theories within Information Systems research. The system that we develop will use the end users computational power to generate a value, by running a cryptocurrency miner. We present the background knowledge required to fully understand the presented design theory. Within the design theory, we present a theoretical framework to base systems on that enables micropayments through <b>cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining.</b> We also present a developed proof of work prototype that proves the validity of the theoretical framework. Lastly we discuss our design theory. We conclude that the design theory enables transactions of a very low value, such as 0, 0001 cents. Transactions of such small value is not possible with systems built upon states monetary policies. We also conclude that the proposed design theory can be further developed to function independently of <b>cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining.</b> Instead the value for the transaction could be generated through solving complicated problems if institutions {{are willing to pay for}} computational power to solve them...|$|E
40|$|A new {{variation}} of blockchain proof of work {{algorithm is proposed}} to incentivize the timely execution of image processing algorithms. A sample image processing algorithm is proposed to determine interesting images using analysis of the entropy of pixel subsets within images. The efficacy of the image processing algorithm is examined using two small sets of training and test data. The interesting image algorithm is then integrated into a simplified blockchain mining proof of work algorithm based on Bitcoin. The incentive of <b>cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining</b> is theorized to incentivize {{the execution of the}} algorithm and thus the retrieval of images that satisfy a minimum requirement set forth by the interesting image algorithm. The digital storage implications of running an image- based blockchain are then examined mathematically. Comment: 30 page...|$|E

Although merged mining has been adopted by a number of cryptocurrencies already, to this date {{little is known about the}} effects and implications. We shed light on this topic area by performing a comprehensive analysis of merged mining in practice. As part of this analysis, we present a block attribution scheme for mining pools to assist in the evaluation of mining centralization. Our findings disclose that mining pools in merge-mined cryptocurrencies have operated at the edge of, and even beyond, the security guarantees offered by the underlying Nakamoto consensus for extended periods. We discuss the implications and security considerations for these <b>cryptocurrencies</b> and the <b>mining</b> ecosystem as a whole, and link our findings to the intended effects of merged mining...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining</b> {{can be said}} to be {{the modern}} alchemy, {{involving}} as it does the transmutation of electricity into digital gold. The goal of mining is to guess the solution to a cryptographic puzzle, the difficulty of which is determined by the network, and thence to win the block reward and transaction fees. Because the return on solo mining has a very high variance, miners band together to create so-called mining pools. These aggregate the power of several individual miners, and, by distributing the accumulated rewards according to some scheme, ensure a more predictable return for participants. In this paper we formulate a model of the dynamics of a queue- based reward distribution scheme in a popular Ethereum mining pool and develop a corresponding simulation. We show that the underlying mechanism disadvantages miners with above-average hash rates. We then consider two-miner scenarios and show how large miners may perform attacks to increase their profits {{at the expense of other}} participants of the mining pool. The outcomes of our analysis show the queue-based reward scheme is vulnerable to manipulation in its current implementation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore several {{contexts}} where an adversary has an upper hand over the defender by using special hardware in an attack. These include password processing, hard-drive protection, <b>cryptocurrency</b> <b>mining,</b> resource sharing, code obfuscation, etc. We suggest memory-hard computing as a generic paradigm, where every task is amalgamated with a certain procedure requiring intensive access to RAM {{both in terms of}} size and (very importantly) bandwidth, so that transferring the computation to GPU, FPGA, and even ASIC brings little or no cost reduction. Cryptographic schemes that run in this framework become egalitarian in the sense that both users and attackers are equal in the price-performance ratio conditions. Based on existing schemes like Argon 2 and the recent generalized-birthday proof-of-work, we suggest a generic framework and two new schemes: MTP, a memory-hard Proof-of-Work based on the memory-hard function with fast verification and short proofs. It can be also used for memory-hard time-lock puzzles.
