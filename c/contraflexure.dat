5000|$|In a bending beam, a {{point is}} known as a point of <b>contraflexure</b> if it is a {{location}} at which no bending occurs. In a bending moment diagram, it is {{the point at which the}} bending moment curve intersects with the zero line. In other words where the bending moment changes its sign from negative to positive or vice versa. Knowing the place of the <b>contraflexure</b> is especially useful when designing reinforced concrete or structural steel beams and also for designing bridges.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bending moment}} at a section through a {{structural}} element {{may be defined}} as [...] "the sum of the moments about that section of all external forces acting {{to one side of}} that section". The forces and moments {{on either side of the}} section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of equilibrium so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments, regardless of which side of the section is selected. If clockwise bending moments are taken as negative, then a negative bending moment within an element will cause [...] "sagging", and a positive moment will cause [...] "hogging". It is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a beam is a point of <b>contraflexure</b> - that is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The Cantilever {{method is}} an {{approximate}} method for calculating shear forces and moments developed in beams and columns of a frame or structure due to lateral loads. The applied lateral loads typically include wind loads and earthquake loads, {{which must be}} taken into consideration while designing buildings. The assumptions used in this method are that the points of <b>contraflexure</b> (or points of inflection of the moment diagram) in both the vertical and horizontal members are located at the midpoint of the member, and that the direct stresses in the columns are proportional to their distances from the centroidal axis of the frame. The frame is analysed in step-wise (iterative) fashion, and the results can then be described by force diagrams drawn {{up at the end of}} the process. The method is quite versatile and can be used to analyse frames of any number of storeys or floors.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} medium {{technique has}} been widely used in the preliminary analysis and design of coupled shear walls in tall buildings by practising engineers for many years. One of the basic assumptions made when using this approximate method is that the coupling beams deform with points of <b>contraflexure</b> at mid-span. However, {{when there is a}} non-negligible difference between the stiffness's of the structural walls connected by the coupling beams, the points of <b>contraflexure</b> of the beams can move off-centre, and hence noticeable error in the analysis may occur.

On the other hand similar members designed {{on the basis of the}} proposed {{physical models}} attained very ductile failures. It appears that, unlike current design approaches, the compressive-force path concept is capable of identifying those areas where failure is most Likely to be triggered, and ensures better load redistribution, thus improving ductility.

The test programme embraced a range of parameters including the length and position of breakout and a variety of reinforcement arrangements. Moment transfer during concrete breakout was monitored to assess whether breakout at one location would cause overstressing {{in other parts of the}} structure. Results from tests and numerical analysis show increases in section deformations away from the breakout were small when compared to those within the breakout length.

40|$|M. Ing. (Civil Engineering) The shear {{strength}} of a concrete structure is usually determined in practice {{in accordance with the}} applicable national concrete design code. Calculation methods prescribed in national design codes differ from code to code and yield widely divergent results. The methods given for different cases in specific codes are often based on different approaches. Further, some of the methods do not agree with the observed behaviour during failure. This shows {{that there is a need}} for more accurate methods of determining {{shear strength}}, as well as approaches leading to universally applicable methods. A literature study was undertaken to establish whether such methods or approaches have already been developed. Special attention was given to the underlying mechanisms involved in shear resistance, to the shear resistance of concrete elements without shear reinforcement, of elements with varying depth, and of areas near points of <b>contraflexure,</b> and to punching resistance of flat slabs.

40|$|Abstract: Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structural elements}} can be strengthened by bonding external steel plates onto the concrete surface {{by means of}} an epoxy adhesive and are referred to as composite structural members. The objectives of this Masterâ€™s research project on the Structural Behaviour of Composite Concrete-Steel Slabs were as follows: ï‚· To determine whether steel plates bonded externally to existing reinforced concrete structural elements can control the deflection ï‚· To determine whether steel plates bonded externally to existing reinforced concrete structural elements can increase the flexural resistance ï‚· To determine whether the various debonding mechanisms of the steel plate from the concrete surface of existing reinforced concrete structural elements can be theoretically predicted by existing theories. Twenty-four reinforced concrete specimens were constructed using 25 MPa concrete and 5 Y 12 internal bars in the longitudinal direction. The concrete and steel plate surfaces were prepared by scabbling and sandblasting respectively. The steel plates, which varied in thickness (from 6 mm to 8 mm), width (from 110 mm to 150 mm) and number (1 or 2), were bonded externally to the soffit of the concrete structural elements by means of epoxy glue. These composite concrete-steel specimens were simply supported and loaded until destruction by applying either a third-span line load (TSLL), mimicking a uniformly distributed load, or a mid-span line load (MSLL). The applied load, vertical deflection and strain on the bonded steel plates at mid-span were electronically logged. The vertical deflection within the elastic range of the unplated and plated reinforced concrete structural elements was obtained using the double integration method. The cracked second moment of area (Icr) was calculated by transforming the cross-sectional area of the steel reinforcement to an equivalent area of concrete. It was found that the deflection of composite concrete structural elements decreased as the cross-sectional area of the bonded steel plates increased. A comparison between the theoretically analysed and experimentally measured deflections was done as part of this research study. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} steel plates externally bonded to reinforced concrete structural elements increase the flexural and shear resistance of the members. The externally bonded plates are not, however, enclosed by the concrete as in the case of internal reinforcement and are therefore not as well anchored. This results in premature debonding of the steel plate from the concrete surface. Two design philosophies for the theoretical prediction of the flexural resistance were considered. The first was the anchorage design philosophy developed in Europe (fib- 14, 2001) where the tension face plates are terminated in the uncracked region, which is beyond or at least to the point of <b>contraflexure.</b> The second is the hinge design philosophy developed in Hong Kong and Australia (Handbook 305 - 2008, Standards Australia) whereby the tension face plates are terminated short of the points of contraflexure; this latter philosophy was adopted as the bonded steel plates stopped 250 mm short of the support, which is also the point of <b>contraflexure</b> for simply supported structural elements. The following debonding mechanisms due to flexure and shear were investigated: [...] M. Ing. (Civil Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tests to {{determine}} the structural capacity, failure modes and {{the economy of the}} eaves region of double-bay portal frames made from cold-formed lipped channels connected back to back at the eaves joint are presented. Two double-bay portal frame eaves joint configurations, namely; Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2) are investigated. In ECT- 1, two rafters are connected to the column back-to-back with one rafter connected to the column at a lower level than the other while, in ECT- 2, two rafters are connected to the column at the same level through a hot-rolled steel gusset plate. Variables in the frames include the width of the channel flanges, strength of the channels, number of bolts, and thickness of the hot-rolled gusset plate. The joints are subjected to equal loads applied through pins at points of <b>contraflexure</b> until failure. Failure modes and experimental results are observed, recorded and analysed. A comparison between theoretical and experimental results is drawn up and analysed. In all the tested structures (ECT- 1 and ECT- 2), the cold-formed channels failed but the joints did not fail. Local buckling in the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels, bolt-bearing deformations and lateral deflection of gusset plates (in ECT- 2 only) are the three modes of failure which were observed. Local buckling in the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels was the initial and ultimate failure mode in all structures. The moment-curvature graphs show that plasticity could not be achieved in both connections (ECT- 1 and ECT- 2). The unfactored resistances of the channels are not achieved by all the joints because of local buckling and bolt-bearing deformation failure. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the two investigated joints are semi-rigid and partial-strength joints since they possess some degree of rotational stiffness and moment capacity, but are insufficiently stiff to develop full continuity and unable to achieve full moment capacity of the connected members at the eaves joint. Furthermore, the investigation shows that ECT- 1 is the most economic joint from a structural and material cost point of view, compared to ECT- 2 joints. However, ECT- 2 joints are [...] . M. Phil.

40|$|Composite steel-concrete {{structures}} experience {{non-linear effects}} which arise from both instability-related geometric non-linearity and from material non-linearity {{in all of}} their component members. Because of this, conventional design procedures cannot capture the true behaviour of a composite frame throughout its full loading range, and so a procedure to account for those non-linearities is much needed. This paper therefore presents a numerical procedure capable of addressing geometric and material non-linearities at the strength limit state based on the refined plastic hinge method. Different material non-linearity for different composite structural components such as T-beams, concrete-filled tubular (CFT) and steel-encased reinforced concrete (SRC) sections can be treated using a routine numerical procedure for their section properties in this plastic hinge approach. Simple and conservative initial and full yield surfaces for general composite sections are proposed in this paper. The refined plastic hinge approach models springs {{at the ends of}} the element which are activated when the surface defining the interaction of bending and axial force at first yield is reached; a transition from the first yield interaction surface to the fully plastic interaction surface is postulated based on a proposed refined spring stiffness, which formulates the load-displacement relation for material non-linearity under the interaction of bending and axial actions. This produces a benign method for a beam-column composite element under general loading cases. Another main feature of this paper is that, for members containing a point of <b>contraflexure,</b> its location is determined with a simple application of the method herein and a node is then located at this position to reproduce the real flexural behaviour and associated material non-linearity of the member. Recourse is made to an updated Lagrangian formulation to consider geometric non-linear behaviour and to develop a non-linear solution strategy. The formulation with the refined plastic hinge approach is efficacious and robust, and so a full frame analysis incorporating geometric and material non-linearity is tractable. By way of contrast, the plastic zone approach possesses the drawback of strain-based procedures which rely on determining plastic zones within a cross-section and which require lengthwise integration.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{wind tunnel}} study on the dynamic response of a 300 m tall guyed telecommunication mast under various wind loads was undertaken at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) in the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada. Although the dynamic response of guyed masts subjected to turbulent wind loads has been routinely analyzed using a number of numerical models, typically in the frequency domain, limited experimental verification of the dynamic analysis results has been performed. Full-scale measurements, where available, {{have proven to be}} difficult to correlate with analytical models due to the tremendous uncertainty inherent in field measurements. As a result, the need for systematic validation of existing analytical models remains. In this investigation, a representative 300 m tall guyed telecommunication mast has been designed and modeled to an appropriate scale. Based on Canadian Standard CSA S 37 - 01, and an empirical study on 41 existing guyed masts, the 300 m tall guyed mast was designed using wind load conforming to representative Canadian climate data obtained from National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 1995). Appropriate properties for the dynamically scaled full aeroelastic model were derived from the 300 m tall prototype guyed mast, which was intended to represent a realistic guyed mast for broadcasting applications in Canada. The wind tunnel test of the guyed mast model was carried out in both open country and over water exposures, simulating medium and low turbulence flow conditions, respectively. Dynamic response characteristics measured during the wind tunnel tests have been analysed and summarized, including dynamic displacements, bending moments, response spectra and peak factors, as well as natural frequencies, mode shapes and structural damping. Comparisons have been made with predictions obtained from an existing frequency domain analysis model. The wind tunnel test results show that good agreement was generally achieved between the frequency domain analytical model and the wind tunnel model with respect to both the magnitude and distribution of the monitored responses. It was found that measured dynamic bending moments were distributed in a fairly uniform manner over the mast height, and that mean (static) bending moments exhibit large variations, along with near-zero response zones at points of <b>contraflexure.</b> It was also found that nonlinear damping effects, associated with vibrations of the highly slackened leeward guys on the upper levels of the mast, may be beneficial in reducing dynamic mast displacements. The spectrum studies indicated that lowest modes were dominated by large guy movements at top guy level and small mast movements, the middle modes were characterized by coupled effects between the guyed cables and mast, meanwhile the highest modes involved significant mast movements with little guy vibration. It is evident that the top of the mast displacement are dominated by the first and second modes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} design of reinforced concrete flat slabs for punching shear. Flat slabs are two way spanning slabs without downstand beams that are directly supported by columns. The thickness of flat slabs is typically governed by considerations of either deflection control or punching shear {{for which there is}} still no widely accepted theoretical treatment. The research seeks to develop {{a better understanding of the}} effects of in-plane restraint and flexural continuity on the punching resistance of flat slabs. The overriding aim is to determine whether flexural continuity is sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of existing flat slabs which appear punching shear deficient when assessed against test data from isolated punching shear specimens. The influence of slab continuity on punching resistance is assessed through analysis of test data, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) and fib MC 2010 Level of Approximation (LoA) IV which is based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) of Muttoni. The CSCT relates shear resistance to the width of the so-called â€˜critical shear crackâ€™ which depends on slab rotation. MC 2010 has four LoA of which I to III are intended for design. Punching resistance is normally determined from tests on isolated slab-column specimens which are intended to simulate behaviour within the elastic line of <b>contraflexure</b> for radial moments, although the benefits of continuity on punching shear strength is well known. MC 2010 LoA IV, which uses nonlinear finite element analysis to determine the slab rotation, is used to investigate and develop a better understanding of the influence of continuity on the punching shear resistance of flat slabs at edge and internal columns. The FE model is calibrated against relevant test data from both isolated and continuous specimens. Parametric studies are presented which show the superseded UK design code BS 8110 to require significantly less punching shear reinforcement than EC 2 (2004) and MC 2010 LoA II which give reasonable strength predictions for isolated internal column punching specimens. Despite this, slabs designed to BS 8110 have performed satisfactorily for many years. MC 2010 LoA IV is used to show that punching resistance at internal columns can be increased significantly by restraint from the surrounding slab. The increase in punching resistance due to continuity is shown to be sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of flat slabs designed to BS 8110 at internal columns. However, the strength increase is variable and, in the case of uniformly loaded slabs, already largely included in BS 8110 and EC 2. The research also considers the influence of slab continuity on punching resistance at edge columns. Parametric studies are developed to examine the influence of shear force eccentricity, flexural reinforcement distribution between support and span, and modelling assumptions on the punching resistance of flat slabs at edge columns. Relating the punching resistance at edge columns to the elastic unbalanced moment as done in MC 2010 LoA II and III is shown to be overly conservative for continuous slabs. The ACI 318 and EC 2 practice of making the design punching resistance independent of the unbalanced moment is reviewed and shown to be reasonable particularly for continuous slabs. MC 2010 LoA IV is shown to be a powerful tool for assessment, however the predictions for the method are very sensitive to the modelling assumptions and boundary conditions. Open Acces...|$|E
