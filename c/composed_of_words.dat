2500|$|One {{possibility}} is that bilinguals initially {{make a decision about}} the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers found that bilinguals can comprehend passages <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> entirely from only one language more quickly than passages <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the switch mechanism will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition in choosing which language information to use. The later lexical completion {{can also be used to}} explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages. [...] However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing. showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E. found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.|$|E
2500|$|Dir En Grey was {{preceded by}} the {{independent}} rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before it ended activities. They disbanded due to leader and bassist Kisaki not wanting to debut as he {{felt that it was}} too soon, but guitarist Kaoru believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show at Nagano Live House on January 24, they decided to stay together as [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] on February 2, 1997. They released their first EP, Missa, a few months later. According to Toshiya, the name [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] was chosen because it [...] "sounded right" [...] and is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> from several languages so that people {{would not be able to}} attach a specific meaning to it other than the band's name itself. However, in another interview Kaoru said [...] "At the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn’t express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn’t exist elsewhere." ...|$|E

60|$|The talk {{round the}} Easy Chair one day was of that strange passion for reading which has of late possessed the public, and the {{contagion}} or infection {{by which it}} has passed {{to hundreds of thousands}} who never read before; and then the talk was of how this prodigious force might be controlled and turned in the right way: not suffered to run to waste like water over the dam, but directed into channels pouring upon wheels that turn the mills of the gods or something like that. There were, of course, a great many words; in fact, talk is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> and the people at that luncheon were there for talking as well as eating, and they did not mind how many words they used. But the sum of their words was the hope, after a due season of despair, that the present passion for reading might be made to eventuate in more civilization than it seemed to be doing, if it could be brought back to good literature, supposing it was ever there in great strength, and the question was how to do this.|$|E

60|$|THE TWO LAST LINES ONLY ARE ORIGINAL; YOU WILL EASILY PERCEIVE THAT THEY OCCUR IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE WE SUSPECTED A WANT. I AM SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THIS SONG IS SUSPECTED BY SOME TO BE A MODERN FORGERY; THIS WILL BE BEST PROVED BY MOST OF THE OLD PEOPLE HEREABOUTS HAVING A GREAT PART OF IT BY HEART; many, indeed, are {{not aware}} of the manners of this place, it is but lately emerged from barbarity, and till this present age the poor {{illiterate}} people in these glens knew of no other entertainment in the long winter nights than in repeating and listening to these feats of their ancestors, which I believe to be handed down inviolate from father to son, for many generations, although no doubt, had a copy been taken of them {{at the end of every}} fifty years, there must have been some difference, which the repeaters would have insensibly fallen into merely by the change of terms in that period. I believe that it is thus that many very ancient songs have been modernised, which yet to a connoisseur will bear visible marks of antiquity. The Maitlen, for instance, exclusive of its mode of description, is all <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> which would mostly every one spell and pronounce in the very same dialect that was spoken some centuries ago.|$|E
60|$|The next {{group that}} {{approached}} {{was composed of}} those who lived by {{the products of the}} dairy. Two cowherds led their beasts, the monotonous tones of whose heavy bells formed a deep and rural accompaniment to the music that regularly preceded each party, while a train of dairy-girls, and of young mountaineers of the class that tend the herds in the summer pasturages, succeeded, a car loaded with the implements of their calling bringing up the rear. In this little procession, no detail of equipment was wanting. The milking-stool was strapped to the body of the dairyman; one had the peculiarly constructed pail in his hand, while another bore at his back the deep wooden vessel in which milk is carried up and down the precipices to the chalet. When they reached the sodded arena, the men commenced milking the cows, the girls set in motion the different processes of the dairy, and the whole united in singing the Ranz des Vaches of the district. It is generally and erroneously believed that there is a particular air which is known throughout Switzerland by this name, whereas in truth nearly every canton has its own song of the mountains, each varying from the others in the notes, {{as well as in the}} words, and we might almost add in the language. The Ranz des Vaches of Vaud is in the patois of the country, a dialect that is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> of Greek and Latin origin, mingled on a foundation of Celtic. Like our own familiar tune, which was first bestowed in derision, and which a glorious history has enabled us to continue in pride, the words are far too numerous to be repeated. We shall, however, give the reader a single verse of a song which Swiss feeling has rendered so celebrated, and which is said often to induce the mountaineer in foreign service to desert the mercenary standard and the tame scenes of towns; to return to the magnificent nature that haunts his waking imagination and embellishes his dreams. It will at once be perceived that the power of this song is chiefly to be found in the recollections to which it gives birth, by recalling the simple charms of rural life, and by reviving the indelible impressions that are made by nature wherever she has laid her hand on the face of the earth with the same majesty as in Switzerland.|$|E
