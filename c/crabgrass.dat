25|$|Soras {{eat more}} plant food in {{fall and winter}} (68%–69%) than in spring and summer (40%). Plant {{material}} such as hairy <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis), fall panicgrass (Panicum dichotomiflorum), and bristlegrass (Setaria spp.) occurred at substantially higher frequencies and in much larger volumes in sora esophagi collected in southeastern Missouri during fall migration than those collected in spring. In addition, animals comprised a larger volume of the spring diet than the fall diet. The volume of animal material in esophagi collected in spring was predominantly composed of adult beetles and snails from the Physidae family.|$|E

500|$|N. ensifer is {{endemic to}} Mexico {{and can be}} found in {{tropical}} dry forests at altitudes of between [...] above sea level. In some cases, colonies have been found [...] below the Pacific Slope. The ant is found throughout several Mexican states within the east, including Guerrero and Michoacán from the south, and Colima and Jalisco from the north. Nests are commonly found in basins and mountains along the Pacific Slope in pine-oak forests. Scrub-thorn forests are also abundant, consisting of trees and shrubs that are [...] tall, but other areas may contain low herbs and grasses. Plants and trees such as thorn trees (Acacia), poinciana plants (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) and Casearia corymbosa have been identified in these habitats. Other identified plants and trees include Indian mallows (Abutilon), spurred anodas (Anoda cristata), Cathestecum erectum, dayflowers (Commelina), cigar plants (Cuphea), hairy <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis), crane grass (Ixophorus unisetus), Mimosa, Mexican panicgrass (Panicum hirticaule), [...] Senna uniflora and Setaria liebmannii. These habitats usually have a wet season in summer and autumn and a dry season in spring.|$|E

40|$|Hempstead Plains, once {{encompassing}} 24, 282 hectares, originally {{extended from}} western Suffolk County, to eastern Queens County, Long Island, New York. Hicks (1892), Harper (1918), Ferguson (1925), Cain et al. (1937), and Seyfert (1972), contended that Hempstead Plains was always devoid of arboreous growth, though Bailey (1949) maintained that shrubs and trees grew on the Plains. Those {{who have made}} important vegetation studies of the Plains included Hicks (1892), Harper (1918), Ferguson (1925), Conard (1935), Seyfert (1972), and Stalter and Lamont (1987). Stalter and Lamont (1987) studied a 8. 5 ha remnant {{in the vicinity of}} Mitchell Field and found little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius Michx.) and broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus L.) to be the dominant species. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), indiangrass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash], and bird-foot violet (Viola pedata L.) are remnants of the prairie flora that dominated Hempstead Plains years ago. Invasion of alien species such as <b>crabgrasses</b> (Digitaria spp.), foxtail grass (Setaria faberi Herrm.), and purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) on disturbed sites reflects the changing character of the Hempstead Plains flora. The small size of the Mitchell Field site, disturbance by vehicles and dumping may hasten the very slow process of old field succession at Mitchell Field...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{revision}} is given of the Malesian {{species of the}} <b>Crabgrasses,</b> or Digitaria Haller (Gramineae). The research was done at the Rijksherbarium, Leyden, while many other Herbaria were shortly visited; some field work was done in Indonesia, Australia, and Papua-New Guinea. The foundation for the study in this large and cosmopolitan genus must be Henrard’s monumental work ‘Monograph of the genus Digitaria’ (1950), which is therefore extensively cited and discussed. Henrard based his division in sections, 32 in the subgenus Digitaria, {{with an emphasis on}} the amount of spikelets per grouplet and the various types of hairs, but such a subdivision appears difficult to maintain. As only part of the species of Digitaria occurs in Malesia, not representing all sections, a new infra-generic system can not be given. As far as the sections present in Malesia are concerned, it appeared that the Biformes, Horizontales, and Parviglumae had to be united with the section Digitaria, the Remotae and Subeffusae had to be merged into one, the Remotae, while the Atrofuscae had to be included, at least partly, in the Clavipilae, here renamed Filiformes. The subgenus Solitaria is better regarded as a section of the subgenus Digitaria. The distinction between annual and perennial in the everwet tropics poses a problem; these conceptions have been maintained, but on a more clearly defined basis. In the region studied 27 species occur, 3 of which are new to science; 25 species are indigenous, 2 are introduced and established; in the key 4 more species have been taken up, which were introduced only once, but have probably vanished. One subspecies and one variety are distinguished, both under a new name. All taxa were also studied for their extra-Malcsian distribution; from the resulting synonymy it appeared that about 52 species recognized by Henrard could be reduced to 24. The genus is estimated to contain about 170 species instead of about 325. Finally, some species are discussed which were said either to occur in Malesia or to belong to Digitaria, but for which {{one or the other of}} these suggestions proved to be false. Of these taxa two species and one variety were given a new name, while one new variety could be described...|$|R

5000|$|The {{prevalent}} {{species of}} Digitaria in North America are large <b>crabgrass</b> (D. sanguinalis), sometimes known as hairy crabgrass; and smooth <b>crabgrass</b> (D. ischaemum). These species often become problem weeds in lawns and gardens, growing especially well in thin lawns that are watered lightly, underfertilized, and poorly drained. They are annual plants, and one plant {{is capable of}} producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late {{spring and early summer}} and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses, expanding outward in a circle up to 30 cm in diameter. In the autumn when the plants die, they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the <b>crabgrass</b> seeds to germinate the following season.|$|E

For example, Pyricularia oryzae (sexual morph Magnaporthe oryzae), the causal agent of the rice blast disease, is one of the most widely distributed diseases of rice, and is highly destructive leading to up to 30% yield loss worldwide. Pyricularia oryzae isolates from rice are mostly host-specific and infect only few host plants beside rice (barley and Lolium). Pyricularia oryzae isolates from other host plants such as Eleusine, Setaria and Triticum are also host-specific, and unable to infect rice. The closely related species P. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea are indistinguishable in morphology of conidium, perithecium and ascopore. Pyricularia grisea isolates from Digitaria were shown to form a distinct clade by phylogenetic analysis and infect <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria), but not other hosts.
