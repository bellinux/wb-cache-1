5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the <b>capture</b> <b>rate,</b> making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a <b>capture</b> <b>rate</b> of its own as well.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Black and White is the Pokémon Dream World, {{which is}} {{dependent}} on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pokéwalker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving <b>capture</b> <b>rate,</b> or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the <b>capture</b> <b>rate</b> is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E

Study of its migratory dynamics is difficult, however, both because of its nocturnal habits and because it does not vocalize readily off of its breeding territory.

500|$|It is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how planets are formed. The prevailing theory {{is that they are}} formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust. A protostar forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk. Through accretion (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets. After a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than Mars' mass, it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere, greatly increasing the <b>capture</b> <b>rate</b> of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag. [...] Depending on the accretion history of solids and gas, a giant planet, an ice giant, or a terrestrial planet may result.|$|E

2500|$|The Painted {{redstart}} (Myioborus pictus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing.

When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey <b>capture</b> <b>rate</b> is at it maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment.

During {{an encounter with}} a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it {{from the bottom of}} the screen up toward the Pokémon. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.

We hypothesised that forest edges would affect <b>capture</b> <b>rates</b> by altering vegetation structure within fragments, and that the strength of edge effects would depend on whether fragments were grazed by livestock. We measured vegetation structure and rat <b>capture</b> <b>rates</b> at 488 locations ranging from 0 – 212 m from the forest edge in 15 forest fragments, seven of which were grazed.

The associated electron and positron <b>capture</b> <b>rates</b> for these isotopes of iron are also calculated in stellar matter. These calculations were recently introduced and this paper is a follow-up which discusses in detail the GT strength distributions and stellar <b>capture</b> <b>rates</b> of key iron isotopes. The calculations are performed {{within the framework of}} the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic state-by-state calculation of GT strength functions and stellar <b>capture</b> <b>rates</b> which greatly increases the reliability of the results. For the first time experimental deformation of nuclei are taken into account. In the core of massive stars isotopes of iron, ^ 54, 55, 56 Fe, are considered to be key players in decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio (Y_e) mainly via electron capture on these nuclide. The structure of the presupernova star is altered both by the changes in Y_e and the entropy of the core material.
