25|$|For a {{resonator}} {{with two}} mirrors with radii of curvature R1 and R2, {{there are a}} number of common cavity configurations. If the two curvatures are equal to half the <b>cavity</b> <b>length</b> (R1 = R2 = Lnbsp&/nbsp&2), a concentric or spherical resonator results. This type of cavity produces a diffraction-limited beam waist in the centre of the cavity, with large beam diameters at the mirrors, filling the whole mirror aperture.

25|$|The {{study of}} sound {{generated}} by flow over cavities {{at high speed}} has been well funded {{by the federal government}} so a considerable amount of effort has been made. The problem relates to flow over aircraft cavities in flight such as bomb bays or wheel wells. Flow over a cavity in a surface can result in excitation of a feedback loop and nearly pure tones. Unlike the edge tone noted above, the cavity edge is typically square, but also can be an edge as part of a thin structural shell. Cavities can be separated into shallow or deep ones, the difference being that for deep cavities a Class III (acoustical) feedback path may be controlling. Shallow cavities are addressed here and are those in which the <b>cavity</b> <b>length</b> L is greater than the cavity depth D.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method of {{machining}} optical fiber surfaces with a CO 2 laser {{for use in}} Fiber-based Fabry-Perot Cavities (FFPCs). Previously FFPCs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short <b>cavity</b> <b>lengths</b> (≤ 200 μm). These characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long <b>cavity</b> <b>lengths.</b> By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser’s transverse mode profile is eliminated. Consequently {{we are able to}} fabricate fiber mirrors {{with a high degree of}} rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence. Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of <b>cavity</b> <b>lengths</b> and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs...|$|R

Devices with <b>cavity</b> <b>lengths</b> as small as 100 µm show stable CW operation at low drive currents. Devices with <b>cavity</b> <b>lengths</b> of 100 – 240 µm were used to characterize the DBR reflectivity.

25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short <b>cavity</b> <b>length,</b> and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E

50|$|For stable operation, the <b>cavity</b> <b>length</b> must {{precisely}} {{match the}} period of the modulation signal or some integer multiple of it. The most powerful technique to solve this is regenerative mode locking i.e. a part of the output signal of the mode-locked laser is detected; the beatnote at the round-trip frequency is filtered out from the detector, and sent to an amplifier, which drives the loss modulator in the laser cavity. This procedure enforces synchronism if the <b>cavity</b> <b>length</b> undergoes fluctuations due to acoustic vibrations or thermal expansion. By using this method, highly stable mode-locked lasers have been achieved. The major advantage of active mode-locking is that it allows synchronized operation of the mode-locked laser to an external radio frequency (RF) source. This is very useful for optical fiber communication where synchronization is normally required between optical signal and electronic control signal. Also active mode-locked fiber can provide much higher repetition rate than passive mode-locking. Currently, fiber lasers and semiconductor diode lasers are the two most important types of lasers where active mode-locking are applied.|$|E
