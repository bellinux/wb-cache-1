40|$|Carding is one {{important}} step in processing line of jute spinning. The cylinder {{is the heart of}} the whole machine due to the <b>carding</b> <b>action,</b> which causes from its cylinder speed and other rollers. This action mainly occurs in breaker card machine. This study was carried out to find out the effectiveness of various speeds of breaker card cylinder on fibre length and quality of jute yarn 276 tex (8 lbs. /spy). Medium speed of the brake card cylinder was better than any other speeds for good fibre length and quality of jute yarn...|$|E
40|$|Carding is {{the first}} and only machine (in card process) which can {{eliminate}} neps, seed coat neps and the remaining impurities which cannot be eliminated by blowroom section. In case of carding machine the higher the production rate, the more sensitive the carding operation and the greater danger of negative influence onquality. So the optimization of speed is the prime factor today [1]. Excessive higher speed can lead to fiberdamage and higher neps generation which will downgrade the final product. Again lower speed will reduce production rate which is not acceptable. So {{we need to find out}} the optimum speed which results best for both production rate and quality. In carding machine actual <b>carding</b> <b>action</b> takes place between the cylinder and flats[1]. Generally the high production cards process higher flat speed. The speed of flats affect the carding process and quality of final yarn and in practice the flat is optimized...|$|E
40|$|With {{this study}} the {{optimized}} {{design of a}} plant {{for the production of}} cotton wool with a productive capacity of 1760 ton/year has been performed. Kept account of the different processes that is necessary to perform, machineries that realize the productive processes to make have been individuated. Besides they have been considered the carding machines and particularly the Cylinder and Hat Carding machines, underlining the positive and negative sides of it by a study of the <b>carding</b> <b>action</b> performed by such machines. Finally, it has opportunely been designed the carding department. It has been performed then the sizing of the whole plant, starting with the machines choice, {{on the basis of the}} determined productive capability of the considered plant. Insofar the beating department has been designed, on the basis of workmanship demands. It has been studied the bleaching phase determining the machines that realize such process. For the drying process a study has been performed aimed to the optimal management of the thermodynamic exchange to be performed, with minimum energy cost. Finally for the wrapping phase, it has been considered a procedure that allowed the reduction at the minimum values of the encumbrance volumes of the final product. Subsequently the sizing of the stores has been realized for raw material and final products...|$|E

50|$|Cards are broadly {{divided into}} two types: <b>action</b> <b>cards</b> and improvements. <b>Action</b> <b>cards</b> do not cost {{anything}} to play, though they may have other requirements that must be satisfied {{before they can be}} played. After they are played, <b>action</b> <b>cards</b> are discarded. Most improvements cost resources to play, but have a lasting effect on the game. Resources are kept in the regions themselves, and each region may store up to three of the resource they produce; if it subsequently produces more resources, any excess are lost. Resources may be spent from any regions that contain them.|$|R
50|$|The core {{mechanic}} are the Action Cards: the Permanent <b>Action</b> <b>Cards</b> may {{be chosen}} as needed, but {{tend to have}} weaker effects compared to the Random <b>Action</b> <b>Cards.</b> These allow players to add production tiles to a player's Production Area, assign workers to production tiles, gather resources, build units or buildings, trade resources, advance in age, and attack other players. Certain Random <b>Action</b> <b>Cards</b> are also God Powers, which have an additional effect if resources are paid. Because Permanent <b>Action</b> <b>Cards</b> are always available each turn, they are typically discarded if unused {{at the end of}} the turn.|$|R
50|$|The points scored are penalty points. At {{the end of}} {{each round}} the winner scores (-100) points. All the others score the sum of the cards {{remaining}} in their hands as follows: For each Number Card - The value of the <b>card.</b> For each <b>Action</b> <b>Card</b> - As listed for each <b>Action</b> <b>Card.</b> After 6 rounds, the points are counted up and the winner is the one with the lowest score.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{to winning}} {{the game is}} to manage which Nobles one {{collects}} through careful use of <b>action</b> <b>cards</b> while forcing other players to collect low- or negative-scoring Nobles. Some <b>Action</b> <b>cards</b> allow a player to prolong the [...] "day" [...] (by adding new Nobles to the line), shorten it by allowing Nobles to [...] "escape," [...] or end it, by playing the [...] "Scarlet Pimpernel" [...] <b>action</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R

Other <b>Action</b> <b>cards</b> allow the player to move a Noble one or more places backward, useful for moving a low- or negative-value card off {{the front of the}} line to collect a higher-value second-position Noble.|$|R
