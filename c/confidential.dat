5|$|Baird {{was given}} {{additional}} responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001. His department increased funding for child services {{early in the}} year, amid {{a significant increase in}} provincial demand. In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a <b>confidential</b> government report recommending 40–45% cuts in provincial child-care programs. Baird initially {{declined to comment on the}} document's contents, but rejected its proposals in early 2002.|$|E
5|$|Couillard first {{appeared}} in the national media when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over <b>confidential,</b> NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{committee}} investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a <b>confidential</b> report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|Local area MPP Michael Mantha raised {{concerns}} that <b>confidential</b> records must be extracted, {{such as those}} from the public health department. He {{expressed concern that the}} information might end up in the local landfill. Documents were never extracted from Algo Mall.|$|E

5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending <b>confidential</b> information. It {{can also}} be {{configured}} to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} <b>confidential</b> information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|Shlomo Ashkenazy is a gay {{psychotherapist}} {{who has run}} a <b>confidential</b> {{support group}} for Orthodox gay men for nearly 20 years. He is interviewed {{about the effects of}} Orthodox attitudes to homosexuality and the reactions of rabbis to gay Jews.|$|E

5|$|A typical McKinsey {{engagement}} {{can last}} {{between two and}} twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing <b>confidential</b> information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely <b>confidential.</b> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E

5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who <b>Confidential,</b> was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{after being}} sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, {{a former member}} turned critic, offered {{a large amount of}} the group's highly <b>confidential</b> teachings in court. The documents, {{contained}} in {{what is known as the}} Fishman Affidavit, included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the meeting, <b>confidential</b> {{negotiations}} took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, Bessarabia in Europe and Batum and Kars {{on the east coast}} of the Black Sea. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of Cyprus. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this compartmentalization, Andrews bypassed {{the chain of command}} on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's military aide, Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included <b>confidential</b> Navy memoranda confirming the accuracy of the Army's bombing.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of <b>confidential</b> leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E

The settlement ended the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies, with each party bearing its own legal costs, and Apple Inc. continuing to use the Apple name and logos on iTunes. The settlement's full terms were <b>confidential.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal <b>confidential</b> information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where <b>confidential</b> information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Remittances from Abroad: As {{identity}} theft happens {{in many different}} ways: a thief obtains credit card receipts or bank statements from your wallet or trash; personal information is inadvertently provided over the phone or Internet; or other <b>confidential</b> information. Before a person even realizes their personal information has been compromised, their credit and goods is claimed by fraudulent persons. The use of the Lebanese Identity Card and PIN in claiming goods and monies sent from abroad {{has been designed to}} prevent unauthorized persons from claiming what is due to the Lebanese Identity Card holder.|$|E
