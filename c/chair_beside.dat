5|$|The video {{starts off}} with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) while a German {{newscast}} featuring Alexander von Roon plays on TV and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Pla√ßa de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E
25|$|Mayenne {{was opposed}} {{to the idea of}} {{summoning}} the Estates-General to elect a king, but in 1592, he finally caved in to Spanish pressure to do so. Mayenne opened the assembly with a symbolically empty <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> him. The influence of Spain on the assembly soon proved problematic. Spain sought the election of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, the daughter of Philip II of Spain and the granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. The Spanish urged the Estates-General to repeal the Salic Law, which prevented the rule of a queen regnant; but in this, they failed to grasp a fundamental principle of the French royal succession.|$|E
60|$|After a moment's reflection, Tom sat himself upon a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{you both}} are," [...] rejoined Sir Marmaduke blandly, as he calmly {{sat down in}} one of the stiff-backed elm <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the hearth, [...] "and why worthy Mistress Lambert never speaks to you of your parentage." ...|$|R
60|$|Gomez obeyed, and Walthew {{sat down}} on the edge of the table, where, if necessary, he could spring up more quickly than from a <b>chair.</b> <b>Besides,</b> the {{position}} helped him to keep both Gomez and the door in sight.|$|R
60|$|Then {{with a shock}} {{he remembered}} that he was naked, and casting about him for covering, saw a long black robe thrown {{on one of the}} <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> him. This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} door {{with both hands and}} seated herself on a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> it.|$|E
60|$|He {{came back}} and, flinging {{himself into the}} <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the stove, filled his pipe.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she was not}} there. Nothing was there; {{not even}} a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the window.|$|E
25|$|On May Day 2015, an art {{installation}} by Italian Davide Dormino titled Anything to Say? {{was placed}} in Berlin's Alexanderplatz. It featured bronze sculptures of Snowden, Julian Assange, and Chelsea Manning standing on <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> a fourth, empty chair meant as a platform for public speaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much; I {{would much rather}} lean on this sofa. And I am much too tired to stand on <b>chairs.</b> <b>Besides,</b> I wouldn't for the world that either Verena or Olive should see me craning {{over the heads of}} the crowd--as if I {{attached}} the smallest importance to their perorations!" ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{stood beside}} him, bent over him, in her earnestness, as she greeted him. She saw a shade {{of pain in}} his eyes and his immobility struck her, but he did not seem badly off. Bo was pale, round-eyed, and {{apparently}} too agitated to speak. Carmichael placed <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the couch for the girls.|$|R
60|$|The Celebrity {{threw himself}} into the <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her and asked {{permission}} to light a cigarette.|$|E
60|$|She {{moved to}} a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the desk, and, opening her bag, took out a writing-block.|$|E
60|$|He sat {{himself down}} in the <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her, took her proffered hand, and leant over her.|$|E
60|$|Grant, {{who told}} him, took out some accounts, and they lounged in big hide <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the stove {{for at least}} half an hour, though it was {{significant}} that {{every now and then}} one of them would turn his head as though listening, and become suddenly intent upon his task again when he fancied his companion noticed him. At last Breckenridge laughed.|$|R
60|$|The {{dim light}} {{of a couple of}} tallow candles flickered weirdly in the draught. Editha looked around her in amazement, {{astonished}} that--like herself--Squire Boatfield had also evidently retraced his steps and was sitting now in one of the high-backed <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the hearth, whilst the old Quakeress stood not far from him, her attitude indicative of obstinacy, even of defiance, {{in the face of a}} duty with which apparently the squire had been charging her.|$|R
40|$|On Monday {{afternoon}} {{two weeks}} ago, {{men who were}} at home sat glued to their comfortable <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> a radio; {{people who were in}} the business sectors crowded around radios {{on the sidewalk in front}} of stores; college students carried portable radios with them; sailors were standing near short wave sets on ships at sea; and soldiers on distant battle fronts gathered around short wave radio sets also, while 70, 000 lucky people were able to crowd into Yankee Stadium...|$|R
60|$|But here, Susy, sitting {{bolt upright}} on an extemporized high stool, happily {{diverted}} his attention {{by pointing to}} the empty <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia {{was back}} from the hospital, and I placed my <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her, and told her of Poirot's wish to visit the dispensary.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{stronger}} to-day," [...] she said, with a composure {{that was a}} little difficult to assume, as she took a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
60|$|The absurd figure bowed again, {{but even}} through the pitiable chalk and {{cosmetics}} of its complexion, an embarrassed colour showed itself. Donna Dolores noticed it, but delicately turned toward an old-fashioned secretary, and opened it, to give her visitor time to recover himself. She drew from a little drawer a folded, legal-looking document, and then placing two <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the secretary, seated herself in one. Thus practically reminded of his duty, Mr. Perkins could no longer decline the proffered seat.|$|R
6000|$|Fritz. He hath thrown {{himself into}} an easy <b>chair</b> [...] <b>Beside</b> the fire, and slumbers; and has ordered [...] He {{may not be}} {{disturbed}} until eleven, [...] When he will take himself to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{think you}} {{understand}} {{better than most}} people," [...] she answered, {{and sat down on}} a little <b>chair</b> placed <b>beside</b> a big leather chair so that Hewet had to sit down beside her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. He {{just came}} along. Can I sit down?" [...] Kramer found a stiff upright <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the bed. [...] "If I'm bothering you--" ...|$|E
60|$|There, on {{the great}} old high-backed carved oak <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the {{fireplace}} sat the same enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The social {{amenities}} whereby Joralemon prepares {{her youth}} for the graces of life having been recognized, Fatty Rusk hitched a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> Carl, and muttered: ...|$|E
5000|$|Implicit in that design {{philosophy}} was a melding of styles and ages. A set of antique Italian <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> a Roy Lichtenstein print; Chinese chairs set around an unvarnished wood table atop a Yosemite granite base. He stated, [...] "there is no arbitrary law {{which says that}} an eighteenth-century French chair and a Sheridan can't {{be used in the}} same room. The only consideration is how well these or other pieces look together; do they compete with each other or do they create a felicitous sense of contrast?" [...] And while this fusion seems commonplace now, it was largely unheard of before Michael Taylor.|$|R
60|$|Josie {{opened the}} gate, {{walked in and}} took a <b>chair</b> that stood <b>beside</b> the desk.|$|R
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the room she could discern a table with a <b>chair</b> close <b>beside</b> it, also a couple of tallow candles, which flickered in the draught caused no doubt by that open window which she could not see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] she said, and {{flashing}} a last malignant glance upon Hortensia, she sank to a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her, {{but not too}} near her.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} busy at her machine when Joan had entered; {{and a pile}} of {{delicate}} white work lay folded on a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly {{not a very}} {{expensive}} place," [...] thought Ralph, and he peered inside to where a sleepy clerk sat dozing in a <b>chair</b> <b>beside</b> the desk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look to my {{horses and}} man,' said Theseus; 'I {{come to see}} your master.' And in he went, {{straight}} up to the high <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> {{the fire in the}} centre. The room was empty, but in a high seat sat, fallen forward and half-asleep, a man in whose grey hair was a circlet of gold and a golden grasshopper. Theseus knew that it was his father, grey and still, like the fallen fire on the hearth. As the king did not look up, Theseus touched his shoulder, and then knelt down, and put his arms round the knees of the king. The king aroused himself with a start. 'Who? What want you?' he said, and rubbed his red, bloodshot eyes.|$|R
60|$|That she {{was able}} to breathe, to move, to talk, to go through the pretence of eating, was to her in the nature of a mild surprise. Life went on, but it seemed to Honora in the hours {{following}} this scene that it was life only. Of the ability to feel she was utterly bereft. Her calmness must have been appalling: her own indifference to what might happen now,--if she could have realized it,--even more so. And in the afternoon, wandering about the house, she found herself in the conservatory. It had been built on against the library, and sometimes, on stormy afternoons, she had tea there with Hugh in the red-cushioned <b>chairs</b> <b>beside</b> the trickling fountain, the flowers giving them an illusion of summer.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{stretched}} {{herself out}} on the swinging couch, and the youth took his seat on a wicker <b>chair</b> close <b>beside</b> her. Mrs. Joyce kept at a decent distance, so that if the young people had anything private to say she might reasonably appear not to have overheard it.|$|R
