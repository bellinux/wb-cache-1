5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows {{they would like}} to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that {{they would like to}} appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E
5|$|They {{decide to}} name their new baby Bart, {{as it is}} the first name they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of that Homer did not think other {{children}} would make fun of. The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spend their wedding night at Marge's family's house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma.|$|E

60|$|What {{could be}} done in this awful perplexity he for one <b>could</b> not <b>think,</b> unless indeed his dear Rachel were willing to part with some of her jewellery; but no! he <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of {{allowing}} her to make such a sacrifice.|$|R
5|$|According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were {{repeatedly}} referenced {{between him}} and Suzuki, {{and that he would}} often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and that his albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land of Dreams (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Krichell focused on Ivy League pitchers, saying he {{preferred}} signing pitchers who <b>could</b> <b>think.</b> From Harvard University, he signed Charlie Devens later saying {{he could have}} been great had he continued to play baseball, and from Yale University, he scouted pitcher Johnny Broaca who seemed to be heading for stardom after winning 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, but suddenly retired to become a professional boxer. In 1935, a local scout who worked with Krichell placed Long Island University pitcher Marius Russo in a semi-professional team. When Krichell deemed Russo ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750, twice becoming a 14-game winner and being an All-Star in 1941 before injuring his arm. Other Krichell signings from this period included Johnny Murphy, Hank Borowy and Johnny Allen. Murphy, a relief pitcher and four time saves leader, was signed while still in high school in the Bronx and at Krichell's behest, the Yankees followed Murphy's education at Fordham University, where he gained baseball experience. Krichell signed Borowy from Fordham University for $8,500 and the player later became the ace for the Yankees during the wartime era. Krichell supposedly discovered Allen by a chance encounter when Allen worked as a desk clerk at a Sanford hotel. The story said he recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and impressed by Allen's ability, signed him to a minor league contract. However, in an interview with J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News, Krichell said while he signed Allen, he did not discover him.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his {{troubles}} began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also {{fallen in love}} with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, real or imaginary. The first thing he did was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of {{nothing other than}} to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E

25|$|After this distraction, England lost 2 quick wickets {{to end the}} day of 113/3. They {{recovered}} on day 3 {{through the}} efforts of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who both scored centuries. England were eventually bowled out for 446, and their bowlers made an improved effort in Pakistan's second innings, reducing them to 183/6 by the end of day 4. They <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about a possible victory, but Inzamam-ul-Haq was still at the wicket going into day 5.|$|E
25|$|Wei Zhao's Book of Wu (吳書) {{described}} Lu Su as follows: Lu Su was {{a strict}} person who rarely indulged in material pleasures, led a frugal life, {{and had no}} interest in common hobbies. He maintained good military discipline and executed orders without fail. Even {{when he was in the}} army, he was often seen reading books. He was proficient in arguing and writing. He <b>could</b> <b>think</b> far and possessed an exemplary sense of judgment. He was the best after Zhou Yu.|$|E
25|$|Huma Shah {{points out}} that Turing himself was {{concerned}} with whether a machine <b>could</b> <b>think</b> and was providing a simple method to examine this: through human-machine question-answer sessions. Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways: a) one-to-one interrogator-machine test, and b) simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human, both questioned in parallel by an interrogator. Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity, the verbal version generalises naturally to all of human performance capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic).|$|E
60|$|This had seemed, though disagreeable, {{straightforward}} and easy enough before the meeting; {{and now that}} it was over he <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> why he had not said exactly what he had come there to say.

25|$|Macquarie {{had been}} {{impressed}} with Foveaux's administration. He put Foveaux's name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania because he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{of no one}} more fitting, and considered {{that he could not}} have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Greek Light Infantry; he pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.|$|E
25|$|The Blackwell Company {{also ran}} a coupon {{campaign}} that offered “free” {{goods to the}} consumers of the Bull Durham brand. Coupons were included in every pack of Bull Durham Tobacco. After a consumer had saved up a set amount of coupons {{he or she could}} cash them in for an item of equivalent value. For example, for 100 coupons and one dollar one could get a gold plated watch. There were over 180 rewards each costing a different number of coupons. This advertising style was unique for its time and increased sales as people had double the incentive to buy the product. This style of advertising is still seen in companies today. The company and especially Carr used every angle of advertising they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of in order to promote Bull Durham. These advertising techniques were completely unique for their time and many of the methods have greatly influenced modern day advertising.|$|E
25|$|A {{retreating}} Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He {{had to make}} camp 27 {{miles away}} from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of no way to fight. So all fled away in such a situation. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. He went first to Murshidabad and then to Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression created {{economic}} obstacles for the park, and Owen {{lost her}} congressional seat. Coe, however, worked tirelessly for the park's establishment in Washington D.C. He sent coconuts to congressmen, President Herbert Hoover, and the Secretary of the Interior. While {{the concept of}} what landscapes were worth protecting were developing {{in the minds of}} scientists and politicians, Coe used any tactic he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to advance the idea of Everglades National Park, even equating its powers with the mythical Fountain of Youth. He took Congressional appointees from the Department of the Interior on tours through the Everglades, and though attempts to establish the park failed twice, it finally passed in May 1934. It carried a provision that the federal government would not be responsible for buying lands for the park, but its establishment ensured that no more land would be purchased from the protected area. Removing the prospect of developing lands in South Florida angered many state politicians. Newly elected governor Fred P. Cone fired Coe and left the Everglades Tropic National Park Commission without any guidance.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} {{received}} only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel {{agreed to a}} slight rewording, renaming the character who appears {{near the end of}} the story a [...] "Chinese man" [...] instead of a [...] "Chinaman". He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin. However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines [...] "Sayanyone <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of that,/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat/ Say, even Jane <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of that." ...|$|E
