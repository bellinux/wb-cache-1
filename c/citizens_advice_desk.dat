While volunteers have varying levels of training, they are all required to receive basic training to ensure they fully understand the nature of the service including the four basic principles.

Some staff may be qualified to give specialist legal advice or to advise on immigration. Each <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> is an affiliated to the national organisation but they are managed and run locally. Many bureaux are also limited companies and may have a board of directors, who will also be the organisation's trustees.

The <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> Administrative Dataset provides information regarding all <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> clients in England and Wales from April 2008. In particular, <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> is the national organisation responsible for providing advice and support for problems and issues faced by the public in England and Wales. Advice is provided by 384 <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> Bureaux (all independent charities) in England and Wales. There are separate national <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> organisations and CABx in Scotland and Northern Ireland. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> {{is one of the}} largest volunteer organisations in the UK, with over 20, 000 volunteers. The service was established in 1939 just after the outbreak of the Second World War to offer members of the public general advice with their problems. The twin aims of <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> are to provide advice for problems that people have and to improve both the policies and practices which will affect people’s lives. The service offers advice and assistance in many areas including welfare benefits, debt, employment, housing, relationships, consumer issues and health. All <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> clients that enter a bureau are recorded onto a single database. A single record is created for that client and is updated every time they return to the same bureau. The client record collects information on the client profile (covering age, gender, ethnicity, disability and location of the client), the broad issue that the client seeks advice on (such as benefit, debt), the detail of the problem (such as the type of debt or benefit) and a third category which describes the nature of the advice given. The Bureaux record details of outcomes on a sample basis (approximately 7 %) covering advice outcomes (such the amount of benefit gained, debt managed or written off and employment tribunals won) and client outcomes (such as impact on health, relationships and confidence). At the moment advice outcomes are recorded in the case management system. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> covers England and Wales only. Similar organisations exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland and together they form the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> service network for the UK. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> data is available from April 2008. External data is published quarterly six weeks after the end of each quarter. Internal data is consolidated around two to three weeks after each quarter. Data is available monthly for reporting and some data can be accessed in ‘real time’. Data collected in each client’s record is updated each time that they re-visit a bureau and when an outcome from any advice or support becomes available. Note that at present, a separate record is created if a client visits a different bureau. In the future, <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> plan to collect data onto one centralised system. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> will consider applications for their micro level data providing that the research can demonstrate the impact of the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> and cover key areas that they provide advice and support for, such as employment issues, discrimination, tribunals, welfare benefits, debt and housing. Research Usage and Linkage The <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> data is used to look at the problems people are experiencing and how this compares by geography, client profile and over time. Data has been used to inform research by the Government Equalities Office on intersectional discrimination and to look at how the recession was affecting different groups of people. Data was used as part of research by BIS on vulnerable workers. The data has also been used to inform the Cabinet Office on potential avoidable contacts in relation to benefit administration, used to look at the value of services and the return on investment and is routinely used to inform and support a wide range of policy work. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> data has not been linked with any other datasets. In theory, it should be possible to link to other datasets using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|R
