5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, 2011 North American <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, and 2016 Green <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} months of 2002, the BA model {{received}} the influential Wheels <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year award, breaking a 36-year drought. The BA also won four consecutive Australia's Best Cars awards, spanning three years. The model's market share briefly topped {{that of its}} chief competitor, the Holden Commodore on two occasions, but have failed to match those of the record-breaking EL Falcon.|$|E
5|$|Variants by Holden's {{performance}} arm, HSV, {{were released}} {{soon after the}} sedan's debut, followed by the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 whilst the Sportwagon began production in July 2008. A VE V8 Calais was awarded Wheels <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, being the fifth Commodore/Calais model to do so.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 4:57pm EDT (20:57 UTC) on Monday, June 22, 2009, Washington Metro Train 112, bound from Glenmont for Shady Grove, {{left the}} Takoma station. Minutes later at 5:02pm, Train 112 rear-ended Train 214, which was stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations {{while waiting for}} another train to leave the Fort Totten station. Nine people were killed, including the operator in the lead <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving train, Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia; at least 80 people were injured. The death toll makes the crash the deadliest in Metro history.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled backwards {{into the}} Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. The rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standing train (4018). No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 people would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E

5|$|The VE Commodore {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian market, where it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly double that of its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota Corolla in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 has helped to re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total Commodore sales. In 2007 the VE Commodore became the fifth Commodore model to receive the Wheels <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year award.|$|E
5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E

5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. The Sunset Limited, a long-distance train {{running along the}} southern border of the United States between Los Angeles and New Orleans, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the Texas State Legislature. The Pioneer gained Superliner coaches on April 26. The Eagle, an overnight train between San Antonio and Chicago, began carrying Superliners in October on those days it connected with the Sunset Limited in San Antonio. Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last <b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was {{named in honor of}} the company's founder, George Mortimer Pullman.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20th century, several award {{competitions}} {{for cars}} and trucks have become widely known, such as European <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year Japan, North American <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, World <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, Truck of the Year, and International <b>Car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year.
