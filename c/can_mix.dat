5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the accretion disks {{is about}} 10millionyears. By {{the time the}} star reaches the classical T-Tauri stage, the disk becomes thinner and cools. Less volatile materials start to condense close to its center, forming 0.1–1μm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates. The transport of the material from the outer disk <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones, which contain organic matter and other volatiles. This mixing can explain some peculiarities {{in the composition of}} Solar System bodies such as the presence of interstellar grains in the primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets.|$|E
5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers <b>can</b> <b>mix.</b> Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E

5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
25|$|In {{membrane}} biology, fusion is {{the process}} by which two initially distinct lipid bilayers merge their hydrophobic cores, resulting in one interconnected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, an aqueous bridge is formed and the internal contents of the two structures <b>can</b> <b>mix.</b> Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. In hemifusion, the lipid constituents of the outer leaflet of the two bilayers <b>can</b> <b>mix,</b> but the inner leaflets remain distinct. The aqueous contents enclosed by each bilayer also remain separated.|$|E

For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Möbius transformations map {{generalized}} circles to generalized circles since circle inversion {{has this}} property. A generalized circle {{is either a}} circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a Möbius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, {{it does not necessarily}} map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.|$|E

Channels to be automixed are assigned in the mixer's graphic user interface, and can then be controlled by a common web browser interface affecting only the Dugan-MY16 card, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{relationship}} between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2°F) at sea level. When {{the temperature of}} the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake <b>can</b> <b>mix,</b> bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling.|$|E

Kakashi Hatake has been shown using all 5 different elements in the Naruto series. Although these ninja can use their different elements separately with little effort, combining the two elements is impossible for ninja who do not have a genetic predisposition for it.

500|$|GameSpot {{highlighted}} positively the prompted choices during certain {{points in}} the game as they encourage replay value, but also admitted that the game length is too short compared to Resident Evil 2 because it only features one disc with one protagonist. IGN praised the live action choice feature, stating that it [...] "speeds up the pace, increases the tension, and forces a decision that varies the following scene." [...] Writing for GameCritics, Dale Weir felt {{that the fact that}} players <b>can</b> <b>mix</b> different types of gunpowder to create ammunition adds a new layer of strategy and customizability to the game. Both the 180 degree turn and dodge move were seen by IGN as welcome and necessary additions. In contrast, Official US PlayStation Magazine criticized the dodge feature for being impractical and for relying too much on timing, resulting in doing more harm to the player than against opponents. Other aspects of the game were not positively received: Official US PlayStation Magazine criticized the story of the game for being lacking, while Game Revolution pointed out that the voice acting was poor. The game was a runner up for GameSpot's 1999 Adventure Game of the Year.|$|E
