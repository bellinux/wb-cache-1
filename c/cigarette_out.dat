McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E

500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E

During this flight he took his hands off the steering wheel, took a <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> of his silver case and smoked it in his ivory holder, [...] thus creating a new record. This delighted Levavasseur because it showcased the aeroplane's stability when being flown with hands off the controls. [...] Then on June 6, 1909, Latham won the Prix Ambroise Goupy for flying a straight-line course of six kilometres in 4 minutes, 13 seconds. These flights convinced Levavasseur that Latham was clearly his best pilot and he was named the company's premier pilot. [...] Furthermore, based {{on the length of}} the flights Latham was conducting, Levavasseur was satisfied that his Antoinette IV monoplane was sufficiently reliable for a 45 minute-to-1 hour continuous flight and therefore Latham could attempt to fly across the English Channel to win a £1,000 (US$5,000 1910) prize offered by the Daily Mail.|$|E

He wore a low-crowned, narrow-brimmed straw hat, with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front; nobby short-tailed coat, pantaloons, vest, all trim and neat and up with the fashion; red-striped stockings, very low-quarter patent-leather shoes, tied with black ribbon; blue ribbon around his neck, wide-open collar; tiny diamond studs; wrinkleless kids; projecting cuffs, fastened with large oxidized silver sleeve-buttons, bearing the device of a dog's face--English pug.

60|$|When {{they stopped}} for tea, {{instead of running}} home as usual, she drank it cold out of a flask she had brought, ate a bun and some chocolate, {{and lay down on}} her back against the hedge. She always avoided that group of her fellow workers round the tea-cans which the farmer's wife brought out. To avoid people, if she could, had become {{habitual}} to her now. They must know about her, or would soon if she gave them the chance. She had never lost consciousness of her ring-finger, expecting every eye to fall on it as a matter of course. Lying on her face, she puffed her cigarette into the grass, and watched a beetle, till one of the sheep-dogs, scouting for scraps, came up, and she fed him with her second bun. Having finished the bun, he tried to eat the beetle, and, when she rescued it, convinced that she had nothing more to give him, sneezed at her, and went away. Pressing the end of her <b>cigarette</b> <b>out</b> against the bank, she turned over. Already the driver was perched on his tiny seat, and his companion, whose business it was to free the falling corn, was getting up alongside. Swish-swish! It had begun again. She rose, stretched herself, and went back to her place in the row. The field would be finished to-night; she would have a lovely rest-all Sunday I Towards seven o'clock a narrow strip, not twenty yards broad, alone was left. This last half hour was what Noel dreaded. To-day it was worse, for the farmer had no cartridges left, and the rabbits were dealt with by hullabaloo and sticks and chasing dogs. Rabbits were vermin, of course, and ate the crops, and must be killed; besides, they were good food, and fetched two shillings apiece; all this she knew but to see the poor frightened things stealing out, pounced on, turned, shouted at, chased, rolled over by great swift dogs, fallen on by the boys and killed and carried with their limp grey bodies upside down, so dead and soft and helpless, always made her feel quite sick. She stood very still, trying not to see or hear, and in the corn opposite to her a rabbit stole along, crouched, and peeped. 'Oh!' she thought, 'come out here, bunny. I'll let you away--can't you see I will? It's your only chance. Come out!' But the rabbit crouched, and gazed, with its little cowed head poked forward, and its ears laid flat; it seemed trying to understand whether this still thing in front of it was the same as those others. With the thought, 'Of course it won't while I look at it,' Noel turned her head away. Out {{of the corner of her}} eye she could see a man standing a few yards off. The rabbit bolted out. Now the man would shout and turn it. But he did not, and the rabbit scuttled past him and away to the hedge. She heard a shout from the end of the row, saw a dog galloping. Too late! Hurrah! And clasping her hands, she looked at the man. It was Fort! With the queerest feeling--amazement, pleasure, the thrill of conspiracy, she saw him coming up to her.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{biological}} effects, smoking has {{a profound}} social impact on people with schizophrenia.

A study of people with schizophrenia on public assistance found that they spent a median amount of $142 per month on <b>cigarettes</b> <b>out</b> of a median monthly public assistance income of $596, or about 27.36%. Some argue that this results in further social impacts as people with schizophrenia are then unable to spend money on entertainment and social events that would promote well-being, or may even be unable to afford housing or nutrition.|$|R
