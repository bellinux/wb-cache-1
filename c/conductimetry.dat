Considering the different scales, experimental techniques are diffraction ones, mainly light scattering techniques (DWS, see below, static and dynamic light scattering, X rays and neutron scattering) at sub-micrometer scales, or microscopic ones. Considering the system as continuous, its bulk properties can be characterized by light transmittance but also <b>conductimetry.</b> The correlation between structure and bulk is evidenced more accurately by acoustics in particular. The organisation between bubbles has been studied numerically using sequential attempts of evolution of the minimum surface energy either at random (Pott's model) or deterministic way (surface evolver).

40|$|Pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) slurry (PS) is {{commonly}} applied as fertilizer to agricultural fields. Knowledge of PS nitrogen content {{is essential for}} good management, but PS nitrogen content is highly variable, not only between farms but also within a farm. Laboratory analysis of animal slurries is often expensive and impractical for routine farmer use.

The detection threshold for Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca) in inoculated peel extracts was ca. 104 colony forming units (cfu) ml- 1 when samples were considered positive {{on the basis of a}} response within 48 h at 20 °C. Detection of E. chrysanthemi (Ech) was less sensitive, only 105 cfu ml- 1 peel extract were detected within 36 h at 25 °C. The linear correlation between detection times in <b>conductimetry</b> and inoculum levels of Eca and Ech in peel extracts was used for a quantitative estimation of Eca and Ech in naturally contaminated peel extracts. Samples giving a positive conductimetric response had to be confirmed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of Eca and Ech, because E. carotovora subsp. carotovora (Ecc) also generated a conductance response. <b>Conductimetry</b> was sensitive and efficient for detection of contamination levels of Eca higher than 104 cfu ml- 1 peel extract. For Ech, conductimetric detection was less sensitive and inefficient due to low contamination levels of Ech and the presence of high numbers of Ecc in many samples after enrichment, which interfered with the test. Immunofluorescence cell staining (IF) combined with enrichment and immunofluorescence colony staining (IFC) were suited to detect and quantify low numbers of Eca and Ech at less than 104 cfu ml- 1 in peel extracts.

40|$|For fungal {{contamination}} of foodstuffs, {{there are no}} fast, reliable, automated techniques to examine growth, nor have any predictive models been developed to describe {{the growth in the}} same way as for bacteria. Traditional plating methods can take 3 to 7 days to get adequate results depending on the fungal species utilised and well over a month for challenge testing, an unacceptable delay especially for the food industry. In this study two rapid analysis techniques were investigated, <b>conductimetry</b> (direct and indirect) and turbidimetry (Bioscreen), with the sole objective being to analyse their capability to detect fungal growth in optimum conditions and in the presence of inhibitory agents, in this case sorbic acid and vanillin. Three fungal (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Pencillium verrucosum and one yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used, though only A. niger growth was analysed using both of the rapid analysis techniques. Two bacterial species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) were also tested using the <b>conductimetry</b> technique for comparison. It was found that both the impedance and turbidimetry methods provided a sensitive and rapid means of detecting, and, under standardised conditions, measuring the activity of micro-organisms. The rate of response showed close correlation with the concentration of both bacteria and spores in the initial inoculum for each strain tested so correlation curves could be constructed to estimate the number of viable cells and spores in a suspension. Moreover, both methods can be used for the accurate screening of potential antimicrobial substances. In comparison with the turbidimetry method though, the impedance method did show a greater deal of variability and there is the possibility it is unsuitable for the analysis of certain fungal species. In addition the direct impedance technique was found to be completely unusable for the analysis of fungal growth.

The tricalcium silicate hydration is always delayed in presence of polycarboxylate superplasticizer.

The cmc∗ increased on increasing the concentration of β-CD due to the encapsulation of the amphiphilic drug to the hydrophobic cavities of the β-CD which delayed the micelle formation. Viscosity of the solution decreased drastically on the addition of β-CD which further increased on increasing the drug solution.

Liquid phase analysis, <b>conductimetry,</b> isothermal calorimetry, in situ XRD and SEM were performed on cement pastes produced with equivalent doses of an alkaline accelerator (sodium aluminate solution) and of an alkali-free accelerator (aluminum sulfate solution). Results showed that the addition of these chemicals first changes the ionic equilibria of the medium by the consumption of Ca 2 + and SO 42 - ions from the liquid phase. The alkali-free accelerator contributes to the rapid formation of ettringite, as well as to a faster rate of alite dissolution and hydration.
