40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} apply the {{emerging}} ability to manipulate genes to poultry improvement, {{it will be necessary}} to identify, <b>clone,</b> and understand <b>genes</b> that have economic potential.

Some such <b>genes</b> have been <b>cloned</b> from the chicken and from mammals. Those genes known to influence immune response and disease resistance or involved in the hormonal regulation of growth and reproduction have potential for cloning and manipulation. A far more difficult problem is the identification of clonable genes that influence quantitative traits.

40|$|We have <b>cloned</b> a new <b>gene</b> locus that {{comprises}} three genes {{concerned with}} the biosynthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen in Streptococcus mutans. The genes encode proteins exhibiting significant homology to the rfbA, rfbB, and rfbD gene products {{that are involved in}} the anabolism of dTDP-L-rhamnose from D-glucose- 1 -phosphate. This anabolism pathway pertains to biosynthesis of the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative bacteria. The cell extract of Escherichia coli expressing each of the <b>cloned</b> <b>genes</b> of S. mutans exhibited enzymatic activity corresponding to the homologous counterpart of the rfb gene products. Rhamnose was not detected in the cell wall preparation purified from the mutant in which each of the three <b>cloned</b> <b>genes</b> was insertionally inactivated. Rabbit antiserum against S. mutans serotype c-specific antigen did not react with the autoclaved extracts from these mutants. These results indicate that the gene products identified in the present study are involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose synthesis pathway and that the pathway relates to the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen of S. mutans. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that genes homologous to the <b>cloned</b> <b>genes</b> involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose synthesis pathway were widely distributed in a variety of streptococci.

50|$|After the {{expression}} of the gene product, it is usually necessary to purify the expressed protein; however, separating the protein of interest from the great majority of proteins of the host cell can be a protracted process. To make this purification process easier, a purification tag may be added to the <b>cloned</b> <b>gene.</b> This tag could be histidine (His) tag, other marker peptides, or a fusion partners such as glutathione S-transferase or maltose-binding protein. Some of these fusion partners may also help to increase the solubility of some expressed proteins.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new strategy with a very tight control {{for the expression of}} <b>cloned</b> <b>genes.</b> The system employed here is the T 7 promoter-based expression system in which transcription activator protein C of bacteriophage Mu (Mu C) has been cloned to serve as a repressor in the regulatory circuit. The system also includes pLysE, which encodes T 7 lysozyme, an inhibitor of T 7 RNA polymerase. This ensures tight regulation of <b>cloned</b> <b>genes</b> in the uninduced state. Upon induction, the expressed Mu C protein binds to its cognate site thereby repressing lys transcription driven by the tet promoter.

For this purpose, a dicistronic unit was constructed by <b>cloning</b> the smalR <b>gene</b> downstream of the Mu C gene.

5000|$|Rome’s lab {{is using}} {{molecular}} engineering of a naturally occurring cellular structure called a vault {{to develop a}} flexible, targetable nanoscale capsule. Vaults are abundant cellular particles of unknown function found in nearly all eukaryotes (cells containing a nucleus). In 1986, Rome and his then postdoctoral associate Nancy Kedersha were the first investigators to isolate and describe the vault particle. [...] Cryo-electron microscopy, plus single particle reconstruction, has provided overall dimensions of the vault at 42 x 75 nanometers (a nanometer is a millionth of a meter). These measurements indicate that the vault is larger in mass and size than many viruses. The overall structure of the intact vault is like a hollow barrel with two protruding caps and an indented waist with a very thin shell surrounding an internal cavity large enough to encompass several hundred proteins. Thus, the vault particle is a nanocapsule with high potential to encapsulate, protect, and deliver compounds.
