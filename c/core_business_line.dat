5000|$|According to some {{scholars}} such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, founder CEOs outperform their non-founder CEO counterparts in both stock performance and market valuation. They tend to take a long-term view and consider their firm their lifetime achievement, resulting in them holding a larger equity stake in their firm than non-founder CEOs. [...] Darius Palia, S. Abraham Ravid, and Chia-Jane Wang developed this idea further and concluded that founder CEOs become less influenced by managerial incentives {{as they continue to}} devote resources to their firm whereas the opposite is true for non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs are less invested in their company {{and are more likely to}} tailor their performance according to managerial incentives. Scholars such as Joon Mahn Mahn Lee, Jongsoo Jays Kim, and Joonhyung Bae, concluded that founder CEOs continually invest in new projects and explore new knowledge that will benefit the firm in the long-term, suggesting that the existence of a founder CEO is correlated with a greater innovation investment. [...] In terms of mergers & acquisitions, Fahlenbrach, along with other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs partake in a greater number of acquisitions within their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> <b>line</b> each year as they have a greater tolerance for risk. This additional risk taken on by founder CEOs stems from overconfidence at the CEO level which {{some scholars}} have measured through their tone in tweets, regarding both earnings announcements and personal statements, and their option exercise behavior relative to non-founder CEOs.|$|E

40|$|At {{the current}} pace and scale of sociotechnical progress, {{incumbent}} firms must seek out alternatives to traditional R&D {{in order to}} protect their current market position. By deploying corporate venture capital, many firms have leveraged the nimble, resourceful, and efficient nature of start-ups to inject compelling innovations into their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> <b>lines.</b> However, this arrangement must be constructed and cultivated carefully in order to optimize potential returns. Technological product or platform integration must be planned and executed, and value networks should be interleaved wherever possible. This paper asserts that the most effective corporate VCs have adopted these distinct practices, and further contends that these CVCs should view investment funding as a cost of doing business (rather than seeking long shot returns). These investors are inherently directing cash flow to an agile development workforce riding at the forefront of trends and technology, over which they maintain some level of strategic control. A series of interviews were conducted in order to capture the direct and indirect objectives, philosophies, and operations of corporate venture capital firms. Rather than simply validating or refuting the above hypotheses, this paper also qualitatively examines the insights and implications of the respondent data. Through the course of the analysis, numerous operational coherency issues were discovered, which are explored and discussed using principles from system dynamics, innovation theory, and management literature. Historical evidence and outside empirical studies were also leveraged to further highlight and underscore some of these key discoveries. by Michael A. Rolfes. Thesis: S.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{workings}} of internal capital markets in diversified firms that engage in related and unrelated corporate acquisitions. Our evidence indicates that bidders invest outside their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> (diversify) when the cash flows of their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> fall behind those of their non-core <b>lines</b> of <b>business.</b> However, bidders invest inside their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> (i. e., undertake non-diversifying investments) when their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> experiences superior cash flows. We also find that bidders whose <b>core</b> <b>business</b> are in industries with low growth prospects engage in diversifying acquisitions while bidders whose <b>core</b> <b>business</b> are in high growth industries undertake non-diversifying acquisitions. The pre-acquisition evidence, then, suggests that firms tend to diversify when the cash flows and the growth opportunities of their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> are considerably {{lower than those of}} their non-core business. Subsequent to acquisitions we find that diversifying bidders continue to allocate financial resources from less profitable business segments (i. e., <b>core</b> <b>business)</b> to more profitable business segments (i. e., non-core business). Given the low profitability of diversifying bidders' <b>core</b> <b>business,</b> this capital resource allocation suggests that diversification increases do not result in capital allocation inefficiencies. The evidence for non-diversifying bidders, however, supports the existence of "corporate socialism" in the sense that there is transfer of funds from the profitable (core) to the less profitable (non-core) business segments in multi-segment bidders. We find that the capital expenditures of bidders' non-core business segments rely on both core and non-core cash flows. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated <b>core</b> <b>business</b> {{conflict that}} occurs amongst government agencies when working together in regional development projects and initiatives. The {{intent is to}} develop methods to manage this conflict and so enhance the delivery of regional development outcomes. The research problem explored is: ‘Government Department <b>core</b> <b>business</b> – managing the impact of potential conflicts on regional development projects and programs’ The research involves three discipline areas – Government and governance, public sector management practices, and regional development. Government agency (GA) <b>core</b> <b>business</b> is determined by Government and delivered using public sector management practices that have shaped individual agency’s strategic plans, processes and systems for <b>core</b> <b>business</b> delivery. Regional development involves multiple agencies delivering their <b>core</b> <b>business</b> outcomes that contribute to regional development. Due to the focus by each agency on their own <b>core</b> <b>business,</b> <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflict can occur when agencies work together. A literature review did not uncover literature or research about GA <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflict, therefore {{this is a new}} area of investigation. The literature studies and reports investigated and discussed a related area – issues and impediment to Whole-of- Government (WOG) and ‘joined-up’ government initiatives. A qualitative inquiry methodology is used to build knowledge about this new area. The sample of participants is drawn from GAs’ staff who are involved in regional development projects and programs, or projects and programs that contribute to regional development. Data collection is through interviews and surveys with GAs’ representatives from 18 agencies, across three levels of Government and from two distinctly different regions (coastal and inland). Two aspects of <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflict are investigated – fundamental <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflict that involves the underpinning philosophy and ideology of an agency, and functional/operational <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflicts that include the strategic plans, policies, procedures and systems involved in delivery of <b>core</b> <b>business,</b> which also influence the design of program and project guidelines, and determine funding and staff resourcing. Research findings contribute new knowledge and expand current knowledge regarding challenges and barriers to agencies working together. Findings also enhance the application of approaches and tools to facilitate effective WOG and collaborative agency work. The research has resulted in a ‘process’ model to resolve the research problem that applies a holistic and comprehensive operational approach to addressing <b>core</b> <b>business</b> conflict. The ‘process’ model builds on the research findings and draws on information and tools from the literature. The research has implications for theory, policy and practice in the three discipline areas involved in the research problem and as a new area investigated, has generated further research opportunities...|$|R

This strategy is less risky than diversification; however, it can still create a substantial competitive advantage because the growth is based on or relates to the pack of skills that the business already does best.

First, a {{conceptual}} model including the three <b>core</b> <b>business</b> processes, product development management, {{supply chain management}} and customer relationship management, and performance measures is constructed based on previous research and literature. The conceptual model consists of 16 research hypotheses. Second, empirical evidence is introduced to test the research hypotheses. Finally, the conceptual model is partly verified through the test of hypotheses. The data {{used in this study}} was collected through use of a web-based questionnaire targeted to the upper management in Finnish companies. The questionnaire was sent to 15 941 decision makers, of which 1 157 completed the survey. Three multivariate data analysis techniques were used to address the research questions in empirical part of the study. First, a measurement model was constructed through use of a confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the theoretically proposed factor constructs. Second, a structural equation model was built to test part of the hypotheses. Third, a mediational analysis was conducted to test rest of the research hypotheses. The findings of this study support the importance of <b>core</b> <b>business</b> process integration. It seems that one <b>core</b> <b>business</b> process directly driving the performance is the customer relationship management. However, both product development management and supply chain management are paramount for overall success of a firm.
