Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude's tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{features}} associated with the road, including stone extraction quarries, side cuttings, a system of <b>catch</b> <b>drains</b> and culverts occurring along the entire length of the roadway. <b>Catch</b> <b>drains</b> average about 50-75 centimetres in width and 20-25 centimetres in depth. Some of the drains are stone pitched.|$|R

30|$|The farmers {{also come}} out with some {{innovation}} to cater with intensive agriculture practices such as plastic rain shelters, shift from vegetable to flower growing, improved seeds, installation of <b>catch</b> <b>drains</b> and sumps, hydroponics, and drip irrigation (Barrow et al. 2009). Cultivation under rain shelter has been practised widely in Cameron Highlands especially for flowers and vegetable farming (e.g., tomato, cucumber and brinjal). This practice provides a protection to that plantation against a direct hit from rain and strong winds. Cultivation under rain shelter also may minimize the soil erosion but the interception of the rainfall due to rain shelter create the bigger amount of runoff and also increase soil salinity (Aminuddin et al. 2001). Moreover, the rain shelter trapped {{the heat from the}} sun and projected higher greenhouse gaseous emission which in turn increase the surrounding temperature (Hamdan et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{difficulty}} of expropriation, dump technology is experiencing the tendency of higher bench, heavier dumping intensity and larger dumping equipment. Therefore, accidents of dump bench instability or general shear failure on foundation soar rapidly. The capacity decreases because of reducing the heap height, and the high cost would be unacceptable if the soft layers of foundation were strengthened or cleared up. The practicality of passive control measures, such as rockfill dams and retaining walls locating at slope toe is analyzed; the validity of <b>catch</b> <b>drains</b> is evaluated, based on the interacting characteristics between the waste dump and the foundation. The design principles, permission of deformation and moderate failure, are submitted with considering consequence to surroundings. Active countermeasure mechanism is established according to spatial effect, reasonably using dumping-site space and adjusting time-space relation during dumping...|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design of {{producing}} the cover drain. The cover serves to <b>catch</b> impurities while <b>draining</b> liquids. The part is made of 1. 4301 stainless steel, using 1 -mm thick sheet metal. The size of the annual production series is 30, 000 units. As an optimal method of production, progressive cutting and shallow drawing were selected in a combined and a one-purpose tool. Technological and design calculations were performed according to which tools were designed. The LENP 100 press was selected considering the total required pressing force. The cost of one piece production was calculated at 18. 91 CZK and the production becomes profitable with annual production higher than 19, 478 units per year...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the Taste Council of Ireland {{undertook}} an {{oral history}} project Lost and forgotten skills in rural Ireland in which interviewees reflected on food skills which had largely died {{out in the}} course of the modernisation of Ireland in the latter part of the 20th century.Interviewees reflected that… pigs were routinely kept in even the smallest of farms. A few would be kept for the family's own use with others reared and sold on. There would normally be two kills on the farm per year, one in April and one in October.To begin the home slaughter of pigs, a tub of brine was prepared and covered. The pigs would be killed on site by the man of the house, with blood drained into an enamel dish for his wife to make blood pudding (she would also take the intestine, which was rinsed out to hold the pudding). Entrails were removed and the liver and kidneys would be saved. The head would be removed and boiled for hours to salvage whatever was possible.Salt was fundamental to the curing of pork, not only to preserve the meat but to eliminate pathogens. Split down the middle, the sides of the pig would be set on a bench and handfuls of salt rubbed in, first on the flesh side and then the skin side. Often, two people would be involved, and hours would be spent ensuring the sides were thoroughly salted - around 4lbs of salt for each flank. Laid then on the floor, skin-side down, often on a bed of straw, sacking or jute would then be thrown over and, after a few days, the salt would be further trampled in by men standing on the jute. Hung up on hooks with sacking over, portions were cut off as required. Pork/bacon could also be smoked in the chimney. Hanging sides of pork would be wrapped in muslin to keep off flies.When the pig was stunned and the throat slit, an enamel basin or bucket was used to <b>catch</b> the blood <b>drained</b> from the pig. Salt was added to prevent coagulation. Intestines were washed in running water. Oatmeal was mixed in, along with some herbs and spices, salt and pepper. Sometimes using a funnel, the mixture was then fed into the intestine, cut and tied at lengths of a foot, put on a tray and steamed over hot water for several hours. The lengths of pudding were then left out into the 'dairy' or outhouse and sliced off for frying at suppertime as required. The taste of home-made pudding was said by all respondents to be incomparable to the manufactured alternative. Those few respondents who still make it the traditional way report huge demand among friends and neighbours.|$|R
