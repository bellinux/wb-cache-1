For their future success, the media enterprises have to analyze the current competence basis and compare them with the required, strategically important, <b>core</b> <b>competences</b> derived from an external market analysis.

2500|$|The content-sourcing {{competence}} means {{acquisition of}} high-quality information and/or entertainment content for content production. Especially {{the production of}} exclusive content leads to unique competitive advantage. Content-creation competence {{is one of the}} most important <b>core</b> <b>competences</b> in most media enterprises. Media enterprises with content-creation competences are, for example, especially good at realizing social trends and implementing them into their media products, making them highly attractive for the customers. The product development competence is the qualification for a product portfolio with a steady flow of revenues.In order to achieve this, media enterprises have to be able to develop promising media products and to assess their marketability. The promotion competence is specifically relevant for media products belonging to the film, book or music categories as these are individual products. Here a different promotion strategy than promotion of brand identity is needed. Achieving public attention and thus a better market position for media products constitutes the promotion competence. [...] Media enterprises with cross-media utilization competences can provide content to the recipients in a timely manner, in the desired amount and via the right channel. Finally the technology competence refers to the employment of modern information and communication technology for the creation and marketing of content.|$|E

However, few research concerning <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> or value chain attributes of farm managers or producers has been found in agricultural context. The impetus that increases the <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> of farming will presumably feed into development of competitive advantages and greater economic capacity of rootstalk vegetable producers. Built upon the concepts of <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> and value chain model for analysis, this study examined the <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> of farming which rootstalk vegetable producers possess and assessed their training and development needs using the same <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> framework. In this research 213 farmers included for investigation were based on the criterion of their international trading experiences in exporting the rootstalk vegetable products. The results showed that rootstalk vegetable producers consider "marketing and sale" and "human resource management" as the most deficient core competencies of farming. It also revealed a more contemporary need in developing <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> of farming consists of both main and supplementary activities pertaining to the value chain.

40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>competence</b> as {{a concept}} has been {{implemented}} and studied within the for-profit sector for some decades. The concept is used to understand, develop and sustain competitive advantage and, in contrast to purely market oriented strategies, takeoff from the internal unique strengths within organizations. There exists almost no research on or use of the <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> concept within the non-profit sector. However leaders and decision-makers at non-profit organizations are also challenged to develop their organizations, either to be relevant for its target group or to compete for funding. Doing this without renouncing on the mission and core values requires appropriate strategies and a well-developed compass. The concept of <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> is anticipated to contribute to such processes. This thesis sets out to study whether the concept of <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> can be identified within the sector, and if so, {{how it can be}} described and how it is linked to associated concepts, and particularly, how the model for this proposed by Ljungquist (2008, 2010) can be applied. The thesis also explores how the concept of <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> is linked to non-profit sector specific characteristics, more specifically in what way <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> is related to the mission of the organization and how resources unique to non-profit organizations like members, volunteers and supporters possibly contribute to <b>core</b> <b>competence.</b> Finally, the notion of a special added value (Weerawardena and Mort, 2001; Wijkström and Malmborg, 2005) among NPOs will be discussed in relation to <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> as defined by the NPOs included in this paper. The thesis is based on a multiple-case study that includes two national organizations in Sweden and two local organizations in Canada. Findings indicate that <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> exists within the four organizations and that it is linked to each organization’s mission. Also, it is indicated that resources are linked not only by its utilization of, but also by its contribution, to <b>core</b> <b>competence.</b> In other aspects, <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> and its associated concepts identified concur with models developed for the for-profit sector. The characteristics of support mechanisms, like systems, routines, capacities and communication are similar as well as other competencies that have the characteristics of development and adaptation. 1 - 250 - 334 - 6052 (Rachel Reid...|$|R

Written in English. The <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> concept {{describes}} how large companies can prosper and achieve competitive advantage. It {{is a well-known}} concept in the strategy domain, frequently practiced in organizations and cited in the literature. Despite this, recent research indicates that in-depth understanding of the concept is scarce. In this thesis, a few shortcomings of the concept are recognized: The vagueness of the original definition, divergence of the existing literature, and invalid appliance. Straightforward <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> identification and verification processes are put forward, applicable to both research and practice. The processes aim at advancing beyond mere identification. Three different core competencies were identified and verified in the empirical part of this thesis. The core competencies were possible to separate through differences in the various influences from competencies, capabilities and resources. The core competencies were also possible to arrange in a complexity continuum, from a compound and highly integrated <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> to a simple and technology-based one, with the third one, a service-based <b>core</b> <b>competence,</b> representing moderate complexity. The two most complex core competencies were, in general, influenced by competencies and capabilities to a larger extent than the simpler <b>core</b> <b>competence.</b> Resources mainly influenced the goods-producing core competencies. The empirical findings of this thesis show that by acknowledging {{the specifics of the}} characteristics of competencies, capabilities and resources and their influences, in conceptual and empirical discussions and applications, core competencies can be identified and verified. Furthermore, their influences provide the keys to managing core competencies. A new <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> agenda is proposed. The agenda includes <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> management, which is of particular value to organizations in need of change, for example those facing dynamic business environments, where vital activities and processes – including <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> – must be continually renewed.

Literature review and theoretical framework resulted into a proposal of a theoretical model of relationship between Customer relations and <b>Core</b> <b>competence.</b> Open ended questions were designed so as to gain {{as much information as}} possible from respondents; data were mainly collected through survey questions and face to face interviews. Collected data were then analyzed using pattern matching technique and theoretical model tested against the observed or actual model after data analysis and discussion of findings. Findings: This study examines the relationship between Customer relations and <b>Core</b> <b>competence</b> of a business. Customer relation strategies which are aimed at creating and maintaining a strong Customer relations-base can only be fully implemented or executed from a backing or support of an efficient <b>Core</b> <b>competence,</b> in other words, <b>Core</b> <b>competence</b> improves and maintains a good and strong Customer relations base. Applicability/Value: This research holds value and adds knowledge to the domain of strategy in general and in particular in the area of Customer relations and <b>core</b> <b>competence.</b> Though it may be limited in certain ways such as the type of industry researched, it certainly underscores important issues to the understanding of customer relations and <b>core</b> <b>competence</b> concepts and this knowledge can help in developing successful customer relations leading to increase in market share, leadership and hence business profitability.
