5|$|Ultimately, {{the region}} was {{repopulated}} by Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. In 1737–1738, the sultan amnestied the rebels and permitted {{the return of the}} insurgents' property in 1741, though none of the former residents is known to have returned. In the 1720s–1730s, Chiprovtsi had only 12 inhabited houses; by the 1750s, those had reached 150. The Orthodox Chiprovtsi Monastery had been reestablished in 1703 by a certain Zhivko who took the ecclesiastical name of Zoticus. As the interrupted mining was apparently not continued after the uprising and the international trade links had been severed, the locals switched to cattle breeding, agriculture, fur trade and later <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> as their main occupation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E

5|$|Prisoners in the Agra jail {{were trained}} and kept {{employed}} as carpet weavers {{as part of}} their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General Thomas Dennehy, who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table, and learn to do other tasks.|$|E

5000|$|The oldest Hereke carpets, now {{exhibited}} in Topkapı and other palaces in Istanbul, contain {{a wide variety}} of colours and designs. The typical [...] "palace carpet" [...] features intricate floral designs, including the tulip, daisy, carnation, crocus, rose, lilac, and hyacinth. It often has quarter medallions in the corners. The medallion designs of earlier Ushak carpets was widely used at the Hereke factory. These medallions are curved on the horizontal axis and taper to points on the vertical axis. Hereke prayer rugs feature patterns of geometric motifs, tendrils and lamps as background designs within the representation of a mihrab (prayer niche). Once referring solely to <b>carpets</b> <b>woven</b> at Hereke, the term [...] "Hereke carpet" [...] now refers to any high quality <b>carpet</b> <b>woven</b> using similar techniques. Hereke carpets remain among the finest and most valuable examples of <b>woven</b> <b>carpets</b> in the world.|$|R

25|$|Under Abbas' reign, <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> {{increased}} {{its role as}} {{an important part of}} Persian industry and culture, as wealthy Europeans started importing Persian rugs.

25|$|The art {{and craft}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> has gone through periods of decline during times of {{political}} unrest, or {{under the influence of}} commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. <b>Carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs were regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige from the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers, until today.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Rezā Shāh, {{supported}} by the British government, deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and founded the Pahlavi dynasty. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying {{the foundation of the}} modern Iranian state. In order to stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving,</b> often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.|$|E
5000|$|Realizing the {{commercial}} potential of <b>carpets</b> <b>woven</b> from hand-spun, vegetably dyed wool, other carpet manufacturers adopted DOBAG's manufacturing approach., [...] The producer's return to traditional dyeing and weaving, and {{the commercial}} interest this created amongst customers, was termed by Eilland as the [...] "Carpet Renaissance".|$|R

25|$|The art of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> was in {{addition}} intimately {{connected to the}} making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.|$|E
25|$|After the Iranian Revolution, little {{information}} could at first be obtained about <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> in Iran.

Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.|$|E
25|$|Kashan is {{the oldest}} carpet-producing city in Central Iran. Famous for its {{production}} of silk carpets, <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> was revived in the late 19th century.

25|$|Another knot {{frequently}} used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet {{can be made}} with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as <b>carpets</b> <b>woven</b> wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally <b>woven</b> <b>carpets,</b> their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.|$|R
25|$|Iran's {{territorial}} integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated the Afghans, and Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving,</b> which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the Afsharid and Zand dynasties.|$|E
25|$|Akbar, a Mogul emperor, is {{accredited}} to {{introducing the}} art of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase. Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, Agra and Bhadohi.|$|E
25|$|In 1789, Mohammad Khan Qajar was crowned king of Persia, {{the founder}} of the Qajar dynasty, which {{provided}} Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> in Persia.|$|E
50|$|Other {{important}} {{media were}} in the applied or decorative arts rather than figurative work. Pottery, especially İznik pottery, jewellery, hardstone carvings, Turkish <b>carpets,</b> <b>woven</b> and embroidered silk textiles were all produced to extremely high standards, and carpets in particular were exported widely. Other Turkish art ranges from metalwork, carved woodwork and furniture with elaborate inlays to traditional Ebru or paper marbling.|$|R
50|$|The term Armenian carpet designates, but is {{not limited}} to, tufted rugs or knotted <b>carpets</b> <b>woven</b> in Armenia or by Armenians from pre-Christian times to the present. It also {{includes}} a number of flat woven textiles. The term covers a large variety of types and sub-varieties. Due to their intrinsic fragility, almost nothing survives—neither carpets nor fragments—from antiquity until the late medieval period.|$|R

25|$|Activities of {{scientists}} and collectors {{beginning in the late}} 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving.</b> This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of art historical and cultural knowledge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> {{may have}} been {{introduced}} into the area {{as far back as}} the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the Ghaznavids and the Ghauris, from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.|$|E
25|$|Arabian geographers {{and historians}} visiting Persia provide, {{for the first}} time, {{references}} {{to the use of}} carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the Hudud al-'Alam states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, Al-Muqaddasi refers to carpets in the Qaināt. Yaqut al-Hamawi tells us that carpets were woven in Azerbaijān in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller Ibn Battuta mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari atabeg in Idhej. These references indicate that <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.|$|E
5000|$|A variant knot is the {{so-called}} jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps.
