5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Immigration</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

5000|$|On immigration, Rubio {{supports}} {{securing the}} country's borders and then offering a legal status {{to people who}} came to the United States unlawfully, and he also believes there should be more vetting of refugees; he now opposes seeking a single <b>comprehensive</b> all-in-one <b>immigration</b> <b>reform</b> bill (which he calls delusional), and instead wants to secure the borders and only then discuss legal status.

40|$|Approximately 30 {{percent of}} the more than 68 million young adults aged 18 to 34 in the United States today are either foreign born or of foreign parentage. As these {{newcomers}} make their transitions to adulthood, their experiences and readiness to progress to adulthood differ significantly from one another, and from their native-parentage counterparts. For many ethnic groups, significant progress takes place from the first to the second generation. But for millions of young immigrants, a lack of legal permanent residency status blocks their prospects for social mobility. Immigrant groups experience gaps in social, economic, and legal status that are even greater than the gaps between native whites and blacks. These social and economic divides reflect three very different ways immigrants enter the country: through regular immigration channels, without legal authorization, or as state-sponsored refugees. Having an undocumented status has become all the more consequential with the failure of Congress to pass <b>comprehensive</b> federal <b>immigration</b> <b>reforms.</b> In the 2011 Pastora Cafferty Lecture on Race and Ethnicity in American Life, professor Rubén G.

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} doctrinal and {{theoretical}} challenges confronting San Francisco 2 ̆ 7 s non-cooperation ordinance, and similar subfederal actions. It does so using a non-conventional but useful method {{of engaging in}} a dialectic exchange. In using the dialectic structure, we take our cue from Professor Stephen Legomsky 2 ̆ 7 s elegant use of the device in his recent article {{on the meaning of}} undocumented status. As he noted, the format has been 2 ̆ 2 under-utilized 2 ̆ 2 in legal scholarly literature. More scholars should use this method, he contended, because it helps to reveal the diametrically opposed positions of various groups concerning aparticular issue. Importantly, a dialectic conversation facilitates a more constructive discussion of the issues at stake. The Article proceeds as follows. Part I provides a brief discussion of the history and current state of the sanctuary ordinance and other immigrant-friendly aspects of San Francisco 2 ̆ 7 s policy. Part II engages in a conversation about the constitutionality of sub-federal enactments like the San Francisco ordinance. It highlights the motivations and purposes of San Francisco 2 ̆ 7 s policy and the specific preemption challenges it faces. Part III launches into a more general examination of the preemption doctrine on sub-federal lawmaking related to undocumented immigrants. In this part, we posit ways of doctrinally distinguishing inclusionary from exclusionary laws and policies. Part IV concludes with a discussion of the implications of the arguments presented for <b>comprehensive</b> federal <b>immigration</b> <b>reform...</b>|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the US {{government}} has expanded immigration detention to unprecedented levels.

Notwithstanding the apparent trend in favor of <b>immigration</b> <b>reform,</b> viable reform proposals continue to assume the need for punitive detention for migrants as part of a criminalized immigration enforcement model.

40|$|Almost 30 {{percent of}} the more than 68 million young adults aged {{eighteen}} to thirty-four in the United States today are either foreign born or of foreign parentage. As these newcomers make their transitions to adulthood, say Ruben Rumbaut and Golnaz Komaie, they differ significantly not only from one another but also from their native-parentage counterparts, including blacks and whites. The authors document the demographic changes in the United States over the past forty years and describe the ways in which generation and national origin shape the experiences of these newcomers as they become adults. Rumbaut and Komaie point out that immigrant groups experience gaps in social, economic, and legal status that are even greater than the gaps between native whites and blacks. By far the most-educated (Indians) and the least-educated (Mexicans) groups in the United States today are first-generation immigrants, as are the groups with the lowest poverty rate (Filipinos) and the highest poverty rate (Dominicans). These social and economic divides reflect three very different ways immigrants enter the country: through regular immigration channels, without legal authorization, or as state-sponsored refugees. For many ethnic groups, significant progress takes place from the first to the second generation. But, say the authors, for millions of young immigrants, a lack of legal permanent residency status blocks their prospects for social mobility. Having an undocumented status has become all the more consequential with the failure of Congress to pass <b>comprehensive</b> federal <b>immigration</b> <b>reforms.</b> In the coming two decades, as the U. S. native-parentage labor force continues to shrink, immigrants and their children are expected to account for most of the growth of the nation's labor force, with the fastest-growing occupations requiring college degrees. Rumbaut and Komaie stress that one key to the nation's future will be how it incorporates young adults of immigrant origin in its economy, polity, and society, especially how it enables these young adults to have access to, and to attain, postsecondary education and its manifold payoffs...|$|R
