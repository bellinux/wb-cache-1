40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we derive worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> {{on delay}} and backlog for non-preemptive {{priority}} queueing systems using network calculus. There are known {{results for the}} average behaviour of non-preemptive priority queueing systems from traditional queueing theory. By use of numerical investigations, we compare our worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> to those average behaviour results {{in order to give}} a feel as to how conservative the worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> are. A practical application of our results is given for DiffServ-based networks which use simple priority queueing to differentiate several traffic classes by assigning them different delay targets...|$|R

The formulation allows for computation {{of the worst}} <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> on the errors in the solution of elasticity problem. From these <b>bounds</b> the worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> on the discretization error of any point {{in the domain of}} the boundary can be computed.

60|$|The {{next day}} Mr. Gladstone {{received}} Graham's letter already described. The interpretation {{that he put}} upon it was that although Graham appeared to lean in favour of acceptance, 'yet the counsel was indecisive.' On ordinary construction, though the counsellor {{said that this was}} a case in which only the man himself could decide, yet he also said that acceptance would be for the public good. 'Your affirmative advice, had it even been more positive, was not approval, nor was Lord Aberdeen's. On the contrary it would have been like the orders to Balaam, that he should go with the messengers of Balak, when notwithstanding the command, the act was recorded against him.' We may be quite sure that when a man draws all these distinctions, between affirmative advice, positive advice, approval, he is going to act without any advice at all, as Mr. Gladstone was in so grave a <b>case</b> <b>bound</b> to do. He declined to join.|$|E

Network calculus provides a methodology for determining the worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> in packet scheduling using the concept of arrival and service curves. Using Network Calculus, this paper presents a mathematical model of a TDMA-based medium access control protocol, where a cluster based system is modeled and arrival/service curve is proposed. In addition, the model is also extended to allow finding the maximum delay and backlog bounds for applications with certain QoS requirements...|$|R
40|$|LLL reduction, {{originally}} {{founded in}} 1982 to factor certain polynomials, {{is a useful}} tool in public key cryptanalysis. The search for short lattice vectors helps determining the practical hardness of lattice problems, which {{are supposed to be}} secure against quantum computer attacks. It is a fact that in practice, the LLL algorithm finds much shorter vectors than its theoretic analysis guarantees. Therefore one can see that the guaranteed worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> are not helpful for practical purposes. We use a probabilistic approach to give an estimate for the length of the shortest vector in an LLL-reduced bases that is tighter than the worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds...</b>|$|R

United States (1986), the Court found the phrase [...] "floods or flood waters" [...] encompassed waters released for flood control purposes when reservoired waters are at flood stage. He went on to write that it was a difficult 'fact-led' question about whether this singular incident would fall within the James decision. For that reason, the Court would allow the suit to proceed in the District Court, only concluding that it was in error for the Government to receive absolute immunity in this case. Therefore, the Ninth Circuit was reversed.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{cornerstones}} {{of modern}} cryptography is the ability for trusted parties to establish a sequence of bits known only to themselves. Using that sequence of bits, {{they are able to}} send messages over an insecure channel, and an eavesdropper who does not know the secret bits cannot tell the difference between a legitimate message and a random one. In this paper we analyze an existing randomized protocol for establishing a secret key from a random deal of cards. Worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds</b> are known for the number of bits established using this protocol, however until now no probabilistic analysis has been applied. We show that in expectation and with high probability the protocol will do considerably better {{in some of the most}} natural situations than the worst <b>case</b> <b>bounds.</b> We present bounds on the expected number of bits as well as bounds on the probability of large deviation from the expected value. Furthermore, in many of these situations we give upper and lower bounds that approach each other in the limit. ...|$|R
