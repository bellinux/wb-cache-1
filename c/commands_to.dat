5|$|Blue Wing Blitz is a {{traditional}} turn-based tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly aerial warfare units.

In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E

5|$|Northern Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in May 1941, and covered the whole of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Townsville, Queensland, Northern Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. In January 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was divided into North-Western and North-Eastern Area <b>Commands,</b> <b>to</b> counter Japanese threats to northern Australia and Papua, respectively.|$|E

5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game, such as triggering a sand avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed. Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
5|$|Darius' initial {{response}} was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned {{himself in the}} centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> any part of his large army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.|$|E
40|$|When sayings of Jesus are {{compared}} between the Pauline letters and the Synoptic Gospels {{in an attempt}} to locate parallels, Galatians 5 : 14 and Romans 13 : 8 – 10 have frequently been put forward as possible parallels to the Synoptic renditions of the great commandment of Mark 12 : 28 – 34 (Mt 22 : 34 – 40; Lk 10 : 25 – 28). These Pauline and Synoptic texts all contain the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour, but the Synoptic texts have added the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love God <b>to</b> the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour. Paul never quoted the great commandment. Consequently, a relationship between the verses is normally rejected. However, not all possibilities have been explored. In the search for parallels between Pauline and Synoptic Jesus traditions it has been overlooked that Paul and Matthew render the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour more than once. Matthew delivers the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour three times. Only once he has connected it <b>to</b> the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love God. Matthew renders the single <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour twice, resembling the Pauline use of the command. Using the criteria for validating parallels between Pauline and Synoptic Jesus traditions, including verbal agreement and the unique use of the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour by Paul and Matthew, it is argued that a connection between Romans 13 : 9 and Matthew 19 : 18 – 19 is likely. INTRADISCIPLINARY AND/OR INTERDISCIPLINARY IMPLICATIONS : The research explores the use of Leviticus 19 : 18 b by the New Testament authors. It is argued that the <b>command</b> <b>to</b> love the neighbour was given high prominence in the early church, as it was used by the Synoptic authors and by Paul to summarise Jesus’ ethical teachings.

They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> {{other members of the}} crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959. The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors, though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground is a {{survival}} horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, {{both of which}} reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.
