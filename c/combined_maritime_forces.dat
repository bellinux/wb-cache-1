40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedOperational commanders and planners are challenged with maintaining fleet presence in many environments with limited resources. To {{add to this}} challenge, there are further constraints placed upon assets allocated to a given operational commander such as replenishments at sea, multinational exercises, diplomatic port visits, and predetermined in-chop and out-chop dates. In {{the case of the}} <b>Combined</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> (CMF), which operates in the FIFTH FLEET Area of Responsibility, these constraints are further magnified by the fact that ships under his or her operational command are from as many as ten different coalition nations at any given time. Furthermore, command of the CMF rotates between these coalition nations, increasing the propensity for inconsistent and sub-optimal resource allocation. This thesis develops a scheduling tool, Coalition Resource Allocation for Maritime Security (C-RAMS), that is capable of quickly producing a schedule that optimizes a given measure of effectiveness for assets assigned to the CMF. This C-RAMS tool accounts for logistics requirements and allows a commander to set priorities within various sub-regions, types of assets, and specific time periods. We illustrate how C-RAMS provides such an optimal schedule and also provides insights into interactions between different priorities and ship types, including those which may be interpolated for future force configurations, through the use of Visual Basic with an Excel 2003 user interface.

40|$|National Security AffairsDuring {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} increase in attention paid to multinational military forces. The idea of UN standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>forces</b> has emerged as a potentially important contributor to international peace, order and stability. The assignment of national contingents to such a force on a standing basis seems desirable, but so far there has been no international consensus on the establishment such as this force. This thesis proposes that a UN Standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> can be an important contributor to international security. Establishing a UN standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> raises a central question: is it possible to establish a UN standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force?</b> What are the problems and constraints of such force in the UN context? The point of this thesis {{is that there is a}} dilemma between realities and ideals, so that the establishment of a UN Standing Multinational <b>Maritime</b> <b>Force</b> seems to be a dream foreseeable only in the distant future. This thesis highlights the political constraints and problems that complicate the creation of a standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force</b> in terms of UN naval missions and supporting tasks. Consequently, this thesis attempts to demonstrate that to establish a standing multinational <b>maritime</b> <b>force</b> within the UN organization is impossible unless these constraints and problems are solved.
