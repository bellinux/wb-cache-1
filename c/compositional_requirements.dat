5000|$|Further {{weight for}} use of the term genetic came from eighteenth century thinker Giambattista Vico, who said, [...] "To {{understand}} something, and not merely be able to describe it, or analyse it into its component parts, is to understand how it came into being - its genesis, its growth … true understanding is always genetic". Despite these legitimate genetic parallels it was felt that this emphasis led to confusion with the concept of genetic algorithms. As a result, the term behavior engineering was introduced to describe the processes that exploit behavior trees to construct systems.

Passive immunization of rabbits with M 131 administered intravenously conferred significant immunity demonstrated {{by the failure of}} syphilitic lesions to appear at 29 % of intradermal challenge sites (7 / 24) and a mean delay of approximately 8 days to lesion appearance at the remaining sites (17 / 24). M 131 not only bound to OMV and to the surfaces of intact motile T. pallidum cells but also bound to organisms whose outer membranes were removed, indicating both surface and subsurface locations for the killing target. This target was determined to be a T. pallidum lipid. Lipid extracted from T. pallidum and made into liposomes bound M 131. Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography separation and fraction collection mass spectrometry (LC-MS+) of T. pallidum lipid showed that the target of M 131 was phosphorylcholine. M 131 binding required both liposome formation and a critical concentration of phospholipid containing phosphorylcholine, suggesting that the epitope has both a conformational and a <b>compositional</b> <b>requirement.</b> M 131 did not react with red blood cells, which have phosphorylcholine-containing lipids in their exterior membrane leaflets, or with Venereal Disease Research Laboratory antigen that also contains phosphorylcholine, further indicating the specificity of M 131.

40|$|Abstract. Distributed Description Logics (DDL) enable {{reasoning}} {{with multiple}} ontologies interconnected by directional semantic mapping, called bridge rules. Bridge rules map concepts of a source ontology into concepts {{of a target}} ontology. Concept subsumptions of the source ontology can be propagated according to a propagation pattern expressed by bridge rules into concept subsumptions of the target ontology. In the basic for-mulation of DDL such a propagation is mostly limited to cases when pairs of ontologies are directly linked by means of bridge rules. However, when more than two ontologies are involved, {{one would expect that}} sub-sumption propagates along chains of ontologies linked by bridge rules, but the semantics of DDL is too weak to support this behaviour. In a recent study, an adjusted semantics for DDL that supports subsump-tion propagation through chains of ontologies has been introduced. This study makes use of so called <b>compositional</b> consistency <b>requirement</b> that has been employed before in Package-based description logics. While the results concerning subsumption propagation under the adjusted seman-tics are encouraging, there are important drawbacks. In this paper we take a wider perspective, and propose a study of several different alter-native extensions of the DDL semantics. For each of them we study the formal properties, and we select the one that, according to our analysis, constitutes a good compromise, and for this case we provide a sound and complete tableaux decision procedure. ...|$|R

40|$|Activation of {{the type}} I {{interferon}} (IFN) pathway by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is {{a major contributor to}} the off-target effects of RNA interference in mammalian cells. While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different <b>compositional</b> and structural <b>requirements,</b> have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5 ′-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor- 3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Biomass is an {{important}} primary and renewable energy resource which is widely distributed around the world. Bioenergy derived from biomass {{is a form of}} renewable energy that may be used to generate power, heat and to synthesize liquid fuels for transport or chemical production. Among the different biomass utilisation processes, thermo-chemical conversion methods, such as pyrolysis or gasification, are {{the most efficient way to}} convert biomass to fuels or fine chemicals. Biomass gasification is generally favoured as it can be used for the production of syngas (H 2 and CO) in differing H 2 /CO ratios, which can be used as a fuel, or for chemical synthesis. However, existing gasification units, suffer from a major technical hurdle that is tar formation. Tar components, especially smaller molecule aromatic ring components such as toluene, xylene and naphthalene etc., are still present in syngas after primary and secondary tar removal treatments. This seriously influences the efficiency of subsequent syngas application in either gas turbines or chemical synthesis. As such tar removal technologies are imperative for the purification of raw syngas generated during biomass gasification. Catalytic cracking is currently considered the most attractive method for tar removal, as cooling of the raw syngas can be avoided and hence minimal energy is lost. A further advantage lies in that tars can be cracked and reformed into light gaseous components, such as H 2, CO and CH 4, increasing the overall gasification efficiency and improving the lower heating value (LHV) of the product syngas. Among the various catalysts available such as alkali metal catalysts, nickel-based catalysts and transition metal catalysts, calcium based catalysts were selected for systematic investigation. Calcium based catalysts were evaluated as the most attractive due to their low cost and ability for simultaneous catalytic tar cracking and CO 2 capture at moderate temperatures. In order to utilise a calcium based catalyst for tar cracking in a biomass gasification process, with a primary focus on syngas production and power generation, two configurations of a novel calcium looping based biomass gasification process were proposed in this thesis; (i) an ex-situ calcium looping (ECL) process for biomass gasification and (ii) a calcium looping based biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (CL-BIGCC). To assess the technical merits of the proposed processes, a fundamental understanding of bio-tar formation during biomass gasification, as well as, bio-tar cracking in the presence of calcium-based catalysts was necessary. Accordingly, a series of experimental and theoretical modelling investigations were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed processes. An experimental investigation of tar cracking behaviour during biomass partial oxidative gasification in the presence of CaO was conducted. The amount of tar cracked was proportional to the oxygen content and CaO loading or Ca/B (mass ratio of calcium to biomass). The effect of oxygen in the gasification environment was more significant for bio-tars cracking in comparison to CaO addition but resulted in higher CO and CO 2 yields in the syngas. However, the presence of CaO resulted in greater catalytic conversion of tars resulting in higher H 2 /CO syngas ratios at lower temperatures. It was also found that the gasification process reaction rate increased for increasing oxygen and CaO content. Therefore, it is crucial to control both the oxygen and CaO content in the biomass gasification process in order to achieve synergetic effects relating to bio-tar cracking and to ultimately produce syngas of the desired <b>compositional</b> <b>requirement.</b> Steam reforming of bio-tars in the presence of natural CaO minerals (stone dust and dolomite) and a novel synthesized dual supported CaO catalyst (CaO-Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 /Al 2 O 3) prepared with and without ultrasonic treatment, was investigated. Of the natural minerals, stone dust showed better tar cracking performance than dolomite. The synthesized catalyst without ultrasonic treatment (CA) exhibited better tar cracking performance in comparison of stone dust and dolomite in the temperature range of 600 to 800 °C. Conversely, the synthesized catalyst with ultrasonic treatment (CAU) performed worse than all other catalysts when the temperature was above 650 °C mainly due to a smaller specific surface area caused by the ultrasonic treatment during preparation. The properties of the natural and synthesised catalyst were also assessed. The CA catalyst had the greatest performance in terms of superior surface area and good mechanical strength due to the core support of Al 2 O 3. This makes it a potential bed material for further study of tar cracking in large-scale fluidized applications. A thermodynamic assessment of the proposed ECL process was completed using the software package Aspen Plus. The ECL process was proposed to overcome the disadvantages of ash separation in traditional chemical looping/ calcium looping biomass gasification processes. Simulation of the ECL process aimed to identify the optimum process operating conditions/parameters for H 2 rich syngas production and CO 2 separation from a thermodynamic point of view. In order to achieve the highest cold gas efficiency, energy efficiency and CO 2 capture efficiency, the simulation results found the optimum operating parameters to be a CaO/biomass mass ratio (1. 1), steam/biomass mass ratio (0. 3), temperature (650 oC) and pressure (1 bar). Finally, a CL-BIGCC process was proposed on the basis of complete tar cracking by the ex situ calcium looping process. A thermodynamic assessment of the CL-BIGCC process was also completed using Aspen Plus. To determine the performance of this proposed process, some key parameters such as compression ratio, air/fuel mass ratio, calcium-to-biomass ratio (Ca/B), steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B), carbonator temperature and calciner temperature were investigated. The results show that both power generation efficiency and gas turbine inlet temperature are sensitive to the aforementioned variants. It can be concluded that the most favorable values of compression ratio, air/fuel mass ratio, Ca/B, S/B, temperatures of carbonator and calciner are 5. 1, 15, 0. 53, 0. 17, 650 °C and 800 °C, respectively. With the above inputs, the net power generation efficiency of novel CL-BIGCC process was found to reach 25 %, which is higher than those of other parallel processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} cope with the growing {{complexity}} of critical real-time embedded systems, systems engineering has adopted a component-based design technique driven by requirements. Yet, such an approach raises several issues since it does not explicitly prescribe how system requirements can be decomposed on components nor how components contribute to the satisfaction of requirements. The envisioned solution is to design, with respect to each requirement and for each involved component, an abstract specification, tractable at each design step, that models how the component is concerned by the satisfaction of the requirement and that can be further refined toward a correct implementation. In this paper, we consider such specifications in the form of contracts. A contract for a component consists in a pair (assumption, guarantee) where the assumption models an abstract behavior of the component’s environment and the guarantee models an abstract behavior of the component given that the environment behaves according to the assumption. Therefore, contracts are a valuable asset for the correct design of systems, but also for mapping and tracing requirements to components, for tracing the evolution of requirements during design and, most importantly, for <b>compositional</b> verification of <b>requirements.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce contract-based reasoning for the design of critical real-time systems made of reactive components modeled with UML and/or SysML. We propose an extension of UML and SysML languages with a syntax and semantics for contracts and the refinement relations that they must satisfy. The semantics of components and contracts is formalized by a variant of timed input/output automata on top of which we build a formal contract-based theory. We prove that the contract-based theory is sound and can be applied for a relatively large class of SysML system models. Finally, we show on a case study extracted from the automated transfer vehicle ([URL] that our contract-based theory allows to verify requirement satisfaction for previously intractable models...|$|R

The specificity is present in S- and R-form LPS but absent in Re mutants of different enterobacterial genera. By the use of purified LPS and monospecific antibodies obtained by immunoabsorption, the specificity is differentiated from the known core specificities of the genus Salmonella and the lipid A specificity by aid of the passive hemolysis and passive hemolysis inhibition test. In Salmonella minnesota R-form LPS, the specificity may be cryptic (R 345, Rb 2 mutant) or partly exposed in the intact molecule (R 7, Rd 1 mutant). The specificity is either demasked or completely exposed after mild acid hydrolysis for a short time, whereas it is destroyed after prolonged hydrolysis.

These relate to <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements</b> and also the consistency of the deposit in chemical and physical terms. Limestone makes up about 10 % of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. The density and porosity of samples from the various locations vary from 2. 61 g/cm 3 to 2. 72 g/cm 3 and 2. 70 % to 3. 80 %. The Schmidt hammer rebound number of samples from Ewekoro quarry varies from 32. 1 to 33. 6. The uniaxial compressive strength of samples from Ewekoro quarry varies from 60. 5 MPa to 63. 5 MPa thereby classifying the rock as moderate to high strength. The point load strength index is obtained from the LAFARGE laboratory results and varies from 1. 23...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{asks whether}} the {{constrains}} imposed by complex functional programs and associated design guidance limit {{the ability to}} deploy design languages with entail their own precise <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements.</b> The Islip Federal Courthouse designed by Richard Meier under the General Services Administrations Design Excellence Program is chosen {{as a case study}} for two reasons: First, the functional constraints are explicitly documented, and their effects can be studied through a comparative analysis of recent Courthouses also built under the same GSA program; Second, Meiers language has received much scholarly attention, is well understood, and can be described with rigor. Both the functional requirements or constraints and the compositional principles associated with the design language are described as formal structures. The thesis shows that, in this instance, all functional constraints can be satisfied without compromising the elaboration of the language. Thus, the thesis contributes to our understanding of design logic and supports the idea that design intentions as well as design considerations can be reconstructed through a systematic study of the designed objectPh.

40|$|Water {{shortage}} {{has been}} a challenge in developing hydraulic fracturing in drought-affected areas such as South (Eagle Ford) and West (Permian Basin) Texas. Non-potable groundwater is a potential alternative to fresh water in making hydraulic fracture fluids. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the technical feasibility of using non-potable waters from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer to make hydraulic fracturing fluids in the Eagle Ford play. The first phase of the research is to compare fracture fluid <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements</b> with the water compositions of the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer by searching through literature, manufacturer?s, and service company?s specifications. The second phase of the research is to evaluate the performance of two different types of fracture fluids using synthetic saline water in the laboratory. Two major lab experiments will be conducted: (1) using a flow loop system to test for friction reducer performance in slickwater and (2) performing viscosity measurements and ?lipping gel? experiments for crosslinked gel performance. After completing literature reviews and laboratory evaluations, a conclusion of the technical feasibility of using non-potable groundwater to make these fracture fluids can be derived. This research will demonstrate the possibility of eliminating the use of fresh water by utilizing the available abundant non-potable groundwater from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in hydraulic fracturing...|$|E

The {{major part of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s population lives in more than 160 countries that are members of the Codex Alimentarius. The Codex Standard on Infant Formula was adopted in 1981 based on scientific knowledge available in the 1970 s and is currently being revised. As part of this process, the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses asked the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition to initiate a consultation process with the international scientific community to provide a proposal on nutrient levels in infant formulae, based on scientific analysis and taking into account existing scientific reports on the subject. ESPGHAN accepted the request and, in collaboration with its sister societies in the Federation of International Societies on Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, invited highly qualified experts in the area of infant nutrition to form an International Expert Group (IEG) to review the issues raised. The group arrived at recommendations on the <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements</b> for a global infant formula standard which are reported here...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimised}} uncertainty (OU) methodology {{is applied}} across {{a range of}} analyte¿commodity combinations. The commodities and respective analytes under investigation were chosen to encompass a range of input factors: measurement costs (sampling and analytical), sampling uncertainties, analytical uncertainties and potential consequence costs which may be incurred as a result of misclassification. Two types of misclassification are identified¿false compliance and false non-compliance. These terms can be used across a wide range of foodstuffs that have regulations requiring either minimum <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements,</b> maximum contaminant allowances or compositional specifications. The latter refers to foodstuffs with regulations that state an allowable tolerance around the compositional specification, i. e. the upper specification limit (USL) and the lower specification limit (LSL). The traditional OU methodology has been adapted so that it is applicable in these cases and has been successfully applied in practice. The Newton¿Raphson method has been used to determine the optimal uncertainty value for the two case studies in which analyte concentration is assessed against a `single threshold¿ regulatory requirement. This numerical method was shown to give a value of the optimal uncertainty that is practically identical to that given by the previously used method of visual inspection. The expectation of financial loss was reduced by an average of 65 % over the four commodities by the application of the OU methodology, showing the benefit of the method...|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend of}} {{peripheral}} nerve tissue engineering is {{the design of}} advanced nerve guidance channels (NGCs) acting as physical guidance for regeneration of nerves across lesions. NGCs should present multifunctional properties aiming to direct the sprouting of axons from the proximal nerve end, to concentrate growth factors secreted by the injured nerve ends, and to reduce the ingrowth of scar tissue into the injury site. A critical aspect {{in the design of}} NGCs is conferring them the ability to provide topographic, chemotactic and haptotactic cues that lead to functional nerve regeneration thus increasing the axon growth rate and avoiding or minimizing end-organ (e. g. muscle) atrophy. The present work reviews the recent state of the art in NGCs engineering and defines the external guide and internal fillers structural and <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements</b> that should be satisfied to improve nerve regeneration, {{especially in the case of}} large gaps (> 2 cm). Techniques for NGCs fabrication were described highlighting the innovative approaches direct to enhance the regeneration of axon stumps compared to current clinical treatments. Furthermore, the possibility to apply stem cells as internal cues to the NGCs was discussed focusing on scaffold properties necessary to ensure cell survival. Finally, the optimized features for NGCs design were summarized showing as multifunctional cues are needed to produce NGCs having improved results in clinic...|$|E
40|$|PSI +], the prion form of {{the yeast}} Sup 35 protein, results from the {{structural}} conversion of Sup 35 from a soluble form into an infectious amyloid form. The infectivity of prions is thought to result from chaperone-dependent fiber cleavage that breaks large prion fibers into smaller, inheritable propagons. Like the mammalian prion protein PrP, Sup 35 contains an oligopeptide repeat domain. Deletion analysis indicates that the oligopeptide repeat domain is critical for [PSI +] propagation, while a distinct region of the prion domain is responsible for prion nucleation. The PrP oligopeptide repeat domain can substitute for the Sup 35 oligopeptide repeat domain in supporting [PSI +] propagation, suggesting a common role for repeats in supporting prion maintenance. However, randomizing {{the order of the}} amino acids in the Sup 35 prion domain does not block prion formation or propagation, suggesting that amino acid composition is the primary determinant of Sup 35 ’s prion propensity. Thus, it is unclear what role the oligopeptide repeats play in [PSI +] propagation: the repeats could simply act as a non-specific spacer separating the prion nucleation domain {{from the rest of the}} protein; the repeats could contain specific compositional elements that promote prion propagation; or the repeats, while not essential for prion propagation, might explain some unique features of [PSI +]. Here, we test these three hypotheses and show that the ability of the Sup 35 and PrP repeats to support [PSI +] propagation stems from their amino acid composition, not their primary sequences.

40|$|The {{analytic}} {{component of}} my dissertation, "Symmetry and Narrative in Christopher Rouse's Trombone Concerto," illuminates {{the ways in}} which the concerto creates a musical metaphor of tragedy. To help frame my discussion of the Trombone Concerto's narrative elements (which include Rouse's self-referential quotation to his own Symphony No. 1 and a quotation of Leonard Bernstein's "Kaddish" Symphony No. 3) I draw on Northrop Frye's classification of tragedy as a narrative archetype. In order to illuminate the narrative functions of the two quotations and other motivic elements, I examine (with voice-leading and structural analysis) how the work's prevailing formal and harmonic symmetry provides the narrative context for its musical expectations. The tragedy of the concerto is realized when the harmonic expectation created by the Bernstein quotation is disrupted by the return of the composition's opening harmony and motivic gesture. Fulfilling the <b>compositional</b> <b>requirements,</b> I submit my 2002 work white space waiting. It is a slow, at times lyric, elegy for chamber orchestra. The harmonic and motivic focus of the piece revolves around five distinct pitches: C, C#, E, F#, and B. These pitches do not occur as a specific leit-motif, but they do recur at important moments (in various guises and orderings) as the composition unfolds. Because white space waiting has large structural repetitions, a key compositional element to the piece is the way in which the order of repetition among different sections becomes varied. By analogy, a three-part form (which this composition is not) might have the following structural rules: once ABC is presented as a particular order of events, A does not always lead to B and C can sometimes precede A in subsequent repetitions. Likewise, for white space waiting, a particular material that serves as the beginning of one section may appear as the ending of another section or as a section unto itself...|$|E
