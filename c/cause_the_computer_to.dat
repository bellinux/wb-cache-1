50|$|Input/output ports—including address {{lines and}} data lines—connected by long lines or {{external}} peripherals are the antennae that permit disturbances to have effects. Electromagnetic interference {{can lead to}} incorrect data and addresses on these lines. Strong fluctuations can <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> misread I/O registers or even stop communication with these ports. Electrostatic discharge can actually destroy ports or cause malfunctions.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} has its pitfalls. If the location specified is incorrect, this will <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> write {{the data to}} some {{other part of the}} program. The results of an error like this are unpredictable. In some cases, the incorrect data might overwrite memory used by the operating system. Computer crackers can take advantage of this to create viruses and malware.|$|E
5000|$|On a BBC Micro computer, the [...] key generates an {{interrupt}} {{which would}} normally cause a warm restart of the computer. A cold restart is triggered by typing [...] If a DFS ROM is installed, [...] will <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> search for and load a file called [...] on the floppy disk in drive 0. The latter two behaviours were inherited by {{the successor to}} Acorn MOS, RISC OS. These behaviours could be changed or exchanged in software, and were often used in rudimentary anti-piracy techniques.|$|E
50|$|A KDL is a {{term used}} on BeOS/Haiku and {{possibly}} other operating systems for a serious kernel error which <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> drop into <b>the</b> kernel debugger. KDL stands for Kernel Debug(ger) Land.|$|R

50|$|Grounding the {{cartridge}} port's /EXROM and/or /GAME lines will <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> automatically start up in C64 mode. This feature faithfully duplicates the C64's behavior when a cartridge (such as Simons' BASIC) is {{plugged into the}} port and asserts either of these lines but, unlike an actual C64, where the memory-map-changing action of these lines is implemented directly in hardware, the C128's Z80 firmware startup code polls these lines on power-up and then switches modes as necessary. C128 native-mode cartridges are recognized and started by the kernal polling defined locations in the memory map.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the older}} approach, the earlier PDP-1 has a {{hardware}} loader, such that an operator need only push the [...] "load" [...] switch to instruct the paper tape reader to load a program directly into core memory. The Data General Supernova used front panel switches to <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> automatically load instructions into memory from a device {{specified by the}} front panel's data switches, and then jump to loaded code; the Nova 800 and 1200 had a switch that loaded a program into main memory from a special read-only memory and jumped to it.|$|E
5000|$|Complex strings {{are harder}} to {{compress}}. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the codec used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including {{one in which the}} very small command [...] "X" [...] could <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> output a very complicated string like [...] "18995316"), any two Turing-complete languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the [...] "translation" [...] language - which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.|$|E
5000|$|Columbias {{aerodynamics}} at high Mach numbers during reentry {{were found}} to differ significantly in some respects from those estimated in pre-flight testing. A misprediction of {{the location of the}} center of pressure (due to using an ideal gas model instead of a real gas model) <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> have to extend the body flap by sixteen degrees rather than the expected eight or nine, and side-slip during the first bank reversal maneuver was twice as high as predicted.|$|R

5000|$|..... {{apparently}} {{caused by}} a combination of two factors. Improper operation of the Atlas airborne beacon equipment resulted in a loss of the rate signal from the vehicle for a prolonged period. The airborne beacon used for obtaining rate data was inoperative for four periods ranging from 1.5 to 61 seconds in duration. Additionally, the Mariner 1 Post Flight Review Board determined that the omission of a hyphen in coded <b>computer</b> instructions in <b>the</b> data-editing program allowed transmission of incorrect guidance signals to the spacecraft. During the periods the airborne beacon was inoperative the omission of the hyphen in <b>the</b> data-editing program <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> incorrectly accept <b>the</b> sweep frequency of the ground receiver as it sought the vehicle beacon signal and combined this data with the tracking data sent to the remaining guidance computation. This <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> swing automatically into a series of unnecessary course corrections with erroneous steering commands which finally threw the spacecraft off course.|$|R
50|$|Front panels {{were often}} used to debug {{programs}} when operating support was limited and most programs were run in stand-alone mode. Typically a front-panel switch could <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> single-step, that is run a single instruction and stop until the programmer pressed a button to execute the next instruction. An address stop could be set to stop a running program when it attempted to execute an instruction or access data at a specified address. The contents of registers and memory would be displayed in the front-panel lights. The programmer could read and alter register contents, change program instructions or data in memory or force a branch to another section of code.|$|E
5000|$|While a {{computer}} {{may be viewed}} as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn. One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running [...] "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed [...] "time-sharing" [...] since each program is allocated a [...] "slice" [...] of time in turn.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, a Pennsylvania woman filed a {{class action}} lawsuit against ZeoBIT LLC, {{claiming}} that the company's computer security program identifies problems that don't exist and generates false error messages to scare users into purchasing an upgrade. (see Holly Yencha, et al. v. ZeoBIT LLC, Case No. 2:13-cv-00578, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.) According to the complaint filed in US District court, [...] "Once installed, MacKeeper prompts the user to conduct a diagnostic scan", the MacKeeper class action lawsuit says. [...] "This scan purportedly detects errors {{that lead to the}} problems identified in ZeoBIT's marketing materials (i.e., performance issues, security and privacy threats)—problems that MacKeeper is supposedly designed to fix." [...] However, the ZeoBIT class action lawsuit alleges that after the diagnostic scan is completed, MacKeeper reports that it identified thousands of issues that <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> be in [...] "critical" [...] condition. While the trial version of MacKeeper purports to [...] "fix" [...] a limited number of the issues, customers are encouraged to purchase a full, registered version of the security software to fully repair the computer. Yencha alleges that neither the free trial nor the full versions of MacKeeper perform reliable diagnostic testing of the computer. [...] "Instead, ZeoBIT intentionally designed MacKeeper to invariably and ominously report that a user's Mac needs repair and is at-risk due to harmful (but fabricated) errors, privacy threats, and other computer problems, regardless of the computer's actual condition", the class action lawsuit alleges. The Class Action was settled in 2015 with no admission of wrong doing and customers were given refunds.|$|E

LGC programs are designated LUMINARY 1 E, and the associated EMPs are identified, with one exception, by a three-digit number beginning with 1. The exception is EMP 99. The EMPs vary in complexity from a simple flagbit setting to a long and intricate logical structure.
