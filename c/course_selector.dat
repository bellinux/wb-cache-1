2500|$|The cockpit {{area of the}} Islander had not {{suffered}} significant damage, {{and there}} was sufficient space for the pilot to survive. The pilot's seat belt and shoulder harness were found undamaged and unbuckled, with all stitching intact and the buckle still functional. There {{was no sign of}} impact on the controls or the instrument panel. Both fuel tanks contained a significant amount of fuel, which investigators calculated to be approximately 100 US gallons in each of the two wing tanks, and the fuel selector valve was in the correct position. Several instruments were damaged by the impact or by the pressure and corrosion from sitting on the seabed for six days. The aircraft's horizontal situation indicator, or HSI (a navigational instrument to direct the pilot to or from ground-based navigation aids, including the MAC VOR), was not set properly for the approach. The instrument's <b>course</b> <b>selector</b> was set to 103°, though the approach called for a setting of 115°. A second device on the HSI, called the [...] "heading bug", is a prominent marker for the pilot to set to the desired heading so that when the aircraft is flying that heading, the bug {{is at the top of}} the instrument's display and aligned with a vertical white line. The heading bug on the HSI was set to 157°. A second instrument situated below the HSI and capable of the same VOR navigation, called the omni bearing indicator (OBI), was also set incorrectly to 309° when it too should have been set to 115°.|$|E

50|$|On a {{conventional}} VOR indicator, left-right and to-from {{must be interpreted}} {{in the context of}} the selected course. When an HSI is tuned to a VOR station, left and right always mean left and right and TO/FROM is indicated by a simple triangular arrowhead pointing to the VOR. If the arrowhead points to the same side as the <b>course</b> <b>selector</b> arrow, it means TO, and if it points behind to the side opposite the <b>course</b> <b>selector,</b> it means FROM. The HSI illustrated here is a type designed for smaller airplanes and is the size of a standard 3&thinsp;¼-inch instrument. Airline and jet aircraft HSIs are larger and may include more display elements.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was (1) to examine the {{relationship}} between vocational indecision and identity formation, and the way of the mutual influence of them in university students, and (2) to weigh the difference of vocational indecision and identity formation in two groups which were distributed into whether students choose teacher-training course. A questionnaire was administered to 374 university students. It contained (a) a question-naire about vocational indecision which referred to Vocational Indecision Scale (Simoyama, 1986) and added items to, and (b) Multidimensional Ego Identity Scale (Tani, 2001). Result showed that (1) the relations between vocational indecision and identity formation was examined, moratorium and uneasiness about vocational decision affected identity formation, and indefiniteness of self-consciousness affected vocational indecision. In addition, (2) as for teacher-training <b>course</b> <b>selectors,</b> self-consciousness was clearer than not-selectors, and as for not-selectors, moratorium and uneasiness was higher than selectors. Furthermore, it was suggested that there were students who did not become one of vocational choices teaching profession, and did not reduce difficulty of vocational decision in students of teacher-training course...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing desire for methodological support for the {{development}} of knowledge based systems, and the KADS methodology is probably the most widely known methodology in Europe. However, KADS has been criticised for the overhead which it places on small and medium-sized KBS projects where the risks of KBS development becoming unmanageable are relatively low. This paper describes the use of "pragmatic KADS", an attempt to extract the most useful elements from the KADS methodology, {{in the development of the}} <b>course</b> <b>selector</b> KBS, which assists undergraduate students to choose courses which comply with University regulations and timetabling restrictions. This KBS was built in 6 man weeks. The paper describes the three major phases of a KBS project, giving a brief outline of the KADS approach to each of these stages, and then discusses the techniques which were actually used for <b>course</b> <b>selector.</b> It concludes with a recommendation of techniques for future small KBS projects. 1 Intr [...] ...|$|E
