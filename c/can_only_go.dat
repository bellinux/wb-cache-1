Skepta also drops the following immortal line in the first verse: 'I like tea, but I don't like crumpets.' A man after my own heart." ...|$|E

Though it is {{regarded}} as seminal to the growth of punk rock in England and elsewhere, Lydon has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that it influenced the Sex Pistols: [...] " [...] were all long-haired and of no interest to me. I didn't like their image, what they stood for, or anything about them"; [...] "They were hilarious but you <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> so far with 'duh-dur-dur-duh'. I've heard it. Next. Move on." [...] On 11 May, the Pistols began a four-week-long Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club. They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols' performance of 4 June at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.|$|E

Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly provided a favorable review, calling the track {{one of the}} best included on Bangerz and describing it as [...] "a merry rap-off with Britney". Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian opined that Spears' inclusion was [...] "a stroke of skewed inspiration", which contributed in making its parent album Cyrus' [...] "game-changer". Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle called the song an [...] "Auto-Tuned Euro-house jam" [...] that helped make the album both [...] "a message of empowerment" [...] and [...] "a straightforward party album". In contrast, Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club provided a more mixed review, saying that [...] "Cyrus absolutely cannot rap, as horrifyingly evidenced by her Kreayshawn-like turns" [...] highlighted in the track. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters cautioned that [...] "braggadocio <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> so far (especially with a song that features such a formless sense of melody)", and felt that Mike Will Made It has a [...] "horrid sense of how hooks work, leaving a slew of missed-attempts and mangled opportunities in his wake." ...|$|E

He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

2500|$|Short selling is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "negative income investment strategy" [...] because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called [...] "going long") has a very different risk profile from selling short. [...] Furthermore, a [...] "long's" [...] losses are limited because the price <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> down to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go. [...] On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. [...] For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, fellow wrestler Bruno Sammartino {{mentioned}} to McMahon that Albano, a mediocre wrestler who was nonetheless an entertaining speaker, {{might be better}} utilized as a manager. In professional wrestling, a manager might be tasked with behind-the-scenes efforts to help push forward a charge's career or handle his booking, but plays an equal or even greater role in the ring, speaking for his charge and helping rile up the crowd for or against him. Sammartino recalled: [...] "One day I said to Vince Sr., this guy [...] isn't the best wrestler, as a team, they [...] <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>go</b> so far. But he'd be a great mouthpiece for some guy. Lou has such a gift of gab that he can help out some people. As a wrestler, he just seemed limited. He was always the same. He was never looked upon by promoters as someone who could be anyone special. But as a manager, he shined. That was his calling." [...] Albano, realizing that wrestlers had only a limited lifespan in the ring, and still dealing with his old football injury, agreed. Although it was his decision to split up his ten-year tag team partnership with Altomare, the two remained very close until the latter's death in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Popper {{held that}} {{rationality}} is {{not restricted to}} the realm of empirical or scientific theories, but that it is merely a special case of the general method of criticism, the method of finding and eliminating contradictions in knowledge without ad-hoc-measures.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{has changed the}} investor’s perception of many assets. Not only has the sound view that real estate assets, as risky assets, <b>can</b> not <b>only</b> <b>go</b> up but also down, returned. We have also been reminded that assets based on interbank debt are only as ‘risk-free’ as the banks themselves. Recently many previously high-rated countries lost their triple-A ratings, leading to chain reactions for financial intermediaries. But has the financial landscape changed in a fundamental way? The issues above are neither new nor contrary to financial theory, only consequences of revised perceptions on risk. At a recent Hanken finance alumni seminar, the “buyand- hold” investment strategy was discussed. While there is some current support for outperforming investment funds, there is – as before – ample evidence that the market efficiency concept is still alive, indirectly supporting long-term strategies. These are not aimed at tactically beating the market, but at harvesting risk premia in the long term. Hanken has an extensive investment strategy, {{and we look forward}} to obtaining returns on our investments both in faculty skills and learning environments, as well as on our financial portfolio...|$|R
