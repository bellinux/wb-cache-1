25|$|The pre-match {{build up}} was {{dominated}} by the omission of Brazilian striker Ronaldo from the starting lineup only to be reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off. He managed to create the first open chance for Brazil in the 22nd minute, dribbling past defender Thuram before sending a <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> {{on the left side}} that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez struggled to hold onto. France however took the lead after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner which Zidane scored via a header. Three minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.|$|E
500|$|The colony {{was split}} over the actions {{and beliefs of}} Anne Hutchinson. [...] She had come {{with her husband and}} {{children}} to the colony in 1634, and began holding Bible sessions at home, gaining a wide audience and sharing her opinions that the colonial leaders labeled as Antinomianism, the view that existing laws and practices were not necessary for salvation. [...] Most of the older colonial leadership, including Dudley and Winthrop, espoused a more Legalist view. [...] Vane was a supporter of Hutchinson, as was at first the influential pastor John Cotton, and this was the faction that propelled Vane into the governor's seat in 1636. [...] Vane, however, immediately alienated some of the colonists by insisting on flying the English flag over Boston's fort. [...] The flag had recently been the subject of controversy, since its depiction of the Cross of St George was seen by many colonists as a symbol of papacy, and John Endecott had notoriously cut the <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> of the Salem militia's flag. [...] Vane's popularity went down further when he learned in December 1636 that there were issues in England requiring his presence, and he attempted to resign. [...] Although the court of assistants accepted his resignation, he withdrew it upon the request of the congregation of the Boston church.|$|E
