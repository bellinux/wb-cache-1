5|$|Since {{the late}} 1920s {{the tension between}} the air and naval {{services}} had declined. It arose briefly again in 1937 when the question of the FAA operational control arose. On this occasion the British Government sided with the Admiralty. Despite a spirited defence of its asset, once the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip had decided to transfer the arm, the Air Ministry was <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the matter rest. Any threat to the Air Ministry's existence had long since passed; budgetary constraint, and the reluctance to engage in another battle which would waste resources were also factors in the Air Ministry's decision not to contest the issue further. However, inter-service squabbling assured maritime aviation's stagnation, especially in shore-based elements. Virtually no co-operation existed in the area of research and development. In the case of Coastal Command, it continued to come third in the Air Ministry's list of priorities, after Fighter and Bomber Commands, well into the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1873, a United States {{military}} commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island {{in exchange for}} the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.|$|E

5|$|On October 16, 1890, a new Mint director, Edward O. Leech, took office. Leech, aged 38 at the time, {{had spent}} his career at the Bureau of the Mint, and was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter of redesign. He took the precaution of obtaining recommendations from Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition. Since most of the proposed artists were New York-based, Andrew Mason, superintendent of the New York Assay Office, was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees. Leading Mason's list of ten names was that of Saint-Gaudens. Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3, 1891; the following day, the Mint director announced the competition, open to the public, but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate. Besides Saint-Gaudens, artists asked to compete included Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, and Kenyon Cox. Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation, Leech offered a $500 prize to the winner, and no payments to anyone else. He sought new designs for {{both sides of the}} dollar, and for the obverses of the half dollar, quarter, and dimeâ€”Leech was <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue. By law, an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime.|$|E

The Byzantines initially seemed <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Tocco alone, as he too had open scores with Zaccaria, but war between the two powers was provoked in late 1426, when Tocco's forces seized the animals of Albanian herders during the latter's annual migration from the Byzantine-controlled central uplands to the plain of Elis.|$|E

500|$|Congress {{convened in}} December 1860, {{with several of}} the {{southern}} states already pledging to secede.

[...] The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid's voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince's love. [...] However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed, and the sea-witch is vanquished. [...] The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying.

After viewing the new footage, the studio was <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Craven continue as director. Weinstein, having seen the mask in action, was satisfied {{that it could be}} scary. The third and final act of the film, over forty minutes long, is set at a house party where Ghostface strikes. It was shot at a vacant property in Tomales over 21nights. The scene, labelled [...] "Scene 118", was considered the most difficult to shoot as it took place entirely in one location yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters.

[...] The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, [...] "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions".
