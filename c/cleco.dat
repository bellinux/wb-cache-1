It operates a regulated electric utility company, <b>Cleco</b> Power, that serves approximately 281,000 customers across Louisiana. <b>Cleco</b> also operates an unregulated wholesale energy business, <b>Cleco</b> Midstream, with approximately 775 megawatts of generating capacity.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2011, Williamson {{was named}} {{president}} and CEO of <b>Cleco</b> Corporation, a utility holding {{company based in}} Louisiana. [...] In his first year as CEO, he finalized the largest wholesale contract ever entered into for the <b>Cleco</b> Corporation by securing a 10-year contract with Dixie Electric Membership Corporation. [...] In December 2013, <b>Cleco</b> Corp. transitioned into the Midcontinent Independent System Operator Market, {{with the hope that}} this will provide additional growth opportunities. [...] Operationally, <b>Cleco</b> has improved its employee safety since Williamson joined the company. Comparing results from 2012 to 2011, <b>Cleco</b> reduced personal injuries by 33 percent and its avoidable accidents by 45 percent. Comparing results from 2012 to 2013, <b>Cleco</b> again improved its employee safety record by 20 percent and its avoidable accidents by 40 percent. [...] Also, since Williamson joined <b>Cleco,</b> the company has raised shareholder dividends five times for a total increase of sixty percent.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, Macquarie Group {{agreed to}} buy <b>Cleco</b> Corporation, {{including}} an assumption of $1.3 Billion in Debt. The sale then had to obtain regulatory approval [...] The proposed sale drew significant opposition from regulators at the Louisiana Public Service commission. Commissioner Cyle Holloway accused Williamson of selling <b>Cleco</b> to obtain a payout of $29 million and called for his resignation. Ultimately on March 29, 2016, the LPSC approved the sale.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cleco,</b> also spelled generically cleko, is a {{fastener}} {{developed by the}} Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Company. [...] Widely used in the manufacture and repair of aluminum-skinned aircraft, {{it is used to}} temporarily fasten sheets of material together, or to pieces such as stifeners, before the pieces are permanently joined. Clecos are installed in holes predrilled through the workpieces (usually holes intended for permanent fasteners installed later). They expand {{on the far side of}} the workpieces and then draw and clamp them together while maintaining the desired alignment and preventing distortion of the pieces. Clecos should fit snugly in their holes to prevent shifting of the workpieces and maintain the alignment of fastener holes which do not have Clecos in them. They are blind fasteners; so they can be installed in assemblies where the worker does not have access to the other side. If permanent fasteners are installed in <b>Cleco</b> holes, a <b>Cleco</b> will be removed when its hole is needed. If the workpieces are bonded or welded, then the <b>Cleco</b> holes may need to be filled later.|$|E

50|$|Frémaux {{started work}} {{when he was}} seven years of age selling {{newspapers}} while attending school. His first real job was in an accounting position with Acadia Iron Works in Crowley, Louisiana where he was employed {{for two and a}} half years. He then worked for the Morse Rice Mill and then the White Swan Rice Mill Corporation at Gueydon before moving to Alexandria in 1913. He worked briefly for Schwarzschild & Sulzberger Company of Louisiana, then became associated with L. A. Stafford Wholesale Grocer as an accountant for the Rapides grocery company. He filled the position of accountant and credit man for this company from 1913 until 1927. From 1915-1916 he successfully completed accounting courses from LaSalle Extension University's Department of Higher Accountancy. After his work at L. A. Stafford, he spent a year and a half with the Louisiana Public Utilities Company. In 1946 Louisiana Public Utilities Company eventually merged with Gulf Public Service Inc. In 1951 Gulf Public Service Inc. merged with Central Louisiana Electric Company, Inc., a company now known as <b>CLECO</b> Corporation. Frémaux played an important part in the business life of Alexandria. In 1931 he took over the Brown Hide Company in partnership with L. G. Stafford and became the sole owner in 1937. In 1942 he joined Alexandria Steam Laundry Company as Secretary-Treasurer. It was at this time that his son Wilton, the eventual sole owner of Alexandria Steam Laundry Company, served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{calendar}} year of 2012 the University of Louisiana at Lafayette {{in conjunction with}} <b>CLECO</b> Power LLC (<b>CLECO)</b> has constructed and commissioned a pilot scale parabolic trough solar thermal power plant {{for the first time}} in Louisiana. The large aperture trough (LAT) solar collectors were provided by Gossamer Space Frames and are coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power block provided by ElectraTherm, Inc. for study of the feasibility of cost-effective commercial scale solar thermal power production in Louisiana. Supported by <b>CLECO</b> and providing power to the existing <b>CLECO</b> grid, the implementation of state-of-the-industry collector frames, mirrors, trackers, and ORC power block is studied under various local weather conditions which present varied operating regimes from existing solar thermal installations. The solar collectors provide a design output of 650 kWth and preliminary actual performance data from the system level is presented. The optimal size, configuration and location for such a plant in the given solar resource region are being studied in conjunction with CLECO's search for optimal renewable energy solutions for the region. The pilot scale size of the facility and implementation of the simpler ORC allows remote operation of the facility and flexibility in operating parameters for optimization studies. The construction of the facility was supported by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the U. S. Department of Energy, and <b>CLECO.</b> The continued operation of the plant is supported by <b>CLECO</b> Power LLC and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette...|$|E
40|$|No âmbito das mudanças climáticas globais, a quantificação do estoque de carbono em povoamentos florestais tem recebido mais atenção, principalmente pelo fato das florestas exercerem um papel {{fundamental}} no equilíbrio do estoque de carbono global. Com o objetivo de contribuir para esse processo, a parte investigativa deste trabalho foi desenvolvida em duas etapas. A primeira etapa objetivou o ajuste de modelos alométricos para a estimativa do estoque de carbono presente na biomassa total (Ctotal), no lenho comercial (<b>Cleco)</b> e parte residual (Crds) (casca, folhas e galhos) em plantações de Eucalyptus spp. em nível de árvores, através de uma amostragem destrutivas de árvores, análise elementar do carbono em laboratório e medidas convencionais de inventário. A medição do diâmetro à altura do peito (DAP) e altura total das árvores em parcelas amostradas instaladas nos talhões onde as árvores foram coletadas para determinação direta de carbono também foi realizada. A segunda parte, consistiu na avaliação do uso da tecnologia LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) aerotransportada (Airborne LASER scanning) como uma alternativa eficiente e versátil para a estimativa do estoque de carbono total (Ctotal), no lenho comercial de toras (<b>Cleco)</b> e no resíduo da árvore (Crds) em nível de parcelas em plantações de Eucalyptus spp usando como base o estoque de carbono estimado na primeira fase. Os resultados obtidos encontram-se resumidos em dois artigos científicos. O primeiro artigo mostra que os modelos baseados no logaritmo do diâmetro à altura do peito (DAP) e da altura total da árvore (Ht) oferecem boas precisão e exatidão para estimar o estoque de carbono em nível de árvore. O segundo artigo, permitiu a determinação das melhores métricas LiDAR para o cálculo do teor total de carbono, tanto no carbono total, lenho comercial e nas partes residuais da árvore em nível de plantação. Esses resultados, bem como os indicadores estatísticos utilizados para avaliar a qualidade dos ajustes, são o cerne desta dissertação. In {{the context}} of global climate change, the quantification of the carbon content in forest plantations have received great attention. This is because vegetation {{play an important role}} in the global carbon budget. This master thesis was developed in two main parts. The first part was to adjust allometric equations for the estimation of the carbon content at a tree level. This was performed for the above ground section (Ctotal), in commercial logs (<b>Cleco)</b> and residuals (Crds) (e. g. bark, leaves and branches/twigs). The experiment was based on the destructive model of individual trees harvested in commercial plantations of Eucaliptus spp. The experiment encompasses both forest inventory and laboratory analyses procedures. Additionally, in-situ measurements such as the diameter at the breast height (DBH) and the total tree height were also performed. These sample plots were located in homogeneous forest units and close to the areas were the trees have been harvested. The second part of this master thesis was the evaluation of the airborne LiDAR technology as a tool for the retrieval of the above ground biomass (Ctotal), the carbon present in the commercial logs (<b>Cleco)</b> and residuals. This procedure was performed at the sample plots level. This procedure was based on the information provided in the first part. The results are presented as two scientific manuscripts. The first manuscript shows that allometric equations based on the log of the variables diameter at the breast height (DBH) and total tree height (Ht) were good predictors for the retrieval of the total carbon content at a tree level. The second manuscript allow the selection of the best LiDAR derived metrics for the retrieval of the total carbon content, either at above ground level, commercial logs and residual parts of the tree at a sample plots level. These results, as well as the statistical indicators for the adjustment of several statistical models is the core of this master thesis...|$|E
