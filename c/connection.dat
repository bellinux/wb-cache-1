5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - the <b>connection</b> on {{the regulator}} surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The <b>connection</b> is officially described as <b>connection</b> CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of <b>connection</b> is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of mathematical <b>connections</b> in learning and understanding mathematics is widely endorsed {{in both the}} research and the professional literature but teachers’ understanding of mathematical <b>connections</b> is underexplored. This study examined teachers’ conceptions of mathematical <b>connections</b> as knowledge at the interface of content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. I had individual conversations with nine secondary mathematics teachers in a three-stage process of progressively more structured interviews. Interviews focussed on teachers’ explicit <b>connections</b> related to particular mathematical topics, including a common task about quadratic functions and equations. I coded transcribed interviews according to a model I developed that identified five types of <b>connections</b> – different representations, implications, part-whole relationships, procedures, and instruction-oriented <b>connections.</b> Teachers’ thinking about <b>connections</b> was completely bound up with their thinking about teaching. They talked about real-world <b>connections</b> and <b>connections</b> to students’ prior knowledge, {{but only a few}} explicitly pointed out <b>connections</b> to their students. Most teachers were enthusiastic in their approval of considering mathematics as an interconnected web of concepts. While some teachers saw mathematical <b>connections</b> as integral to the way they taught, others were conflicted, and expressed a tension between teaching concepts and teaching algorithms. In the context of a structured task, teachers demonstrated knowledge of specific mathematical <b>connections</b> at a fine-grained level, but only with considerable effort. Teachers do have knowledge of specific mathematical <b>connections</b> but that knowledge is largely tacit. Teachers described specific mathematical <b>connections</b> in all five categories of the model. The model proved robust in classifying <b>connections</b> across a range of mathematical topics and grain-size. The mathematical <b>connections</b> that teachers articulated dealt with a narrow range of content, and favoured <b>connections</b> that were explicitly described in their textbooks. Nevertheless, teachers were also able to identify certain <b>connections</b> as crucial to students’ understanding of a topic. This systematic and detailed examination of the way that teachers view mathematical <b>connections</b> has laid a foundation for future research by demonstrating a methodology that facilitated the expression of teachers’ tacit knowledge, and by developing a model for classifying the explicit mathematical <b>connections</b> that teachers did express...|$|R

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet <b>connection</b> of the cylinder valve available for <b>connection</b> of a regulator. This means that the <b>connection</b> cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold <b>connection,</b> or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a <b>connection</b> which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
