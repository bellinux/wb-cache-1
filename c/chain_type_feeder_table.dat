40|$|Five {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>feeders</b> {{were designed}} and tested on goats {{to find out}} their effectiveness in reducing feed wastage and cost fabrication. Experiment was conducted at Agriculture Research Station (ARS) -Bandipur for two years. Tested feeders were hexagonal, rectangular, hay rack, chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu. Feeders were fabricated using iron bars and woods. They were tested with the adult goats for feed wastage and feed contamination. Experimental feeds were fodders twigs (Tanki), forage (Stylo, Napier), crop residue (straw from black bean) and commercial concentrate. <b>Chain</b> barrel <b>type</b> of <b>feeder</b> was also tested at farmer’s field at Baradi. Rectangular feeders have significantly lower (P< 0. 01) feed wastage (6. 61 % for fodders) compared to other tested feeders. The fabrication cost was NRs 3200, 1700, 700, 900, and 150 for hexagonal, rectangular; hay rack, chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu respectively. The rectangular feeder is suitable for goats feeding in Tarai and {{in the hills of}} Nepal. It has provision for feeding fodders, grasses, crop residues and concentrates together at the same time. <b>Chain</b> barrel <b>type</b> had comparatively higher wastage (10. 7 % for fodder) than the rectangular but was preferred by the farmers due to its low fabricating cost, portable in size, small space required and easy to handle. Therefore, the rectangular feeder is recommended for middle level farmers and chain barrel for small farmers who rear few goats...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the pair {{resonator}} generates an elliptic vibration for colony <b>type</b> <b>feeder.</b> The resonator consists of loop and leg part and vibrates respectively. Each part was actuated by bimorph type piezoelectric member. The resonator can generate elliptic motion at the center point of the upper member by the deflection of loop part and the bending of leg part. If the resonators that {{be put in a}} train are actuated at the same frequency, the colony <b>type</b> <b>feeder,</b> consits of the resonators, can feed objects on the upper surface of its train. The resonator needs rigid fixation on the bottom end for generating an elliptic vibration. However, there is no space to place the mechanism for fixing rigidity, because the feeder needs a narrow gap between each resonators. Therefore, we developed the pair resonator, stucked two resonators of each other on the bottom end. Since the pair resonators, be put in order, vibrate like a tuning fork without rigid fixation, the feeder can generate arbitrary elliptic vibration on all feeding surface without a long gap to each others. The trial one of the feeder can change locus of elliptic vibration with changing input phase...|$|R

40|$|Polyubiquitination can mediate several {{different}} biochemical functions, determined {{in part by}} which lysine of ubiquitin is used to link the polyubiquitin chain. Among the HECT domain ubiquitin ligases, some, such as human E 6 AP, preferentially catalyze the formation of K 48 -linked polyubiquitin chains, while others, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsp 5 and human Itch, preferentially catalyze the formation of K 63 -linked chains. The features of HECT E 3 s that determine their <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> specificities have not been identified. We show here that <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> specificity is a function solely of the Rsp 5 HECT domain, that {{the identity of the}} cooperating E 2 protein does not influence the <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> specificity, that single chains produced by Rsp 5 contain between 12 and 30 ubiquitin moieties, and that the determinants of <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> specificity are located within the last 60 amino acids of the C lobe of the HECT domain. Our results are also consistent with a simple sequential-addition mechanism for polyubiquitination by Rsp 5, rather than a mechanism involving the formation of either E 2 - or E 3 -linked polyubiquitin chain transfers...|$|R

40|$|We present {{examples}} of the both types of bursts and show their similarities and differences. Then for <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts a similar model as for drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in the DPS, the <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts can be generated by the fragmented magnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this new model of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts, we present an effect of merging of two plasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can also explain the "wavy" appearance of some <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts. Then we show that the <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts with the "wavy" appearance {{can be used for}} estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that differences of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts and DPSs are mainly owing to different regimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the quasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated regime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive flares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current sheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this magnetic reconnection.

40|$|Kappa and lambda-immunoglobulin light chains were {{measured}} {{to evaluate their}} usefulness for identifying monoclonal components in serum. Reference concentrations of the Ig light chains were evaluated by {{the analysis of the}} serum of 50 blood donors. Two hundred and fifty patients were selected for the presence of an M-component in their serum, which was detected by serum electrophoresis on agarose. The heavy and light chains of the M-component were identified by immunofixation. The concentrations of the three major immunoglobulin classes and of the two light <b>chain</b> <b>types</b> {{were measured}} by immunonephelometry. On the basis of the Ig kappa/lambda ratio alone, the Ig light <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> was correctly identified in 76 % of the M-components, and there were no misidentifications. By comparing the calculated concentrations of M-component and residual polyclonal Ig with the measured concentrations of the 3 major Ig classes, it was possible to identify the heavy <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> of 58 % of the M-components. These observations suggest that M-components can often be identified by the measurement of Ig light chains, a procedure involving less work and time than immunofixation. Moreover, the follow up of gammapathies could benefit from quantitative parameters evaluated from the Ig light chain concentrations: the concentration of the M-component, the ratio of M-component vs total Ig of the same class, and the ratio of M-component vs the sum of the 3 major Ig classes...|$|R

40|$|In our {{observation}} of leukemia and malignant lymphoma, many cases with slight {{changes in the}} IgM precipitation line ("abnormal IgM"), suggestive of small amounts of M-component, were detected by immunoelectrophoretic analysis. In these cases, determination of the light <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> seemed necessary for the diagnosis of M-component. However, typing was difficult by conventional methods because of the low amount of M-component. In this report, a new method for typing of the light chain of the IgM type of M-component, using FITC labelled anti-light chain specific antisera, is discussed. With this method, the light <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> of M-component {{was determined by the}} difference in strength of FITC specific fluorescence between the reaction of FITC conjugated anti-kappa and -lambda chain sera at the abnormal parts of the immune precipitation, which were prepared by agar immunoelectrophoresis using antiheavy chain specific antisera. This method was applied to 11 cases with usual M-component, in which the light <b>chain</b> <b>types</b> were determined only by agar immunoelectrophoresis utilizing anti-light chain specific antisera or by combination with gel-filtration. In all cases, the types were determined in agreement with previous methods. Compared with cellulose acetate electrophoresis or agar immunoelectrophoresis using anti-heavy chain specific antisera, the immunofluorescent method had a sensitivity similar to agar immunoelectrophoresis and more sensitive than cellulose acetate electrophoresis. This method was applied to 7 cases with "abnormal IgM" which were found in leukemia and malignant lymphoma. In all 7 cases, differences in the strength of FITC specific fluorescence at the abnormal parts of the precipitation line were observed. As a result, 1 case with both kappa and lambda types, 2 cases with the kappa type and 4 cases with the lambda type of M-component were found. These results indicate the usefulness of this method for light <b>chain</b> <b>typing</b> of low amounts of M-component with IgM type. It seems likely that the slight changes in the IgM precipitation line, detected in leukemia and malignant lymphoma, result from M-components...|$|R
