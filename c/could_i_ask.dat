2500|$|Carleton is {{probably}} most famously {{known for a}} comment made to the incoming federal Australian Labor Party leader Bob Hawke in 1983: [...] "Mr. Hawke, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you whether {{you feel a little}} embarrassed tonight at the blood that's on your hands?" [...] which was a reference to the alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticised Carleton for his [...] "damned impertinence".|$|E
6000|$|... 'That sounds mysteriously awful; <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> what {{nautical}} torture [...] "bowsing jibs" [...] is?' asked Mrs Jo, {{in a tone}} of deep interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Carrie, {{with the}} spot of colour {{once more in}} her cheek. [...] "He would never tell me, and how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> him? It is a hateful subject--why should you mention it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A mingled {{feeling of}} fear and veneration kept me silent, till I {{perceived}} by his look that he expected and encouraged me to speak; and collecting my spirits as well as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him wherefore he had thought proper to appear, and why to me rather than to any other person? ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. When {{you said}} you <b>could</b> come round <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{somebody}} <b>I</b> want you very much to meet.|$|R
60|$|Why should Helena {{write to}} Philip at all--and {{especially}} without mentioning it to me? Here was a riddle {{which was more}} than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> guess. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Selina to help me. She might at least have tried, I thought; but she looked uneasy, and made excuses.|$|R
6000|$|Tyrrel {{turned to}} him without one word of reproach. [...] "Well, we're no rivals now," [...] he answered, generously. [...] "Even if she would have me--even if she loved me well--how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> her to take--her brother's murderer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The tears brimmed {{over from}} Nigel's eyes, and he wrung the gaunt hand {{extended}} from the bath. [...] "By Saint Paul! what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> better in the world? I fear to leave her, for she has none other to care for her. But if it can in any way be arranged--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not easy, but I {{could not}} find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf a {{prospect}} of one to gif you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited in}} the stillness and loneliness, until it grew nearly dark. The servant brought in candles. Why <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not <b>ask</b> him whether my father and Clara had come home yet? Was I faltering in my {{resolution}} already? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{read the}} future, Preacher. If <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> should <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to expound to me your {{religion}} which probably {{is of no}} more worth than a score of others I have studied, just because it tells of the future? If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> read the future I should be a god instead of only an earth-lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{suddenly}} {{threw her}} arms round his neck, kissed him passionately, and whispered, with her lips at his ear: [...] "Oh, Ernest, forgive me! <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> you to marry me for my money if I had not taken refuge in a disguise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I ask you, miss, {{where you}} got that lovely hat?" [...] she said. [...] "From Madame Elise? Why, of course, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask!</b> I assure you it is most charmingly becoming. I shall try to get one like it, but I'm afraid I can't go beyond six guineas. And your shawl--a Cashmere, I see. A present from her Majesty, no doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forget nothing, my Prince," [...] she replied. [...] "You {{have spoken}} no word of love to me, nor do I expect that you ever shall; but nothing can prevent me loving you. I {{would not take}} the place of Dejah Thoris. My {{greatest}} ambition is to serve you, my Prince, for ever as your slave. No greater boon <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> no greater honour could I crave, no greater happiness could I hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moreover," [...] added Cicely, [...] "if I {{did try to}} turn {{my words}} with the Scottish or French ring, I wot that {{the sight of the}} Queen's Majesty and my anxiety would drive out from me all I should strive to remember, and I should falter and utter mere folly; and if she saw I was deceiving her, there would be no hope at all. Nay, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> God Almighty to bless my doing with a lie in my mouth?" ...|$|E
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>ask</b> {{her what}} she meant.|$|R
60|$|I looked up. Eunice's {{eyes were}} fixed on a shrubbery, at some little {{distance}} from us, which closed the view of the garden on that side. I noticed that she was trembling. Nothing to alarm her was visible that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> discover. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> what she had seen to startle her. She pointed to the shrubbery.|$|R
6000|$|... 'True, true,' said Bray, biting his nails, and plainly {{very ill}} at ease. 'I couldn't do {{anything}} better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> Now, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you, Nickleby, {{as a man}} of the world; could I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how was I {{to direct}} myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly {{direction}} to reach my destination, {{but the sun}} was my only guide. I {{did not know the}} names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.|$|E
6000|$|Here I {{started up}} with more alacrity than I have {{displayed}} for some years; but sat down while my aunt added, laying her hand upon my sleeve, [...] "The chapel has been long considered as common ground, my dear, and used for a pinfold, and what objection can we have to the man for employing what is his own to his own profit? Besides, I did speak to him, and he very readily and civilly promised that if he found bones or monuments, they should be carefully respected and reinstated; and what more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask?</b> So, the first stone they found bore the name of Margaret Bothwell, 1585, and I have caused it to be laid carefully aside, as I think it betokens death, and having served my namesake two hundred years, it has just been cast up in time to do me the same good turn. My house has been long put in order, {{as far as the}} small earthly concerns require it; but who shall say that their account with, Heaven is sufficiently revised?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] Beric said. [...] "I {{love your}} {{daughter}} Aemilia, but I have never spoken {{of it to}} you for two reasons. In the first place I shall not be for some years of {{the age at which}} we Britons marry, and in the second I am but a captive. At present I stand high in the favour of Nero, but that favour may fail me at any day, and my life at the palace is becoming unbearable; but besides, it is impossible that this orgy of crime and debauchery can continue. The vengeance of heaven cannot be much longer delayed. The legions in the provinces are utterly discontented and well nigh mutinous, and even if Rome continues to support Nero the time cannot be far off when the legions proclaim either Galba, or Vespasian, or some other general, as emperor, and then the downfall of Nero must come. How then <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you for the hand of Aemilia, a maiden of noble family, when the future is all so dark and troubled and my own lot so uncertain? ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, the Southam {{newspaper}} chain {{closed its}} paper in Winnipeg, {{the same day}} as the Thomson newspaper chain closed its newspaper in Ottawa. The closures gave Thomson newspapers a monopoly in Winnipeg and Southam newspapers a monopoly in Ottawa. Eventually, the two newspapers were prosecuted under the federal Combines Investigation Act offences governing mergers and monopolistic conduct. [...] Claude Thomson was retained to carry on the prosecution on behalf of the Crown. After a lengthy trial, the two newspaper chains were acquitted. Thomson later commented about the case: [...] "I presented every piece of evidence <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> every tough question <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of. The judge believed the defence. That's what our system of justice is about and I have no complaints." ...|$|R
60|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> {{him what}} he meant, he looked up {{suddenly}} at me, with deep sadness on his usually nonchalant face.|$|R
60|$|I gave {{my brother}} into your hands, and {{told you that}} if he died a brave man's death <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> for no more.|$|R

50|$|Lewis Thomas {{published}} multiple books {{throughout his}} career, the first being The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher. In 1979 he published The Medusa and the Snail: More Notes of a Biology Watcher. He wrote an autobiographical book in 1983, The Youngest Science: Notes of a Medicine-Watcher. Also in 1983 he published Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler’s Ninth Symphony followed by <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> You Something? in 1985. In 1990 and 1992 Thomas published Et Cetera Et Cetera: Notes of a Word Watcher and The Fragile Species respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In February '81 1881 I {{began to}} put in shape a scheme {{conceived}} twenty-five years before that date 1856, namely to give orchestral concerts of the best attainable character and quality at a price which should admit any one and everyone likely to care for such things - my hope was to draw in by degrees a larger and less-educated class of society - I had meant to engage an orchestra and a conductor to be at my beck and call because this only <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> and get practice sufficient in amount and quality to reach the playing of the great German orchestras.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{there some}} {{official}} expression we <b>could</b> use?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> vastly {{taken by the}} fancy. [...] "'Sold {{for the benefit of}} the underwriters: for further particulars apply to J. Pinkerton, Montana Block, S.F.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything that {{a father}} <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> <b>I</b> would do," [...] exclaimed Ellen, eagerly. [...] "Where is my father? and when shall I meet him?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> him perhaps {{about how}} to {{pronounce}} that voglio. But then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.|$|R
50|$|Amongst some 500 contenders {{there were}} celebrities like Natalya Fateyeva and Anastasiya Vertinskaya, but the {{director}} chose the 19-year-old amateur for the leading role. According to Gaidai, Varley has won {{him with her}} ingénue charms, but she later opined that one particular episode might {{have proved to be}} the decisive one....So I came to the Mosfilm. Read a script fragment. Did the donkey episode. Then Gaidai asks me, somewhat diffidently: 'And now, Natasha, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you perhaps to undress - down to a swimming suit?' 'Sure', I said, and did. Everybody just went: 'Aahh!' It is now that for actresses undressing is business-as-usual. In those years the Soviet cinema, as well as the Soviet people, were so much more shy. But for me the swimming-suit was a kind of circus uniform, I got used to it. So we shoot the episode with a swimming-suit, and I think it was the one that made all the difference.|$|E
5000|$|BPI Entertainment News Wire {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "Say No More is a sonically adventurous album on which Walker offers more pop tendencies than usual, without sacrificing his country pedigree. He sings with passion throughout, especially on piano-based ballads like Real the soulful You Deliver Me, and the conversational <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> You Not to Dance. This is a diverse package that effectively demonstrates Walker's versatility and maturity." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of AllMusic described the album by writing [...] "Say No More {{is a fine}} album from an artist who has proved his staying power time and time again." [...] Jerry Sharpe of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave the album a four star rating and wrote, [...] "All told, it's a nice mixture masterfully performed. Consider this a [...] "don't miss" [...] disc for Walker fans." [...] Mike Clark of Country Standard Time gave the album a negative review by writing, [...] "Neither pop nor country, this is easily Walker's least satisfying CD. [...] "Say No More" [...] indeed." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{joined the}} Association of Christian Librarians (ACL) in 1997, {{at a time}} when I was seeking God’s will for my future in library work. The {{previous}} year, I had been unexpectedly let go after eight years in a Bible college library position due to downsizing, and my heart was still in academic library work. I found ACL to be far more than a facilitator for library job searching. This association is foremost a Christian one, and provided something far better than networking just to advance oneself. Attending my first ACL conference in 1997, I was greatly encouraged by a group of library colleagues with whom I could share my heart and search for God’s will, with the assurance that they understood and would pray for me. Here I could be developed and challenged both professionally and spiritually – what more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> for? I determined to attend the ACL conference every year...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my lord; {{you gave}} me no {{instructions}} about it, and I thought it better {{to wait until the}} morning, when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} as briefly as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>asked</b> {{him if he}} could explain the matter. He shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> him, {{or about}} hell either, {{he was gone}} like a whiff of smoke from a rifle mouth in a strong wind." ...|$|R
