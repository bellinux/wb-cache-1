40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{achieving}} im-proved ego-vehicle global localization with respect to an ap-proaching intersection, {{which is based on}} the alignment of visual landmarks perceived by the on-board visual system, with the infor-mation from a proposed extended digital map (EDM). The visual system relies on a stereovision system that provides a detailed 3 -D description of the environment, including road landmark infor-mation (lateral lane delimiters, painted traffic signs, <b>curbs,</b> and <b>stop</b> lines) and dynamic environment information (other vehicles). An EDM is proposed, which enriches the standard map informa-tion with {{a detailed description of the}} intersection required for current lane identification, landmark alignment, and ego-vehicle accurate global localization. A novel approach for lane-delimiter classification, which is necessary for the lane identification, is also presented. An original solution for identifying the current lane, combining visual and map information with the help of a Bayesian network (BN), is proposed. Extensive experiments have been performed, and the results are evaluated with a Global Navigation Satellite System of high accuracy (2 cm). The achieved global localization accuracy is of submeter level, depending on the performance of the stereovision system.

5000|$|Montreal {{also used}} trolley buses. [...] Introduced in 1937, {{they were seen}} as having some {{advantages}} over streetcars. Unlike streetcars, they could load and unload at the <b>curb</b> instead of <b>stopping</b> traffic {{in the middle of}} the street. They were still dependent on overhead trolley wires. Their passenger capacity was also less than the larger streetcars. Although all streetcar lines had been converted to buses by 1959, traffic congestion had not improved as hoped. City traffic engineers came up with a plan to turn many major streets into one-way thoroughfares, which would affect several trolley bus routes. Trolley buses by this time had fallen out of favour with transit companies, and new North American equipment was harder to get. Montreal's Brill trolley buses were quickly approaching the end of their economic service lives. As a result of all of these factors, the Commission decided to end trolley bus service in 1966. Two of the four trolley bus routes were converted to diesel buses in April while the last two trolley bus routes were converted to diesel buses in June. Montreal's new subway, the Metro, would open just four months later in October.|$|R
50|$|From {{the start}} Omar Khalifa {{went to the}} lead, shadowed by Joseph Chesire with Sebastian Coe marking their lead in third. The first lap was 58.85. 500 metres into the race, Steve Scott| ran around the leaders to take the point, Coe and José Manuel Abascal {{stringing}} out the field. They passed the 800 metre mark in a slightly faster 1:56.81. Abascal continued to speed up, passing Coe then Scott between 900 and 1000. Scott began to fall back through the field as Steve Cram and Steve Ovett moved forward. At the bell the three Brits were 2-4, three Steves were 3-5. Midway through the penultimate turn, suddenly the world record holder Ovett stepped inside of the <b>curb</b> and <b>stopped.</b> With 300 to go in an even faster 2:53.21, Abascal, Coe and Cram had three metres on Cheshire who accelerated around Scott and Jim Spivey as Ovett dropped out. Cram accelerated down the back stretch, Coe reacting, with about 220 metres to go, the leaders were three abreast across the track. Coe emerged ahead into the turn with Cram sprinting in his wake. Coe looked around to see where his competition was then focused on holding his position. Coming off the turn, Coe checked again, seeing Cram still a metre behind him, breaking away from Abascal. Coe sprinted away from Cram, checking again mid-straightaway to be sure his work was accomplished, then extending his lead to 6 metres by the finish. Cram had another 7 metres on Abascal {{who was able to}} hold off Cheshire for bronze. Coe became the only man to successfully defend his title in the 1500 metres. Coe turned back toward the press area and angrily showed them his index finger on both hands, indicating he was number one again. Still fresh after running less than 2 seconds off the world record, Coe jogged back still looking at that area of the stands and again showing his number one finger.|$|R
40|$|The studied {{bump stop}} is a hollow folded {{polyurethane}} cylinder mounted around the damper rod in a MacPherson front wheel suspension, restricting the upward wheel displacement. It {{is a critical}} component for durability since the force transfer through the bump stop determines the vertical peak loads to the car body. In extreme load cases as driving over a <b>curb,</b> the bump <b>stop</b> is subjected to impact loading giving a highly non-linear behavior. The nominal compressive strain can reach 80 % under a load duration of milliseconds. The presented model is based on impact test data. By performing drop tests, high load levels and short contact times can be combined, giving a realistic loading in view of road load data from the test track. The main objective of the model is to predict the behavior at high strain rates and strain levels. The strongly progressive behavior, shown in a stress strain diagram, {{both in terms of}} the loading curve and the hysteresis, requires special attention. The main feature of the model is a linear viscoelastic Maxwell model combined with a function that takes care of the strongly progressive behavior. This function, obtained from a dynamic loading curve in the impact test, is multiplied with the Maxwell stress, giving the sought progressive behavior. The model is accurate, simple to obtain from the impact test, computationally efficient, and easy to implement in commercial multi-body-system codes as ADAMS and can thus successfully be used in the product development of new cars...|$|R
40|$|Sildenafil citrate (SC) is {{an active}} {{ingredient}} found in Viagra, a prescribed pharmaceutical drug to cure erectile dysfunction (ED). Consuming SC will increase the {{blood flow to the}} body which lead to an increase in blood pressure to men with ED for normal sexual life. Sildenafil abuse was reported by media for those who are not diagnosed with ED but taking SC for the sexual affect that it brings. SC legally is forbidden, if consumed without prescription might cause headache, vision disturbances, heart problem and even failure, thus might lead to death. Camouflaged by the pleasure and masking the threat it brings, Sildenafil can be taken on its own or spiked in beverages, candy, herbal supplement and coffee powder. Various steps have been taken by the authorities to <b>curb</b> and hopefully <b>stop</b> this problem. In order to avoid prosecution, black-marketeers have introduced Sildenafil analogues. Thus, the authorities have been forced to introduce new procedures to detect these drugs in consumer products. Hence this study is focused on the detection of Sildenafil and Sildenafil analogues in coffee powder using LC-MSMS. The chemical fragmentation elucidation was done by interpreting the chromatograms obtained. Fifteen samples of confiscated coffee powders were obtained from local market; six were found to contain either Sildenafil alone or mixture of Sildenafil analogues namely Yohimbine; 8. 53 ppm (S 5), Sildenafil; 0. 51 ppm (S 7), Homosildenafil; 5. 87 ppm (S 7), Thiosildenafil; 1. 01 ppm (S 7) Thiodymethyl sildenafil; 131. 77 ppm (S 7), ThiohomoSildenafil; 0. 0064 ppm (S 9), Tadalafil; 21. 03 ppm (S 11), Norneosildenafil; 0. 02 ppm (S 11), Carbodenafil; 0. 1 ppm (S 12), NDesmethylacetildenafil; 4. 7 ppm (S 12) and Hydroxythiohomosildenafil; 0. 02 ppm (S 13).

40|$|In {{what may}} be the first {{application}} of visual preference methods to transit facili-ties, transit users, nonusers, and professionals were (a) shown a series of paired slides of bus stops, (b) asked to choose the stop from each pair at which they would prefer to wait, and (c) asked to rate each stop chosen as a place to wait. Subsequent analyses showed that transit-oriented design features most affecting both choices and ratings are (a) a bus shelter at the stop, (b) trees along the street leading to the stop, (c) a vertical <b>curb</b> at the <b>stop,</b> (d) the setback of the stop from the street edge, and (e) a continuous sidewalk leading to the stop. Such surveys may help transit planners choose the best transit stop locations and devote limited financial resources to the most promising transit stop amenities. In dealing with the aesthetic or visual qualities of design, designers tend to impose their own taste instead of user (client) preferences or, at best, tend to make naive assumptions about user preferences. —Im (1984) At least 50 transit-oriented design (TOD) manuals are now available across North America, with many more to come. In Florida alone, two transit operators have developed TOD guidelines. Most manuals contain guidelines related to site planning, pedestrian access, road geometrics, and bus stop siting and design (see Figure 1). The stated purpose is to make devel-opers, public officials, and highway agencies more sensitive to transit needs. Yet of the TOD manuals reviewed here, not one appears to have asked transit users or potential users about their needs and wants. Instead, newer manuals borrow from older ones, and all rely heavily on assumptions (whether naive or not) about user preferences. A TOD manual prepared for the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is an excep-tion, being based in part on a visual preference survey (VPS™) of transit users, nonusers, and (for the sake of comparison) transit professionals. This may be the first-ever application of VPS ™ methodology to transit facilities. 1 What follows is (a) a brief introduction to VPS™, (b) a description of our survey and results, and (c) a discussion of implications for transit-oriented design...|$|R
40|$|A tirosinase desempenha um papel {{fundamental}} na biossíntese de melanina e, portanto, a sua inibição paralisa o processo como um todo ou pode, até mesmo, minimizar algumas de suas consequências. Assim, manchas de pele e hiper-pigmentação cutânea causadas pela formação excessiva ou acúmulo de melanina podem ser tratadas com formulações contendo substâncias e ou extratos com ação anti-tirosinásica. No presente trabalho, foram coletadas espécies de treze plantas nativas ou exóticas do cerrado brasileiro e, em seguida, obtidos dezoito extratos etanólicos secos. Esses extratos foram caracterizados e estudados via espectroscopia no ultravioleta-visível (UV-Vis), cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE), espectroscopia no infravermelho (IV), ressonância magnética nuclear de 1 H e de 13 C e espectrometria de massas, empregando-se, quando possível, padrões comerciais ou anteriormente isolados. A atividade anti-tirosinásica das amostras foi avaliada através de bioensaios in vitro, monitorando-se, via espectroscopia no UV-Vis, a formação do dopacromo, um dos intermediários do processo de síntese, e em testes com discos de batata, uma das fontes naturais de tirosinase. Ao final, esses resultados foram comparados com aqueles advindos do emprego do ácido kójico, um agente anti-tirosinásico amplamente estudado e empregado. Os resultados dos dois tipos de ensaio foram, em geral, coincidentes e indicaram que os inibidores de tirosinase mais ativos seriam, em ordem decrescente, os extratos obtidos a partir de Brosimum gaudichaudii, Schinus terebinthifolius, Stryphnodendron adstringens, Kalanchoe pinnata e Rosa alba. Por último, formulações cosméticas foram preparadas a partir dos três extratos mais ativos e, então, avaliadas quanto à atividade anti-tirosinásica através dos métodos mencionados acima. Os resultados demonstraram que as formulações apresentaram atividades inibitórias similares às determinadas para os extratos concentrados e, dessa maneira, o que consistiu uma indicação de que esses extratos e respectivas formulações têm propriedades para serem utilizadas no tratamento de manchas de peleThe enzyme tyrosinase {{is crucial}} on the biosynthesis of the melanin. Consequently, its inhibition stops the synthesis and even can minimize {{some of its}} consequences. For instance, {{it is well known}} that lotions and creams containing those inhibitors are employed to reduce or eliminated some skins blemishes, originated by the excessive formation or accumulation of the melanin. The first step of the present work was the collection of 13 different species, native or not, of the Cerrado (brazilian savannah). It was followed by obtention and characterization of 18 extracts. That characterization was achieved employing various chromatographic and spectrometric methods and, when possible, by comparison with commercial or isolated standards. The inhibition proprieties themselves were evaluated in vitro (through the effect of the extracts on the formation of the dopachrome, an intermediary of the melaninas biosynthesis process, via UV-Vis spectroscopy) or their ability to <b>curb</b> or <b>stop</b> the spontaneous darkening in discs of potato, a natural and rich source of tyrosinase. Those results were compared with those achieved by the use of the kojic acid, a widely studied and known inhibitor of the melanins formation. In general, both methods indicated that the most actives extracts were, in decrescent order, those obtained from Brosimum gaudichaudii, Schinus terebinthifolius, Stryphnodendron adstringens, Kalanchoe pinnata and Rosa alba. Finally, it was evaluated the inhibition activity of some lotions, made from those three most active extracts, and the results were remarkable coincident with those recorded for the crude extracts, which indicated their anti-tyrosinase power and their potential use on products utilized on the healing of some skins blemishe...|$|R
40|$|L'autor remarca la {{important}} participació que els jueus tingueren en la vida econòmica de Catalunya: en el préstec de diners, en la percepció d'impostos i també en el comerç nacional i internacional. La participació dels jueus en el comerç marítim amb la Mediterrània oriental demostra que les activitats econòmiques dels jueus només foren possible quan les autoritats i la societat cristianes els ho permeteren perquè els afavoria. L'article ofereix una imatge general de l'expansió político-comercial catalana vers la Mediterrània oriental, el paper que els jueus van fer en el desenvolupament del comerç marítim, els mètodes comercials utilitzats en el segle XIII, les rutes marítimes que anaven cap al Pròxim Orient, les dificultats amb què topaven els jueus, els sistemes de finançament i de capitalització, els impostos, els productes amb què es comerciejava i els diferents tipus de societats mercantils que existien en aquells temps. The Jews of Barcelona in {{the maritime}} {{trade with the}} eastern Mediterranean The 13 th century was {{the golden age of}} the Jews who lived in the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. Apart from their far-reaching philosopical and scientific creations, which are not the aim of the present article, {{it should be pointed out}} that their involvement in the economic life of those kingdoms was of vast proportions. In lending, in tax-collecting, in home and foreign trade, Jews showed a strength that aroused wonderment and envy. Towards the close of the 13 th century, a remarkable increase in these activities took place in Catalonia, sparking off the opposition of the new urban class that dominated Barcelona's Consell de Cent (Council of One Hundred). Even though some steps were taken with the intention of hindering the activities of Jewish lenders, their activity continued for a long time, as it was beneficial to a society that was always in need of ready money. Jews met with success wherever and whenever the Christian authorities and society required their services and made a profit on their trading activities. Moreover, they contributed a huge revenue to the royal treasury. Further proof that the economic activities of the Jews were only possible if Christian authorities and societies allowed it is found in the participation of the Jews in the maritime trade with the eastern Mediterranean. Towards the end of the 13 th and the beginning of the 14 th century, Catalan Jewish merchants tried to win a share in the trade that was being carried out between Barcelona and Alexandria. This trade developed as the Crown of Catalonia-Aragon expanded its political and commercial power throughout the Mediterranean basin. The attempt had a fair chance of being successful. Jews had the capital, the contacts, the skill and the will to succeed in their endeavours. But the enterprise failed. One of the main obstacles that the Jewish initiative ran up against was the emergence of a new middle class that viewed maritime trade as an allimportant way to develop and to strengthen its social status. This early middle class, typical of Catalonia, was probably an essential factor in the creation of the infrastructure necessary for the growth of commercial activities that ran parallel to, or rather sustained, the political expansion of the country. Catalan merchants established commercial settlements (called Consulats de mar, Sea Consulates') in the main towns of the Levant, both in Moslem and in Christian countries  Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Syria, and even the Crimean Peninsula. There was no reason why they should share with the Jews the profit they expected to make on that ramified trade [...] . Town councils repeatedly voiced their hostility towards these Jewish merchants, because they were seen as dangerous competitors. The article gives an overall picture of the Catalan politico-commercial expansion towards the eastern Mediterranean, the role played by the Jews in the development of that maritime trade, the commercial methods prevailing in the 13 th century, the sea-lanes to the Levant, the difficulties put in the way of the Jews in this sector, the financing and capitalization systems, the taxes, the goods that were the object of the trade, and the various kinds of trading companies that were in existence at that time. From this chapter of the history of the Jews in the Crown of Catalonia- Aragon, one cannot but draw a conclusion of considerable historical scope. In spite of the fact that Jews were always harshly criticized as moneylenders and subjected to many restrictions, they filled a gap and therefore their activities never stopped. Christians did not succeed in creating a substitute for the Jewish moneylender. However, what happened in the maritime trade with Moslem countries was quite the contrary. Thanks to the skills of the Jews and to their being wellconnected merchants, their participation in such a trade was initially possible. But as soon as Christians became aware of the possibility of holding sway over that trade without having to resort to the Jewish merchants and without having to share the profits with them, that participation was not only <b>curbed</b> but <b>stopped</b> altogether...|$|R
