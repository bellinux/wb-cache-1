5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the <b>crew</b> <b>spaces,</b> a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Each {{ship had}} {{a crew of}} 854{{officers}} and enlisted men. The enlisted <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> were located forward in the upper deck, and were cramped and unhygienic. The cabins for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime I wore two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime I was also repainted dark gray at this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 in the now fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around <b>crew</b> <b>spaces,</b> some {{of it on the}} lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload to a range of 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|E

25|$|After {{the newest}} and most {{powerful}} state-owned icebreakers, Voima and Jääkarhu, were handed over to Soviet Union as war reparations, Finland was left with four old steam-powered icebreakers and the small diesel-electric Sisu, which had been rejected due to the extensive damage it had sustained in the war. The newest steam-powered icebreaker, Tarmo, was almost 40 years old and along with the others long overdue for replacement — even the largest Finnish icebreakers were not wide and powerful enough to assist the biggest post-war cargo ships. There was also a severe shortage of coal and occasionally the Finnish icebreakers {{had to rely on}} firewood. The steam-powered icebreakers were completely overhauled for the last time in 1951–1952 when they finally received modern navigation equipment — even as late as 1952 some had neither gyrocompass, sonar nor radar — and their <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> were rebuilt to modern standards. There were talks about converting the furnaces of Sampo from coal to oil, but it was not deemed necessary as the old icebreaker was due to decommissioning in the near future.|$|E
500|$|Pietro Micca was [...] long between perpendiculars {{and had a}} beam of [...] and {{an average}} draft of [...] She {{displaced}} [...] normally and [...] at full load. The ship had an iron-built hull with a flat bottom. Much of the ship's internal space was reserved for propulsion system and coal storage, with only the forward quarter reserved for <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> and stores. The ship had a very minimalist superstructure, with a small conning tower and a single pole mast. She had a crew of 73officers and men.|$|E
500|$|During further {{development}} of the design, serious flaws became apparent, including the weakness of both the main battery and anti-aircraft armament, {{as well as the}} insufficiently thick armor protection. The stepped arrangement of the deck armor wasted space and was therefore impractical. The layout of the propulsion system was also problematic; both turbines were in the same engine room, and therefore each were vulnerable to disabling if the other was damaged. Their <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> were also insufficient for long-range cruises. As a result, the design was heavily modified for the last two ships of the class, Q and R. The initial design borrowed on contemporary British and French ships, the [...] and , respectively. The distribution of the M-class ships' side armor was the most obvious influence of the Southampton-class design.|$|E

500|$|In 1867, {{the high}} command {{decided to send}} Delphin back to the Mediterranean. She {{was sent to the}} Königliche Werft in Danzig for a {{reconstruction}} that would make the vessel more suitable for an extended overseas assignment. This included replacing old or damaged hull timbers, installing a new deck, and rebuilding the <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> to make them more habitable. On 1 May 1868, Delphin was finally recommissioned for her assignment, but conflicts in the Reichstag (Diet of the Realm) over budgets forced the navy to cancel Delphins deployment to save money. Accordingly, she was placed out of service temporarily. In August, Delphin was recommissioned and on the 21st, began the voyage to the Mediterranean. While en route, damage to her engine forced her to stop in Algiers for repairs. She finally reached Constantinople on 17 October, and on 24 October she steamed to the mouth of the Danube at Sulina. She steamed about [...] upstream to the town of Giurgiu before returning to Constantinople. She made a similar trip up the Danube in 1869, and also stopped in Varna, Bulgaria {{on the way back to}} Constantinople.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{traditional}} zeppelin {{designs were}} {{composed of a}} series of main rings, made from a single reinforced girder, with unreinforced rings, which provided shape but not structural strength, in the spaces in between. Arnstein's proposal for the two new ships was to have the main rings composed of a pair of rings, connected by supports that formed triangles all around the circumference of the ring. These [...] "deep rings", made of duraluminum, were spaced further apart than the single rings used in zeppelins, and were believed to offer greater strength, for which the US Navy was prepared to accept that the framework was heavier than in similar German produced airships. Similarly, rather than using a single structural keel along the underside of the hull, Arnstein's design had three, triangular shaped keels - one {{along the top of the}} airship, which was used to provide access to the valves of the ship's gas cells, and two more placed at 45 degree angles on each side of the bottom of the hull, which supported the engine compartments and <b>crew</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although hydrogen-oxygen {{propulsion}} {{had been}} considered for submarines as early as World War I, the concept was not very successful until recently due to fire and explosion concerns.

The gases are piped through the pressure hull to the fuel cells as needed to generate electricity, but {{at any given time}} there is only a very small amount of gas present in the <b>crew</b> <b>space.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The first warship to {{use only}} fuel oil {{propulsion}} was the Royal Navy's torpedo boat destroyer , after experiments in 1904, although the obsolescence of coal as a fuel in British warships was delayed by its availability. Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the [...] of 1909.In spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the <b>crew</b> <b>spaces,</b> extending 1/4 to 1/3 the way along the hull. Aft of the <b>crew</b> <b>spaces</b> was as much engine space as the technology of the time would allow: several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, {{in front of the}} bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.|$|E
