60|$|There {{are three}} hundred and fifty-five stories about Suleiman-bin-Daoud; {{but this is not}} one of them. It is not the story of the Lapwing who found the Water; or the Hoopoe who shaded Suleimanbin-Daoud from the heat. It is not the story of the Glass Pavement, or the Ruby with the <b>Crooked</b> <b>Hole,</b> or the Gold Bars of Balkis. It {{is the story of the}} Butterfly that Stamped.|$|E
60|$|Charlie Ward. [Taking the {{can from}} him and looking at it.] If every can had a little hole in the middle like that, I think you {{would be able to}} mend them; but there's the {{straight}} hole, and the <b>crooked</b> <b>hole,</b> the round hole, the square hole, the angle hole, the bottom hole, the top hole, the side leak, the open leak, the leak-all-round, but I won't frighten you with the names of them all, only this I will say, that, when you've learned to mend all the leakages in a can--and that should take you a year--you're only in {{the first day of the}} tinker's week.|$|E

5000|$|Oil well {{shooting}} {{is a method}} of increasing production of an oil well by removing obstructions to drilling, straightening <b>crooked</b> <b>holes,</b> preventing water penetration, and/or increase the flow of oil.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic-set packers use fluid {{pressure}} {{to drive the}} cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set {{by the use of}} either entrapped pressure or a mechanical lock. They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or <b>crooked</b> <b>holes</b> where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension.|$|R
40|$|Much {{emphasis}} {{today is}} {{being placed on}} the drilling and completion of steam wells. Success or failure depends greatly on the cementing process, which requires not only the selection of competent and durable materials but also the complete understanding of placement techniques. Immobile muds, <b>crooked</b> <b>holes,</b> lost circulation, poor centralization, and the inability to move pipe {{are some of the}} major areas which contribute to good or bad results. This presentation covers a ''state of the art'' of the various techniques, materials, and equipment being used in cementing steam wells in the US and Mexico...|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{experience}} with rotary drilling had established several principles for {{the configuration of}} drilling equipment down hole ("Bottom Hole Assembly" [...] or [...] "BHA") that would be prone to [...] "drilling crooked hole" [...] (i.e., initial accidental deviations from the vertical would be increased). Counter-experience had also given early directional drillers ("DD's") principles of BHA design and drilling practice that would help bring a <b>crooked</b> <b>hole</b> nearer the vertical.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, Pew and {{his brother}} J. Howard, who had become Sun Oilâ€™s {{president}} in 1912, expanded into the shipbuilding business. Joseph Jr. ran the Sun Shipbuilding Company, which would become the largest private shipyard and biggest producer of oil tankers in America by World War II. As visionary of the company, it was Pew who was behind the effort to develop gasoline without tetraethyl lead, creating Blue Sunoco. He also developed a gyroscopic instrument with high-speed camera and timing device for preventing the drilling of <b>crooked</b> <b>holes</b> in oil wells. Receiving a patent in 1926, the device helped the company drill deeper oil wells.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no need}} of any caution this time, and no fear {{of being}} {{detained}} by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp's boy. The place was entirely deserted, and looked as dusty and dingy {{as if it had}} been so for months. A rusty padlock was fastened on the door, ends of discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the half-opened upper windows, and the <b>crooked</b> <b>holes</b> cut in the closed shutters below, were black with the darkness of the inside. Some of the glass in the window he had so often watched, had been broken in the rough hurry of the morning, and that room looked more deserted and dull than any. A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the door-steps; some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house; others were clustered about the keyhole, watching half in jest and half in earnest for 'the ghost,' which an hour's gloom, added to the mystery that hung about the late inhabitants, had already raised. Standing all alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street, the house looked a picture of cold desolation; and Kit, who remembered the cheerful fire that used to burn there on a winter's night and the no less cheerful laugh that made the small room ring, turned quite mournfully away.|$|R
5000|$|Labyrinthine Maleperduys {{is full of}} <b>holes,</b> <b>crooked</b> and long, with {{multiple}} exits, which Reynard can open and shut to elude his enemies. Full of secret chambers and passageways, in William Caxton's The Historie of Reynart the Foxe (1485) the castle of Maleperduys is described as the [...] "best and the fastest burgh that Reynard had. There lay he in when he had need, and was in any dread or fear." [...] (Chapter VII, How Bruin the Bear was sped of Reynard the Fox). Over time, the word came to mean a place of refuge.|$|R
