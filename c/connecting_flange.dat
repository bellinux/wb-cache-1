40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} a helicopter, which met with a Cat-I accident on November 27, 2008, were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that all the four bolts connecting the tail drive shaft (TDS) with the main gearbox (MGB) have sheared off. Fractographic study confirmed that these bolts have failed by fatigue. Examination also discovered {{that three of the}} four bolts used were not as per the design specification. It was found that these bolts were longer than that of the recommended one, and they are actually meant for use with the intermediate gearbox (IGB) casing. There was mix-up of bolts and the wrong ones were used in this particular case. The shank length of the IGB bolts is such that it does not provide enough threads to allow tightening of the assembly joint at the TDS <b>connecting</b> <b>flange.</b> Since the bolts cannot travel beyond the first thread from the shank, the reading on the torque wrench during this assembly would have been a wrong indication of tightness of the joint. In fact, the joint was either loose or did not have required pretension. Because of this, there was slip between the TDS <b>connecting</b> <b>flange</b> and the main rotor brake disc. This had resulted in excessive load on the fourth bolt which appears to have failed first by fatigue. Following this, the unequal load distribution in conjunction with the looseness in the joint was responsible for the fatigue failure of the remaining three bolts. Hence, the primary failure in the system was the failure of the bolts at the TDS <b>connecting</b> <b>flange</b> – main rotor brake disc assembly. The other damages seen on other components/structures of the helicopter are secondary in nature and would have occurred subsequent to the primary failure or during crash onto the ground. It is, therefore, stated that the mix-up of the bolts during assembly of the TDS was responsible for the failure and the accident...|$|E

A coal mine mobile refuge chamber {{is a new}} class of device for miners those who are unable to escape after an accident which can provide basic survival conditions. In this paper, in order to study the propagation law of an underground methane/air mixture explosive wave, and check the failure mode of a coal mine mobile refuge chamber, a full-sized underground tunnel model and a refuge chamber model have been established in ANSYS/LS-DYNA (LSTC, R 7. 0. 0, Livermore, CA, USA, 2014). The simulation results show that the reflected wave pressure on the front surface of the refuge chamber was about twice as high than the incident wave. The pressure on various locations of the chamber was also analyzed. When the peak pressure of the explosive shockwave reached 0. 64 MPa, the maximum displacement and stress occur {{at the center of the}} front door and the joint of stiffeners and the front plate, respectively.

50|$|The <b>connecting</b> <b>flanges</b> on column {{sections}} were not fully faced, the spigot {{which should have}} given positive location of one section in the next was not always present, and the bolts did not fill the holes. Consequently, the only thing resisting one flange's sliding over another was the pinching-down action of the bolts. This was reduced as boltheads and nuts were unfaced - some nuts had burrs up to 0.05 inch on them (he produced an example). This prevented any holding-down power, since if such a nut were used at a column base joint and the burr subsequently crushed, there would be over 2 inches free play {{at the top of}} the column. The nuts used were abnormally short and thin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Corrugated web girders {{emerged in}} the past two decades. Their main {{advantages}} consists in the possibility to use slender webs avoiding the risk of premature local buckling. Consequently, higher moment capacity might be obtained increasing the beam depth with really thin webs, which are stiffened by the corrugations. Increased interest for this solution was observed for the main frames of single-storey steel buildings and steel bridges. A new solution was proposed at the Politehnica University of Timisoara, in which the beam is composed by a web of trapezoidal steel sheet and flanges of back-to-back lipped channel steel sections. This solution uses self-drilling screws for <b>connecting</b> <b>flanges</b> to the web and to ensure the continuity of the web as seam fasteners. Starting from this new technological solution the paper extends and investigates the use of spot welding as seam fastening to build the web, in order to increase the degree of automation of fabrication.

The present study aims to per-form a structural {{analysis of a}} 100 kW wind turbine tower, taking into consideration several structural integrity requirements. Among many requirements of {{the design of a}} tower, the analysis of free vibration has been performed. Details of static and elas-tic stability analysis are also presented.

Flanges are adopted to strengthen the tower modules end, having also the purpose of attaching the modules extremities by pre stressed bolts. Contact elements were adopted for the joint model. A distinct tool provided by ANSYS is the possibility of applying a preload to the connecting bolts.

40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of flanged cross section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively <b>connected</b> <b>flanges</b> also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the vertical shear resistance of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (header units, shear connectors, and wire ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested. The vertical shear capacity of the interface at the flange-web intersection was assessed in each case and compared to predicted code capacities. Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach. It showed that both the size of the specimen as well as the boundary and applied loading conditions on the flanges can significantly influence the observed vertical shear resistance of the interfaces of specimens with the same bonding pattern. Using the results of the numerical investigation, the critical parameters for a test to determine the vertical shear capacity of brick masonry nonrectangular cross sections are assessed and the governing parameters for a suitable shear test suggested...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCold-formed steel (CFS) {{sections}} {{are commonly}} used in modern roof construction. Most purlin members are of thin-walled open cross section. They are usually subjected to roof loading at the top flange in either an upward or a downward direction. The load application points, where the sheeting/purlin connections are located, are often eccentric to the shear centre, and thus inevitably generate a torsional moment that will induce twisting and/or warping deformations in addition to bending deflection. This type of complexity associated with the loading conditions will be exacerbated by the occurrence of single- or mixed-mode buckling (e. g. overall, distortional and local buckling) due to compression flanges tending to move sideways. The connections between purlin and roof sheeting provide a restraining effect on purlin members by preventing such lateral and twisting movements, and thus have a beneficial effect on their load-carrying capacity. In design practice, this effect {{should be taken into}} account from a design-efficiency perspective. To this end, a key step is to quantify the rotational restraint stiffness by using an engineering-orientated model. This paper firstly reports a series of torsional restraint tests (F-tests) for both sigma and zed sections. Two loading directions were examined by adjusting the purlin fixing direction. The rotational angles between the <b>connected</b> <b>flange</b> and sheeting were recorded at each loading step, from which the moment–rotation curves were produced and presented for each test case. A linear relationship has been observed for the moment–rotation relationship from all test specimens. Secondly, a hand calculation model for calculating the rotational stiffness at each connection was developed. In that model, the rotation was deemed to be primarily caused by the localised deformation of the roof sheeting and the distortional deformation of the purlin flange. The rotation caused by the separation of connection was found to be negligible. The model was validated by the experimental test results and an example was presented to demonstrate the application of the model proposed. The rotational stiffness calculated by this model can be used to evaluate the input parameters required for numerical modelling of purlin–sheeting interaction...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{flexural}} behaviour of railway bridges {{is influenced by}} the torsional behaviour, and the flexural response tends to be amplified as the flexural natural frequency (the 1 st vibrational mode) and torsional frequency (the 2 nd vibrational mode) are adjoining. To avoid this phenomenon, the installation of concrete segment panels was considered for the reinforcement of torsional stiffness by <b>connecting</b> bottom <b>flanges</b> between girders. This alternative can increase the torsional stiffness by providing the restraint in torsional vibration and reduce the influence of torsional behaviour on the amplification of flexural responses.

The excitation tests on a full-size bridge specimen with 30 m span length were conducted with respect to the installation length of concrete panels up to 7 m from each ends. The results show that the installation of concrete segment panel augments the torsional frequency up to 22 % while the flexural frequency keeps its original value.
