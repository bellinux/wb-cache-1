50|$|The Galerie Devambez {{was opened}} at 43, Boulevard Malesherbes in 1897. Initially {{it was used}} purely as a sales outlet for {{original}} prints - lithographs, etchings, drypoints - and facsimile prints of watercolours. During the First World War the Galerie {{was used by the}} Louvre (which was closed) to sell prints created by the <b>Chalcographie</b> du Louvre.|$|E

DC and AC electrochemical techniques {{have been used to}} characterize the effect of the inhibitors and to quantify the aggressiveness of the cleaning treatment. Citric acid removes copper surface tarnish. BTA and AMT inhibitors are similarly efficient. De-aeration reduces corrosion to levels similar to those obtained with inhibitors. © VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1996. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
