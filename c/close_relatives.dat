5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E

5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} recovers Corythoraptor {{as member}} of the family Oviraptoridae, forming a clade with Huanansaurus as its <b>closest</b> <b>relative,</b> and Citipati, an unnamed taxon, Rinchenia and Oviraptor as the other <b>closest</b> <b>relatives</b> of that clade by declining degrees in the mentioned order.|$|R
50|$|The fool's {{mushroom}} (Amanita verna), {{also known}} as the spring destroying angel or death angel, is a <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of Amanita phalloides, the death cap, {{and a member of the}} mushroom genus Amanita. Amanita verna, like its <b>close</b> <b>relative,</b> belongs to the subfamily Phalloideae.|$|R

5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, {{but also that}} of <b>close</b> <b>relatives.</b> In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of the East German armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> in West Germany. They were all subjected to close scrutiny to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast again showed Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri to be each other's <b>closest</b> <b>relatives,</b> {{but they were}} only distantly related to {{other members of the}} series Banksia.

5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of the cougar.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and Risso's dolphin.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> that normally infect owls.|$|E

5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their <b>close</b> <b>relatives,</b> the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{suspected}} of being toxic {{as is the case}} in most of its <b>close</b> <b>relatives.</b> Handling the mushroom is harmless; poisoning occurs only on ingestion. A case of poisoning that may have been caused by S.thiersii has been reported from the state of Puebla, Mexico. The outcome of this case is unknown. Symptoms of poisoning in humans include reversible impairment of kidney function. A Meixner test revealed that amatoxins were not involved in the Puebla case.|$|E
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} and tarsiers {{may have}} {{evolved from the}} specialized folds of tissue below that tongue, as seen in some marsupials, such as sugar gliders, {{as well as some}} embryonic eutherian mammals, such as whales and dogs. It is also found in some adult eutherian mammals, such as treeshrews, colugos, and rodents. The sublingua of treeshrews, <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of primates, is less developed than in lemuriforms and tarsiers, but suggests a phylogenetic relationship.|$|E
50|$|But {{this does}} not mean that Eremopezus was a <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of either secretarybird or shoebill. Even though modern {{taxonomy}} generally tries to avoid using monotypic families as much as possible, its placement in a distinct family Eremopezidae may well be warranted, as its <b>closest</b> <b>relatives</b> remain completely obscure.|$|R
50|$|The Crustacea were {{generally}} considered the <b>closest</b> <b>relatives</b> of the Uniramia, and sometimes these were united as Mandibulata. However, the competing hypothesis — that Crustacea and Hexapoda form a monophyletic group, the Pancrustacea, {{to which the}} Myriapoda are the <b>closest</b> <b>relatives</b> — has support from molecular and fossil evidence.|$|R

5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its <b>close</b> <b>relatives.</b>|$|E
5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus. More distantly related is the contemporaneous Apatosaurus, {{which is still}} considered a diplodocid, although not a diplodocine, {{as it is a}} member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E
