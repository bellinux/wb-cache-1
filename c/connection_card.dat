40|$|Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is an {{evolving}} multi-hop, ubiquitous and high speed networking technology. In this thesis, {{we proposed a}} secure micropayment scheme for network access in WMNs. The main motivation is that the operators are not considered as fully trusted entities in our scheme; the clients control their balance with their operators. In this way, none of the system entities can behave dishonestly {{about the amount of}} services provided and obtained. Our proposed payment scheme is a prepaid one. The users obtain connection cards for getting service. <b>Connection</b> <b>card</b> issuer, which is a trusted third party, generates the connection cards. Each <b>connection</b> <b>card</b> includes tokens. These tokens are generated as a hash chain which is obtained by hashing an initial value (IV) several times. Hash functions are one way and irreversible cryptographic functions. The tokens are consumed backwards. Therefore, it is not feasible to generate unused tokens from an already used token. This property is the main enabler for the security of our scheme. We have conducted simulations for performance evaluation of the proposed scheme. Our results show that in a network with 300 clients, the average authentication completion time becomes less than 1 second even if all the clients send their connection request at the same time...|$|E
40|$|The data {{collected}} for my study {{came from the}} CWU’s University Recreation Center. There {{are two types of}} {{data collected}}; one came from the electronic scans created each time a student uses their <b>connection</b> <b>card</b> to enter the facility, and the other source came from what the staff calls the “rounds sheets”. This data is collected by student employees of the facility as they go throughout the facility and count the number of patrons using the various sections of the gym. My project analyzes the collected data to find any trends that would be of use to the staff of the facility as well as all potential and current patrons. This project is important for many reasons. For students it is important because it would assist them in knowing which times are the busiest [...] this may help them not to feel rushed in their work out or to make a class before it fills up. The results are important to the professional staff of the facility because if we can accurately forecast when throughout the day the gym is the busiest, then they can make sure to have an appropriate amount of workers on duty and not waste payroll or be understaffed and leaving patrons unattended. Finally, the results may be of interest to faculty members who are members of the URC, as the information can let them come in and use the facilities and not have to try and work out around a mass of college students...|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the microprocessor, a digital computer consisted of multiple printed circuit boards in a card-cage case with components connected by a backplane, a set of interconnected sockets. In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete <b>connections</b> between <b>card</b> connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane.

40|$|Most laptops {{and many}} desktop PCs include a {{provision}} for wireless connectivity (commonly called “Wi-Fi”). However, computers rarely have a provision {{for more than}} one WiFi connection at a time, because its own card must serve each connection. Some laptops allow for two WiFi cards, but even that may be problematic because of the physical size and shape of the cards, and because of their need for power. We propose a software-based approach, called vWLAN TM. This software solution virtualizes multiple Wi-Fi cards within the same computer. That is, it creates two or more software WiFi cards in computer memory so that multiple Wi-Fi connections can take place essentially at the same time. This means that the same computer simultaneously can be connected to multiple access points, to different WiFi networks, to multiple nodes in an ad hoc network, or to multiple Wi-Fi channels on the same network. The expanded functionality opens up new applications that previously have been unaddressable by computers equipped with only a single Wi-Fi <b>connection.</b> <b>cards</b> solve a number of important problems with existing wireless network. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II, presents some application that motivated us towards building vWLAN.

The objective {{here is to}} evaluate {{the performance of the}} system by Markov chain models. We focus on Work-In-Process (WIP) and lost rate of the system. In general it is hard to obtain an exact analytical result of the system. Thus some approximation methods are proposed here. A simple situation is considered and formulated as a Markov chain process. Then we derive the steady-state probability of the system for two and three machines case, and obtain the WIP and the lost rate. The formulations proposed show the <b>connection</b> of control <b>cards</b> and performance measures. The method can extended to the case of multiple machines.
