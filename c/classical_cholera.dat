50|$|An El Tor {{infection}} is relatively mild, {{or at least}} rarely fatal, and patients are asymptomatic for about a week. El Tor is able {{to survive in the}} body longer than <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> vibrios. This characteristic allows carriers to infect a greater population of people. In fact, V. cholerae biotype eltor can be isolated from water sources {{in the absence of an}} outbreak of cases. In extreme cases, persons can become long-term carriers; for example, Cholera Dolores, who tested vibrio positive nine years after her primary infection. El Tor is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. This route is the consequence of infected persons defecating near a water source, and uninfected persons consuming contaminated water. In addition, the bacteria can be transmitted by consuming uncooked food fertilized with human feces. Treatment of a cholera infection consists of replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes by intravenous or oral solutions, and by antibiotics. El Tor outbreaks can be prevented by better standards of sanitation, filtering and boiling water, thoroughly cooking seafood, and washing vegetables and fruits before consumption.|$|E

40|$|Pandemic V. cholerae strains in the O 1 {{serogroup}} have 2 biotypes: {{classical and}} El Tor. The classical biotype {{strains of the}} sixth pandemic, which encode the classical type cholera toxin (CT), {{have been replaced by}} El Tor biotype strains of the seventh pandemic. The prototype El Tor strains that produce biotype-specific cholera toxin are being replaced by atypical El Tor variants that harbor <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin. Atypical El Tor strains are categorized into 2 groups, Wave 2 and Wave 3 strains, based on genomic variations and the CTX phage that they harbor. Whole-genome analysis of V. cholerae strains in the seventh cholera pandemic has demonstrated gradual changes in the genome of prototype and atypical El Tor strains, indicating that atypical strains arose from the prototype strains by replacing the CTX phages. We examined the molecular mechanisms that effected the emergence of El Tor strains with <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin-carrying phage. We isolated an intermediary V. cholerae strain that carried two different CTX phages that encode El Tor and <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin, respectively. We show here that the intermediary strain can be converted into various Wave 2 strains and can act as the source of the novel mosaic CTX phages.

40|$|The genus Vibrio is most {{extensively}} characterized and {{medically important}} group {{within the family}} vibrionaceae {{and it is the}} most important member of the genus is Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. Depending on the presence of O 1 antigen they are devided in to two serogroups or serovars: O 1 and non-O 1. Further O 1 is devided in to two biotypes: classical and El Tor. These two biotypes are divided into three serotypes that are inaba, ogawa and hikojima. The virulence properties vary from strain to strain (serogroups). The current study was undertaken aiming at exploring the factors involved with virulence in V. <b>cholerae</b> <b>classical</b> in comparison to V. cholerae O 139 by various studies like bacterial antibiotic susceptibility test, haemolytic activity, In silico approach to find potential virulence factors and gene expression pattern study for OMPU & OMPT (Semi quantitative study).

We have analyzed 23 <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> isolates collected between 1961 and 1968, 14 classical isolates collected between 1982 and 1992 from the capital city, Dhaka, and 6 <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> isolates collected from two southern districts of Bangladesh and studied restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns of rRNA genes (ribotypes) to investigate the clonal relationships among the isolates. Southern blots of total DNA digested with restriction enzyme BamHI, BglI, EcoRI, HindIII, or PstI were probed, using a cloned Escherichia coli rRNA operon. While restriction enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, and PstI failed to differentiate the isolates {{on the basis of}} ribotyping, BglI and HindIII produced digestion patterns that allowed differentiation. Ribotyping the isolates with BglI and HindIII revealed five different clones (ribotypes IA, IB, IIA, IC, and IIC) of classical vibrios in Bangladesh. Strains belonging to ribotypes IA and IB were isolated in Dhaka before 1968, and one ribotype (IA) was again isolated between 1982 and 1992. Ribotype IIA was isolated in 1988 and 1989, when both clones (IA and IIA) of classical vibrios coexisted with the EI Tor vibrios. Isolates belonging to ribotypes IC and IIC were collected in the southern districts of Bangladesh and were clearly different from those collected in Dhaka between 1968 and 1992 by ribotyping analysis with BglI.

40|$|The species Vibrio cholerae {{contains}} {{within it}} two biotypes, classical and El Tor, {{both of which}} are motile. Phenotypic expression of motility was unaffected by type of growth medium, salt concentration, pH, or temperature of incubation. However, seven strains of <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> produced spontaneous nonmotile mutants at an unusually high frequency (ca. 10 (- 4)), while no mutants were detected for all three El Tor strains examined. No revertants of these nonmotile mutants were detected. Four independent mutants of classical strain 395 were isolated to characterize this phenomenon. By transmission electron microscopy, one of the nonmotile mutants was found to be flagellated, while the other three were found to be aflagellate. Chromosomal DNA from the mutants and parental wild-type strain 395 was examined by Southern blot analysis with, as probes, V. cholerae mutagenic prophages VcA- 1 and VcA- 2 and six cloned motility gene regions isolated from transposon insertion motility mutants of strains 395 and N 16961 (El Tor, Inaba). The parental wild-type strain and all of the mutants exhibited the same pattern of bands when probed with VcA- 1 and VcA- 2 DNAs. Four of the cloned motility gene regions hybridized to the same fragments of DNA in both the wild-type and mutant isolates. However, two other probes detected a new fragment for a single aflagellate mutant. The observations that spontaneous nonmotile mutants occurred at a high frequency and that these mutants did not revert at a detectable frequency suggested that a genetic event is involved.

40|$|Plasmid profiles, the {{location}} of cholera toxin subunit A genes, {{and the presence of}} the defective VcA 1 prophage genome in classical Vibrio cholerae isolated from patients in Bangladesh in 1982 were compared with those in older classical strains isolated during the sixth pandemic and with those in selected eltor and nontoxigenic O 1 isolates. Classical strains typically had two plasmids (21 and 3 megadaltons), eltor strains typically had no plasmids, and nontoxigenic O 1 strains had zero to three plasmids. The old and new isolates of classical V. cholerae had two HindIII chromosomal digest fragments containing cholera toxin subunit A genes, whereas the eltor strains from Eastern countries had one fragment. The eltor strains from areas surrounding the Gulf of Mexico also had two subunit A gene fragments, which were smaller and easily distinguished from the classical pattern. All classical strains had 8 to 10 HindIII fragments containing the defective VcA 1 prophage genome; none of the Eastern eltor strains had these genes, and the Gulf Coast eltor strains contained a different array of weakly hybridizing genes. These data suggest that the recent isolates of <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> in Bangladesh are closely related to the bacterial strain(s) which caused <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> during the sixth pandemic.

40|$|The two biotypes of Vibrio cholerae {{were found}} to have cell-associated {{hemagglutinins}} which differ with regard to binding to different species of erythrocytes and inhibition by monosaccharides. A total of 12 <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> strains (Inaba or Ogawa) strongly agglutinated human erythrocytes in a reaction specifically inhibited by L-fucose, whereas 12 El Tor strains preferably agglutinated chicken erythrocytes, a reaction reversed by D-mannose or by higher concentrations of D-fructose, D-glucose, alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, or sucrose. Milk from Swedish women inhibited both of these adherence reactions, and the predominating inhibitory activity for each reaction resisted boiling, was destroyed by periodate treatment, and bound a concanavalin A-Sepharose column, suggesting a carbohydrate structure. Further characterization indicated that the inhibitory activity for <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> hemagglutination was distributed about equally on glycoprotein and free oligosaccharide, but was not present on glycolipid. The El Tor inhibiting activity, on the other hand, was almost exclusively of a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein nature. These results support our previous suggestion (Holmgren et al., Infect.

40|$|The <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> red {{reaction}} was first described by Bujwid (1887) who noted {{the development of}} a rose-violet color upon the addition of hydrochloric, nitric, or sulfuric acids to a broth culture of the common bacillus. Diagnostic significance was immediately placed on the test since the reaction did not occur with cultures of Bacillus anthracis, B. subtilis, air-borne micrococei, or with fecal bacteria. Dunham (1887) reviewed these results, established the use of sulfuric acid as the test reagent, and further recommended the use of the test for the identifica-tion of Vibrio comma. The test depends upon the simultaneous production of indole from tryptophan and nitrites from nitrates by the organism. The reaction between nitrous acid, produced by acidification of nitrites, and indole yields nitroso-indole; hence, {{the development of a}} pink to violet color. Wle have observed that cultures of V. comma strains Inaba and El Tor produce neither the <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> red reaction nor positive tests for indole (using Kovacs reagent) when grown in the commercial indole-nitrite medium (BBL). However, positive tests for indole were obtained when these strains were grown in peptone water. Since the only major difference between the two media appeared to be the presence of 0. 1 per cent potassium nitrate in the former medium, the influence of nitrate and nitrite concentration on the indole and cholera red tests was investigated.

40|$|Background: Vibrio cholerae O 1 El Tor {{dominated}} the seventh cholera pandemic which {{occurred in the}} 1960 s. For two decades, variants of V. cholerae O 1 El Tor that produce <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin have emerged and spread globally, replacing the prototypic El Tor biotype. This study aims to characterize V. cholerae O 1 isolates from outbreaks in Thailand with special reference to genotypic variations over time. Methods/Findings: A total of 343 isolates of V. cholerae O 1 from cholera outbreaks from 2007 to 2010 were investigated, and 99. 4 % were found to carry the <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin B subunit (ctxB) and El Tor rstR genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) differentiated the isolates into 10 distinct pulsotypes, clustered into two major groups, A and B, with an overall similarity of 88 %. Ribotyping, multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), and PCR to detect Vibrio seventh pandemic island II (VSP-II) related genes of randomly selected isolates from each pulsotype corresponded to the results obtained by PFGE.

40|$|CTXφ is a {{filamentous}} bacteriophage that encodes cholera toxin, {{the principal}} virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae. CTXφ is unusual among filamentous phages because it encodes a repressor and forms lysogens. CTXφ can infect the existing live-attenuated V. cholerae vaccine strains derived {{from either the}} El Tor or <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> biotypes and result in vaccine reversion to toxinogenicity. Intraintestinal CTXφ transduction assays were used to demonstrate that El Tor biotype strains of V. cholerae are immune to infection with the El Tor-derived CTXφ, whereas classical strains are not. The El Tor CTXφ repressor, RstR, was sufficient to render classical strains immune to infection with the El Tor CTXφ. The DNA sequences of the classical and El Tor CTXφ repressors and their presumed cognate operators are highly diverged, whereas the sequences that surround this “immunity” region are nearly identical. Transcriptional fusion studies revealed that the El Tor RstR mediated repression of an El Tor rstA-lacZ fusion but did not repress a classical rstA-lacZ fusion. Likewise, the classical RstR only repressed a classical rstA-lacZ fusion. Thus, similar to the mechanistic basis for heteroimmunity among lambdoid phages, the specificity of CTXφ immunity {{is based on the}} divergence of the sequences of repressors and their operators.

The possibility of early development of the serological R variant in the epidemic strains was discussed on the data of the literature. 抗原因子S 1 はエルトールコレラ菌の教室保存菌株でも検出された. ただその検出率はクラシック型コレラ菌に比して低率であった. 保存菌全株についてのその出現率は菌株の保存期間すなわち「古さ」に関連し,上記のコレラ菌の区分やその血清型とは無関係であった. S 1 保有菌は抗R血清によって同時に凝集されまた補体の殺菌作用に感受性であった. 本菌は通常の基準によるR型変異菌ではないが,S→R変異の前駆的段階にあるものと称し得よう. 本因子はエルトール菌新鮮分離株の一部においても立証されたが,補体感受性は期待に反して認め得なかった. この場合には上記の「古さ」の関係は適用できない. 血清学的R型変異が流行菌株の場合このように早期にも起る可能性を文献上から考察した...|$|E
40|$|The diarrheal {{response}} of orally inoculated infant mice to viable Vibrio cholerae and purified cholera toxin was quantitated {{by means of}} a fluid accumulation (FA) ratio. The FA ratio is defined as the gut weight/remaining body weight. FA ratios were determined in relation to time of exposure and dose. Onset of fluid accumulation with viable cells of strains CA 401 and 569 B occurred 8 h postinoculation and reached a near maximum of 16 h. A dose of 4 x 10 (6) colony-forming units of strain CA 401 was required for a positive response 16 to 18 h postinoculation. Several other <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> strains demonstrated a similar dose-related response. Strain 569 B, however, required a 100 -fold higher dose to give a positive response. Several mutant cholera strains were decreased virulence in other model systems elicited FA ratios decreased from wild-type values. Onset of fluid accumulation which cholera toxin occurred 6 to 8 h postinoculation and reached a maximum by 10 h. A dose of 0. 5 microng was required for a positive response 10 to 12 h postinoculation. The positive response to toxin could be inhibited by preincubation with specific antitoxin...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundA hybrid {{strain of}} Vibrio cholerae O 1 El Tor that expresses a <b>classical</b> <b>cholera</b> toxin (CT) emerged in 2001. This hybrid variant rapidly {{replaced}} the previous El Tor strain around the world. The global emergence of this variant coincided with anecdotal reports that cholera patients were presenting with more severe dehydration and disease in many locations. MethodsA comparison {{was made of}} the severity of disease before and after the emergence of the hybrid strain in cholera patients attending an icddr,b hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ResultsIt was found that cholera patients presented with more severe dehydration and severe disease in the later period. However, this was also true for all non-cholera patients as well. In addition, in sub-analyses of patients who presented with rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), similar results were found. Comparing the two periods for differences in patient characteristics, nutritional status, vaccination status, and income, no plausible cause for patients presenting with more severe disease was identified in the later period. ConclusionsAs a shift in severity for both cholera and non-cholera was observed, these results indicate that the altered El Tor strain cannot fully explain the difference in cholera severity before and after 2001...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a process}} called quorum sensing (QS), {{bacteria}} communicate with extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AIs). Response to AIs allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression on a population-wide scale and thereby carry out particular behaviors in unison, much like multicellular organisms. In Vibrio cholerae El Tor, the etiological agent of the current cholera pandemic, AI information is transduced internally through a phosphorelay circuit that impinges on the transcription of multiple small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). These RNAs base-pair with, and repress the translation of, the mRNA encoding the master transcriptional regulator HapR. In V. cholerae, HapR controls virulence factor expression and biofilm formation. Here we identify a sRNA-dependent, HapR-independent QS pathway in which the sRNAs base-pair with a new target mRNA and activate translation by preventing formation of a translation-inhibiting stem-loop structure. We show that the <b>classical</b> V. <b>cholerae</b> strain, which caused previous pandemics and is reportedly incapable of QS because of a nonfunctional HapR, nonetheless exhibits QS-controlled gene expression through this new HapR-independent pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} motile {{strains of the}} Ogawa and Inaba serotypes of <b>classical</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> and of the El Tor biotypes to kill {{suckling}} mice after oral challenge with 10 - 8 colony-forming units (representing at least 100 to 1, 000 minimal lethal doses) was {{compared to that of}} nonmotile derivatives of the same strains. Loss of motility, in each case, resulted in a marked reduction in virulence. The mortality (at 36 h) caused by 10 of the 13 nonmotile strains was 32 % or less. whereas the motile wild-type strains resulted in nearly 100 % deaths. The reduced virulence of the nonmotile strains was associated with reduced capacity to adsorb to the surface of segments of mouse intestine. The mutants were tested for alterations in enterotoxin production and surface properties. The results suggest that motility may contribute to virulence by increasing the chance for association of the vibrios with the intestinal mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Cholera toxin-like (CT-like) enterotoxins {{produced}} by two strains of Vibrio mimicus, 61892 and 63616, isolated from diarrhea patients in Bangladesh, were purified, and their physicochemical, biological, and immunological properties {{were compared with}} those of CT {{produced by}} <b>classical</b> Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> 569 B. The CT-like toxins were produced by lincomycin-resistant mutants grown in the presence of lincomycin at 200 micrograms/ml for strain 63616 and 250 micrograms/ml for strain 61892 and were purified by coprecipitation with hexametaphosphate followed by chromatography on phosphocellulose. The pure CT-like toxins were indistinguishable from 569 B CT in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, rabbit intestinal loop and Y- 1 adrenal cell assays, antiserum neutralization and binding inhibition assays, and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, except that the CT-like toxins appeared to consist almost entirely of A subunit which was proteolytically unnicked. Trypsin nicking, however, resulted in fragments that appeared to be identical to those of 569 B CT. These results indicate that at least one species of Vibrio other than V. cholerae can produce enterotoxins which are virtually identical to CT...|$|R
