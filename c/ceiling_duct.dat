5000|$|On October 21, 2010, a {{young man}} entered the GameStop store inside Westfield Galleria at Roseville [...] "speaking incoherently" [...] and {{claiming}} to have a handgun. The man ordered the employees and customers to vacate the store and proceeded to {{set fire to the}} merchandise in the store room. As police and fire crews converged on the scene, the suspect barricaded himself outside the store and began setting other fires. After breaching the barricade, several police officers led the suspect out in handcuffs shortly after 1:00 PM. The mall was evacuated, along with police and fire crews, during the incident due to concerns of a possible incendiary or explosive device in a backpack left behind by the suspect. Due to the wait for the bomb squad, the fire spread and consumed large areas of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>duct</b> work and roof. The suspect, identified as Alexander Piggee, had also set a fire in a local Walmart garden department earlier in the day. He was sentenced to 180 months in prison followed by 72 months surveillance on August 2, 2011 after a guilty plea. The affected wing of Westfield Galleria at Roseville was closed until October 6, 2011 while repairs were made to approximately 40 stores and expansions built.|$|E

40|$|Although {{human excreta}} as a NH 3 source has been {{recognized}} globally, this source has never been quantitatively determined in cities, hampering efforts to fully assess the causes of urban air pollution. In the present study, the exhausts of 15 <b>ceiling</b> <b>ducts</b> from collecting septic tanks in 13 buildings with 6 function types were selected to quantify NH 3 emission rates in the megacity of Shanghai. As a comparison, the ambient NH 3 concentrations across Shanghai were also measured at 13 atmospheric monitoring sites. The concentrations of NH 3 in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>ducts</b> (2809 (- 2661) (+ 5803) μg m(- 3)) outweigh those of the open air (~ 10 μg m(- 3)) by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude, {{and there is no}} significant difference between different seasons. δ 15 N values of NH 3 emitted from two <b>ceiling</b> <b>ducts</b> are also seasonally consistent, suggesting that human excreta may be a stable source of NH 3 in urban areas. The NH 3 concentration levels were variable and dependent on the different building types and the level of human activity. NH 3 emission rates of the six residential buildings (RBNH 3) were in agreement with each other. Taking occupation time into account, we confined the range of the average NH 3 emission factor for human excreta to be 2 - 4 times (with the best estimate of 3 times) of the averaged RBNH 3 of 66. 0 ± 58. 9 g NH 3 capita(- 1) yr(- 1). With this emission factor, the population of ~ 21 million people living in the urban areas of Shanghai annually emitted approximately 1386 Mg NH 3, which corresponds to over 11. 4 % of the total NH 3 emissions in the Shanghai urban areas. The spatial distribution of NH 3 emissions from human excreta based on population data was calculated for the city of Shanghai at a high-resolution (100 × 100 m). Our results demonstrate that human excreta should be included in official ammonia emission inventories...|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is considerably altered. Room layouts indicate original separate tenancies but openings in the party walls now connect them.

50|$|Exhaust ducts and/or {{open windows}} {{must be used}} at all times to allow air to {{continually}} escape the air conditioned area. Otherwise, pressure develops and the fan/blower in the system is unable to push much air through the media and into the air conditioned area. The evaporative system cannot function without exhausting the continuous supply of air from the air conditioned area to the outside. By optimizing {{the placement of the}} 'cooled air' inlet, along with the layout of the house passages, related doors and room windows, the system can be used most effectively to direct the cooled air to the required areas. A well designed layout can very effectively scavenge and expel the hot air from desired areas without the need for an above <b>ceiling</b> <b>ducted</b> venting system. Continuous airflow is essential, so the exhaust windows or vents must not restrict the volume and passage of air being introduced by the evaporative cooling machine. One must also be mindful of the outside wind direction, as for example a strong hot southerly wind will slow or restrict the exhausted air from a south facing window. It is always best to have the downwind windows open, while the upwind windows are closed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To explore {{pipelines}} is one {{of various}} bio-mimetic robot applications. The robot may work in common buildings such as between <b>ceilings</b> and <b>ducts,</b> in addition to complicated and massive pipeline systems of large industrial plants. The bio-mimetic robot finds any troubled area or malfunction and then reports its data. Importantly, it can not only prepare for but also react to any abnormal routes in the pipeline. The pipeline monitoring tasks require special types of mobile robots. For an effective movement along a pipeline, {{the movement of the}} robot will be similar to that of insects or crawling animals. During its movement along the pipelines, a pipeline monitoring robot has an important task of finding the shapes of the approaching path on the pipes. In this paper we propose an effective solution to the pipeline pattern recognition, based on the fuzzy classification rules for the measured IR distance data.

50|$|Active {{chilled beam}} are mounted in a {{suspended}} ceiling and then {{anchored to the}} overhead structure, because T-bar ceilings cannot support the typical operating weight of a chilled beam. They are generally 1 to 2 ft wide, and require less than 1 ft of overhead space. A typical 2 ft wide chilled beam system generally weighs about 15 lb per 1 ft length of the beam. Chilled beams are generally installed so that {{the center of each}} beam is no more than 3 m {{from the center of the}} next beam. Some architects and end-users dislike the beams because they do not cover the entire <b>ceiling</b> so <b>ducts,</b> wiring, and other infrastructure can be seen. Some designers have installed one chilled beam system around the building perimeter (where temperature differences can be the greatest) and another in the interior of the building, to better control temperature throughout the structure. Higher system performance may be obtained by increasing the static pressure of the air in the building. The systems generally need little cleaning (vacuuming of dirt and dust from the fins every five years).|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{vibrations}} {{can occur in}} floor systems due to excitation from human activities such as walking and aerobics. In building floors, excessive vibrations are generally not a safety concern for building floor systems but a cause of annoyance and discomfort. Excessive vibrations typically occur in: (a) light weight floors; (b) floor systems with low stiffness where the floor dominant natural frequency {{is close to the}} excitation frequency; and (c) floors with low damping. While the floor mass and stiffness are normally constant during the life of the structure and can be estimated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, damping is more difficult to predict because it is mostly associated with non-structural components such as partitions, false floors, suspended <b>ceilings</b> and <b>ducts</b> as well as furniture such as filing cabinets and bookshelfs. Current trends in the building industry associated with using lightweight materials, long-span open-plan floors and adoption of the electronic office, give rise to the importance of understanding floor vibrations and specifically damping. This paper provides a summary of factors affecting floor vibrations and discusses available damping systems which can be used to reduce vibration levels in floor systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In modern {{building}} construction, utility ducts and pipes are accommodated in {{the space}} above the false <b>ceiling.</b> Passing these <b>ducts</b> through openings in the floor beams eliminates {{a significant amount of}} dead space and results in a more compact and economical design. Including transverse openings in the web of a reinforced concrete beam induces high stress concentration at the corners of openings, reduces the beam stiffness and alters the simple beam behaviour to a more complex one. Therefore, in design, while providing large openings, the effects on ultimate and service load behaviour of the beam must be properly accounted for. Steel fibre reinforced structural elements are widely used in the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. Steel fibre composites offer excellent properties which are not available in th...|$|R

In residences, asbestos was often a component of a type of flocked acoustic ceiling called popcorn ceiling or [...] "cottage cheese ceiling", until its production was banned in the US in 1978. However, the ban allowed installers to use up remaining stocks, so houses built as late as 1986 could still have asbestos in their acoustic ceilings.

40|$|Particle {{deposition}} in ventilation ducts influences particle exposures of building occupants and {{may lead to}} a variety of indoor air quality concerns. Experiments have been performed in a laboratory to study the effects of particle size and air speed on deposition rates of particles from turbulent air flows in galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. The duct systems were constructed of materials typically found in commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle sizes of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the insulated duct system, deposition rates of particles with nominal sizes of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m were measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces (floor, wall and ceiling) at two straight duct sections where the turbulent flow profile was fully developed. In steel ducts, deposition rates were higher to the duct floor than to the wall, which were, in turn, greater than to the <b>ceiling.</b> In insulated <b>ducts,</b> deposition was nearly the same to the duct floor, wall and ceiling for a given particle size and air speed. Deposition to <b>duct</b> walls and <b>ceilings</b> was greatly enhanced in insulated ducts compared to steel ducts. Deposition velocities to each of the three duct surface orientations in both systems were found to increase with increasing particle size or air velocity over the ranges studied. Deposition rates measured in the current experiments were in general agreement with the limited observations of similar systems by previous researchers...|$|R
40|$|In {{ventilation}} duct flow the turbulent flow profile is commonly disturbed or not fully developed and these conditions {{are likely to}} influence particle deposition to duct surfaces. Particle deposition rates at eight S-connectors, in two 90 {sup o} duct bends and in two ducts where the turbulent flow profile was not fully developed were measured in a laboratory duct system with both galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle diameters of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the insulated duct system, deposition of particles with nominal diameters of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m was measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces. Deposition at S-connectors, in bends and in straight ducts with developing turbulence was often greater than deposition in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence for equal particle sizes, air speeds and duct surface orientations. Deposition rates at all locations were found to increase {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. High deposition rates at S-connectors resulted from impaction and these rates were nearly independent of the orientation of the S-connector. Deposition rates in the two 90 {sup o} bends differed by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, probably because of the difference in turbulence conditions at the bend inlets. In straight steel ducts where the turbulent flow profile was developing, the deposition enhancement relative to fully developed turbulence generally increased with air speed and decreased with downstream distance from the duct inlet. This enhancement was greater at the <b>duct</b> <b>ceiling</b> and wall than at the duct floor. In insulated ducts, deposition enhancement was less pronounced overall than in steel ducts. Trends that were observed in steel ducts were present, but weaker, in insulated ducts...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} particles is detrimental {{to human health}} and indoor exposures dominate total exposures for most people. The accidental or intentional release of aerosolized chemical and biological agents within or near a building can lead to exposures of building occupants to hazardous agents and costly building remediation. Particle deposition in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may significantly influence exposures to particles indoors, diminish HVAC performance and lead to secondary pollutant release within buildings. This dissertation advances the understanding of particle behavior in HVAC systems and the fates of indoor particles by means of experiments and modeling. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify particle deposition rates in horizontal ventilation ducts using real HVAC materials. Particle deposition experiments were conducted in steel and internally insulated ducts at air speeds typically found in ventilation ducts, 2 - 9 m/s. Behaviors of monodisperse particles with diameters in the size range 1 - 16 {micro}m were investigated. Deposition rates were measured in straight ducts with a fully developed turbulent flow profile, straight ducts with a developing turbulent flow profile, in duct bends and at S-connector pieces located at duct junctions. In straight ducts with fully developed turbulence, experiments showed deposition rates to be highest at duct floors, intermediate at duct walls, and lowest at <b>duct</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Deposition rates to a given surface increased {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. Deposition was much higher in internally insulated ducts than in uninsulated steel ducts. In most cases, deposition in straight ducts with developing turbulence, in duct bends and at S-connectors at duct junctions was higher than in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence. Measured deposition rates were generally higher than predicted by published models. A model incorporating empirical equations based on the experimental measurements was applied to evaluate particle losses in supply and return duct runs. Model results suggest that duct losses are negligible for particle sizes less than 1 {micro}m and complete for particle sizes greater than 50 {micro}m. Deposition to insulated ducts, horizontal duct floors and bends are predicted to control losses in duct systems. When combined with models for HVAC filtration and deposition to indoor surfaces to predict the ultimate fates of particles within buildings, these results suggest that ventilation ducts play only a small role in determining indoor particle concentrations, especially when HVAC filtration is present. However, the measured and modeled particle deposition rates are expected to be important for ventilation system contamination...|$|R
40|$|Summer urban heat island (UHI) {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} of having higher urban temperatures compared to the those in surrounding suburban and rural areas. Higher urban air temperatures lead to increased cooling demand, accelerates the formation of smog, and contributes to the generation of greenhouse gas emissions. Dark-colored impervious surfaces cover a significant fraction of an urban fabric, and as hot and dry surfaces, are {{a major contributor to}} the UHI effect. Adopting solar-reflective (“cool”) roofs and cool pavements, and increasing the urban vegetation, are strategies proven to mitigate urban heat islands. These strategies often have an “indirect” effect (ambient cooling) and “direct” effect (change in solar energy flux entering the conditioned space) on the energy use of buildings. This work investigates some elements of the UHI mitigation strategies, specifically the annual direct effect of a cool roof, and the direct and indirect effects of cool pavements. The first topic researched in this paper consists in an experimental assessment of the direct effects from replacing a conventional dark roof with a highly energy-efficient cool roof. The study measures and calculates the annual benefits of the cool roof on the cooling and heating energy uses, and the associated emission reductions. The energy savings attributed to the cool roof are validated by measuring the difference between the homes in the heat loads that entered the conditioned space through the <b>ceiling</b> and HVAC <b>ducts.</b> Fractional annual cooling energy savings (26 %) were 2. 6 times the 10 % daily cooling energy savings measured in a previous study that used a white coating to increase the albedo of an asphalt shingle roof by the same amount (0. 44). The improved cooling energy savings (26 % vs. 10 %) may be attributed to the cool tile’s above-sheathing ventilation, rather than to its high thermal mass. The roof also provided energy savings during the heating season, yielding fractional annual gas heating savings of 4 % and electric heating savings of 3 %. The slightly positive fractional annual heating energy savings likely resulted from the tile roof’s high thermal capacitance, which increased the overnight temperature of the attic air. Thus cool tile roofs should be perceived as a technology that provides energy and environmental benefits during the cooling season as well as the heating season. The second topic investigates the direct and indirect effects of cool pavements on the energy use of California’s building stock. First, a simple urban canyon model was developed to calculate the canyon albedo after the user provides the solar position, canyon orientation, and dimensions of the canyon walls, road, and setbacks. Next, a method is presented to correct the values of temperature changes obtained from previous urban climate models to values that would be obtained from canyon geometries that distinguish between road and setbacks (e. g. sidewalk, front yard). The new canyon model is used to scale the temperature changes obtained from a recent urban climate model that simulated the climatological impact of cool pavements on various California cities. The adjusted temperature changes are then combined with building energy simulations to investigate the effect of cool pavements on the cooling, heating, and lighting energy uses of buildings as well as the environmental impact related to these energy uses. Net (direct + indirect) conditioning (cooling + heating) energy savings and environmental savings from cool pavements were smaller in residential buildings than in commercial buildings. Additionally, residential buildings strongly dominate the building stock in all of the evaluated cities. Therefore, even though most cities yielded conditioning energy and environmental savings, they were small due to the minuscule savings from the residential buildings. When increasing the albedo by 0. 20 of all public pavements in different California cities, Los Angeles was the city with the largest savings, yielding only 0. 60 % in Primary Energy Demand and 0. 30 % in Global Warming Potential (GWP). Some of the cities experienced even a small net penalty in GWP of up to 0. 20 %...|$|R
