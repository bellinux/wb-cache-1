5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the <b>change</b> <b>over</b> time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} <b>change</b> <b>over</b> the course of the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E

Another <b>change</b> <b>over</b> the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Snow science {{addresses}} how snow forms, its distribution, {{and processes}} affecting how snowpacks <b>change</b> <b>over</b> time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover {{and its effect}} on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.|$|E

It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
