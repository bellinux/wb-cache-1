The {{objective of this}} thesis is to prepare the aluminum alloy workpiece for cutting experiment. Second objective of this project is machining the aluminium alloy workpiece with process damping technique which is using high axial depth of cut and low radial depth of cut.

50|$|Similar alloys are {{possible}} with the metal phase consisting {{of one or more}} of silver, copper, gold, aluminium, magnesium, and zinc. The carbide-forming metal can be selected from titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, and chromium, where Ti, Zr, and Hf are preferable. The amount of carbide-forming metal must be sufficient to coat at least 25% of the diamond grains, as otherwise the bonding is insufficient, the heat transfer between matrix and diamond grains is weak which leads to loss of effectivity towards the level of the matrix metal alone, and the material may deform at higher temperatures, and must be low in order to prevent formation of too thick carbide layer that would hinder heat transfer. The volume of diamond should be higher than 30 vol.%, as lower ratio does not provide significant increase of thermal conductivity, and lower than 70 vol.% as higher ratio of diamond makes thermal expansion matching to semiconductors difficult. The grains should also be completely surrounded with metal, to avoid deformation due to different thermal expansion coefficients between diamond and metal; the <b>carbide</b> <b>coating</b> assists with this.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental investigation on surface roughness and chip formation in turning of Al 2219 / 15 SiCp and Al 2219 / 15 SiCp- 3 Gr (hybrid) composites.

The results reveal that the surface roughness values are less for <b>coated</b> <b>carbide</b> tools compared to carbide and are minimum for PCD tools. The incorporation of graphite in Al 2219 / 15 SiCp composite increases the surface roughness.
