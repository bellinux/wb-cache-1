Three X-ray techniques have been investigated, including radioisotope-induced X-ray fluorescence (RXRF), proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and high resolution PIXE. Low flux radioisotope X-ray sources have been used to non-destructively characterize the elements present in photographic papers and emulsions. The information obtained has proven valuable for cataloging and preserving photographic prints of historical significance. Radioisotope X-ray sources have also been used in the development of low-cost, portable instrumentation useful for quantitating a variety of toxicological samples, including urine and feces samples to determine the elimination rates of X-ray contrast media <b>containing</b> <b>dysprosium.</b> The PIXE technique has been applied to the analysis of forensic samples, including bullet lead, tissue fragments and thin metal coatings, and has been compared with other non-destructive methods of analysis. Sample preparation techniques and analytical procedures {{have been developed}} for general, thin target, quantitative PIXE analysis. These procedures were applied to the analysis of five NBS standard reference materials, and to the analysis of deep-sea ferromanganese nodules. A high resolution (2 eV) PIXE system has been developed to aid in the deconvolution of overlapping X-ray peaks encountered in conventional PIXE spectra. This system has been applied to the measurement of chemical shifts in the X-ray emisson spectra of transition metal compounds...|$|E

40|$|EREAN is the European Rare Earth Magnet Recycling Network {{which started}} its {{activities}} in September 2013. It trains 15 young {{researchers in the}} direct and indirect recycling of NdFeB permanent magnets. The innovative aspect of the EREAN project is that it addresses the whole materials loop from End-of-Life consumer goods to recycling {{and the production of}} new REE magnets, with an integrated life cycle assessment. As is highlighted by the European Rare Earths Competency Network (ERECON), recycling of REE permanent magnets should receive top priority. The automotive sector is likely to become the main consumer of REE magnets in Europe, as it moves towards more Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Full Electric Vehicles (EVs). These magnets also <b>contain</b> <b>dysprosium,</b> arguably the most critical REE. Direct recycling routes (alloy reproceing) can offer a cost-effective strategy for recycling REE magnets. In the case where direct recycling of permanent magnets is not possible, novel indirect recycling routes can offer solutions. Indirect recycling routes can also be used for dealing with other REE-containing industrial process residues. Further research into leaching, precipitation, solvent extraction and electrochemistry could give the EU a competitive advantage in this area. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{lanthanide}} phthalocyanines <b>containing</b> <b>dysprosium,</b> erbium and lutetium {{as central}} metals were synthesized using phthalonitrile:metal salt ratio of 4 : 1 or lower phthalonitrile content {{as well as}} using unmetallated phthalocyanine. They were characterized using various spectroscopic and elemental analyses. Dysprosium bis-phthalocyanine was obtained while monomers were obtained for erbium and lutetium phthalocyanines. Theopen-shelldysprosiumbis-phthalocyanine and the monomeric complex of the open-shell erbium were neither fluorescent nor showed the ability to generate singlet oxygen. The triplet states of all the lutetium phthalocyanines {{were found to be}} populated with high triplet quantum yields and corresponding high singlet oxygen quantum yields. The fluorescence quantum yields of the lutetium phthalocyanines were however found to be very low. The lutetium phthalocyanines together with unsubstituted zinc phthalocyanine and its derivatives were successfully incorporated into electrospun polymer fibers either by covalent linkage or sorption forces. Spectral characteristics of the functionalized electrospun polymer fibers indicated that the phthalocyanines were bound and their integrity maintained within the fiber matrices. Most importantly the fluorescence and photoactivity of the phthalocyanines were equally maintained within the electrospun fibers. The functionalized electrospun polymer fibers especially those containing the zinc phthalocyanines could qualitatively detect nitrogen dioxide, a known environmental air pollutant. Also all the functionalized electrospun polystyrene and polysulfone fibers containing lutetium and zinc phthalocyanines could be applied for the photoconversion of 4 -chlorophenol, 4 -nitrophenol and methyl orange. Those of polystyrene could be re-used. Polyacrylic acid and polyurethane functionalized electrospun fibers were found not to be suitable for photocatalytic applications in aqueous medium. 4 -Chlorophenol was found to be more susceptible to photodegradation while methyl orange very difficult to degrade...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of additives {{in a metal}} halide lamp is examined through numerical modelling. A model for a lamp containing sodium iodide additives has been modified to study a discharge <b>containing</b> <b>dysprosium</b> tri-iodide salts. To study the complex chemistry the method of Gibbs minimization is used to decide which species {{have to be taken}} into account and to fill lookup tables with the chemical composition at different combinations of elemental abundance, lamp pressure and temperature. The results from the model with dysprosium additives were compared with earlier results from the lamp containing sodium additives and a simulation of a pure mercury lamp. It was found that radial segregation creates the conditions required for axial segregation. Radial segregation occurs due to the unequal diffusion of atoms and molecules. Under the right conditions convection currents in the lamp can cause axial demixing. These conditions depend on the ratio of axial convection and radial diffusion as expressed by the Peclet number. At a Peclet number of unity axial segregation is most pronounced. At low Peclet numbers radial segregation is at its worst, while axial segregation is not present. At large Peclet numbers the discharge becomes homogeneously mixed. The degree of axial segregation at a Peclet number of unity depends on the temperature at which the additive under consideration fully dissociates. If the molecules dissociate very close to the walls no molecules are transported by the convective currents in the lamp, and hence axial segregation is limited. If they dissociate further away from the walls in the area where the downward convective currents are strongest, more axial segregation is observed. © 2008 IOP Publishing Lt...|$|E

40|$|The diluent {{effect on}} the solvent {{extraction}} of rare earth elements from neodymium magnet leachate MARINO GERGORIĆ Industrial Materials Recycling Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Chalmers University of Technology ABSTRACT Rare earth elements (REEs) have become vital components {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. The demand for the REEs has grown significantly in the last few decades. This has led to increasing costs and supply chain risk. Today, despite lower prices than in 2011, they are classified as the highest supply risk elements in the EU; thus new incentives for recycling the REEs out of electronic scrap were brought forth. End-of-life neodymium magnets are a viable source for the recovery of some REEs. Although mainly iron alloys, these materials <b>contain</b> neodymium, <b>dysprosium</b> and small admixtures of praseodymium and terbium. Leaching followed by solvent extraction of the REEs out of the leachate is an attractive and efficient way of recycling these elements out of end-of-life neodymium magnets. The issues that are encountered along this recycling path is the separation of the REEs from the other elements that are dissolved with the REEs into the leachate and achieving high separation factors between the REEs from each other. Extracting agents such as D 2 EHPA (di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) and TODGA (tetraoctyl diglycolamide) have been previously used for achieving good separation of the REEs under specific extraction conditions. This thesis has focused on the development and optimization of REE extraction from real commercial waste sources, the nitric acid and sulfuric acid media leachates of the neodymium magnet waste, using TODGA and D 2 EHPA as extracting agents, respectively. Selective REE extraction from the solution with minimal or no co-extraction of other elements in the leachate is hoped to provide a novel route to a commercially viable route to recyclable REE products. The composition of the organic phase was investigated in order to study the effect of the diluent on the overall extraction process, a well-known optimization parameter, however infrequently used. The effect of the diluent on the separation factors was also discussed as well as some characteristics of the aqueous phase on the overall extraction process. The named extractants were used at various concentrations in different diluents like solvent 70, hexane, octane, cyclohexanone, toluene, 1 -octanol and chloroform. Both extractants demonstrated good selectivity concerning the extraction of the REEs out of the neodymium magnet waste leachates.
