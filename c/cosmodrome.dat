5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome,</b> Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the launch pad on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the <b>cosmodrome</b> at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the launch pad, Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving for}} the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome,</b> Yazdovsky and Gazenko {{conducted}} surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the <b>cosmodrome</b> was small, {{the dogs and}} crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il-14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they {{were placed in the}} capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, an {{unmanned}} Progress resupply mission, Progress M1-2, {{launched from}} the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome</b> {{to the station}} to deliver supplies to the crew. Progress M1-2 docked with Mir on April 27. On April 26, the Progress M1-1 spacecraft, which had been docked since February and {{was used by the}} Russian Federal Space Agency to boost the station to a higher orbit, undocked and de-orbited over the Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The Dnepr rocket {{assigned}} to launch CryoSat-2 {{arrived at the}} Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome</b> by train on 29 December 2009. On 12 January 2010, the first two stages of the rocket were loaded into the launch canister, and the canister was prepared for transportation to the launch site. On 14 January, it was rolled out to Site 109/95, where it was installed into its silo. The next day saw the third stage transported to the silo, and installed atop the rocket.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome,</b> Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk <b>Cosmodrome</b> in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur <b>cosmodrome</b> and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
5|$|The initial spacewalk {{to begin}} the {{assembly}} of the International Space Station was held on December 7, 1998, following {{the launch of the}} first section of the station, Zarya, from Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome,</b> Kazakhstan, on November 20, 1998. The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built Unity node to Zarya. The longest spacewalk was performed on March 11, 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the airlock, but remained in their suits ready to exit the airlock again in case the robotics operations ran into problems. The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.|$|E
50|$|Until 2014 Launches were {{conducted}} at Kazakhstan's Baikonur and Russia's Plesetsk <b>Cosmodromes.</b> Since the Crimean crisis, launches are conducted on Sea Launch's floating platform. NSAU has ground control and tracking facilities in Kiev {{with the other}} facilities in Yevpatoria, Crimea, and the control-measuring complexes in Yevpatoria were abandoned, while they are operating the control center in Dunaivtsi (Khmelnytskyi Oblast).|$|R
50|$|Borisenko {{flew into}} {{space for the}} first time as a Flight Engineer for the ISS long {{duration}} Expedition 27/28 missions. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft carrying Borisenko, cosmonaut Aleksandr Samokutyayev and NASA astronaut Ron Garan launched on schedule from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome's</b> Gagarin's Start launch pad, at 23:18:20 UTC on April 4, 2011. The launch of Soyuz TMA-21 was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight by Yuri Gagarin performed in 1961.|$|R
50|$|The Soyuz-U {{carrier rocket}} with Progress M-08M was {{launched}} from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome's</b> Pad 1 (Gagarin's launch pad) at 15:11:50 on 27 October 2010. Ascent was nominal, and all systems functioned without issues. The launch {{mass of the}} spacecraft was 7289 kg. Progress M-08M successfully achieved the preliminary orbit of (192.46 by 242.99 kilometres, inclination—51.4 deg, revolution—88.57 min) after a nine-minute ascent provided by the three-stage Soyuz-U rocket. In space, onboard commands were issued to unfurl the spacecraft's communications and navigation antennas and extend the two solar arrays.|$|R
5|$|The three-member Expedition 1 crew {{successfully}} {{launched on}} 31 October 2000, at 07:52 UTC, atop a Soyuz-U rocket on Soyuz TM-31 from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome</b> in Kazakhstan; they used launch pad Gagarin's Start, {{from which the}} first human to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched in 1961. After 33 orbits of the Earth, {{and a series of}} rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC. Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.|$|E
5|$|Stalin died in March 1953, {{and in the}} {{reorganisation}} that followed, the Presidium was abolished and {{a smaller}} Politburo reconstituted. Although Brezhnev was not made a Politburo member, he was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Army and the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant-General, a very senior position. Brezhnev's patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev's opponent Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years. On 7 May 1955, Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. On the surface, his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive. In reality, Brezhnev {{became involved in the}} development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the Baykonur <b>Cosmodrome.</b> The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became unproductive and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis. Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956. The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign was disappointing, which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} weight reduction, GLONASS-K {{spacecraft}} can be launched in pairs from the Plesetsk <b>Cosmodrome</b> launch site using the substantially lower cost Soyuz-2.1b boosters or in six-at-once from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome</b> using Proton-K Briz-M launch vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2015, a {{spokesperson}} for a Russian government space infrastructure agency reported that [...] "Work with the rocket at the integration and testing complex now can not be conducted because the facility is not ready" [...] and added that [...] "There are still imperfections in the construction." [...] According to The Moscow Times, critical infrastructure was built at the wrong dimensions and would not fit {{the current generation of}} Soyuz rockets. However later this information was disproved by the <b>cosmodrome's</b> operation centre and the rocket was set into the facility.|$|R
50|$|Samokutyayev {{flew into}} {{space for the}} first time as a Flight Engineer for the ISS long {{duration}} Expedition 27/28 missions. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft carrying Samokutyayev, cosmonaut Andrei Borisenko and NASA astronaut Ron Garan launched on schedule from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome's</b> Gagarin's Start launch pad, at 23:18:20 UTC on 4 April 2011. Samokutyayev served as Commander of Soyuz TMA-21. The launch of Soyuz TMA-21 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first space mission by Yuri Gagarin. Samokutyayev carried a small stuffed dog given to him by his daughter. Hanging in front of the crew, live NASA TV launch footage showed that the dog begun to float as the spacecraft soared skywards, an indication of the weightlessness of space.|$|R
50|$|The Soyuz FG rocket {{carrying}} TMA-14M commander Aleksandr Samokutyayev, Yelena Serova and NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore blasted {{off from}} the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome's</b> Site 1/5 at 20:25 UTC. Nine minutes after launch, the Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft separated from the third stage of the FG rocket to reach orbit. Soon after, the spacecraft deployed its KURS navigation antennas, however, {{only one of the}} two power-generating solar arrays successfully unfolded. Despite the trouble encountered, TMA-14M linked up with the Space Station four orbits and six hours later at 1:12 UTC on 26 September. When leak checks were complete, the hatch on the Poisk module was opened at 5:06 UTC and Serova with Samokutyayev and Wilmore entered the Space Station. On 11 March 2015, the crew successfully returned to Earth after 167 days in space.|$|R

50|$|The final {{planned flight}} of the {{baseline}} Soyuz-TMA design was Soyuz TMA-22, launched November 14, 2011 from the Baikonur <b>Cosmodrome's</b> Gagarin's Start launch pad in Kazakhstan, at 04:14:03 UTC. The new modernized Soyuz TMA-M series was developed and built by RKK Energia as an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz-TMA. Thirty-six obsolete pieces of equipment have been replaced with 19 new-generation devices and the vehicle's total mass has been reduced by 70 kilograms (154 lbs). In particular, the reliable but heavy (70 kg) Argon digital computer and analogue systems, which had been used on Soyuz ships for more than 30 years, has been replaced with a new digital computer, the TsVM-101, and digital avionics. Power consumption has been reduced throughout the ship. There are also changes to the spacecraft's structure, such as replacing the magnesium alloy used in the instrument module frame with aluminium alloy, to make the ship easier to manufacture.|$|R

50|$|Space and rocket {{equipment}} {{is considered to}} be among the most powerful source of the man-made impact on the global climate, environment and economies. There are 17 <b>cosmodromes</b> (space-vehicle launching sites or space centers) in the world.Over the period 1957 to 2001, 1189 space rockets were launched from Baikonur to put into orbit 1237 space ships on various assignments. These launches also included more than 100 intercontinental ballistic rockets. From 2000 to 2001, 30% of the world’s space rocket launching was carried out from Baikonur space center.The location of space centers on the coasts of USA, France, Japan, Australia and India was done purposefully in order to reduce damage from accidents and prevent the fall of rocket stages and products of combustion in the residential areas. Only three countries - Russia, China and Kazakhstan - launch from landlocked continental space centers exposing the population of their countries to danger and polluting inhabited areas.|$|R
25|$|On Monday 28 November 2011, a Soyuz rocket, {{launched}} from the Plesetsk <b>Cosmodrome</b> Space Centre, placed a single GLONASS-M satellite into orbit into Plane 3.|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{preparation}} of liquid propellant components (LPC) before fueling the tanks of rocket and space {{technology is the}} one of the operations performed by ground technological complexes on <b>cosmodromes.</b> Refrigeration of high-boiling LPC is needed to increase its density and to create cold reserve for compensation of heat flows existing during fueling and prelaunch operations of space rockets. The method and results of simulation of LPC refrigeration in the recuperative heat exchangers with heat carrier which is refrigerated by-turn with liquid nitrogen sparging. The refrigerating system consists of two tanks (for the chilled coolant and LPC), LPC and heat carrier circulation loops with heat exchanger and system of heat carrier refrigeration in its tank with bubbler. Application of intermediate heat carrier between LPC and liquid nitrogen allows to avoid LPC crystallization on cold surfaces of the heat exchanger. Simulation of such systems performance is necessary to determine its basic design and functional parameters ensuring effective refrigerating of liquid propellant components, time and the amount of liquid nitrogen spent on refrigeration operation. Creating a simulator is quite complicated because of the need to take into consideration many different heat exchange processes occurring in the system. Also, to determine the influence of various parameters on occurring processes it is necessary to take into consideration the dependence of all heat exchange parameters on each other: heat emission coefficients, heat transfer coefficients, heat flow amounts, etc. The paper offers an overview of 10 references to foreign and Russian publications on separate issues and processes occurring in liquids refrigerating, including LPC refrigeration with liquid nitrogen. Concluded the need to define the LPC refrigerating conditions to minimize cost of liquid nitrogen. The experimental data presented in these publications is conformed with the application of the simulator and its parts. In the proposed algorithm of calculations a simulator consists of three blocks with data and intermediate results exchange with each other. Blocks contain subsimulator of heat gain in the LPC and heat carrier circulation loops, cooling-heating subsimulator of LPC and the heat carrier in the heat exchanger and heat exchange subsimulator of LPC and heat carrier in its tanks. Functional dependence of thermophysical properties of LPC and heat carrier and its temperatures, as well as characteristics of the pumps are taken into consideration in calculations. Pump heat gain subsimulator includes hydrauliccirculation loop calculation and the calculation of the heat flow emitted by pump. Subsimulator of the heat exchanger is based on differential equations of static heat exchange, where the integration variable is length coordinate of heat exchanger. The output data of these subsimulators are input data in heat exchange subsimulator of LPC and heat carrier in its tanks, which is based on the differential equations of quasi-stationary heat exchange. Simulation results are interpolated functions of LPC, heat carrier and the metal shells temperatures. Analyzing these functions graphs one can determine the performance indicators of the refrigerating system: refrigerating time and the relative costs of liquid nitrogen (mass of liquid nitrogen spent, referred to the weight of the refrigerated LPC). For example in the case of refrigerating portions 13260 kg and 3300 kg of high-boiling oxidizer with various combinations of design and functional parameters the refrigeration time is 2. 8 [...] . 78. 3 hours, and the relative costs of nitrogen amounted to 0, 178 [...] . 0, 322. Concluded the possibility of applying the proposed method for LPC refrigeration simulation with ground equipment systems using liquid nitrogen and intermediate heat carrier to determine rational design and functional parameters of the system, which allow to achieve the lowest cost of liquid nitrogen. </p...|$|R
