40|$|Basilar {{impression}} (BI) and hydrocephalus <b>complicating</b> {{osteogenesis imperfecta}} (OI) is usually treated by anterior transoral decompression and posterior fixation. Nevertheless, {{it may be}} questioned if posterior fusion following axial halo traction is adequate in patients with symptomatic BI <b>complicating</b> OI. We report on a case with progressive symptomatic hydrocephalus and BI <b>complicating</b> OI that was successfully treated by halo traction followed by posterior occipitocervical fusion. However, after a symptom free interval of 2 years the patient suffered from recurrence of symptomatic hydrocephalus needing additional ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement. In conclusion, posterior fusion without additional VP shunt placement may not be effective {{in the long term}} for ameliorating symptoms and signs and halting progressive hydrocephalus in BI <b>complicating</b> O...|$|R

The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
