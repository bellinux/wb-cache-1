5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had {{returned to}} the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation of the two groups by overseeing numerous <b>cross-band</b> weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.|$|E
