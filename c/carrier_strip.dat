40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{the work of the}} Laboratory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing in the Technical Test Center (TTC), we {{investigated}} the influence of the Faraday cage on measurement results. The primary goal of this study is the simulation of the fields in the cage, especially around resonant frequencies, {{in order to be able}} to predict results of measurements of devices under test in the anechoic chamber or in any other environment. We developed simulation (computer) models of the cage step by step, by using the Wipl-D program and by comparing the numerical results with measurements as well as by resolving difficulties due to the complex structure and imperfections of the cage. The subject of this paper is to present these simulation models and the corresponding results of the computations and measurements. Construction of the cage The cage is made of steel plates with the dimensions 1. 25 m x 2. 5 m. The base of the cage is a square; the footprint interior dimensions are 3. 76 m x 3. 76 m, and the height is 2. 5 m. The cage ceiling is lowered by plasticized aluminum strips. The strips are loosely attached to the carriers which are screwed to the ceiling. The cage has four ventilation openings (two on the ceiling and two on one wall), made of honeycomb waveguide holes. In one corner of the cage, there is a single door with springs made of beryllium bronze. For frequencies of a few tens of MHz, the skin effect is fully developed in the cage walls. By measuring the input impedance of the wire line parallel to a wall of the cage, we calculated the surface losses of the cage plates. In addition, we used a magnetic probe to detect shield discontinuities. We generated a strong current at a frequency of 106  kHz outside the cage and measured the magnetic field inside the cage at the places of cage shield discontinuities. In this paper, we showed the influence of these places on the measurement results, especially on the qualitative and quantitative changes of the cage resonant frequencies. Model of the cage On the basis of the testing, the initial simulation model of the cage in the Wipl-D program consists of plates with losses, including losses at plate junctions, wall ventilation openings, aluminum profiles, profile carriers, and screws. The analysis showed that this model is not satisfactory. To obtain a more accurate model of the cage, we need the additional and more precise model of the lowered ceiling. That would complicate the model and require a lot of additional testing. For obtaining a simpler, but more reliable simulation model, we dismounted the aluminum profiles from the carriers. Thereafter, the agreement between the simulation and the experimental results was better than for the initial model, but still is not good enough, due to the uncertainties caused by the <b>strips</b> <b>carriers</b> and the screws. Final model of the cage To avoid the uncertainty due to the <b>strips</b> <b>carriers,</b> we removed the carriers and the screws from the cage. A very good matching of the simulation and the experimental results was achieved. We showed that the relative difference of the resonant frequencies between simulation and measurement is less than 1  %. However, the relative difference of resonant frequency between simulation or measurement and theoretical results is also less than 1  %, except for TE 101 and TE 011 modes, for which the relative difference is under 5  %. We explained the exception by the influence of the places of the cage shield discontinuities on the measurement results. Conclusion The results of the simulations and the measurements for the final model show good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We showed that the resonant frequencies in the simulations and the measurement results have same positions and depths. Also, the relative differences of the resonant frequencies are less than 1  %. As future work, we will provide a technique for the identification of equivalent sources that represent the device under test. This would enable a characterization of the tested device in an arbitrary electromagnetic environment and allow a comparison of results obtained in different laboratories.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic carrier {{technology}} (MCT) {{has found a}} wide range of applications, including biological cell separation, waste remediation, and raw material recovery. The challenge to MCT is to develop a new method for the preparation of magnetic carriers with the following features: high density of reactive functional groups, diversity of functionalities, and durability of surface films. In this thesis, two novel methods, molecular self-assembly and silanation, were developed for the preparation of magnetic carriers. In molecular self-assembly, 16 -mercaptohexadecanoic acid (HOOC-$ rm C sb{ 15 }H sb{ 30 }$-SH, ie. MHA) was anchored onto the $ gamma$-Fe$ rm sb 2 O sb 3 $ surface through chemical bonding between the carboxylic head group of the surfactant and iron on the surface, leaving the thiol or disulfide groups reactive. The molecular orientation of MHA self-assembled on $ gamma$-Fe$ rm sb 2 O sb 3 $ was studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and film flotation. The self-assembled MHA film on $ gamma$-$ rm Fe sb 2 O sb 3 $ was immobilized and resistant to acid and base attack. Magnetic carriers prepared as such showed a strong affinity to Ag$ sp+$ and Cu$ sp{ 2 +}$ ions in an aqueous solution. In the preparation of magnetic carriers by silanation using 3 -amino-propyltriethoxy silane (APTES), XPS, DRIFTS, and zeta-potential measurements indicated that direct silanation of APTES from either water or toluene solutions on bare magnetic particles was successful. In acid solutions, APTES films silanized on bare magnetic particles from toluene were more stable compared to the ones silanized from water. Both films were unstable in alkaline solutions. To improve the stability of silanized films, a thin silica layer was coated onto the magnetic particles using the sol-gel process, followed by dense liquid silica coating. Magnetic carriers with amino groups were prepared by the silanation of silica coated magnetic particles using APTES in toluene. Stability tests indicated that the silanized films on silica coated magnetic particles were more stable than the ones silanized on bare magnetic particles. Magnetic carriers with reactive amine groups were proved to be effective for removal or recovery of heavy metal ions such as Cu$ sp{ 2 +}$ and Zn$ sp{ 2 +}$ from aqueous solutions. Loaded metal ions on magnetic <b>carriers</b> were completely <b>stripped</b> off by 0. 01 M nitric or hydrochloric acid. The possible recycling of magnetic carriers could offset the high price of magnetic carriers and lower the cost associated with industrial applications. Applications of magnetic carriers with reactive amine and thiol groups in biological cell separation, immobilization of enzymes, magnetic fluids, and waste remediation were also discussed...|$|R
