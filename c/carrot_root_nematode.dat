50|$|Heterodera carotae is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode {{commonly known}} as the <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> <b>nematode</b> or carrot cyst nematode. It is found in Europe, Cyprus and India and is considered an invasive species in the United States. It causes damage to carrot crops and is very specific in its choice of hosts, only infecting Daucus carota and Daucus pulcherrima.|$|E

The developed method refers to computer aided mathematical modeling of the <b>carrot</b> <b>root.</b> The Bézier curves {{were used in}} mathematical model for description of the <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> shape. Two smoothly connected Bézier curves described half of longitudinal contour of <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> cross section. After rotation of these curves, the ob-tained equations were subjected to scaling. The proposed mathematical model can serve the ge-nerating the 3 D solids that are similar in respect of the shape and basic dimensions of <b>carrot</b> <b>roots.</b> In mathematical model {{it is possible to}} change the values of parameters that determine basic geome-tric dimensions (diameters and length of root) and the root shape (coordinates of nodal and check points of the Bézier curves).

Ethylene applied exogenously in concentrations above 0. 3 ppm induced the formation of MMHD in <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> discs. Continued production of MMHD required the continued presence of ethylene. The amounts of MMHD in the discs were reduced by CO 2, an inhibitor of ethylene action, and by reduction of the partial pressure of ethylene in fungus-inoculated or 2, 4, 5 -T-treated <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> discs. The results indicate that ethylene is required for the induction of MMHD formation by <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> tissue...|$|R

40|$|Since 2007 Applied Plant Research (PPO) investigates {{whether the}} <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> fly (Psila rosae) can be disorientated by {{applying}} strong smelling oils. A mature <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> fly {{can find a}} carrot field by smell. The {{question is whether the}} smell of carrots may be masked by strong smelling oils so that the <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> fly can not find the carrot plants. In 2008 we found an indication that strong smelling oil can reduce onion root fly damage. In the untreated plot 7 % of the roots were affected by the <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> fly and in the treated plot (masked by strong smelling oil) 1 % of the roots were affected. In 2009 on 6 carrot fields and one root parsley field demonstrations were created by Dutch organic farmers to reduce carrot fly damage. In all the 6 <b>carrot</b> fields the <b>root</b> fly damage was too little to determine differences. The maximum percentage of infected <b>carrot</b> <b>roots</b> was below 3 %. As a result, the effect of oregano-oil could not be determined. In the parsley root field damage was sufficiently high to see effects of the oil treatment. In the patch protected by onion oil 1. 5 % of the roots were affected. At a distance of 150 m from this patch no infected roods were found. At a distance of 270 m from the patch 11. 5 % of the roots were affected. The oils used have a natural origin (extracted from plants). The method is selective because only insects reacting on the carrot smell are affected. They have more difficulty in finding carrot fields, or can not find them at all. If this method functions well, it can be used in organic and conventional cultivation of carrots...|$|R

40|$|Potassium is an {{essential}} nutrient which {{plays an important role}} in many aspects of plant growth and development. Plants have developed a number of highly specific mechanisms to take up potassium from the soil; these include the expression of K(+) transporters and potassium channels in root cells. Despite the fact that root epidermal and hair cells are in direct contact with the soil, the role of these tissues in K(+) uptake is not well understood. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel potassium channel KDC 1 which forms part of a new subfamily of plant K(in) channels. Kdc 1 was isolated from <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> RNA and in situ hybridization experiments show Kdc 1 to be highly expressed in root hair cells. Expressing the KDC 1 protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells identified it as a voltage and pH-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channel. An electrophysiological analysis of <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> hair protoplasts confirmed the biophysical properties of the Kdc 1 gene product (KDC 1) in the heterologous expression system. KDC 1 thus represents a major K(+) uptake channel in <b>carrot</b> <b>root</b> hair cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of toxic metabolites by four isolates of Alternaria radicina and two isolates of A. alternata in rice grains and carrot discs at 1, 10 and 20 ° C was investigated. Incubation lasted 21 and 35 days or 14 and 28 days for rice grains and carrot discs, respectively. Accumulation of toxins in inoculated <b>carrot</b> <b>roots</b> stored for 24 weeks and in inoculated dried carrots stored for 48 weeks was also determined.

Although the isolates tested were capable of producing toxins in rice grains at 1 ° C, {{none of them was}} detected in carrot discs.

Fosthietan, aldicarb, and oxamyl at 4 and 6 kg ai/ha protected the roots during formation and gave a lasting control of root-knot nematode. There was some nematode damage to the roots with phenamiphos and carbofuran at 4 and 6 kg ai/ha.
