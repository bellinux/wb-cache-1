50|$|<b>Cheating</b> was {{exploited}} by technology-oriented players {{due to the}} difficulty of early <b>cheats.</b> However, a <b>cheat</b> industry emerged as gaming systems evolved, through the packaging and selling of <b>cheating</b> as a product. Cheat-enablers such as <b>cheat</b> books, game guides, <b>cheat</b> cartridges helped form a <b>cheat</b> industry and cemented <b>cheating</b> as part of gaming culture. However, <b>cheating</b> was not universally accepted in early gaming; gaming magazine Amiga Power condemned cheaters, taking the stance that <b>cheating</b> was not part of their philosophy of fairness. They also applied this in reverse; games should also not be allowed to <b>cheat</b> the player. Guides, walkthroughs and tutorials are sometimes used to complete games but whether this is <b>cheating</b> is debated.|$|R

40|$|Academic {{dishonesty}} (<b>cheating)</b> {{has been}} prevalent {{on college campuses}} for decades {{and the percentage of}} students reporting <b>cheating</b> varies by college major. This study, based on a survey of 643 undergraduate engineering majors at 11 institutions, used two parallel hierarchical multiple regression analyses to predict the frequency of <b>cheating</b> on exams and the frequency of <b>cheating</b> on homework based on eight blocks of independent variables: demographics, pre-college <b>cheating</b> behavior, co-curricular participation, plus five blocks organized around Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (moral obligation not to <b>cheat,</b> attitudes about <b>cheating,</b> evaluation of {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>cheating,</b> perceived social pressures to <b>cheat</b> or not to <b>cheat,</b> and perceived effectiveness of academic dishonesty policies).

Due to the unconditional security and the property of decoding without computation, VC has been applied to numerous applications such as visual authentication and identification, steganography, and image encryption. The dissertation proposed an explicit definition of <b>cheating</b> in the k-out-of-n VC. In VC, the property of applying of Human Visual System (HVS) for decoding distinguishes VC from secret sharing schemes. According to the property, the definition consists of authentic conditions, brightness condition, and security condition. Moreover, three <b>cheating</b> attack models, encryption algorithm only, known transparency, and known secret, are proposed based on the amount of the information known to the cheater. A reasonable scenario and the algorithm of the proposed <b>cheating</b> activity are used to show that <b>cheating</b> is possible in VC. According to the definition of <b>cheating,</b> Hu and Tzeng's <b>cheating</b> activities, CA- 1 and CA- 2, are not considered as a successful <b>cheating</b> activity in the k-out-of-n VC. The dissertation then proposed four <b>cheating</b> prevention schemes. The zero-bit appended <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme, the authentication based <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (ABCP), the 2 -out-of-(n+l) VC <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme, and the homogenous secret images based <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (HBCP). The proposed four <b>cheating</b> prevention schemes are shown to provide well solutions to deal with <b>cheating</b> attacks. With respect to Hu and Tzeng's <b>cheating</b> prevention scheme (HTCP), it suffers <b>cheating</b> activities after the proposed basis matrix filtering attack (BMFA). On the contrary, the proposed four schemes, ZACP, 2 -out-of-(n+l) VC, ABCP, and HBCP, are proven as secure as the VC scheme.
