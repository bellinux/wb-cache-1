5000|$|Sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> are a {{class of}} semi-structured {{projective}} techniques. Sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> typically provide respondents with beginnings of sentences, referred to as [...] "stems", and respondents then complete the sentences {{in ways that are}} meaningful to them. The responses are believed to provide indications of attitudes, beliefs, motivations, or other mental states. Therefore, sentence completion technique, with such advantage, promotes the respondents to disclose their concealed feelings. Notwithstanding, there is debate over whether or not sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> elicit responses from conscious thought rather than unconscious states. This debate would affect whether sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> can be strictly categorized as projective tests.|$|R

25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment <b>completion</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

50|$|The data {{collected}} from sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> can usually be analyzed either quantitatively or qualitatively. Usually, sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> can be interpreted in two different ways: subjective-intuitive analysis of the underlying motivations projected in the subject's responses, or objective analysis by means of scores assigned to each completed sentence. Multiple themes can occur in a short test, which gives the examinee multiple opportunities to reveal underlying motivations about each topic during data analysis. Of course, most sentence <b>completion</b> <b>tests</b> are much longer-anywhere from 40 to 100 stems-and contain more themes-anywhere from 4 to 15 topics.|$|R

The test has been characterized as a good test for clinical use as it can measure across distinct psychopathologies and help in choosing treatment modalities; to this end, it is used by many clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.|$|E

50|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus is {{generally}} credited with developing {{the first sentence}} <b>completion</b> <b>test</b> in 1897. Ebbinghaus's sentence <b>completion</b> <b>test</b> was used {{as part of an}} intelligence test. Simultaneously, Carl Jung's word association test may also have been a precursor to modern sentence completion tests. Moreover, in recent decades, sentence completion tests have increased in usage, in part because they are easy to develop and easy to administer. As of the 1980s, sentence completion tests were the eighty-fifth most widely used personality assessment instruments. Another reason for the increased usage of sentence completion tests is because of their superiority to other measures in uncovering conflicted attitudes. Some sentence completion tests were developed as a way to overcome the problems associated with thematic apperception measures of the same constructs.|$|E
