40|$|This study uses {{a set of}} firm-level {{data from}} Worldscope to {{examine the impact of}} {{national}} <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> on audit markets across 39 countries. Our auditor choice and audit fee results support the legal cost hypothesis that Big Five auditors charge a higher risk premium {{and are more likely to}} turn away risky clients in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> than in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> We also find that the complementary effect outweighs the legal cost effect in that strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> do not reduce the market share of high quality auditors, but they enhance the development of capital markets, which in turn creates a higher demand for quality audit service. Our general sample results show that firms in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments,</b> ceteris paribus, are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than their counterparts operating in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> However, among the large firms in the sample, which are more likely to have international investors, we document evidence supporting the substitution effect hypothesis that firms in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than firms in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> because external auditors may serve as a substitute for legal protection t...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. The first essay finds that small firms in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> (poor quality contract enforcement and property rights environments) are more financially constrained relative to small firms in better quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> Consequently, financial development, that is, the emergence of venture capitalists, has a greater effect on small firms' access to external financing in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> The second essay finds {{that the quality of}} contract enforcement is a risk factor, while the quality of property rights protection is not. The results indicate that poor quality property rights protection hinders the development of informal capital markets; hence, there exists a greater need for financial intermediation in such environments. These results indicate that venture capital financing should be encouraged in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> and provide one rationale for why capital markets in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> countries tend to be bank-based. The third essay finds that the demand for growth financing is lower in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> relative to better quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> The existing literature has focused on the effect that limited supply of external financing has on firm growth rates in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> This paper indicates that lower firm growth rates in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> may also result from lower demand for growth financing. The empirical results in all three essays indicate that poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> primarily affect the development of informal capital markets. Hence, financial intermediation is of greater importance in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> during the early stages of a firm's growth cycle. This indicates that encouraging the growth of venture capital financing, which is better suited to ameliorating moral hazard problems (investments in small firms and technology intensive ventures) relative to debt or bank financing, will facilitate faster economic growth in poor quality <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> Evidence that venture capitalists' asset allocations are significantly and positively associated with long-run country growth rates is provided in the second essay...|$|R

40|$|Objectives : To {{determine}} the influence of a state's <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> and a hospital's Prenatal Substance Exposure (PSE) protocol on physicians' propensity to respond when prenatal substance exposure is suspected. Methods : Using a sample of 1367 physicians from every state and the District of Columbia, we formulate a set of linear models to {{determine the}} impact of the <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> and hospital protocol on physicians' response to PSE, the agreement between physicians' perceptions and actual state <b>legal</b> <b>environments,</b> and physicians' motivation to act when PSE is suspected. Results : Both protocol and <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> showed to be significantly correlated with physicians' propensity to take action when PSE is suspected (p < 0. 05). Our analysis shows that physicians prefer a public health (patient-centered) approach to more punitive measures. Conclusions : Our results suggest a policy strategy focused first on enacting laws that would encourage a patient-centered approach, by developing and using hospital protocols to implement state policy, and then on educating physicians about the actual <b>legal</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{interactions}} with foreign capital, product, and labor markets affect the disclosure practices of non-U. S. multinational firms. Drawing on literature related to multinationals, country-level legal institutions, and accounting disclosures, {{we expect that}} the relation between globalization and voluntary disclosure will be conditioned by the <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> in a firm 2 ̆ 7 s home country. Specifically, while firms from countries with a strong <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> (e. g., common-law countries) already face pressure for good disclosure, globalization can increase the benefits associated with good disclosure to firms from weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> (e. g., civil-law countries). We use a self-constructed voluntary disclosure index and hand-collected disclosure and foreign activity data for 643 non-U. S. firms from 30 countries for 2003. We find a significant interaction between globalization and the <b>legal</b> <b>environment.</b> This indicates that for {{the same level of}} globalization, there is more voluntary disclosure for firms based in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> Our results suggest that globalization is an important variable that has been overlooked in much of the previous cross-country research...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{construct}} a typology which indicates strategic reaction of organizations against <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> during the historical development of insurance industry which cannot complete the process of institutionalization in Turkey. In this study, institutional and resource dependence perspectives are used to the prediction of strategic reactions to institutional processes. The study offers a typology of strategic reactions that vary in active organizational defiance from passive deference to proactive manipulation. The theoretical typology constructed at the end of the study exhibits the transition from stationary <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> to dynamic <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> for insurance industry. In this transition period, insurance companies have tended to isomorphic inclination with this laws and related organizational applications. On the other hand, three testable propositions are reproduced for future studies from three stages of institutional process to contribute approaches and models of strategic management. The article proceeds in the following manner. First, we briefly review the literature regarding <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> and strategic reactions of organizations to <b>legal</b> <b>environment.</b> Organization theories such as institutional theory and resource dependence theory form the basis of this study. Second, we analyze role of <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> in the historical process of insurance industry in Turkey. We scan many historical documents, laws, regulations and politic applications. Next, we produce typology for industries in the process of institutionalization and testable propositions for future studies. Finally, we provide the research findings and discuss their organizational and theoretical implications...|$|R
