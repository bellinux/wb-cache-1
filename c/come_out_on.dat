5|$|On October 2016, the reveal trailer for Nintendo Switch {{featured}} gameplay of Skyrim on the console. At the time, it {{was reported}} that Bethesda only used the game for the reveal trailer and that it was not officially releasing on the Nintendo Switch. On January 13, 2017, Todd Howard officially confirmed that the game will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the Nintendo Switch, making it the first Elder Scrolls title to be released on a Nintendo platform, as well as the first game Bethesda has made or released for a Nintendo home console since Home Alone for the NES in 1991.

5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before its actual release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 people. Before its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about Dragon Quest VII's release, moved Final Fantasy IX to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a later date. Horii stated {{in an interview that}} the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E

5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while {{trying to pick up}} a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing each other for the division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} lap, Newman became the leader, as Logano drove to pit road. On the 173rd lap, Menard {{moved to the}} third position, after having {{assistance}} from Stewart. Two laps later, Ragan became the leader, but two laps later, Bowyer reclaimed the position. On lap179, Newman moved {{up to the first}} position, as Earnhardt moved to eleventh.

On lap192, Bowyer moved up to the third position, then to the first position. Three laps later, Smith moved into the first position. On lap197, the fifteenth caution was given after Smith spun sideways, as Bowyer was also involved and sustained major damage. During the caution, Earnhardt made a pit stop because of a possible deflating tire. At the lap202 restart, for a green-white-checker finish, Ragan was the leader, ahead of Bayne.|$|E
5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} misdirection and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the consequences of their actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} revolutionary {{products}} to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the market was the company's disposable Pampers diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with Head & Shoulders. Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling.|$|E

25|$|In the quarterfinals, Iraq {{defeated}} Vietnam 2–0, while South Korea ('Korea Republic') {{needed a}} penalty shootout to eliminate Iran 4–2.

El Hijo del Santo regained the WWA Welterweight title and brought it with him to AAA. One of the first feuds he was put in was again Negro Casas' youngest brother, Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal took el Hijo del Santo's WWA Welterweight title and won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship but el Hijo del Santo would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top of the feud and took both titles from Heavy Metal before he lost them again to another young star, Psicosis.|$|E

25|$|Some {{more recent}} publicized gay Mormon suicides include 17-year-old Jack Denton Reese who {{was from a}} small town in Utah where over 90% of the {{residents}} were LDS and who experienced severe physical and verbal bullying at school. In 2016 there were three suicides of young gay Mormon men which received media attention. Harry Fisher was a 28-year-old BYU history student and had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Facebook about two months before his death on 12 February 2016. He reported hearing anti-gay rhetoric from individuals around him and having to leave church to cry in his car. Lincoln Parkin was a 22-year-old man who grew up in Pleasant View, Utah and received an award in 2012 for reestablishing the gay-straight alliance at Weber High School after having a gay friend commit suicide. He attended Westminster College and had attempted suicide before having experienced significant depression for a decade but completed suicide on 6 April 2016.

25|$|In 2001, EastEnders {{clashed with}} Coronation Street {{for the first}} time. EastEnders won the battle with 8.4 million viewers (41% share) whilst Coronation Street lagged behind with 7.3 million viewers (34 percent share). On 21 September 2004, Louise Berridge, the then {{executive}} producer, quit following criticism of the show. The following day the show received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of Emmerdale against it. Emmerdale was watched by 8.1 million people. The poor ratings motivated the press into reporting viewers were bored with implausible and ill-thought-out storylines. Under new producers, EastEnders and Emmerdale continued to clash at times, and Emmerdale tended to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top, giving EastEnders lower than average ratings. In 2006, EastEnders regularly attracted between 8 and 12 million viewers in official ratings. EastEnders received its second lowest ratings on 17 May 2007, when 4.0 million viewers tuned in. This was also the lowest ever audience share, with just 19.6 percent. This was attributed to a conflicting one hour special episode of Emmerdale on ITV1. However, ratings for the 10pm EastEnders repeat on BBC Three reached an all-time high of 1.4 million. However, {{there have been times}} when EastEnders had higher ratings than Emmerdale despite the two going head-to-head.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasting for 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top {{with a time of}} two minutes and 11.842 seconds on the final lap of the session with new tyres. He was eight-tenths of a second quicker than the best-placed rookie Ilott in second position with teammate Giovinazzi another thousandth of a second in arrears in third place. Ilott and Giovinazzi held the lead at various points in the session before Rosenqvist's last lap effort. Sam MacLeod improved on his last lap to end the session in fourth place having had four new tyres installed at his pit stop. On his last timed lap, Juncadella recovered from an earlier free practice gearbox problem to end up provisionally fifth. Having been in contention for much of first qualifying, Pommer finished sixth, with Sekiguci and Mikkel Jensen in close proximity on the time sheets. Gustavo Menezes and Sims rounded out the top ten. Following them were Charles Leclerc, Kanamaru with Stroll and Arjun Maini provisionally lining up on the seventh row of the grid. Alessio Lorandi was next up ahead of Dennis–whose air restrictor fell off his car and then suffered gearbox issues–Dorian Boccolacci, Yamashita, Santino Ferrucci and Cassidy. The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Sérgio Sette Câmara, Martin Cao, Ryan Tveter, Takaboshi, Matt Solomon, Zhi Cong Li and Wing Chung Chang. The session passed relatively smoothly, with only Sette Câmara running into the barriers, and then stopping at San Francisco Hill so he could not risk any further damage by driving back to the pit lane.|$|E

25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top with a late lap time of two minutes and 12.751 seconds. He achieved this effort despite not slipstreaming any other car and recovered the lost time through the final sections of the track. Rosenqvist ended up 0.111 seconds faster than Félix da Costa with Sims a further three-tenths of a second in arrears in third place. Harry Tincknell finished the session in fourth place with Pipo Derani following in fifth having held the lead of first qualifying in the opening minutes. Sainz ended up sixth in front of Coletti and Marciello with Korjus and Jaafar—who was forced to abort his fastest time because of red flags—rounding out the top ten. Auer was the fastest driver not {{to reach the top}} ten although he was fourth {{in the early stages of}} qualifying before other drivers improved on their best efforts. Following him were Blomqvist, King the highest-placed rookie, with Giovnazzi provisionally joining King on the seventh row. Sekiguchi was next up ahead of William Buller, Nakayama, Ocon, Katsumasa Chiyo and Nicholas Latifi. The rest of the order was completed by Bryant-Meisner, Mason, Jones, van de Laar, Sean Gelael, Lynn and Sun. Wolf did not compete a lap time during qualifying because of the damage sustained to his car in the first practice session. Lynn crashed his car at Fisherman's Bend in the opening minutes of qualifying which was temporarily halted to enable marshals to push his car in a safe location. The session ended early with one minute and 37 seconds remaining after Nakayama broke his suspension in a heavy impact with the wall at Solitude Esses corner. Nakayama was unhurt.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top {{with a time of}} two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the tyre wall and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into the fast lane of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red light signal at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the weighbridge.|$|E
