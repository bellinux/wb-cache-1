40|$|ABsrg^cr: In {{order to}} compare the {{validity}} of petrographic and isotopic techniques in determining the depositional and diagenetic history of limestones, both techniques were used on samples from a Pleistocene outcrop on Barbados, where depositional and diagenetic models are relatively simple and have well-documented recent analogues. The outcrop consists of a reasonably homogeneous grainstone cut by a discontinuity surface. The carbonate immediately {{above and below the}} discontinuity forms well-cemented layers, {{but the rest of the}} grainstone is highly permeable. Only the lower well-cemented layer contains isopachous, bladed cement. Carbon of this layer is isotopically light, and oxygen is slightly heavy. In addition, ~ ~ 80 distinctly changes across the discontinuity. Based on the cement morphology, the lower <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> formed as a submarine hardground; however, the isotopic analyses indicate evaporative precipitation of calcite at a subaerial exposure at or just above the submarine hardground following a regression. This regression and following transgression formed the discontinuity. The distinct offset of 8 t 80 values across the discontinuity indicates that the limestone above and below the discontinuity underwent mineralogical stabilization in solutions of different isotopic compositions. Diagenesis of the unit below the discontinuity preceded deposition of the unit above. The upper <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> resulted from cementation i a perched phreatic environment resting on the discontinuity. We consider these results to be generally apphcable to other hmestones.

The tests were carried out on samples enclosed in a cylindrical testing chamber, 450 mm diameter and 450 mm high, which allowed independent control of horizontal and vertical stress in the range 25 kPa to 500 kPa. The samples consisted of a loose, uncemented calcareous sand consisting predominantly of foraminifera and mollusc micro-organisms (D 50 = 0. 2 mm, calcium carbonate content 92 %). Into this was built a layer of the same material artificially cemented by a gypsum plaster. The layer had similar properties to naturally cemented deposits, and layers with unconfirmed crushing strengths in the range 500 kPa to 4000 kPa have been prepared. All samples were tested dry. Closed end model piles of 16 mm diameter were jacked at 0. 1 mm/s into the sample, and continuous profiles of end bearing capacity obtained during penetration.

The number of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> {{was related to the}} known age of the animals. It was found that the number of primary incremental lines in the cement on the lingual surface of the incisor agreed with the age of the tooth. The formation of layers on the labial surface of the teeth older than 7 years progresses irregularly. The readability of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> in bison is poor, in hybrids it is slightly better, and in cattle it is good. Due to this, counting of layers by independent investigators gives a low agreement of estimates (in bisons and hybrids about 30 %).

Thus for an estimation of the number of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> a proper part of a tooth should be chosen and some experience must be gained. Layers of secondary dentine were well visible in the part adjacent to pulp cavity, but its line at the site of meeting of the primary dentine is not distinct.

Thirty human uniradicular roots were treated endodontically.

All posts were luted with self-adhesive resin cement. The push-out test was carried out after storage for 24 h and 90 days in distilled water at 37 °C. The data were analyzed with three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (a= 0. 05). Bond strengths were significantly higher for CUSTOM (9. 37 MPa), than for THIN (7. 85 MPa) and THICK (7. 07 MPa), which were statistically similar. Considering the thirds, the bond strength varied in the sequence: apical (7. 13 MPa) < middle (8. 22 MPa) = coronal (8. 94 MPa). Bond strength for 24 h storage was significantly higher (8. 80 MPa) than for 90 -day storage (7. 40 MPa).

Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional finite element model was simulated to replace missing mandibular first molar with second premolar and second molar as abutments. The model was subjected to a range of occlusal loads (20, 30, 40 MPa) in two different directions - vertical and 30 ° to the vertical. The cements (zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, glass ionomer, and composite) were modeled with two cement thicknesses - 25 and 100 μm. Stresses were determined in certain reference points in fixed prosthesis and the <b>cement</b> <b>layer.</b> Statistical Analysis Used: The stress values are mathematic calculations without variance; hence, statistical analysis is not routinely required. Results: Stress levels were calculated according to Von Mises criteria for each node. Maximum stresses were recorded at the occlusal surface, axio-gingival corners, followed by axial wall. The stresses were greater with lateral load and with 100 -μm cement thickness. Results revealed higher stresses for zinc phosphate cement, followed by composites. Conclusions: The thinner cement interfaces favor the success of the prosthesis. The stresses in the prosthesis suggest rounding of axio-gingival corners and a well-established finish line as important factors in maintaining the integrity of the prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{fundamental}} mechanics for {{the changes in}} stresses and strains states due to groundwater pumping is formulated. This was accomplished by developing a 3 D closed form solution. The results from this research are compared with results of finite element (FE) analyses and data obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Land subsidence (LS) due to groundwater pumping from a single well for different geological profiles {{and the reason why}} LS continues after groundwater pumping cessation were investigated. FE analyses for four different scenarios were used to investigate the effects of cemented layers and non-cemented layers above the aquifer on EF initiation. A practical method which is based on the stiffness and cementation strength of the <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> and the gradient of the slope of the subsidence bowl (ɑ) was proposed to determine earth fissure (EF) initiation. Three-point bending beam test was conducted in the lab to determine the mode of failure and the modulus of rupture of a local cemented soil that occurs in areas where EFs were observed. The major findings are as follows. LS due to groundwater pumping consists of i) isotropic compression and ii) simple shear on vertical planes with rotation. For a parabolic distribution of groundwater level in a homogenous aquifer, simple shear on vertical planes will be dominant when the characteristic length of the aquifer is larger than √ 2 times the aquifer thickness. Fine-grained soils are responsible for LS occurring after the cessation of pumping and for sagging in LS profiles. Regardless of the stiffness and cementation strength of the top layer above the aquifer, EF will not initiate if ɑ is less than 8 x 10 ⁻⁵. When the stiffness of the top <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> increases, it becomes more prone to EF initiation. However if the layer is stiff enough to be classified as "rock" then a higher value of ɑ is needed to initiate an EF. The experiments show that the preferred mode of failure of a cemented soil is shear rather than bending and existing cracks significantly influence the results of EF formation...|$|E

Geochemical patterns across the boundary {{are governed by}} the source material of the spherule bed and postdepositional processes. The chemical composition and the nature of this bed indicate that it derived from melted target rocks from the Chicxulub impact structure. Ir and other typical extraterrestrial elements do not present significant e richments, which suggests that the spherule bed material derived from crustal rocks. Ir instead reaches its highest concentration i the burrow-mottled calcareous ooze above the spherule bed, suggesting that it is associated to the finest fraction deposited after the target-rock-derived material. Only the Ni and Co content show slight enrichments within theupper part of the spherule layer, although most of the trace element profiles resulted from diagenetic alteration. During the alteration of glass to smectite, the concentrations of certain trace elements, such as the rare earth elements, were severely changed.

40|$|Two {{examples}} of carbonate-beach rock formation {{have been studied}} in Tunisia and on the Bahamas. It appears evident that cementation takes place under a cover of sediment where the carbonate grains are immobilized and where primary cements are precipitated in a marine or fresh-water, phreatic or vadose environment close to the water table. Oblique beach stratification and keystone vugs (typical for the swash zone) are thus preserved. Coastal erosion exposes this preferentially <b>cemented</b> <b>layer,</b> and marine cementation in the intertidal zone further indurates the rock. Wave action often washes away the underlying non-consolidated sediment. This causes the beach rock to break into blokes which (by gravity) may glide into the subtidal zone. Except for secondary marine vadose cements, all cements types found in beach rocks also occur in other environments. The identification of ancient beach rocks should therefore not be based on cementation criteria only, but also on sedimentary structures and on stratigraphic context. Davaud Eric, Strasser André.
