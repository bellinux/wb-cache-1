40|$|One of {{the good}} qualities of a world class {{university}} is their high standard <b>examination</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper attempts to optimize the <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> in a potential world class university by minimizing the major variables: time, cost and human resources involved in the examination conduct. Covenant University, the best private university in Nigeria, {{is used as a}} case study. The <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> covering conduct of examination at Covenant University, were modelled as a linear programming with time, cost and human resources as our decision variables. The constraint, including the nonnegativity constraint, were carefully formed. The standard form of the model is solved using Simplex method {{with the aid of a}} computer software - LIP Solver, which was used to evaluate the feasible solutions from the initial tableau. It was observed that some of the decision variables such as time to correct examination questions and address examination misconducts must be deemphasized, while decision variables such as time to admit students into the examination hall and time to verify students’ identity in order to admit them into the examination hall should be given priority in order to optimize the resources related to the examination conduct at Covenant University...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore a current status of {{entrance}} <b>examination</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are applied for bachelor studies at faculties of Charles University with social science orientation (i. e. the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Arts). In first part, utilizing an analysis of relevant secondary data, the thesis deals with the description of current forms of entrance <b>examination</b> <b>procedures.</b> Besides description of current practice, the thesis further contains an analysis of stakeholders and qualitative research {{which is based on}} an analysis of interviews with representatives of faculty decision-makers, representatives of students from the faculty academic senates and students of the three analyzed faculties. The inteviews were transcribed and open-coded, which led to the sorting information into categories by theme. As a method of stakeholder analysis a "quick" analysis of stakeholders was used in order to identify the main stakeholders of the issues under investigation. Overall, the analysis of interviews shows that each faculty has different strategies and preferences for selecting students during the entrance procedure. Hence, possible consensus of entrance <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> in similar fields across the three faculties is not entirely likely, [...] ...|$|R
