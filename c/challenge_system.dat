5|$|The game, {{which was}} {{developed}} using Marvel Super Heroes and Clash of Super Heroes arcade ROMs, aimed {{to maintain the}} integrity of their original releases. As such, no changes were made to gameplay mechanics or character balance. Origins introduces high-definition visuals with multiple options for filters and viewing angles. It implements GGPO-enhanced online multiplayer with player lobbies, spectating, and replay saving. It also incorporates a <b>challenge</b> <b>system</b> which awards points used to unlock concept art, secret characters, and other content.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} {{models of the}} Challenge. The first model, simply known as the [...] "Challenge" [...] used the 64-bit R4400. With {{the introduction of the}} R8000, the Challenge was upgraded to support more processors and memory as well as featuring support for this new processor. Such systems are known as the [...] "POWER Challenge". During the final years of the Challenge architecture's useful life, the line was upgraded to support R10000 microprocessors. Older <b>Challenge</b> <b>systems</b> using the R10000 were known as the [...] "Challenge 10000", while the newer POWER <b>Challenge</b> <b>systems</b> using the R10000 were known as the [...] "POWER Challenge 10000".|$|R
50|$|Exercising TDD on large, <b>challenging</b> <b>systems</b> {{requires}} a modular architecture, well-defined components with published interfaces, and disciplined system layering with maximization of platform independence.

25|$|A {{proposal}} in 1912 that the Shield should {{be decided by}} an inter-provincial tournament {{rather than by the}} <b>challenge</b> <b>system</b> was rejected as impracticable at the time. However, starting with the 1921–22 season, the four principal teams (minus Hawke's Bay, which lost first-class status) played each other in a single round-robin series of matches. Central Districts entered the competition in 1950–51, and Northern Districts in 1956–57.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two {{exceptions}} are that from 1908 to 1961 the server {{had to keep}} {{one foot on the}} ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point <b>challenge</b> <b>system,</b> which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.|$|E
25|$|Three {{gameplay}} modes are included, Story, Online, and Party. Story mode {{is played}} by one player as they progress through the game's main campaign. Online play features new levels, challenges and online leaderboards. Up to four players can join in for simultaneous gameplay for Party mode. Fourteen different vehicles are available, and includes over 100 levels. Bonus levels are often interchanged by the developer. Popular levels stay in play longer while those less popular are replaced by new or previous creations. Each level is roughly 20 kilobytes in size, and approximately 50 were created to be interchanged post-launch. Each level remains online for 12–24 hours and features a score-based <b>challenge</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} a beta-propiolactone (BPL) -inactivated coxsackievirus A 16 (CA 16) vaccine, using three immunogenicity evaluation and two animal <b>challenge</b> <b>systems.</b> A CA 16 virus strain, named 419, was used as the production strain. Another CA 16 strain, named 1131, was isolated an used as the challenge strain in intracerebral inoculation of neonatal mice for the calculation of median lethal dose (LD 50). In the passive and maternal antibody-protection <b>challenge</b> <b>systems,</b> all results indicated that the vaccine could protect mouse pups from lethal challenge with the CA 16 virus. In the immunogenicity systems, three types of animal (mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey), were immunized with the 419 /CA 16 vaccine. The dose-effect relationship and the antibody-generation routine were described. The CA 16 vaccine induced a more potent serum antibody effect in rat than in mouse. The serum antibody titer was detectable more than 63 days after the initial vaccination. We also identified tools to evaluate the effect of the BPL-inactivated CA 16 vaccine.

25|$|The 1913 season saw major {{improvement}} {{in which the}} team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the 1913 grand final by Fitzroy. At the time a <b>challenge</b> <b>system</b> was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series {{if it was not}} the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against South Melbourne and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda – the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point – and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).|$|E
25|$|The Ranfurly Shield, colloquially {{known as}} the Log o' Wood, {{is perhaps the most}} prestigious trophy in New Zealand's {{domestic}} rugby union competition. First presented to Auckland in 1902, the Shield is based on a <b>challenge</b> <b>system,</b> rather than a league or knockout competition as with most football trophies. The holding union must defend the Shield in challenge matches, and a successful challenger becomes the new holder of the Shield. The Shield holder {{at the end of each}} season is required to accept at least seven challenges for the following year. All home games during league play, but not during knockout playoffs, in the Mitre 10 Cup or Heartland Championship are automatic challenges. The remaining Shield defences must be made up of challenges from unions in the other domestic competition. For example, since North Harbour, an Air New Zealand Cup team, held the Shield at the end of the 2006 season despite losing their home quarter-final to Otago, they were forced to defend the Shield against Heartland Championship teams during the 2007 pre-season. Having successfully done so, all their home fixtures in the round-robin phase were Shield defences until they lost the shield to Waikato. The Shield is currently held by Canterbury, who won it from Waikato in the 2016 Mitre 10 Cup.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{accepted}} by governing bodies in tennis, cricket and association football as a technological means of adjudication. Hawk-Eye {{is used for the}} <b>Challenge</b> <b>System</b> since 2006 in tennis and Umpire Decision Review System in cricket since 2009. The system was rolled out for the 2013-14 Premier League season as a means of goal-line technology.

In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. The US Open, Miami Masters, US Open Series, and World Team Tennis started using this <b>challenge</b> <b>system</b> in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, the ICC began trialling a <b>challenge</b> <b>system</b> in International Matches. This {{works as}} follows; When a {{decision}} has been made by the on-field umpire (either out or not-out), then either the batsmen or fielding player (depending on which way the decision went), can decide to refer the decision to the Third Umpire. This is signalled by making a [...] "T" [...] symbol with the arms. The Third Umpire can then use only basic technology to judge whether there is any reason to overrule the on-field umpires decision. If the Third Umpire decides that the on-field umpire made an incorrect decision then he will inform the on-field umpire, via headsets, of what he has seen and tell him to either change his decision or to stay with his original decision. This system is normally only used for LBW (to determine if the delivery meets all the LBW criteria) or close catch decisions (to determine if the ball had made contact with the bat or gloves and thus been [...] "hit" [...] and that the ball was caught cleanly).|$|E
