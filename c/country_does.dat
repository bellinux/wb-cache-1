5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

25|$|Discounting to face value: Before {{national}} currencies {{and efficient}} clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable {{at face value}} at the issuing bank. Even a branch bank could discount notes of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the issuing bank. The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but sometimes became worthless. The problem of discounting within a <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not exist with national currencies; however, under floating exchange rates currencies are valued relative {{to one another in}} the foreign exchange market.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{different}} languages are spoken in Tanzania, {{making it the}} most linguistically diverse country in East Africa. The <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not have a de jure official language, although the national language is Swahili. Swahili is used in parliamentary debate, in the lower courts, and as a medium of instruction in primary school. English is used in foreign trade, in diplomacy, in higher courts, and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education, although the Tanzanian government is planning to discontinue English as a language of instruction altogether. Approximately 10 percent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language, and up to 90 percent speak it as a second language.|$|E
500|$|The republican {{institutions}} {{of our country}} [...] have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva {{does not mean the}} same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate <b>country,</b> <b>does</b> not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being." ...|$|E

500|$|... no {{data was}} {{available}} {{for the number of}} women's football players in the country. In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team. In 2008, the situation for women's football in the Middle East was said by author Gary Brecher to be up there in popularity of freedom and democracy in the region. An all-women's school sporting competition was held at Effat University in 2010. The tournament was investigated by Saudi authorities because, according to Ahmed al-Zahrani, director of the Girls Education Department in Jeddah, the <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not have [...] "any regulations that say that it's okay for girl schools to hold sports classes or training". In 2011, women's football was seen as a way to combat a growing problem of obesity in the country.|$|E
500|$|According to Ganesan, {{the main}} theme of Andha Naal is patriotism; {{for him the}} film {{suggests}} that if a <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not appreciate its talented young men's efforts, they could turn against the nation. Regarding the more personal undertones, Ganesan said that the film tells how unemployment and desolation can lead young people to become traitors. Rajan becomes a traitor by selling Indian secrets to Japan because his idea {{was rejected by the}} Indian government. According to Guy, Andha Naal reuses the thematic line of the 1946 Tamil film Chitra: [...] "a person sending secret messages to the enemy through radio". Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai compared Pandari Bai's [...] "ideologically driven" [...] character Usha in the film to her character in Parasakthi, but in the former, [...] "it is the idea of the Indian nation that she pledges her allegiance to." [...] The Times of India compared Andha Naal to Citizen Kane (1941) for its similar lighting and camera angles.|$|E
500|$|Choe {{wrote in}} the usual tone of a learned Confucian scholar, which {{provides}} insight into the values and attitudes of early Joseon Confucian scholars. Choe Bu's account is unique among foreign travel accounts in China, since {{it is from the}} perspective of a castaway, not a commonplace Korean ambassador to Ming China. Historian Eugene Newton Anderson notes that, while pre-modern Koreans tended to adulate China and associate it with everything that was positive, Choe regarded it with a more objective outsider's perspective. When curious Chinese pressed Choe about Korea's rituals of ancestor worship, Choe responded, [...] "All my countrymen build shrines and sacrifice to their ancestors. They serve the gods and spirits they ought to serve and do not respect unorthodox sacrifices." [...] Historian Laurel Kendall writes that this was perhaps wishful thinking, but it reveals what a 15th-century Korean Confucian thought the Chinese would consider proper and in accordance with the teaching of Confucius. When a certain Chinese scholar Wang Yiyuan sympathized with Choe and his party's plight and served him tea, he asked Choe if the Koreans revered the Buddha as the Chinese did. Choe answered, [...] "my <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not revere the Buddhist law, it honors only the Confucian system. All its families make filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and sincerity their concern." ...|$|E
