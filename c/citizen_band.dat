25|$|In {{the same}} treaty, the Seminoles {{were the first}} tribe {{relocated}} to the ceded Creek land. Several tribes of Eastern Indians were also moved to {{the eastern end of}} the ceded Creek land. The Absentee Shawnee and <b>Citizen</b> <b>Band</b> of Pottawatomi shared a reserve; also, the Sac and Fox. Later, the Kickapoo were moved in and, lastly, the Iowa. The combined Cheyenne Arapaho tribe was given the western end of the Creek and Seminole land along with some land ceded from the other tribes. Most of the former Creek and Seminole land, as was true for the rest of central and western Indian Territory, was leased from the Indian tribes by large cattle ranching companies.|$|E
500|$|The Tenth Circuit Court {{affirmed the}} {{decision}} of the district court. [...] First the court noted that the reservation boundaries were not relevant to the case, the issue instead being tribal immunity from state jurisdiction. [...] The court noted the prior Supreme Court decision in Okla. Tax Comm'n v. <b>Citizen</b> <b>Band,</b> Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla. and stated that [...] "It appears as though the State of Oklahoma persists in fighting a battle it has already lost." [...] Since Oklahoma could provide no Congressional authority for collecting taxes from Sac and Fox tribal members {{it was clear that the}} state had exceeded its authority. [...] On the income tax for non-tribal employees, the Sac and Fox Nation asserted that the Commerce Clause and treaty language granted it exclusive taxing authority on tribal land. [...] The appellate court was not persuaded and ruled that the state could impose an income tax on non-tribal members.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Citizens</b> <b>band</b> radio (also {{known as}} CB radio) is, in many countries, {{a system of}} short-distance radio {{communications}} between individuals typically on a selection of 40 channels within the 27 MHz (11 m) <b>band.</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>band</b> is distinct from other personal radio service allocations such as FRS, GMRS, MURS, UHF CB and the Amateur Radio Service ("ham" [...] radio). In many countries, CB operation {{does not require a}} license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other two-way radio services, <b>citizens</b> <b>band</b> channels are shared by many users. Only one station may transmit at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available. It is customary for stations waiting to use a shared channel to broadcast the single word [...] "Break" [...] during a lull in the conversation. [...] This informs people using the channel that others are waiting.|$|R
