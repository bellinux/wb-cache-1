50|$|Tribal Style today {{represents}} {{everything from}} Folkloric inspired dances (such {{as the original}} Bal Anat) to a fusion of ancient dance techniques from North India, the Middle East, Spain and Africa. As a general category, Tribal Style covers many flavors of American Belly Dance both the folkloric inspired and fusion and <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> <b>styles</b> which explore modern, jazz, dance theatre, and hip hop with belly dance, as well as fusion with traditional classical ethnic dance forms like Bhangra, Bharata Natyam, Flamenco and now even Polynesian and West African Dance.|$|R
5|$|Though {{electric}} guitars {{had been}} used by industrial artists {{since the early days}} of the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as Throbbing Gristle displayed a strong anti-rock stance. British post-punk band Killing Joke pioneered the <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between <b>styles,</b> and was an influence on major industrial metal bands such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Nine Inch Nails. Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.|$|R
50|$|Often called Oliver Momm Jahresmix, {{these were}} the year end megamixes, <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> all <b>styles,</b> {{beginning}} with slow R'n'B and hip hop tunes, ending in techno, trance and progressive house tunes. These megamixes extended on average over 70 to 80 tunes, many {{for just a few}} seconds, partially a cappella. Momm said that these Gigamixes took more time than a usual Partymix; four to five weeks was the time range to present a brilliant year end mix.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} success of Eraserheads {{paved the way}} for more Pinoy rock acts such as Rivermaya, Rizal Underground and The Youth getting record deals. Some brave all-female bands got signed (Kelt's Cross, Tribal Fish, Agaw Agimat) and a few solo artists as well (Maegan Aguilar, Bayang Barrios, DJ Alvaro). Rappers <b>crossed</b> <b>over</b> with great success (Francis M with Hardware Syndrome and Erectus), despite some earlier controversy with hip hop-bashing allegedly incited by some artists. These bands adopted a variety of influences both in image and music; many fell under a particular genre; however, the <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> of <b>styles</b> was most often inevitable.|$|R
50|$|Before long, {{groups and}} musicians like Horslips, Van Morrison and even Thin Lizzy were {{incorporating}} elements of traditional music into a rock idiom {{to form a}} unique new sound. During the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between these <b>styles</b> of playing {{as a matter of}} course. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of bands like U2, Snow Patrol, The Cranberries, The Undertones and The Corrs.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} prevalence of Western culture throughout the world, {{certain aspects of}} culture resist the mixing that naturally comes with ease of accessibility to {{every corner of the}} world. Though music from wildly disparate backgrounds is constantly being fused together now to create fascinating new sounds and styles, and although composers of various nationalities have begun <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> to different <b>styles,</b> some more conservative cultures resist such mélanges. Indian music has a rich history of its own, a tale of the gradual layering of the music of different peoples inhabiting the Indian subcontinent. In itself, it varies region by region, as different immediate lifestyles have molded particular branches. One thing is clear, however: that the Indian style is distinctive from its Western congeners, and that while crossovers are not impossible, the resulting style is recognizably neither Indian nor Western in nature. Composers of Indian classical music often do not receive the kind of credit given to Western composers. The simplest reason for this lies in the manner of performing such music. The composer rarely lends great genius to a classical work...|$|R
500|$|Irish {{traditional}} {{music and dance}} has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, {{traditional music}} {{had fallen out of}} favour, especially in urban areas. However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as The Dubliners, The Chieftains, The Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney's Men and individuals like Seán Ó Riada and Christy Moore. Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between these <b>styles</b> of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, The Saw Doctors, The Corrs, Sinéad O'Connor, Clannad, The Cranberries and The Pogues among others. Since then {{there have been a number}} of stylistic fusions including folk metal and others, while some contemporary music groups stick closer to a [...] "traditional" [...] sound.|$|R
