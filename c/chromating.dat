Cerium-based {{conversion}} coatings {{are being}} investigated as alternatives to <b>chromating</b> treatments for the corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys {{because of the}} environmentally unfriendly nature of the <b>chromating</b> process. This study investigates the surface film composition, structure and corrosion performance following a two-step surface treatment for an AA 2024 -T 3 clad aluminium alloy. The two-step treatment comprised of an initial cerium conversion process involving immersion in an aqueous solution containing Ce 3 + ions at 75 °C followed by immersion in a propylene glycol solution at 75 °C. The coating surface morphology, composition and structure have been studied using SEM, XPS, Auger spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while corrosion resistance was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The coating formed by the two-step treatment is an interconnecting fibrous (pseudo) boehmite layer with the incorporation of Ce 3 + in the film. This two step treatment coating exhibits high impedance compared with the coatings formed through exposure to just stage 1 or stage 2 of the two-step treatment and shows good potential for improved corrosion protection...|$|E

Different types of zincplated surfaces have been investigated. Selected hybrid polymer nano-composites have been applied on various zinc surfaces in a dip coating process and finally provided with a standard polyester powder coating. The performance of these samples have then been compared with relevant, commercially available anti-corrosion systems in defined test procedures in order to assess the adhesion strength and the degree of corrosion of the laminated composites. In addition, the deformability behaviour in bending and deep-drawing processes has been examined. Especially on electro-galvanized surfaces, samples with the newly developed hybrid nanomaterials exhibited good adhesion and corrosion-protection characteristics after 360 h in the salt spray test (DIN EN ISO 9227 -NSS). Test samples coated with these hybrid materials and covered with polyester powder could easily be bended and deep-drawn, no matter what type of galvanization had been applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cr(VI) (<b>chromate)</b> is a widespread, toxic and soluble {{environmental}} contaminant. Bacteria {{can reduce}} <b>chromate</b> to insoluble and less toxic Cr(III), and thus <b>chromate</b> bioremediation is of interest. Genetic and protein engineering of suitable enzymes can improve bacterial bioremediation. However, many fundamental parameters that define an organism’s capacity to remediate <b>chromate</b> have not previously been characterized. We have measured the innate {{ability of a}} wide range of bacteria to reduce <b>chromate.</b> All bacteria that we tested were able to reduce Cr(VI) through to stable Cr(III) end-products. One of these, Pseudomonas putida MK 1, is a promising candidate for <b>chromate</b> bioremediation, and we show that <b>chromate</b> transformation per mass unit increases in these cells as the environmental <b>chromate</b> concentration rises. However, bacterial growth is inhibited by <b>chromate</b> concentrations above 0. 8 mM. Furthermore, although cell extracts show increased <b>chromate</b> reductase activity under slow-growth conditions (mimicking nutrient-limited field conditions), the ability of the whole cells to transform <b>chromate</b> is greatly diminished. <b>Chromate</b> reduction by both whole cells and purified ChrR (a P. putida <b>chromate</b> reductase) is also inhibited by co-pollutants of chromate-contaminated sites. Thus, these studies identify several potential areas of improvement for generation of improved chromate-remediating bacteria...|$|R

40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is used {{to analyse}} variations during exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) in the chemical composition of the outer surface of organic coatings (lacquers) containing phosphating or <b>chromating</b> reagents applied on galvanised steel, galvanneal and galfan substrates.

In general, the formation of defects or the loss of adhesion of the lacquer film leads to a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance values and, at the same time, an increase in interfacial capacitance values. The special behaviour of the galfan/lacquer >with <b>chromating</b> reagents> system is associated with the presence of a thin insulating film of chromium and aluminium oxides {{at the base of the}} pores in the lacquer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a <b>chromating</b> process, in which different anodes are used for deposition and oxidation of Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, in which the oxidation anode as above is used. USE - Used for regenerating solutions containing chromic acid by anodic oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) in electrolytic <b>chromating</b> baths, which are used for electroplating, chromation, etching e. g. acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastics and anodizing e. g. aluminum. ADVANTAGE - Chromium plating is normally carried out with lead anodes, which combine a double function, as counter-electrode (working electrode) and oxidation anode. In anodic operation, it becomes coated with lead dioxide. However, lead anodes form sludge and have limited dimensional stability. Various coated titanium anodes avoid this problem but have other drawbacks, including the need to add lead. The novel apparatus with the diamond-coated oxidation anode ensures effective oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) without costly maintenance procedures. The process is flexible and simple, even with complex geometries and structures, e. g. internal in plating of pipes and it eliminates the need to add lead and its associated drawbacks...|$|E
