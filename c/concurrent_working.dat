40|$|Appraisal {{refers to}} the {{evaluation}} of the meaning of emotional stimuli and is considered causal in the generation of an emotional response. Cognitive neuroscience has paid little attention to a theoretical distinction between low-level appraisal, considered to be automatic and preattentive, and high-level appraisal that requires attentional and working memory resources. To disentangle low-level from high-level appraisal, we varied cognitive load in a <b>concurrent,</b> unrelated <b>working</b> memory task, while anxiety was induced through anticipation of impending pain. Confirming theoretical predictions, we show that anxiety-related activity in dorsal medial prefrontal/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (dorsal MPFC/ACC) is attenuated under high, relative to low, cognitive load. Lateral prefrontal regions previously implicated in reappraisal and cognitive emotion regulation show a similar interaction between anxiety and cognitive load. Critically, there were no changes in physiological and subjective measures of low-level appraisal outcome and emotional response generation as a function of load, allowing us to conclude that MPFC/ACC and lateral PFC activity during anticipatory anxiety reflects high-level appraisal. Our data provide neurobiological evidence for a distinction between low-level and high-level appraisal mechanisms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

We consider the following verification problem: given a family of series-parallel graphs described by a context-free graph transformation system (GTS), and a concurrent automaton over series-parallel graphs, is some graph generated by the GTS accepted by the automaton? The general problem is undecidable already for (one-way) multi-head automata over strings. We show that a bounded version, where the automata make a fixed number of reversals along the graph and use a fixed number of shared registers is decidable, {{even though there is}} no bound on the sizes of series-parallel graphs generated by the GTS. Our decidability result is based on establishing that the number of context switches is bounded and on an encoding of the computation of bounded concurrent automata to reduce the emptiness problem to the emptiness problem for pushdown automata.

In Experiment 1, participants focused their attention on continuous target vibrations while attempting to ignore pulsed distractor vibrations. In Experiment 2, targets were always presented to a particular hand, with distractors being presented to the other hand. In both experiments, a high (vs. low) load in a <b>concurrent</b> <b>working</b> memory task led to greater interference by the tactile distractors.

40|$|The perceptual {{load and}} {{dilution}} models differ fundamentally {{in terms of}} the proposed mechanism underlying variation in distractibility during different perceptual conditions. However, both models predict that distracting information can be processed beyond perceptual processing under certain conditions, a prediction that is well-supported by the literature. Load theory proposes that in such cases, where perceptual task aspects do not allow for sufficient attentional selectivity, the maintenance of task-relevant processing depends on cognitive control mechanisms, including working memory. The key prediction is that working memory plays a role in keeping clear processing priorities in the face of potential distraction, and the evidence reviewed and evaluated in a meta-analysis here supports this claim, by showing that the processing of distracting information tends to be enhanced when load on a <b>concurrent</b> task of <b>working</b> memory is high. Low working memory capacity is similarly associated with greater distractor processing in selective attention, again suggesting that the unavailability of working memory during selective attention leads to an increase in distractibility. Together, these findings suggest that selective attention against distractors that are processed beyond perception depends on the availability of working memory. Possible mechanisms for the effects of working memory on selective attention are discussed...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIncreasing {{evidence}} suggests that walking while performing a concurrent task negatively influences gait performance. However, it remains unclear how higher-level cognitive processes and coordination of limb movements are altered in challenging walking environments. This study investigated the influence of cognitive task complexity and walking road condition on the neutral correlates of executive function and postural control in dual-task walking. MethodsTwenty-four healthy young adults completed a series of overground walks with three walking road conditions (wide, narrow, with obstacles) with and without the <b>concurrent</b> n-back <b>working</b> memory tasks of two complexity levels (1 -back and 3 -back). Prefrontal brain activation was assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. A three-dimensional motion analysis system was used simultaneously to measure gait performance and lower-extremity kinematics. Repeated measures analysis of variance were performed to examine {{the differences between the}} conditions. ResultsIn comparison with standing still, participants showed lower n-back task accuracy while walking, with the worst performance from the road with obstacles. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, lower-extremity joint movements, and the relative changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration levels were all significantly different across the task complexity and walking path conditions. While dual-tasking participants were found to flex their hips and knees less, leading to a slower gait speed, longer stride time, shorter step length, and greater gait variability than during normal walking. For narrow-road walking, smaller ankle dorsiflexion and larger hip flexion were observed, along with a reduced gait speed. Obstacle negotiation was mainly characterized by increased gait variability than other conditions. HbO levels appeared to be lower during dual-task walking than normal walking. Compared to wide and obstacle conditions, walking on the narrow road was found to elicit a smaller decrement in HbO levels. ConclusionsThe current study provided direct evidence that, in young adults, neural correlates of executive function and dynamic postural control tend to be altered in response to the cognitive load imposed by the walking environment and the concurrent task during ambulation. A shift of brain activation patterns between functionally connected networks may occur when facing challenging cognitive-motor interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} intuition has captivated the {{attention}} of many in both academic and conversational contexts. While most agree that intuition is characterized as an emotional, rapid, and non-conscious process, scientific evidence for the mechanisms underlying intuition is largely non-existent. Here, we introduce a novel technique in which subliminal emotional information is presented while participants make concurrent fully conscious sensory decisions. Participants were instructed to make decisions regarding the global direction of a noisy moving-dot stimulus, which was presented simultaneously with suppressed emotional images. Our 1 st study provides behavioral data and physiological measures which demonstrate that non-conscious emotional information boosted accuracy and confidence in the concurrent emotion-free decision task. Further, a computational model of simple decision-making suggests that sensory and emotional information were integrated into a single stream of evidence to make decisions. Together with skin conductance data, a trend emerged demonstrating that the boost from emotional information was modulated {{as a function of}} decision difficulty. These findings support the notion that non-conscious emotion can bias concurrent non-emotional behaviour – a process otherwise known as intuition. The 2 nd study found that a psychological questionnaire commonly used to assess intuitive susceptibility could also predict the utilization of non-conscious emotional information in the decision task. In addition, we found distinct patterns of behavioural and physiological data for different thinking styles. For example, 'intuitive thinkers' relied heavily on non-conscious emotional information, while 'rational thinkers' showed the opposite pattern of behaviour. In our last study, the 3 rd study, by introducing a <b>concurrent</b> standard <b>working</b> memory task in our sensory decision paradigm, we found that the utilization of non-conscious emotional information was optimized during higher cognitive loads. Further, these data also support the existence of two cognitive systems in human behavior: a rational system and an experiential/intuitive system.

30|$|To study visual {{foraging}} as {{a function}} of age, we used a newly developed task by Kristjánsson et al. (2014). They studied visual foraging of adults using an iPad display consisting of 80 stimuli, from four stimulus categories, two of which were targets and two were distractors. The participants were instructed to find and tap all targets from both categories as quickly as possible, while avoiding tapping any distractors. While in most previous foraging studies visual salience was used to manipulate selection behavior (e.g. Bond, 1982; Dawkins, 1971), Kristjánsson et al. (2014) contrasted feature versus conjunction foraging to manipulate attentional load. In their feature condition, targets and distractors were defined by a single feature dimension (color), while in the conjunction condition, targets were defined by both color and shape. During feature foraging, participants randomly switched between target categories, while during conjunction foraging, most participants repeatedly selected targets from the same category (see also Jóhannesson et al., 2016). Kristjánsson et al. (2014) speculated whether this reflects that participants can simultaneously hold two features in working memory, while most participants cannot keep four features and their relation simultaneously in working memory. Interestingly, a small proportion of participants, termed “super-foragers,” could switch randomly between target categories during conjunction foraging, without either increases in error rates nor response times (see also Socé, Cain, & Wolfe, 2016, where observers switch rapidly between two target types during multiple-target search). These findings ran counter to predictions of theories which assume that only a single search template can be held in working memory at a time (see e.g. Huang & Pashler, 2007; Olivers, Peters, Houtkamp, & Roelfsema, 2011; van Moorselaar, Theeuwes, & Olivers, 2014). Working memory has, indeed, been shown to influence both visual search for pop-out targets and more difficult targets (Soto, Heinke, Humphreys, & Blanco, 2005; Soto, Humphreys, & Heinke, 2006). Kristjánsson, Saevarsson, and Driver (2013) showed how visual search performance is influenced by a <b>concurrent</b> visual <b>working</b> memory task among adults (see also Lee, Mozer, & Vecera, 2009) which has also been seen for verbal working memory (Soto & Humphreys, 2007).|$|R
