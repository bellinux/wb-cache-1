40|$|GFP and a FRET <b>compatible</b> <b>dye</b> {{were used}} to assess the {{influence}} of genetically encoded aryl azide positioning on Click chemistry-based protein conjugation. While modification efficiency of the sampled mutants using a strain promoted reaction varied by as much as [similar] 10 fold, there was no simple correlation with accessibility of the aryl azide on GFP's surface. One labeled GFP mutant (Gln 204 AzPhe) exhibited high efficiency FRET ([similar] 90 %) and an unprecedented pseudo-Stokes shift of 126 nm...|$|E
30|$|<b>Compatible</b> <b>dyeing</b> {{performance}} requires careful {{control of}} the dyeing parameters such as temperature, salt and alkali concentrations, the dyeing time and the liquor ratio. There is often a doubt about the particular reactive group presents in a reactive dye.

40|$|Anthocyanins {{as natural}} {{pigments}} are colorful and environmentally <b>compatible</b> <b>dyes</b> for {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSSCs). To increase the efficiency, we designed and synthesized unnatural O-methylflavonols and O-methylcyanidins that possess an aryl group at the 8 -position. We synthesized per-O-methylquercetin from quercetin, then using selective demethylation prepared various O-methylquercetins. Using the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, 8 -arylation of per-O-methylquercetin was achieved. Using a LiAlH 4 reduction or Clemmensen reduction, these flavonols were transformed to the corresponding cyanidin derivatives in satisfactory yields. Using these dyes, we fabricated DSSCs, and their efficiency was investigated. The efficiency of tetra-O-methylflavonol was 0. 31 %. However, {{the introduction of the}} 8 -aryl residue increased the efficiency to 1. 04 %. In comparison to these flavonols, O-methylcyanidins exhibited a lower efficiency of 0. 05 % to 0. 52 %. The introduction of the 8 -aryl group into the cyanidin derivatives did not result in a remarkable increase in the efficiency. These phenomena {{may be due to the}} poor fit of the HOMO-LUMO level of the dyes to the TiO 2 conduction band...|$|R
40|$|Major {{barriers}} to achieving progress in gynaecological cancer management are limitations in ovarian cancer treatment and morbidity related to lymphadenectomy {{in early stage}} cervical, vulval and endometrial cancers. The main morbidity of treatments for early endometrial, cervical and vulval cancers is surgery. Currently, all patients with high-Â­âgrade endometrial cancers, cervical cancers and squamous cell cancers of the vulva receive a complete regional lymphadenectomy. Complete lymphadenectomy causes significant morbidity, affecting the long-Â­âterm {{quality of life for}} these patients. There has been an emphasis on sentinel node biopsy to eliminate these morbidities, and some cancer centres already provide sentinel lymph node biopsy using radioactive isotopes, without compromising patient survival. Our study mainly focuses on a novel imaging technique using near infrared (NIR) with <b>compatible</b> <b>dyes.</b> We demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of using intraoperative NIR for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Advanced ovarian cancer management involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. The aim of surgery is to remove all visible disease before commencing chemotherapy or mid-Â­âway during chemotherapy. Limitations to radical surgery are the unpredictability of radicality from available imaging modalities and patient morbidity. Limitations to chemotherapy are the limited response or resistance, mainly due to tumour heterogeneity. Our ovarian cancer pilot study aims to explore methods that could overcome the limitations of surgical planning prior to radical surgery and to identify tumour resistance in specific tumour sites by tracking the tumours during chemotherapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{plasticity}} of the cytoskeleton {{architecture and}} membrane properties {{is important for}} the establishment of cell polarity, adhesion and migration. Here, we present a method which combines stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution imaging and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to correlate cytoskeletal structural information with membrane physical properties in live astrocytes. Using STED <b>compatible</b> <b>dyes</b> for live cell imaging of the cytoskeleton, and simultaneously mapping the cell surface topology with AFM, we obtain unprecedented detail of highly organized networks of actin and microtubules in astrocytes. Combining mechanical data from AFM with optical imaging of actin and tubulin further reveals links between cytoskeleton organization and membrane properties. Using this methodology we illustrate that scratch-induced migration induces cytoskeleton remodeling. The latter is caused by a polarization of actin and microtubule elements within astroglial cell processes, which correlates strongly with changes in cell stiffness. The method opens new avenues for the dynamic probing of the membrane structural and functional plasticity of living brain cells. It is a powerful tool for providing new insights into mechanisms of cell structural remodeling during physiological or pathological processes, such as brain development or tumorigenesis.

40|$|Dynamic imaging of {{neuronal}} {{function is}} one of the main techniques capable of resolving the emergent function of brain circuits, but no single technique is sufficient to capture all levels of information necessary to understand these networks. Specifically, calcium indicators can measure action potentials from individual neurons but are unable to detect membrane potential dynamics of the cell body and dendrites. In contrast, voltage sensitive dye imaging can measure neuronal transmembrane voltage changes occurring during synaptic activation, but is often unable to detect action potential firing in individual neurons within heterogeneous networks. I combined calcium and voltage imaging to create a novel imaging technique that merges the strengths of both methods to more completely evaluate the overall behavior of a network, allowing me to resolve both synaptic potentials and action potential firing in hippocampus microcircuits. ^ I built a system that combined two-photon excitation microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy in order to image voltage and calcium signals from the same tissue using the same objective lens. Integration of these imaging modalities required optimization of <b>compatible</b> <b>dyes,</b> lenses, filters, and custom development of analytical software. Implementation of this integrated microscope allowed me to image both calcium and voltage signals from multi-stained hippocampal slices with minimal interference between the two modalities. ^ I next investigated the postnatal development of circuit function of the hippocampal dentate gyrus using the combined calcium and voltage imaging system. I found that the gating function of the dentate exhibited a prolonged maturation, which could contribute to altered behavioral characteristics evident in mouse pups relative to adult animals. I also found that granule cells exhibit precise, deterministic firing characteristics at all ages. In addition, I found strong asymmetry in cellular activation within the infra- and suprapyramidal blades of the dentate gyrus. ^ This new microscope is capable of imaging dynamic circuit activity in virtually any tissue in the brain or spinal cord, revealing both network and individual neural properties. This is critical in elucidating mechanisms underlying both healthy function and disease states in these various microcircuits. This knowledge can help guide efforts directed towards development of effective preventative methods as well as improve our current treatment strategies in various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. ...|$|R
40|$|The photophysical {{properties}} of two recently reported live cell <b>compatible,</b> DNA-binding <b>dyes,</b> 4, 6 -bis(4 -(4 -methylpiperazin- 1 -yl) phenyl) pyrimidin- 2 -ol, 1, and [1, 3 -bis[4 -(4 -methylpiperazin- 1 -yl) phenyl]- 1, 3 -propandioato-kappa O, kappa O']difluoroboron, 2, are characterized. Both dyes are quenched in aqueous solutions, while binding to sequences containing only AT pairs enhances the emission. Binding of the dyes to sequences containing only GC pairs {{does not produce}} a significant emission enhancement, and for sequences containing both AT and GC base pairs, emission {{is dependent on the}} length of the AT pair tracts. Through emission lifetime measurements and analysis of the dye redox potentials, photoinduced electron transfer with GC pairs is implicated as a quenching mechanism. Binding of the dyes to AT-rich regions is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of 26 and 30 nm, respectively. Excitation at longer wavelengths thus increases the ON/OFF ratio of the bound probes significantly and provides improved contrast ratios in solution as well as in fluorescence microscopy of living cells...|$|R
30|$|Overall, the {{performances}} of the natural pigment based solar cells are still less compared to conventional ruthenium-based DSSC and further optimization is necessary to improve the performance of these solar cells. The present DSSC components are optimized for synthetic dyes. These components (such as the electrolyte and the photocatalytic TiO 2) {{need to be replaced}} with materials that are more <b>compatible</b> with natural <b>dyes</b> to improve their stability. In summary, although natural dye-sensitized solar cells offer a low-cost option for entry into the commercial market of solar cells, there still remains large scope for further development of this technology to ensure their repeatability and reliability for the purpose of commercialization.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of molecular materials for conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuels {{is one of}} the most active research areas, in which the light absorber plays a key role. In this article, we present a class of photo-sensitizers constituted by heteroleptic bis-diimine copper(I) complexes, whose features rely on their tunable MLCT excited states and earth abundant and environmentally friendly nature of copper. These properties make this class of <b>dyes</b> <b>compatible</b> with a sustainable development. Their synthesis through the HETPHEN strategy and the background of their photophysical properties as well as the recent advances in the fields of both dye-sensitized solar cells and photoinduced charge separation are presented. The presented examples prove that bis-diimine copper(I) complexes are valuable dyes to be used to build multicomponent arrays for long range electron transfer and for dye-sensitized solar cells. These examples illustrate that one major advantage of heteroleptic complexes is the possibility to finely tune their opto-electronic properties to a larger extent than homoleptic complexes...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{mapping of}} Ca 2 +-sensitive {{fluorescence}} probes {{has become an}} extremely useful approach and adopted by many cardiovascular research laboratories to study a spectrum of myocardial physiology and disease conditions. Optical mapping data are often displayed as detailed pseudocolor images, providing unique insight for interpreting mechanisms of ectopic activity, action potential and Ca 2 + transient alternans, tachycardia, and fibrillation. Ca 2 +-sensitive fluorescent probes and optical mapping systems continue to evolve in the ongoing effort to improve therapies that ease the growing worldwide burden of cardiovascular disease. In this technical review we provide an updated overview of conventional approaches for optical mapping of Cai 2 + within intact myocardium. In doing so, {{a brief history of}} Cai 2 + probes is provided, and nonratiometric and ratiometric Ca 2 + probes are discussed, including probes for imaging sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + and probes <b>compatible</b> with potentiometric <b>dyes</b> for dual optical mapping. Typical measurements derived from optical Cai 2 + signals are explained, and the analytics used to compute them are presented. Last, recent studies using Cai 2 + optical mapping to study arrhythmias, heart failure, and metabolic perturbations are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{autofluorescence}} {{background of}} biological samples impedes {{the detection of}} single molecules when imaging. The most common method of reducing the background is to use evanescent field excitation, which is incompatible with imaging beyond the surface of biological samples. An alternative would be to use probes that can be excited in the near infra-red region of the spectrum, where autofluorescence is low. Such probes could also {{increase the number of}} labels that can be imaged in multicolour single molecule microscopes. Despite being widely used in ensemble imaging, there is a currently a shortage of information available for selecting appropriate commercial near infra-red dyes for single molecule work. It is therefore important to characterise available near infra-red dyes relevant to multicolour single molecule imaging. Methodology/Principal Findings: A range of commercially available near infra-red <b>dyes</b> <b>compatible</b> with multi-colour imaging was screened to find the brightest and most photostable candidates. Image series of immobilised samples of the brightest dyes (Alexa 700, IRDye 700 DX, Alexa 790 and IRDye 800 CW) were analysed to obtain the mean intensity of single dye molecules, their photobleaching rates and long period blinking kinetics.

40|$|Thin- film organic {{distributed}} feedback (DFB) dye lasers are a {{topic of}} continuous research and development due to their quality to enable a narrow-band, single-mode emission applicable e. g. as compact biosensors or integrated lab-on-a-chip systems. If such DFB dye lasers are processed with elastomeric polymers they offer possibilities to continuously tune their spectral emission properties due the flexibility and stretchability of the elastomers. The combination with a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) enables {{the control of the}} emission wavelength by means of electro-mechanical actuation. This thesis presents effective and reproducible technological methods for fabrication, including new replication processes, of DFB laser and DEA module components, followed by techniques for their as sembling and integration to a single device. Within the scope of this work, a selection of <b>compatible</b> organic laser <b>dyes,</b> polymer matrices and solvents were investigated to achieve lasing in a broad spectral range of 575 700 nm. The modification of the polymer matrix through addition of plasticizers, as well as {{the development of a new}} ultra-thin DFB laser design leads to lower impact of the mechanical properties during actuation. Different measurement setups are used to examine the laser characteristics regarding the lifetime, optical gain, threshold and the efficiency. The e ort results in several wavelength tunable laser devices, which show emission within a spectral range of 615 - 692 nm, a total of 77 nm by means of mechanical tuning and within a spectral range of 608 - 656 nm, a total of 48 nm by means of electromechanical actuation. Further research was focused on the combination of distinct active layer systems with different periods and dyes onto a single DEA module in order to form a laser array with extended laser emission tuning range. The experiments reveal a tuning range of 573 - 659 nm, a total of 86 nm, the highest yet reported emission tuning on a single module...|$|R
40|$|Nanofluids, a {{new class}} of fluids {{engineered}} by suspending nanometer-sized particles in a host liquid, are offered as a new strategy in order to improve heat and mass transfer efficiency. My research was motivated by previous exciting studies on enhanced mass diffusion and the possibility of tailoring mass transport by direct manipulation of molecular diffusion. Therefore, a microfluidic approach capable of directly probing tracer diffusion between nanoparticle-laden fluid streams was developed. Under conditions matching previously reported studies, strong complexation interactions between the dye and nanoparticles at the interface between fluid streams was observed. When the tracer dye and surfactant were carefully chosen to minimize the collective effects of the interactions, no significant change in tracer dye diffusivity was observed in the presence of nanoparticles. Next, adapting tracer dyes for studies involving colloidal nanomaterials was explored. Addition of these charged tracers poses a myriad of challenges because of their propensity to disrupt the delicate balance among physicochemical interactions governing suspension stability. Here it was shown {{how important it is to}} select the <b>compatible</b> combinations of <b>dye,</b> nanoparticle, and stabilizing surfactant to overcome these limitations in low volume fraction (< 1 vol%) aqueous suspensions of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles. A microfluidic system was applied as a stability probe that unexpectedly revealed how rapid aggregation could be readily triggered in the presence of local chemical gradients. Suspension stability was also assessed in conjunction with coordinated measurements of zeta potential, steady shear viscosity and bulk thermal conductivity. These studies also guided our efforts to prepare new refrigerant formulations containing dispersed nanomaterials, including graphene nanosheets, carbon nanotubes and metal oxide and nitride. The influence of key parameters such as particle type, size and volume fraction on the suspension's thermal conductivity was investigated using a standard protocol. Our findings showed that thermal conductivity values of carbon nanotube and graphene nanosheet suspensions were higher than TiO 2 nanoparticles, despite some nanoparticles with large particle sizes provided noticeable thermal conductivity enhancements. Significantly, the graphene containing suspensions uniquely matched the thermal conductivity enhancements attained in nanotube suspensions without accompanying viscosity, thus making them an attractive new coolant for demanding applications such as electronics and reactor cooling...|$|R
