40|$|Large, uniform {{sized coke}} is {{desirable}} for blast furnace use. It {{has previously been}} shown that the coke oven flue temperature {{in the first few}} hours of coking is a key determinant of <b>coke</b> <b>size.</b> In this paper, the authors present a new programmed heating approach, which is called pulsed heating,aiming to increase coke mean size at a given average flue temperature. The approach takes into account the charging sequence in coke oven batteries and the authors demonstrate how existing operating practice can be modified in batteries with suitable heating systems to achieve the desired heating programme. A mathematical model of fissure formation provides a prediction of the increase in coke mean size using pulsed heating, compared with standard heating. Pilot scale experiments have also been performed to validate the modelling approach. The results of the modelling indicate that the mean <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> can be increased by several millimetres in some cases, although results from the pilot scale show that pulsed heating increases <b>coke</b> <b>size,</b> but by a smaller amount than that predicted by the model. The potential advantages and limitations of pulsed heating are discussed, as well as opportunities for further investigation of the approach...|$|E

30|$|The {{data used}} in this study is half V-group data, with bin sizes of 0.05 % reflectance, taken from pilot coking oven {{experimental}} results, representing both Australian and some overseas coals, and their blends. In this study, the method for measuring CSR is equivalent to the ISO standard method (International Organization for Standardization 2006), however a <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> of +[*] 19 – 21  mm is used yielding no measurable difference in CSR results. To generate the categories contained within the VDC parameter, only blends were considered. As a modification to the approach described by North et al. (2017), additional new data was added to extend the training set. Data that had previously been filtered due to low measured CSR was also reintroduced. This change was adopted as it was considered that provided the V-group data itself was acceptable, then the CSR, and conditions under which the coke was produced would not affect the SOM itself. This extended the data set for the VDC parameter generation from 401 to 638 instances.|$|E

40|$|The Boudouard {{reactivity}} of single cokes produced from selected bituminous coals and commercial cokes {{has been investigated}} in a thermo gravimetric furnace. The effect of potassium {{as a catalyst for}} this reaction was studied, as it is known to accumulate in ferromanganese furnaces. A gaseous impregnation technique using K 2 CO 3 as the potassium source was applied to impregnate the coke samples. The reactivity experiments were designed to simulate conditions occurring in an industrial furnace, as used for production of Mn-alloys. The <b>coke</b> particle <b>size</b> varied from 3. 35 to 6. 63 mm, while the temperature was maintained between 800 - 1100 oC with a gas composition from 50 to 75 % CO 2 in a CO/CO 2 mixture. To de-termine the catalytic effect of potassium, the concentration varied from a fraction of a percent up to 15 %wt. The results show that single chars vary significantly in reactivity, depending on the properties of the parent coal, while commercial cokes exhibit similar reaction rates. Temperature and partial pressure of CO 2 have the strongest influence on the reactivity, while the influence of gas flow rate and <b>coke</b> particle <b>size</b> were found to be negligible. The catalytic studies revealed that the relative {{reactivity of}} non-impregnated samples are preserved after the impregnation, so the least reactive coke is still the least reactive after the impregnation for the whole range of potassium loads. Also, it has been confirmed that the Boudouard reactivity reaches a plateau at potassium concentration of 4 %wt. 1...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  4 that the bubble-PCWS could obtain the biggest yield stress when the {{operational}} parameters were set as follows, aeration time of 30  min, solid concentration of 65  wt%, frother dosage of 0.030  wt% of the air-dried pulverized petroleum <b>coke,</b> aperture <b>size</b> of air distribution plate of 2 – 5  μm and AOS frother. It can also be seen from the range values of the five factors in Table  4 that the main factors affecting the yield stress of bubble-PCWS were solid concentration, aeration time and frother dosage. However, the effects of aperture size of air distribution plate and type of frother on the yield stress were slight within the experimental range.|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} high sulfur content of coke produced during the upgrading of Athabasca bitumen makes it environmentally unsuitable as a fuel. Using heavy oil or bitumen as a binder we {{have attempted to}} coagglomerate these cokes with limestone, {{in an attempt to}} reduce emissions during combustion.

Cokes from both Suncor and Syncrude operations were used in this investigation. The combustion tests on coke-sorbent agglomerates were carried out in a bench scaled fluidized bed apparatus at 850 degrees Celsius.

30|$|The {{quality of}} coke affects the {{performance}} of the blast furnace, factors affecting coke quality include coal properties, coal charge granulometry and carbonization conditions. The coke properties include the size analysis, cold strength (Micum Indices-M 40, M 10) and hot strength (Coke Reactivity Index-CRI, Coke Strength after Reaction-CSR) properties and structural properties such as coke structure and texture. Structural properties comprise the porosity, pore-cell wall thickness and pore sizes, while textures consist of the carbon forms in the coke. In present work, advanced method such as image analysis method was used to interpret coke microstructure. Conventional methods such as determination of coke porosity by measurement of real and apparent density and mercury porosimetry have a number of limitations. <b>Coke</b> <b>size,</b> magnification, number of image frames captured, process of pellet preparations and coke properties such as M 40, M 10, CRI and CSR (low, medium and high values) were taken as variables for experimental purposes. The coke structure parameters such as porosity, length, perimeter, breadth, roundness, pore-wall thickness and pore size distribution of the pores were determined by image analysis method. This method provided average porosity in addition to pore-wall thickness and pore-size distribution. The pore wall thickness measurement by image analysis method provided significant correlations with M 40, CRI and CSR values. This explained the usability of image analysis for coke structure measurement.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental pore {{formation}} mechanisms in iron ore sinter and pellets were investigated. The study was first conducted with tablets made from iron ore and limestone particles, {{with and without}} addition of coke, {{and the results were}} then tested and proved in real pellets made with a laboratory ball mill and in real sinter made with a sintering pot. It was found that pores were formed at sites of limestone and coke particles and that a number of factors had a significant influence on the {{pore formation}} and the final pore structure, such as limestone particle <b>size,</b> <b>coke</b> particle <b>size,</b> iron ore particle size, amount of limestone, temperature and initial porosity, etc. It was also found that the air flow through the sintering bed was very unlikely to cause any pores to form in sinter. Different types of pores were classified in terms of their origins. The results have shown that an open or close to open pore structure may be achieved by controlling the temperature and using proper amounts and particle <b>sizes</b> of limestone, <b>coke</b> and probably other additives. The results have also shown that porosity and limestone particle size had a strong effect on reducibility and {{it might be possible to}} achieve high reducibility and high strength simultaneously with an open or close to open pore structure at low porosity.

30|$|Through range analysis, the {{following}} {{conclusions can be}} drawn. The main factors affecting the yield stress of bubble-PCWS were solid concentration, aeration time and dosage of frother.

40|$|In an {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} bed, the combustion behaviour of coke particles together with {{velocity of the}} flowing gas stream determines the temperature, width and speed of the traversing flame front. A bed heat treatment mathematical model was formulated in an earlier study to describe this complex relationship. An area of improvement in the model is {{the description of the}} coke combustion process, which is highly dependent on the resistances controlling the flow of gases to and from the coke particles. These vary for different coke particles because of the prior coarsening of the sinter mix by granulation. The characteristic structure of granules – nuclear particle with an adhering fines layer – indicates that gases have better access to finer coke particles. In this study, an available granulation model is integrated into the heat treatment model to provide a novel description of coke positioning within granules. In addition to this change, two endothermic reactions were introduced into the model. Using the previous and modified models, predicted bed temperature–time profiles as a function of position down the bed, were compared against embedded thermocouples results from seventeen laboratory sinter tests. Generally, the modified definition of coke combustion behaviour resulted in improved comparison with experimental results. In the sintering literature, studies have been reported on: the use of charcoal/biomass char to replace coke, the preferential placement of coke particles on the outside of granules, and varying the size distribution of the coke particles. Improving the access of gases to coke particles and decreasing <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> are comparable to using more reactive fuels. Combustion rate, efficiency and flame front properties are all influenced by fuel reactivity. Model predictions of changes in bed temperatures, flame front properties and sintering performance caused by fuel type, location and size are consistent with reported observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} consumes {{a large amount}} of high quality {{metallurgy}} <b>coke</b> (<b>size</b> 35 - 80 mm) in addition to ore in the form of pellets and sinter. This coke is the coarse fraction, derived from the coke plant. The fine fraction (8 - 35 mm), arise after sieving, named nut coke, can’t be directly used in blast furnace. The fraction of smaller than 8 mm is used in the sinter plant. Therefore, a large fraction of coke around 20 % from coking plant/process is not used for iron ore reduction. Recent research indicates that usage of nut coke will be economic if properly used. Nut coke cannot be directly mixed with normal coke because it will decrease the permeability of the coke layer in the blast furnace. However, mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden layer could be an effective way to use the coke resource economically. This mixed charging could improve softening and melting behaviour, reduction kinetics and permeability and also make full use of the coke resource. It may, however, also worsen the layer permeability and even deteriorate the whole blast furnace process. The mechanism of the effect of mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace is still not clear, and thus the usage of nut coke is still limited. To investigate the effect and mechanism of using nut coke in the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace, cold flow model experiments and high temperature experiments have been conducted. An advanced Reduction, Softening and Melting experimental facility (RSM) was designed for high temperature experiments at TU Delft.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties of four metallurgical coals in different rank and geology was investigated. And that of coke qualities of these coals was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and coke qualities were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture of four metallurgical coals was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification of coal blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the caking properties of coals such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|E

About 20 % of total coke fines (- 0. 5 mm) are produced during different steps of preparation.

Sinter and coke layers were separately charged against air flow rates from zero to 0. 372 m 3 /s. Different particle sizes for sinter and coke were selected in order to exaggerate the individual behaviour of each material. <b>Coke</b> particle <b>sizes</b> ranged from - 8. 0 + 6. 3 mm to - 4. 0 + 3. 15 mm and sinter particle sizes ranged from - 2. 5 + 2. 0 mm to - 1. 0 + 0. 5 mm. Thermistors were used to record above burden velocity profiles. The experimental data were analysed by theories of segregation and flow in packed beds as appropriate. Results show that air flow increases coke deformation which in turn decreases the angle of repose of the upper layer of sinter. However, even though a flatter profile was obtained, relative velocity profile increased as the air flow rate through the burden increased and radial velocity distribution followed a catenary pattern.

Results show that, despite the high potentialities of such vitrains for producing hydrocarbons, i. e. a suspensive medium efficient for their cokefaction, each of the pyrolysis methods does not lead to solid residues chemically equivalent to natural coking coals, since the cokes from these residues are always made of smaller MOD than those obtained for coking coals. For comparison, a similar characterisation, carried out on a conventional vitrain (Fouthiaux) pyrolysed in a confined-system which prevents the release of hydrocarbons, leads also to non-coking coals.

The blast furnace operation involves rich granular dynamics phenomena which currently attract a strong interest from wide scientific and engineering community. In this work, percolation phenomenon is analyzed extensively. Percolation phenomenon {{is one of the most}} significant factors which cause particle segregation and mixing. In blast furnace when sinter and <b>coke</b> of different <b>size</b> and density are charged, percolation phenomenon occurs. In this work percolation properties like percolation velocity, residence time distribution and radial dispersion are checked for different material properties of percolating particles. It was found that percolation behaviour is related to many factors. Percolation properties of a single particle and also for batches of percolating particle were examined. The effect of external forces on percolation properties is also checked. DEM simulation method was found to be suitable for analysis of percolation flow behaviour of different types of particles. It was also found that the change of packed bed conditions has a great impact on particle percolation and segregation behaviour. In a packed bed, vibration and liquid of different properties were introduced. Particle dynamics in descending packed bed condition was checked. The effect of vibration and descending velocity was measured for percolation behaviour. Both vibration frequency and amplitude are important factors for particle flow in such a packed bed. Descending velocity of packed particles combined with vibration was found to have a pronounced impact on percolation behaviour. Liquid properties like viscosity and density affect particle dynamics significantly. Particle segregation in a pile was investigated as an extension of the percolation study. The effects of diameter ratio of binary feed, initial mixing ratio, feed rate in case of central feeding on conical pile were investigated.

40|$|The {{very high}} {{temperature}} reactor (VHTR) {{is the latest}} generation of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR). The VHTR has higher outlet temperatures than a traditional HTGR with outlet temperatures up to 1000 °C. This high outlet temperature permits emissions-free process heat {{in the form of}} high-quality steam for high temperature industrial applications. Moreover, the high temperatures of the reactor could potentially be used for hydrogen production from water or high efficiency electrical power production (~ 50 % efficiency of thermal to electrical power conversion). The VHTR is designed to employ helium as its coolant and uses graphite for its neutron moderator and as a key structural component for the core. Graphite is used because of it excellent structural stability at high temperatures, high thermal inertia, and the relatively low cost of its production. Since graphite is a key component to the VHTR, the integrity of the graphite is critically linked to the operable lifetime of the reactor. Thorough characterization of the graphite material used, as well as a complete understanding of the mechanisms behind graphite’s life-limiting phenomena is critical to understanding the limits of safe operation for the VHTR. Graphite is not a new high temperature nuclear material; in fact, it has been used in nuclear reactor designs since the very first reactor went critical in December of 1942. Due to its continued use in reactors, a major focus has been placed on understanding graphite’s long-term degradation in a radiation environment, and thus many of the phenomena responsible for degradation are well known. Unfortunately, graphite is a complicated/complex material in that the properties are highly dependent upon the initial source of carbon, as well as variations in the <b>coke</b> type, <b>size</b> and relative quantities of filler and binder, and the manufacturing process used. Thus, each graphite used for nuclear applications is in some sense a new material with unique properties that must be thoroughly characterized before use in a reactor. This dissertation research is focused on the pre-irradiation characterization of IG- 110, PGX, NBG- 18, and PCEA commercial graphites, the atomic level defects involved in irradiation induced shrinkage and swelling of these graphite materials, and finally the development of a unified reaction model for the oxidation of all high-purity nuclear graphites with oxygen. While similar characterizations and mechanistic studies have been made, many of the techniques used in this study such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), image processing and analysis, and filtering of high resolution lattice images were either impractical or unavailable in the past. This dissertation seeks to build on past studies of classical reactor grade graphites and use modern experimental techniques to further our understanding of the specific graphites examined and the underlying mechanism that contribute to graphite degradation. In Chapter Two, microstructural characterization of the filler and binder materials is performed. All grades examined were well graphitized in both the binder and filler, although the spatial domains of crystallites were significantly smaller in the binder. Turbostratic graphite, indicated by an elliptical diffraction pattern, was present in all grades. The microcracks, which are known to contribute to the bulk materials shrinkage and later swelling, were found to vary significantly in size, shape, and quantity with graphite grade. Chapter Three examines the atomic scale defects responsible for irradiation induced swelling and microcrack closure via transmission electron microscopy under electron beam irradiation. Utilization of noise-filtering in the frequency domain of lattice images and videos allowed analysis of the formation of vacancy loops, interstitial loops, and resulting dislocations with unprecedented clarity. The dislocations were observed to undergo positive climb resulting in the formation of extra basal planes. This in addition with the reduction in atomic density evidenced by electron energy loss spectroscopy is believed to be responsible for the graphite swelling in the c-direction and microcrack closure. Using optical microscopy, the macro-scale features of the filler particles and macro-porosity were characterized in Chapter Four. The average size and shape of the two-dimensional cross-sections of the filler particles for each grade was determined. A qualitative trend was found between the aspect ratio of the particles and the degree of alignment of the particle crystallites. To characterize the porosity, image analysis was performed using code written in matlab. Probability densities were determined for {{the size and shape of}} the macroporosity. Furthermore, a preferred orientation was observed for all grades characterized. The code for two-dimensional analysis used for the corresponding publication is currently being modified to analyze three-dimensional input data from µX-ray CT scans and will be published in a future journal article. In Chapter Five, the oxidation of NBG- 18 nuclear graphite was studied. A reaction model was developed based upon the actual oxygen transfer mechanism for the graphite-oxygen reaction system. The parameters are therefore physically meaningful and directly related to individual elementary reaction rates within the mechanism. The Arrhenius parameters are in excellent agreement with experimental and theoretical measurements of the same elementary reactions. Given the wide variety of high-purity graphite sources used in this literature and excellent agreement between measured and predicted values, the developed intrinsic model should be applicable to all nuclear-grade graphites. Moreover, the model can be extrapolated outside the experimental temperature and pressure range with much larger degrees of certainty due to the relationship of the fitted parameters to the physical reaction mechanism...|$|R
