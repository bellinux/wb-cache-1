5|$|We all {{holed up}} in (producer) David Bianco's lovely studio, which {{was built in the}} '70s and hasn't <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> since then—and though it was the sticky, hot LA summer outside, inside, it was snowy, {{delightful}} Christmastime. We.. everything together around an invisible campfire; everyone picking up different instruments and playing them on a moment's notice. There was definitely some holiday magic in the air that week.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building has not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> (although a new steeple {{was built in}} 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close {{that it is difficult}} to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|MD410 was {{originally}} built along mostly new alignment between Bethesda and Silver Spring {{in the late}} 1920s. The highway was extended east to Hyattsville in the mid-1930s. While the Montgomery County portion has not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> in the ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in their {{assessment of the}} games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> since previous generations, and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations. However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton {{became much}} cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.|$|E

5|$|The Roosevelt dime {{was first}} struck on January 19, 1946, at the Philadelphia Mint. It was {{released}} into circulation on January 30, {{which would have}} been President Roosevelt's 64th birthday. The planned release date had been February 5; it was moved up to coincide with the anniversary. With its debut, Sinnock became the first chief engraver to be credited with the design of a new circulating U.S. coin since those designed by Charles E. Barber were first issued in 1892. The release of the coins was a newsworthy event, and demand for the new design remained strong, although many of Roosevelt's opponents, particularly Republicans, were outraged. There were reports of the new dime being rejected in vending machines, but no changes to the coin were made. The dime's design has not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> in its over seventy years of production, the most significant alterations being minor changes to Roosevelt's hair and the shifting of the mint mark from reverse to obverse in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not <b>changed</b> <b>much.</b> Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} gameplay and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little had changed since the release of Fire Emblem, saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> since the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E

25|$|The forest {{surrounding}} {{and within}} Ravensburg State Park has not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> {{in the past}} 100 years. It is also unlikely that much timber has even been harvested in this area due to the extremely rocky surroundings and the narrow gorge in which Ravensburg State Park lies.|$|E
25|$|The moors {{have not}} <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> {{in the past}} 50 years, and are often used as a {{backdrop}} to British television programmes and films.

Dalby Forest is also host to many forms of entertainment throughout the year including outdoor concerts.|$|E

25|$|A {{shopping}} centre (including a new central library) {{was built to}} the east and north-east of the market cross and opened in 1986. The area east of the market cross had formerly been occupied by narrow alleyways of housing and small shops (on a layout which had not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> since medieval times) and referred to locally as The Lanes. Carlisle city centre was pedestrianised in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{appearance}} had not <b>changed</b> <b>much</b> by the 18th century. Houses {{were made}} of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow {{in the second half}} of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires, but also the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.|$|E
