30|$|Carbon and {{hydrogen}} {{are the major}} <b>combustible</b> <b>constituents</b> of coal, {{and both of them}} are high in the coal samples (Table[*] 2). The amount of carbon depends on the type of coal, and its percentage increases with rank, from lignite to anthracite. Thus, the carbon content of coal is used in its classification. The higher the carbon content, the higher is the calorific value and the better is the quality of the coal. However, hydrogen is mostly associated with volatile matter, and hence, it affects the use to which the coal would be put to. A good coal sample should have high amount of carbon with low amount of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, {{as in the case of}} these coal samples.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{performance of a}} biomass-fueled boiler/steam power co-generation system is investigated. The system performance {{is based on the}} known or assumed properties of the biomass fuel(its size, elemental composition, moisture content), energy content of the <b>combustible</b> <b>constituents</b> of the fuel, actual performance of a piston-operated-valve (POV) reciprocating engine and an alternator from earlier studies, and load profiles. Steam engine performance {{has been the subject of}} detailed studies at the Energy Research Center of the Australian National University (for example, Refs [1] and [2]), and these studies are referred to for steam engine performance for a given engine configuration. While the {{theoretical performance}} of a biomass-fired boiler is the major focus of this paper, experimental results from tests carried out on a sawdust-fired twin-chambered furnace/mono-tube boiler system are also addressed...|$|E
40|$|A flow {{calorimeter}} {{for determining}} the combustion efficiency of turbojet and ram-jet combustors from measurement of the residual enthalpy of combustion of the exhaust gas is described. Briefly, the calorimeter catalytically oxidizes the <b>combustible</b> <b>constituents</b> of exhaust-gas samples, and the resultant temperature rise is measured. This temperature rise {{is related to the}} residual enthalpy of combustion of the sample by previous calibration of the calorimeter. Combustion efficiency can be calculated from a knowledge of the residual enthalpy of the exhaust gas and the combustor input enthalpy. An accuracy of +- 0. 2 Btu per cubic foot was obtained with prepared fuel-air mixtures, and the combustion efficiencies of single turbojet combustors measured by both the flow-calorimeter and heat-balance methods compared within 3 percentage units. Flow calorimetry appears to be a suitable method for determining combustion efficiencies at high combustor temperatures where ordinary thermocouples cannot be used. The method is fundamentally more accurate than heat-balance methods at high combustion efficiencies and can be used to verify near- 100 -percent efficiency data...|$|E
40|$|The exact {{location}} of planetary noble gases in meteorites remains unknown {{but it is}} inferred to be closely associated with, if not precisely some portion of, the macromolecular organic material in carbonaceous chondrites. Herein we show that for enstatite chondrites the major carbonaceous component is not the carrier of the gases. This may also be true for other chondritic groups. Rather, these gases are all contained in a minor <b>combustible</b> <b>constituent.</b> This situation has all the hallmarks of a Russian matryoshka doll problem, as was witnessed previously {{in the study of}} meteorites prior {{to the understanding of the}} presence of presolar grains. A possible conclusion, which is in line with previous suggestions, is that planetary noble gases are also presolar and located in a new, and as yet unidentified, form of presolar material. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} lignite {{desulphurization}} via its treatment by an oxidant (air or air–steam mixture) has been studied. The research objective was useful determination of steam application in oxidative lignite desulphurization. It {{has been proved}} that the water steam {{should be included in}} the oxidant composition to increase the hydrogen sulphide and <b>combustible</b> <b>constituent</b> content in the gases obtained during the processes under research. The impact of factors which affect the reactions between solid (in our case – lignite) and gaseous reagent (oxidant, i.e. air and or air–steam mixture) upon the research process has been investigated, if these reactions occur in the kinetic area. Such factors are linear rate of oxidant movement and coal grain size. The values of oxidant movement linear rate and coal grain size, which the reaction transfer from pyrite sulphur and organic content of lignite from diffusion into kinetic area occurs by, have been determined. Under these “transfer” conditions, the values of coefficients of oxidant mass transfer (β, m/s) as well as Sherwood criteria and boiling layer differences have been calculated.|$|R
40|$|Keywords:kitchen waste, waste {{composting}}, simple barrel composting method, maturity assessment Abstract. Kitchen {{waste recycling}} is an environmental friendly measure. Two identical samples of kitchen waste were conducted for composting by the barrel-type of method in this study. Compost produced {{from these two}} experiments was analyzed for their physical and chemical properties. No {{significant difference was found}} between the compositions of the two kitchen waste samples. The major components of the two kitchen waste samples of this study were water content (averaged 72. 7 %), followed by <b>combustible</b> <b>constituent</b> (about 25. 6 %). The carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio was between 15 and 25. Compost by the simple barrel method had the average C/N ratio of 12. For the simple barrel method, because its enzyme fermentation lasted longer, the maturity of the compost was better. The compost samples had the average germination rate of 95 %, indicating the simple barrel composting method definitely has better maturity. When comparing the compost samples produced in this study to the standards given by the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan, the simple barrel compost qualified all the criteria. The simple barrel composting method is a convenient and easy method for recycling and processing organic waste, especially kitchen. The compost products, both solid and liquid, can be used for agricultural purposes...|$|R
40|$|Syngas {{produced}} by gasification has a {{potential to be}} one of the fueling solutions for gas turbines in the future. In addition to the <b>combustible</b> <b>constituents</b> and inert gases, syngas derived by gasification contains a considerable amount of water vapor which effect on syngas combustion behaviour. In this work, a micro-gas turbine with a thermal capacity of 50 kW was simulated using ASPEN Plus. The micro gas turbine system emissions were characterized using dry syngas fuels with a different composition, syngas 1 (10. 53 % H 2, 24. 94 % CO, 2. 03 % CH 4, 12. 80 % CO 2, and 49. 70 % N 2) and syngas 2 (21. 62 % H 2, 32. 48 % CO, 3. 72 % CH 4, 19. 69 % CO 2, and 22. 49 % N 2) mixed with LPG in a dual fueling mode. The effect of syngas moisture content was then studied by testing the system with moist syngas/LPG with a moisture content ranging from 0 to 20 % by volume. The study demonstrates that the syngas moisture content has high influence on nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions. It’s found that for 5 % syngas moisture content, the NOx emission were reduced by 75. 5 % and 83 % for Syngas 1 and Syngas 2 respectively. On carbon monoxide emissions and for same moisture content ratio, the reduction was found to be 43 % and 57 % for syngas 1 and syngas 2 respectively...|$|E
