50|$|A German Enigma {{operator}} {{would be}} given a plaintext message to encrypt. For each letter typed in, a lamp indicated a different letter according to a pseudo-random substitution, based upon the wiring of the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded as the enciphered substitution. The action of pressing a key also moved the rotor so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor, giving a different substitution alphabet. This continued for each letter in the message until the message was completed {{and a series of}} substitutions, each different from the others, had occurred to create a <b>cyphertext</b> from the plaintext. The <b>cyphertext</b> would then be transmitted as normal to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would key in the <b>cyphertext</b> and—as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine—for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.|$|E

It has been thought that the search with errors over encrypted data is impossible because 1 bit difference over plaintexts may reduce to enormous bits difference over <b>cyphertexts.</b> We propose a novel idea {{to deal with the}} search with errors over encrypted data. We develop two similarity search schemes, implement the prototypes and provide substantial analysis. We define security requirements for the similarity search over encrypted data. The first scheme can achieve perfect privacy in similarity search but the second scheme is more efficient...|$|R
2500|$|Until modern times, {{cryptography}} referred {{almost exclusively}} to encryption, which {{is the process of}} converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a [...] "key". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. [...] Formally, a [...] "cryptosystem" [...] is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible <b>cyphertexts,</b> finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key. [...] Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks. There are two kinds of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems the same key (the secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is faster than asymmetric systems as they generally use shorter key lengths. Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt it. Use of asymmetric systems enhances the security of communication. Examples of asymmetric systems include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Symmetric models include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).|$|R

50|$|In cryptography, {{ciphertext}} or <b>cyphertext</b> is {{the result}} of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is {{not to be confused with}} codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.|$|E
50|$|Cyphernetics {{developed}} {{many products}} that were {{well ahead of}} their time, and whose concepts are contained {{in many of the}} most important PC applications, even today. Cyphernetics had an email system (called UTI:MEMO) in the early 1970s, as well as word processing (<b>Cyphertext),</b> spreadsheets (Cyphertab), project management, and time series data storage and analysis (TSAM). Despite comparatively weak CPU's, very limited memory and storage, and slow communications networks of the time, most modern PC applications were functional on the timesharing network at 300 to 1200 baud while running on a processor (that was much less powerful than a desktop PC is today) shared by 50+ simultaneous users.|$|E
5000|$|Normally such {{a system}} would be {{no better than the}} single-alphabet systems of the 16th century. However the rotor in the Hebern machine was geared to the {{keyboard}} on the typewriter, so that after every keypress, the rotor turned and the substitution alphabet thus changed slightly. This turns the basic substitution into a polyalphabetic one similar to the well known Vigenère cipher, with the exception that it required no manual lookup of the keys or <b>cyphertext.</b> Operators simply turned the rotor to a pre-chosen starting position and started typing. To decrypt the message, they turned the rotor around in its socket so it was [...] "backwards", thus reversing all the substitutions. They then typed in the ciphertext and out came the plaintext.|$|E
50|$|Public Key Cryptography is {{a common}} form of a forward {{anonymous}} system. It is used to pass encrypted messages, preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by an attacker. It uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is published, and is used by anyone to encrypt a plaintext message. The Private key is not well known, and is used to decrypt <b>cyphertext.</b> Public key cryptography is known as an asymmetric decryption algorithm because of different keys being used to perform opposing functions. Public key cryptography is popular because, while it is computationally easy to create a pair of keys, {{it is extremely difficult}} to determine the private key knowing only the public key. Therefore, the public key being well known does not allow messages which are intercepted to be decrypted. This is a forward anonymous system because one compromised key (the public key) does not compromise the anonymity of the system.|$|E

40|$|Classical digital {{cryptography}} {{is concerned}} with the problem of providing secure and secret communication over a medium which guarantees neither of these functions. This provision is achieved through the encryption of data at the sender, and the decryption of that <b>cyphertext</b> at the receiver (an encrypted message is known in cryptography as the <b>cyphertext</b> of the message). There are further considerations concerning cryptography such as fair exchange and non-repudiation, but these notions are separate to the security issue which we will be discussing here. The majority of cryptographic techniques in common use today rely on the notion of computational complexity to ensure the difficulty (but not impossibility) of decrypting cyphertexts. Such methods make use of cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt data, and depending on the encryption chosen can be extremely secure 1. The problem with this system is that the receiver must know which encryption was used by the sender in order to decrypt the <b>cyphertext</b> correctly.

In addition, the algorithms used by the encryptions are static. There is a predefined number of operatiors, and a predefined order (loops included) of operations. The algorithm stays the same, and the plaintext and <b>cyphertext</b> along with the key are churned through this cypherblock.

40|$|International audienceRecently introduced, Attribute-based {{encryption}} (ABE) is {{a promising}} cryptographic method proposed by Sahai and Waters. This technique provides means for designing scalable and fine-grained access control. In ABE, data are encrypted with an access structure {{which is the}} logical expression of the access policy (eg: the data can be accessed by physician in cardiology division or by nurses). The <b>cyphertext</b> (encrypted data) can be decrypted by any user if his secret key has attributes that satisfy the access policy. The power of ABE {{is that we do}} not need to rely on the storage server for avoiding unauthorized data access since the access policy is embedded in the <b>cyphertext</b> itself. This makes ABE good solution to provide a fine-grained access control for medical applications, where data is outsourced on untrusted servers like the case of the Cloud. However, for emergency management, integrating ABE creates particular challenges for providing temporary access victims medical data when this is needed. In this paper we present our architecture for secure emergency management in healthcare area.

40|$|Shannon {{introduced}} the classic {{model of a}} cryptosystem in 1949, where Eve has access to an identical copy of the <b>cyphertext</b> that Alice sends to Bob. Shannon defined perfect secrecy {{to be the case}} when the mutual information between the plaintext and the <b>cyphertext</b> is zero. Perfect secrecy is motivated by error-free transmission and requires that Bob and Alice share a secret key. Wyner in 1975 and later I. Csiszár and J. Körner in 1978 modified the Shannon model assuming that the channels are noisy and proved that secrecy can be achieved without sharing a secret key. This model is called wiretap channel model and secrecy capacity is known when Eve's channel is noisier than Bob's channel. In this paper we review the concept of wiretap coding from the satellite channel viewpoint. We also review subsequently introduced stronger secrecy levels which can be numerically quantified and are keyless unconditionally secure under certain assumptions. We introduce the general construction of wiretap coding and analyse its applicability for a typical satellite channel. From our analysis we discuss the potential of keyless information theoretic physical layer security for satellite channels based on wiretap coding.

The idea is that an adversary cannot distinguish an encrypted text with an encryption of an equal-lenght string of garbage. Then, we have the Find-then-Guess Security which is an adaption of the polynomial security.

40|$|International audienceIn all {{differential}} {{power analysis}} methods, {{the basic idea}} underlying the attack is that the instantaneous amount of energy used by the circuit during an encryption operation depends on the actual values of the manipulated data. Based on this assumption and by focusing {{on a part of}} the circuit that operates on {{a small part of the}} <b>cyphertext</b> and the secret key (for instance the output of an Sbox in AES algorithm that depends on 8 bits only), the attacker can guess all the sub-keys.

The best correlation should correspond to the correct secret key. In this talk we will present how the knowledge of the structure of the circuit can be exploited to improve the DPA attack. We propose to perform a timing simulation of the circuit by guessing all the secret keys. This simulation is used to determine the instant when the energy consumed by the circuit is highly correlated to the secret key.
