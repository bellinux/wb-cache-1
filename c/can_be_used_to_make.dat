5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E
5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.|$|E
50|$|HMDS <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> convert {{alcohols}} into trimethylsilyl ethers. HMDS <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> silylate {{laboratory glassware}} {{and make it}} hydrophobic, or automobile glass, just as Rain-X does.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} novel {{resistive}} pressure sensors, integrated on-chip at the inlet- and outlet-channels of a micro Coriolis mass flow sensor. The pressure sensors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure the pressure drop over the Coriolis sensor which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> compensate pressure-dependent behaviour that might occur and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> calculate the dynamic viscosity of the fluid inside the channels...|$|R
40|$|Modal domain {{optical fiber}} sensors, or {{distributed}} effect sensors, for active vibration suppression in flexible structures are considered. Preliminary modeling {{results indicate that}} these sensors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sense vibrations in a flexible beam and the signal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> damp vibrations in the beam. Weighted distributed-effect sensors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> implement high order compensators with low order functional observers...|$|R
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which {{is also used to}} absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
50|$|The ladder analogy arises {{because no}} single {{technique}} can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure nearby distances, a second <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung {{of the ladder}} provides information that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine the distances at the next higher rung.|$|R
50|$|The {{internet}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{raise awareness}} about the issues of language extinction and language preservation. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> translate, catalog, store, and provide information and access to languages. New technologies such as podcasts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> preserve the spoken versions of languages, and written documents can preserve information about the native literature and linguistics of languages.|$|R
50|$|Just as block ciphers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build hash {{functions}}, hash functions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are SHACAL, BEAR and LION.|$|R
5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a prank call to lure a householder away, catnip {{can be used to}} distract cats.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps most importantly, the Kuzyk Limit <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{calculate}} the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, {{which is a}} scale invariant quantity that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> compare molecules of different sizes.|$|R
50|$|The free {{radicals}} and ions generated in corona reactions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> scrub {{the air of}} certain noxious products, through chemical reactions, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce ozone.|$|R
