5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; {{the first one to}} reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through <b>coaling,</b> victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key <b>coaling</b> station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The demand for labour for <b>coaling</b> was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E

Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea.

5|$|In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, {{a member}} of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. {{strategic}} thinker, wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued {{for the creation of a}} large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy.

5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to <b>coaling</b> stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders.

Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least , {{more than enough to}} operate in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British <b>coaling</b> station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden spent two days combing the Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of automatic signalling and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced <b>coaling,</b> watering, and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E

In 1906, she conducted tests with <b>coaling</b> while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental observation balloon. She saw extensive action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112. She took part in the seizure of Benghazi, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Tripoli, and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western Libya and the Red Sea coast of Arabia. She was still in service during World War I as a training ship, but she did not see action during the conflict. Liguria was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Blyth {{was first}} {{recorded}} from 1138, when monks at Newminster Abbey exported salt, having created it from pans {{on the north}} side of the river and evaporated using the copious supplies of local coal. Coal exports started from the 14th century, with local mines recorded from the 16th century. In 1609 21,571 tons of coal were shipped from Blyth. The first large quay - Bishop's Quay, which still exists today - was developed by 1682. But the port was not dredged at this time, necessitating the use of Northumbrian keel boats to transfer the loads to ships moored offshore. By 1730 specific <b>coaling</b> and ballast quays existed, and by 1765 the ports facilities included a pilot house and lighthouse, to facilitate the newly built first breakwater, North Dyke. The High Lighthouse came into operation soon afterwards, operating until July 1984.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} of peace inevitably meant {{a reduction in}} military expenditure, but {{this was more than}} offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar.

Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside <b>coaling.</b> An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.|$|E

In early 1893 they overthrew her, set up a republican government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States. The Harrison administration had quickly agreed {{with representatives of the}} new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval.
