30|$|From Table 1, it {{is clear}} that SGO {{provides}} better optimal results in as many as 12 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> GA, 5 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> PSO, 4 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> DE, 3 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> ABC and 2 functions <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> TLBO. It can be arrived at a conclusion here that SGO is very competitive <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> ABC and especially with TLBO. However, we have noted that SGO is faster when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other algorithms. It takes 1 / 500 th function evaluations <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> GA, PSO, DE and ABC for all functions except for Rosenbrock wherein it takes 1 / 50 th of total function evaluations. And it is computing almost in half of the total function evaluations <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> TLBO except for Rosenbrock for which SGO takes 1 / 5 th number of function evaluation as against TLBO. From the above findings, we may arrive at a conclusion that our proposed algorithm not only performs better <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> many state-of-the art algorithms like GA, PSO, DE but also very competitive with ABC and TLBO in providing optimal solutions. Importantly, SGO takes less computation efforts <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> all other algorithms investigated in this section.|$|R

5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance <b>compares</b> <b>to</b> planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12.

5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that <b>compares</b> <b>to</b> very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{is never}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, but can be {{observed}} through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This <b>compares</b> <b>to</b> +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This <b>compares</b> <b>to</b> 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E

5|$|The pay of a praefectus of an {{auxiliary}} regiment {{in the early}} 2nd century has been estimated at over 50 times that of a miles (common soldier). (This <b>compares</b> <b>to</b> a full colonel in the British Army, who is currently paid about five times a private's salary). The reason for the huge gap between the top and {{the bottom of the}} pyramid is that Roman society was far more hierarchical than a modern one. A praefectus was not just a senior officer. He was also a Roman citizen (which most of his men were not) and, {{as a member of the}} equestrian order, an aristocrat. The social gulf between the praefectus and a peregrinus soldier was thus immense, and the pay differential reflected that fact.|$|E
