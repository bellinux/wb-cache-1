40|$|Chemistry of the {{actinide}} elements {{represents a}} challenging yet vital scientific frontier. Development of actinide chemistry requires fundamental {{understanding of the}} relative roles of actinide valence-region orbitals {{and the nature of}} their chemical bonding. We report here an experimental and theoretical investigation of the uranium methylidyne molecules X 3 UCH (X = F, Cl, Br), F 2 <b>ClUCH,</b> and F 3 UCF formed through reactions of laser-ablated uranium atoms and trihalomethanes or carbon tetrafluoride in excess argon. By using matrix infrared spectroscopy and relativistic quantum chemistry calculations, we have shown that these actinide complexes possess relatively strong UC triple bonds between the U 6 d- 5 f hybrid orbitals and carbon 2 s- 2 p orbitals. Electron-withdrawing ligands are critical in stabilizing the U(VI) oxidation state and sustaining the formation of uranium multiple bonds. These unique UC-bearing molecules are examples of the long-sought actinide-alkylidynes. This discovery opens the door to the rational synthesis of triple-bonded actinidecarbon compounds...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{patent application}} proposed that electromagnetic clutches {{be used in}} the transmission. The year of the patent was 1949, a time when pressure operated hydraulic technology was less well developed. Several years later, when the Ravigneaux went into production at Ford Motor Company, hydraulically operated band brakes and <b>cluches</b> were used.|$|R

The {{immature}} snake has a distinctive orange-brown stripe running {{the length of}} its back, with a dorsal ground colour of olive green, which darkens as it gets older. Is active at night (nocturnal); its diet consists of rodents, lizards, and frogs. The female lays eggs in <b>cluches</b> of eight to 12, with hatchlings averaging 20 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{habits of}} the Angola batis are little known, it feeds on insects which are often caught in the air by sallying from a perch, a {{behaviour}} called [...] "flycatching". The appear to be rather solitary, like other batises, being recorded mainly as single or in pairs. The cup shaped nest is built by both sexes from strips of bark and spider webs and {{is placed in the}} fork of a small tree at around head height. The only recorded <b>cluches</b> have consisted of 2 eggs. Breeding behaviour has been observed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July.|$|R
