40|$|All <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>fusion</b> devices under {{construction}} or design have such high performances {{to require a}} special care in the dimensioning of various components, specically from the electromagnetic point of view. To this purpose, it is fundamental to develop models which are both accurate (i. e. able to describe the physical phenomena) and predictive (i. e. useful not only to explain what happens in running experiments, but also to reliably extrapolate to other range of parameters). The dynamics of fusion plasmas is often conveniently described by Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics (MHD) equations, which predict that some unstable evolution modes may exist. On the other hand, {{the complexity of the}} intrinsically 3 D model of the interactions between a realistic unstable plasma, the surrounding passive structures (important to guarantee a good MHD stability) and the active conductors (coils) require the numerical solution of challenging electromagnetic problems. In this work a discrete geometric formulation for eddy-current problems in the frequency domain is developed; the magnetic elds produced by a typical active coil system is calculated in the presence of 3 D conductive structures...|$|R

PACS: 64. 30. +i; 95. 30. -k; 97. 10. -q The basic source of energy in stars is the nuclear energy. At high temperature inside a star there are conditions for the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion.</b> More heavy nuclei have greater bonding energy and greater mass defect. The energy related to this mass defect becomes free at fusion of heavy nuclei and it is used up for a heating of a star and a radiation. This is generally known. The <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> can be considered as a process of a growing of the averaged mass number A and the averaged charge Z of nuclei in plasma. The nuclear mass table data show that the bonding energy which becomes free at <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> depend linearly on the averaged charge of nuclei Em ≈ − 3 · 10 − 5 Z erg (1) But, at consideration of the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> as an unique process of the energy generation in stars, one looses {{sight of the fact that}} there is other additional parallel mechanism of the energy generation- a decrease in the gravitational energy of a star, which is caused by of decrease in the electrostatic energy of plasma and is a result of nuclear charge build-up. 1 According to the virial theorem [1],[2] the full energy of plasma is equal to the half of its potential energy.
