40|$|The {{influence}} of swirler design parameters namely, vane shape (flat or <b>curved),</b> <b>vane</b> outlet angle, aspect ratio and space-to-chord ratio (number of vanes), on the pressure drop-mass flow characteristics {{and the size}} and turbulence characteristics of the downstream recirculation region has been determined experimentally. A five-hole spherical pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry {{have been used for}} the investigation. A technique for simple and reasonably accurate interpretation of the signals from the hot-wire anemometer has been formulated. Its performance has been tested at first in round jets for which experimental turbulence data are already available for comparison purposes. The method has been applied subsequently to swirling flows issuing from the swirlers; the mean and turbulence characteristics of the flow fields have been determined in this way. In addition to these, the turbulent viscosities Ĭrr, Ĭrz, Ĭrθ and Ĭθθ have been calculated. Also, detailed accounts of the previous experimental work on swirling flows and of some finite difference procedures for the computation of weakly and strongly swirling flows have been given. It has been shown that the hot-wire formulation developed provides a simple, economic and efficient procedure for the measurement of the turbulence quantities in swirling flows. The results have shown that <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> type swirlers operate more efficiently than flat vane types such that a larger recirculation region and a stronger shear zone are induced at a lower pressure drop. The pressure drop through both the flat and <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> type swirlers increases with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratio. The size of the downstream recirculation region, the reverse mass flow and the decay rates of the axial and swirl velocities increase with increasing vane angle and decreasing aspect ratio in the case of <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> type swirlers. The effect of the space-to-chord ratio has not been found very significant in the cases of I 6 and I 2 vanes for the vane angle of 60 ° and the aspect ratio 0. 4. Higher turbulence and stronger shear zones can be obtained in swirling flows with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratios. Turbulence is anisotropic in strongly swirling jets issuing from vane type swirlers. The most dominant stresses are in turn ww, uw, and uu; all the other stresses are smaller. In parallel to the anisotropy in the stresses, the turbulent viscosities are also anisotropic; the turbulent viscosity Ĭθθ has shown domination among the four viscosities which have been calculated. Ĭrr values have shown too much scatter. For these reasons, <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> type swirlers should prove much more efficient than flat vane types in the application to combustion process...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{evaluate}} the production of CO-NO-HC emissions while varying the swirl angle of curve vane radial swirler. Swirling flow generates central recirculation region (CRZ) which is necessary for flame stability and enhances fuel air mixing. Therefore designing an appropriate air swirler is a challenge to produce stable, efficient and low emission combustion inside burner system. Four radial <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> swirlers with 30 o, 40 o, 50 o and 60 o vane angles corresponding to swirl numbers of 0. 366, 0. 630, 0. 978 and 1. 427 respectively were used in this experiment to measure the vane angles effect on emission production in the combustion chamber. Emission measurements were conducted at 5 axial distances from the burner throat, and at 5 locations along the radius starting the central axis at each section. It was found that at the core near the throat, CO and HC concentrations are low due to high available O 2 and high fuel mixing rate producing efficient combustion. This is due to the high shear region created the high swirl flow...|$|E

40|$|The first {{steam engine}} built by James Watt {{in the year}} 1769 was the advent in substituting the low energy rates {{produced}} by wind, water, man and beast for the higher mechanical power produced by a machine. A further milestone was in the year 1866 when Werner von Siemens invented the principle of producing electricity from a rotating machine, the so-called electro-magnetic principle. Coupled to the steam engine this {{had the advantage of}} producing power centrally and making it available at a large number of points. The steam engine and also to a latter extent the diesel engine had a limited capacity in producing power, due to the inherent disadvantages of reciprocating machinery. This led to the introduction of rotating machinery to produce the steadily increasing needs for electricity; already well known in the harnessing of water energy the principle of blading was adopted in the steam and at a later date in the gas turbines. I. Theory of Steam Turbines The steam turbine obtains its motive power from the change of momentum of a jet of steam flowing over a <b>curved</b> <b>vane.</b> The steam jet, in moving over the curved surface of the blade, exerts a pressure on the blade owing to its centrifugal force. This centrifugal pressure is exerted normal to the blade surface and acts along the whole length of the blade. This fundamental is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The resultant of these centrifugal pressures, plus the effect of change of velocity, is the motive force on the blade. This introductory paragraph regarding the transfer of energy from the fluid to the blade can also be shown mathematically. Fig. 2 shows the general view of a rotor mounted on a shaft, Figs. 2 a and 2 b the side and end elevations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a shroud bleed slot system of a compressor stage from a turbocharger unit used in heavy duty diesel engines of approximately 300 kW. The {{first part of the}} work presented in this thesis deals with a detailed analysis of a compressor stage with and without a shroud bleed slot, and various slot geometries which include three different widths and three different positions of the slot. The second stage of this study is an investigation of an addition of a set of vanes in the annular cavity of the shroud bleed slot system. This investigation was performed using both CFD modelling and experimental measurements. The CFD model used a full stage steady state approach. Very good agreement was achieved between the experimental measurements of efficiency, pressure ratio and mass flow rate and those values predicted by the CFD model over the entire performance map, providing confidence in the CFD model as a tool to help understand the flow features of the bleed slot, its various geometries and an addition of annular cavity vanes. The first stage of the study emphasises the significance of the inclusion of a shroud bleed slot into the conventional turbocharger compressor stage and the appropriate choice of the slot geometry in order to achieve as the widest map possible. In comparison with the non-bleed slot compressor stage, the bleed slot significantly extended the map width at the higher speeds, by reducing the surge mass flow rate. However, no or very little improvement was found at lower speeds. The analysis of changes to design parameters revealed that it is vital to obtain an optimised geometry of the bleed slot system for a compressor stage to achieve a wider map without compromising other performance characteristics of the compressor. This study also discloses the importance of an optimised shape of the shroud bleed slot system to increase the compressor performance by avoiding the recirculation losses within the slot and cavity passages at both choke and surge flow conditions. In the second stage of the work presented in this thesis, three different types of the annular cavity vane (straight, positive curved and negative curved vanes) have been designed and investigated. The purpose of the annular cavity vane technique is to remove some of the positive swirl that can be carried through the bleed slot system, which would influence the pressure ratio. In addition to this, the series of cavity vanes provides better guidance to the slot recirculating flow before it mixes with the impeller main inlet flow. Better guidance of the flow improves the mixing at the inducer inlet in the circumferential direction. As a consequence, the stability of the compressor is improved at lower flow rates and a wider map can be achieved. The impact of these three cavity vane designs on the map width and performance of the compressor has been highlighted through a detailed analysis of the impeller and cavity vane bleed slot flow field. Interestingly, all three types of cavity vane showed an improvement in map width by moving the surge point to a lower mass flow rate with no significant efficiency penalty over the entire operating range. This improvement was most evident at the highest running speed. In particular, the negative <b>curved</b> <b>vane</b> showed a significant increase in map width which re{{presents an}} extra 67 % improvement in map width that was achieved between the baseline bleed slot and non-bleed slot configurations.

Flow pattern inside a combustor is important to self sustain the flame, increase mixing of air and fuel and combustion intensity. Aerodynamically <b>curved</b> <b>vanes</b> allow the incoming axial flow to turn gradually. This inhibits flow separation on the suction side of the vane. Thus, more complete turning and higher swirl and radial-velocity components can be generated at the swirler exit, with the added advantage of lower pressure loss.

This study presents the possibility of application of the advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of its stator. By using this curve in the inner surface of the stator, we are desirous of improving a sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump, in addition to improving of the inertial reaction of the vanes in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because, it causes a smooth sliding motion of the vanes and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it because of decreasing vane- tip and inner surface of stator wear and decreasing of vibration, noise and high stresses.

40|$|Characteristics of flows around curved {{sections}} of open channels at velocities {{greater than the}} wave velocity (that is, F > 1) are discussed in this paper. In simple curves such flows produce cross-wave disturbance patterns which also persist for long distances in the downstream tangent. These disturbance patterns indicate nonequilibrium conditions whose basic cause (when F > 1) is that disturbances cannot be propagated upstream or even directly across the channel. Thus, the turning effect of the curved walls does not act equally on all filaments in a given cross section and equilibrium is destroyed. The paper outlines two basic methods of eliminating these disturbance patterns. Analytical design criteria are developed, and experimental verifications of the analyses are presented. The first method consists of applying a lateral force {{in such a way}} that it acts simultaneously on all filaments, causing the flow to turn without disturbing the equilibrium. Bottom banking supplies such a lateral force, and a series of vertical <b>curved</b> <b>vanes</b> across the channel has roughly the same effect. The second method employs interference patterns introduced deliberately at the beginning and at the end of the curve. Compound curves, spiral transitions, and sills all operate on this principle. Rectangular channels are uniquely suited to the interference method of treatment, since for a given channel the wave patterns are substantially independent of the flow. Trapezoidal and other nonrectangular channels should be avoided if possible, unless the flow is invariant. The fields of application of the different treatments are discussed briefly...|$|R

With such a shift the ability of existing ventilation systems in meeting the new requirements is a challenging question for researchers. The available options could {{have an impact on}} workers' health in terms of providing acceptable levels of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Thus, this experimental investigation focuses on the performances of three different air distribution systems in an open-plan office space. The investigated systems were: mixing ventilation with ceiling-mounted inlets, confluent jets ventilation and underfloor air distribution with straight and <b>curved</b> <b>vanes.</b> Although this represents a small part of our more extensive experimental investigation, the results show that all the purposed stratified ventilation systems (CJV and UFAD) were more or less behaving as mixing systems with some tendency for displacement effects.

For the open-plan office we studied here, it will be shown that the new systems are capable of performing better than the conventional mixing systems. As expected, the higher air exchange efficiency in combination with lower local mean age of air for corner-mounted CJV and floor-mounted UFAD grills systems indicates that these systems are suitable for open-plan offices and are to be favored over conventional mixing systems...|$|R

Specifically the aims are set at flame stability and pollutions. Important part of this paper is a novel design procedure dealing with premixed burners. Further, by exploiting the results of testing program enabled one to design burners exhibiting low level of nitrogen oxides emissions. On the basis of aerodynamic analysis of premixed burners flow path several recommendations on the geometry resulted in proposing two ejectors, which transport the combustion air. In the first ejector the fuel jet, generated by flow through a nozzle, draws the specified part of the combustion air, and then the mixture is a driving agent of the second ejector. The remaining part of combustion air flows first through the radial <b>curved</b> <b>vanes,</b> and second its tangential velocity component is augmented by axial vanes prior it enters mixing part of the second ejector. For the additional contribution to the rotating motion the inclined axial vanes built inside the nozzle of the second ejector are responsible. The resulting swirling number reaches the values up to 2. 6. For the burner so arranged fire stability and low NOx emissions in the wide operating conditions can be expected. Within the frame of extensive testing program in the field of diffusion burners several modifications have been carried out such as setting of axial vanes which secure the swirling motion, changes of combustion air flows path, and modifications of secondary nozzles, these resulted in extending zone of stabilized flame and reducing the formation of NOx, e. g.

50|$|To rotate, a light mill {{does not}} have to be coated with {{different}} colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the University of Texas, Austin created a monocolored light mill which has four <b>curved</b> vanes; each <b>vane</b> forms a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold nanocrystals, which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this asymmetric heating effect generates a net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to Newton's Third Law.This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of micrometer- or nanometer- scaled light mills, as it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer casing ring, with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced <b>curved</b> <b>vanes,</b> and a shroud or inner ring. The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R

The brake is connected with the wheel carriage pairs. The process {{is based on the}} energy dissipation in liqid when the disks with spikes rotate in it. Because the real liquid has friction and viscosity, it will be heat up, when the mechanical parts of the hydraulic brake are moved in it. The design, operating principle and characteristics of the hydraulic brake are proposed. Transmission of kinetic energy of carriage motion to brake system executed by mechanical clutches. It connected with the wheel pair and transmitting the energy the wheels rotation to hydraulic brake discs. The cylindrical rods are installed on the discs. Rods location fits the profile of the <b>curved</b> centrifugal pump <b>vanes.</b> As result, the fluid heatind prosess by rotatinge discs with rods take place also at the same time with the liquid pumping through the inner volume of brake system. Conclusions: Affordable passenger carriage braking dynamic is achieved by varying the size and number of rods. The heated liquid may be subsequently used for household needs and for heating the passenger carriage...|$|R
40|$|For {{advanced}} {{gas turbine}} engines, two combustor systems, the lean premixed/prevaporized (LPP) {{and the rich}} burn/quick quench/lean burn (RQL) offer great potential for reducing NO(x) emissions. An important consideration for either concept {{is the development of}} an advanced fuel injection system that will provide a stable, efficient, and very uniform combustion system over a wide operating range. High-shear airblast fuel injectors for gas turbine combustors have exhibited superior atomization and mixing compared with pressure-atomizing fuel injectors. This improved mixing has lowered NO(x) emissions and the pattern factor, and has enabled combustors to alternate fuels while maintaining a stable, efficient combustion system. The performance of high-shear airblast fuel injectors is highly dependent on the design of the dome swirl vanes. The type of swirl vanes most widely used in gas turbine combustors are usually flat for ease of manufacture, but vanes with curvature will, in general, give superior aerodynamic performance. The design and performance of high-turning, low-loss <b>curved</b> dome swirl <b>vanes</b> with twist along the span are investigated. The twist induces a secondary vortex flow pattern which will improve the atomization of the fuel, thereby producing a more uniform fuel-air distribution. This uniform distribution will increase combustion efficiency while lowering NO(x) emissions. A systematic swirl vane design system is presented based on one-, two-, and three-dimensional flowfield calculations, with variations in vane-turning angle, rate of turning, vane solidity, and vane twist as design parameters...|$|R
40|$|The vane {{method has}} been shown to be an {{effective}} tool in measuring the yield stress of both settled and mixed slurries in laboratory bench scale conditions in supporting assessments of both actual and simulant waste slurries. The vane has also been used to characterize dry powders and granular solids, the effect of non-cohesive solids with interstitial fluids and used as a guide to determine if slip is present in the geometries typically used to perform rheological flow <b>curve</b> measurements. The <b>vane</b> has been extensively characterized for measuring the shear strength in soils in both field and laboratory studies. The objectives for this task are: Fabricate vane instrument; Bench top testing to further characterize the effect of cohesive, non-cohesive, and blends of cohesive/non-cohesive simple simulants; Data from measurement of homogenized and settled bed of Kaolin sludge and assessment of the technology. In this document, the assessment using bench scale measurements of non-cohesive materials (beads) and cohesive materials (kaolin) is discussed. The non-cohesive materials include various size beads and the vane was assessed for depth and deaeration (or packing) via tapping measurements. For the cohesive (or non-Newtonian) materials, flow curves and yield stress measurements are performed using the vane and this data is compared to the traditional concentric cylinder flow curve measurement. Finally, a large scale vane was designed, fabricated, and tested with the cohesive (or non-Newtonian) materials to determine how a larger vane performs in measuring the yield stress and flow curve of settled cohesive solids...|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} has been {{conducted}} in which the use of pilot-scale centrifugal solvent extraction contactors for cesium removal from an alkaline waste stream has been successfully demonstrated. The program was designed specifically {{to evaluate the use}} of centrifugal contactors having 5 -cm-diam rotors for the removal of cesium from alkaline high-level waste (HLW) that was generated and is being stored at the U. S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS). The removal of cesium from this waste is highly desirable because it will reduce the volume of waste that must be treated and disposed of as HLW. The parameters applied in the test effort are those that have been established for the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process, a multistage extraction operation that has been designed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In the CSSX process, cesium is extracted by calix(4) arene-bis-(fert-octylbenzo-crown- 6), commonly referred to as BOBCalixC 6. The extract is scrubbed with dilute (0. 05 M) nitric acid, both to remove coextracted elements (primarily potassium and sodium) and to adjust the pH of the extract to facilitate recovery of the cesium. The scrubbed solvent is contacted with 0. 001 M HNO{sub 3 }, which results in the stripping of the cesium from the solvent into the aqueous acid. The CSSX process flow rates have been established so to produce a cesium concentration in the strip effluent that is 12 to 15 times the concentration in the waste stream that enters the extraction section of the cascade. Results from initial hydraulic testing of a commercially available 5 -cm contactor under CSSX conditions indicated that the mixing of feed solutions within the unit (which is critical to efficient solute transfer) was limited by a feature of the contactor that was designed to increase throughput and improve separation performance. In the design, phase separation is improved by reducing turbulence within the contactor. Subsequent to the initial hydraulic test: cesium transfer tests were performed using contactors arranged in both single-stage and multistage arrangements. Results of these tests confirmed that phase mixing within the contactor was inadequate. In an effort to improve mixing within the contactor and thereby increase mass transfer efficiency, two minor modifications were made to a single contactor unit. One modification was the replacement of the bottom plate from the vendor-supplied contactor housing, which was equipped with <b>curved</b> (impeller-type) <b>vanes,</b> with a bottom assembly that had straight radial vanes. The latter configuration is the standard used in all existing ANL, ORNL, and SRS contactor designs. The second modification involved enlargement of the opening {{in the bottom of the}} rotor through which dispersion from the contactor mixing zone enters the rotor for separation. By increasing the rotor opening sufficiently, the rotor loses pumping efficiency to such an extent that accumulation of a hydrostatic head in the annular mixing zone is required for solution to be pumped through the contactor to the organic and aqueous discharge ports. By causing a volume of liquid to accumulate in the mixing zone, it is expected that phase mixing will be improved. Following modification of a contactor, hydraulic testing was repeated to determine flow parameters to be applied in mass transfer testing using the modified device. As expected, test results indicated that the maximum throughputs that could be achieved using the modified contactor under extraction and stripping conditions were lower than those obtained using the ''as-received'' unit. However, phase separation performance within the reduced operating envelope was excellent. Most importantly, cesium transfer stage efficiencies were significantly improved over those obtained using the unmodified device and resulted in attainment of the target CSSX process decontamination factor of 40, 000 when extrapolated to the baseline CSSX contactor cascade...|$|R
