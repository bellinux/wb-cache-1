5|$|As {{with other}} {{cockatoo}}s, the red-tailed black cockatoo <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long-lived in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist Neville Cayley reported one over {{fifty years old}} at Taronga Zoo. Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long-lived, {{especially}} in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived {{for more than}} 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.|$|E

5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> accurate.|$|E
5|$|File {{artifacts}} and meta-data {{can be used}} to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of Microsoft Word embedded a Global Unique Identifer into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving whether a file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> important.|$|E
5|$|Older vacuum tube-based {{communications}} receivers are affectionately {{known as}} boatanchors for their large size and weight. Such receivers include the Collins R-390 and R-390A, the RCA AR-88, the Racal RA-17L and the Marconi Elettra. However, even modern solid-state receivers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> large and heavy, {{such as the}} Plessey PR2250, the Redifon R551 or the Rohde & Schwarz EK070.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E
5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} {{are quite}} reactive and present an immediate hazard {{to human health}} on exposure. For example, germanium chloride and germane (GeH4) are a liquid and gas, respectively, that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is {{slower to}} mature than lighter breeds, and thus usually enters harness racing {{competition}} {{at the age of}} four. However, its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and the breed's effective competition career <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long. The Finnish harness racing bylaws allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16.|$|E

5|$|The red wattlebird {{has been}} kept as an aviary bird in Sydney. It is not {{difficult}} to look after but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> aggressive to other cage birds. Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party {{to own the}} right to use a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns {{the right to use}} the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of {{the ages of the}} family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction.
