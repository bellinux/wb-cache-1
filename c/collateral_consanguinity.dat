500|$|While {{dividing}} his time, Blackstone {{became an}} administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746. Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, {{is attributed to}} his work. In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a [...] "perfectionist zeal" [...] in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, An Essay on <b>Collateral</b> <b>Consanguinity,</b> which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls {{in an attempt to}} gain preeminence in elections. Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to Convocation, the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers. With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to [...] "no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [...] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself", which was to give a set of lectures on the common law – the first lectures of that sort in the world.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{clinical trial}} {{in which the}} serum anti-phenolic glycolipid (anti-PGL- 1) antibodies were analysed in household contacts (HHC) of patients with leprosy as an adjunct early leprosy diagnostic marker was conducted. The families of 83 patients underwent clinical examination and serum anti-PGL 1 measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 320 HHC, 98 were contacts of lepromatous leprosy (LL), 80 were contacts of borderline lepromatous (BL), 28 were contacts of borderline (BB) leprosy, 54 were contacts of borderline tuberculoid (BT), 40 were contacts of tuberculoid (TT) and 20 were contacts of indeterminate (I) leprosy. Consanguinity with the patients was determined for 232 (72. 5 %) HHC. Of those 232 contacts, 183 had linear consanguinity. Forty-nine HHC had <b>collateral</b> <b>consanguinity.</b> Fifty-eight contacts (18. 1 %) tested positive for anti-PGL 1 antibodies. The number of seropositive contacts based on the clinical forms of the index case was 17 (29. 3 %) for LL, 15 (25. 9 %) for BL, one (1. 7 %) for BB, 14 (24. 1 %) for BT, three (5. 2 %) for TT and eight (13. 7 %) for I. At the one year follow-up, two (3. 4 %) of these seropositive contacts had developed BT leprosy. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the serum anti-PGL- 1 IgM antibody may be useful for evaluating antigen exposure and as a tool for an early leprosy diagnosis in HHC.
