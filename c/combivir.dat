40|$|Abstract: <b>Combivir</b> is a fixed dose {{combination}} tablet of two antiretroviral drugs; zidovudine and lamivudine, {{used in the}} treatment of HIV- 1 infection. AZT was the first antiretroviral used in clinical trials and the addition of lamivudine improved its effectiveness. With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy {{in the form of a}} combination of three drugs including two nucleoside analogues, <b>Combivir</b> became the gold standard nucleoside ‘backbone ’ until very recently. <b>Combivir</b> was the first combination agent and simplified HIV therapy greatly. The introduction of newer fixed dose combinations with the advantage of once daily dosing and improved tolerability and toxicity profiles has made <b>Combivir</b> a less popular choice in treatment naïve individuals needing to start therapy...|$|E
40|$|Commonly used {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (highly active antiretroviral therapy, HAART) include drug combinations such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + lamivudine (3 TC) and <b>combivir</b> [zidovudine (AZT) + 3 TC] + efavirenz (EFV). These combinations may enhance the genotoxic effects induced by such drugs individually, since the therapy requires lifelong adherence and the drugs have unknown effects during treatment. Thus, the evaluation of the benefits and risks of HAART is of great importance. In order to assess the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of three concentrations of each of the antiretroviral combinations TDF + 3 TC (800 + 400, 1600 + 800, and 3200 + 1600 mg/kg body weight, BW) and <b>combivir</b> + EFV (200 + 100 + 400, 400 + 200 + 800, and 800 + 400 + 1600 mg/kg BW) after two exposure periods (24 h and 48 h), in the present study the in vivo comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test were used. Neither TDF + 3 TC nor <b>combivir</b> + EFV induced DNA damage at any concentrations tested after 24 h or 48 h using the comet assay. After 24 h, both combinations increased the micronucleus frequency at all concentrations tested. After 48 h, <b>combivir</b> + EFV increased the micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (MNPCE) frequency at the two highest concentrations tested. Polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) /normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) ratio was high for both combinations, suggesting that they can be mitogenic. Since genotoxicity may be related to carcinogenesis, it is necessary to conduct further studies to verify the long-term mutagenic effects of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{need for}} a drug policy on HIV/AIDS was {{investigated}} through a pilot clinical study of 20 Persons Living With AIDS (PLWA), (8 males and 12 females) who took <b>combivir</b> antiretroviral drugs (ARV). Their age range was between 11 and 60 years with those between 11 and 40 years presenting most for the drug therapy. Each participant responded orally or in writing to a self-developed questionnaire. Hospital case record files were also reviewed for more data to establish additional complications during therapeutic interventions with <b>combivir</b> therapy. Recommendations for commencing ARV drug therapy as well as side effects and opportunistic infections for combination drug therapy were made. These have significant implications for HIV/AIDS victims, and patients on ARV drugs, counselling and psychotherapy. Policy recommendations emphasise need for drug in terms of combination therapy, sustained health education, empowerment and capacity building, expanded facilities and above all, increase in uptake and availability of ARV drugs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Emergence of drug {{resistance}} following HIV prophylaxis {{has an important}} impact on ART program. Objective: To investigate the emergence of {{drug resistance}} in HIV- 1 infected pregnant women. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three HIV- 1 infected pregnant women who had received 4 - 12 weeks of antenatal AZT followed by Nevirapine during delivery and <b>Combivir</b> [AZT + 3 TC] for 1 week postpartum (group- 1, n = 48) or who come {{at the time of}} delivery and received Nevirapine followed by <b>Combivir</b> for 1 week (group- 2, n = 5) were recruited. Samples were collected {{prior to the start of}} the prophylaxis and 5 - 8 weeks postpartum. In addition, a third sample was collected between 26 - 65 weeks postpartum from 7 women. Amplification of HIV- 1 pol gene and drug resistance analysis was done. Result: Two (3. 8 %) women in group- 1 showed transmitted drug resistance and they continued to show this even at 6 weeks postpartum. One (2 %) woman from group- 1 showed a mutation after 6 - 8 weeks of prophylaxis. Among the samples collected between 26 - 65 weeks postpartum, 3 / 7 (43 %) showed mutations and all these women belong to group- 1. Women belonging to group- 2 didn′t show mutation prior to or following prophylaxis. Conclusion: In contrast to the available data among pregnant women with ART prophylaxis, our data showed reduced frequency of mutations following 5 - 8 weeks of postpartum but an emergence of mutation later (26 - 65 weeks). The addition of <b>Combivir</b> with the single dose Nevirapine during delivery and the early stage of the disease with higher CD 4 counts could be the reasons for this...|$|E

Although the trial was stopped prematurely due to idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, eight subjects met protocol-defined virologic failure criteria. Clonal analyses of the viral envelope tropism, aplaviroc susceptibility, and env sequencing were performed on plasma at baseline {{and at the time}} of virologic failure. Molecular evolutionary analyses were also performed. The majority of the subjects with virologic failure (six of eight) acquired the lamivudine resistance-associated mutation M 184 V, and none had evidence of reduced susceptibility to aplaviroc at the time of virologic failure, even at the clonal level. Six subjects with virologic failure maintained CCR 5 tropism, while two exhibited a change in population tropism readout to dual/mixed-tropic with R 5 X 4 -tropic clones detected prior to therapy. Two evolutionary patterns were observed: five subjects had no evidence of population turnover, while three subjects had multiple lines of evidence for env population turnover.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS {{incidence}} and mortality rates have decreased in the U. S. since 1996. Accompanying the longer life spans of those {{diagnosed with the}} disease, however, is a tremendous rise in expenditures on medication. The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the trends in utilization of, spending on, and market shares of antiretroviral medications in the U. S. Medicaid Program. Antiretroviral drugs include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and fusion inhibitors (FIs). Methods Utilization and payment data from 1991 to 2005 are provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Descriptive summary analyses were used to assess quarterly prescription numbers and amounts of payment. Results The total number of prescriptions for antiretrovirals increased from 168, 914 in 1991 to 2. 0 million in 1998, and 3. 0 million in 2005, a 16. 7 -fold increase over 15 years. The number of prescriptions for NRTIs reached 1. 6 million in 2005. Prescriptions for PIs increased from 114 in 1995 to 932, 176 in 2005, while the number of prescriptions for NNRTIs increased from 1, 339 in 1996 to 401, 272 in 2005. The total payment for antiretroviral drugs in the U. S. Medicaid Program increased from US$ 30. 6 million in 1991 to US$ 1. 6 billion in 2005, a 49. 8 -fold increase. In 2005, NRTIs as a class had the highest payment market share. These drugs alone accounted for US$ 787. 9 million in Medicaid spending (50. 8 percent of spending on antiretrovirals). Payment per prescription for each drug, with the exception of Agenerase ®, increased, at least somewhat, over time. The relatively expensive drugs in 2005 included Trizivir ® ($ 1040) and <b>Combivir</b> ® ($ 640), as well as Reyataz ® ($ 750), Lexiva ® ($ 700), Sustiva ® ($ 420), Viramune ® ($ 370), and Fuzeon ® ($ 1914). Conclusion The tremendous growth in antiretroviral spending is due primarily to rising utilization, secondarily to the entry of newer, more expensive antiretrovirals, and, finally, in part to rising per-prescription cost of existing medications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Chinese {{government}} has provided health services to those infected {{by the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) under the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) care policy since 2003. Detailed research on the actual expenditures and costs for providing care to patients with AIDS is needed for future financial planning of AIDS health care services and possible reform of HIV/AIDS-related policy. The {{purpose of the current}} {{study was to determine the}} actual expenditures and factors influencing costs for untreated AIDS patients in a rural area of China after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) under the national Free Care Program (China CARES). Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Yunnan and Shanxi Provinces, where HAART and all medical care are provided free to HIV-positive patients. Health expenditures and costs in the first treatment year were collected from medical records and prescriptions at local hospitals between January and June 2007. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine the factors associated with the actual expenditures in the first antiretroviral (ARV) treatment year. Results Five ARV regimens are commonly used in China CARES: zidovudine (AZT) + lamivudine (3 TC) + nevirapine (NVP), stavudine (D 4 T) + 3 TC + efavirenz (EFV), D 4 T + 3 TC + NVP, didanosine (DDI) + 3 TC + NVP and <b>combivir</b> + EFV. The mean annual expenditure per person for ARV medications was US$ 2, 242 (US$ 1 = 7 Chinese Yuan (CNY)) among 276 participants. The total costs for treating all adverse drug events (ADEs) and opportunistic infections (OIs) were US$ 29, 703 and US$ 23, 031, respectively. The expenses for treatment of peripheral neuritis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were the highest among those patients with ADEs and OIs, respectively. On the basis of multivariate linear regression, CD 4 cell counts (100 - 199 cells/&# 956;L versus < 100 cells/&# 956;L, P = 0. 02; and &# 8805; 200 cells/&# 956;L versus < 100 cells/&# 956;L, P < 0. 004), residence in Mangshi County (P < 0. 0001), ADEs (P = 0. 04) and OIs (P = 0. 02) were significantly associated with total expenditures in the first ARV treatment year. Conclusions This is the first study to determine the actual costs of HIV treatment in rural areas of China. Costs for ARV drugs represented the major portion of HIV medical expenditures. Initiating HAART in patients with higher CD 4 cell count levels is likely to reduce treatment expenses for ADEs and OIs in patients with AIDS...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the influence of an HIV infection with tuberculosis or chronic viral hepatitis on efficiency and safety during 48 weeks of HAART. Methods: HAART was received by 327 na&#x 00 EF;ve HIV patients (pts). Clinical symptoms of an HIV infection had 273 pts (83. 5 %). The 1 st group - 59 HIV pts with tuberculosis, the 2 nd group - 217 HIV pts with chronic viral hepatitis, the 3 rd group - 51 HIV-monoinfected pts. All pts were treated with 2 NRTI +&#x 200 A;EFV/PI. Evaluation of HAART efficacy based on the change of amount CD 4 cells and RNA HIV level after 24 and 48 weeks therapy. Safety of HAART was evaluated on the frequency of adverse events and the change of laboratory abnormalities. Results: After 24 weeks 61 &#x 2013; 72 % of patients had undetectable RNA HIV level. CD 4 cells increased in all groups. The percentage of pts with low CD 4 cells (&# 60; 200 cells/mm 3) decreased from 40 &#x 2013; 55 % to 26 &#x 2013; 30 %. After 48 weeks HAART CD 4 cells increased by 90 &#x 2013; 127 cells/mm 3 (vs baseline) in all pts, however 17. 4 &#x 2013; 26. 7 % pts saved low CD 4 cells. Undetectable RNA HIV level registered in 75. 6 % pts with tuberculosis and 87. 5 &#x 2013; 88. 8 % other pts. The proportion of pts who had adverse events was more among 1 st and 2 nd groups as compared as HIV-monoinfected pts (33 &#x 2013; 35 % and 19 %, p&#x 200 A;&# 60;&#x 200 A; 0. 05) after 24 weeks of therapy. After 48 weeks HAART the frequency of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities decreased to 20 &#x 2013; 28 % in 1 st and 2 nd groups and to 2 % in 3 rd group. The most frequent we observed CNS disorders (grade 1) due to EFV and gastrointestinal symptoms due to PI or <b>Combivir</b> (CBV). In pts with accompanying diseases the frequent increase of ALT level was observed in 30 &#x 2013; 40 %, in HIV-monoinfected pts - 4 &#x 2013; 10 %. The frequency of interruption HAART was greatest among patients with tuberculosis - 14. 3 % (vs 5 % and 5. 8 % in patients with hepatitis and monoinfected patients). In general, the interrupt has been associated with the combination of side effects of antiretroviral and antituberculosis drugs. Conclusions: Availability of chronic liver disease or tuberculosis almost have no influence on the HAART efficacy. However, essential increase the frequency of adverse events HAART that leads to change HAART regimen or interruption it...|$|E
