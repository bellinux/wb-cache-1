5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. <b>Connective</b> <b>tissue</b> gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose <b>connective</b> <b>tissue,</b> adipose tissue, fibrous <b>connective</b> <b>tissue,</b> cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other <b>connective</b> <b>tissues,</b> {{cartilage}} {{does not}} contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by diffusion, helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other <b>connective</b> <b>tissues,</b> cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.|$|R
5000|$|Dermis: Muse cells, {{detected}} as SSEA-3-positive cells, {{are located}} sparsely in the <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> of organs. In the human dermis, Muse cells {{are located in}} the <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> distributed in the dermis and hypodermis. Their location is not related to particular structures such as blood vessels or dermal papilla.|$|R

5|$|The lung is {{surrounded}} by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> attached to the substance of the lung.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> Together, the osteoderms and <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|Cholangiosarcoma is a tumor of the <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> of the bile ducts.|$|R
40|$|<b>Connective</b> <b>tissues</b> {{have many}} {{features}} in common, including resisting and dissipating mechanical load and providing shape, as well as acting to provide barriers regulating water flow and diffusibility of macromolecules. In this chapter we have chosen to focus on cartilage and bone, covering many aspects of <b>connective</b> <b>tissues.</b> We give special focus to the noncollagenous proteins in their matrices...|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of fibroblasts {{is to maintain}} the structural integrity of <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> by continuously secreting precursors of the extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts secrete the precursors of all {{the components of the}} extracellular matrix, primarily the ground substance and a variety of fibers. The composition of the extracellular matrix determines the physical properties of <b>connective</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{two main}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} underlying cause of SCSFLS are {{as a result of}} a <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> disorder or spinal drainage problems.|$|E

5|$|The {{outermost}} {{zone of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.|$|E

50|$|A {{lubricating}} role of hyaluronan in muscular <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> {{to enhance}} the sliding between adjacent tissue layers has been suggested. A particular type of fibroblasts, embedded in dense fascial tissues, has been proposed as being cells specialized for the biosynthesis of the hyaluronan-rich matrix. Their related activity could be involved in regulating the sliding ability between adjacent muscular <b>connective</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} epithelial <b>tissues</b> (epithelium), <b>connective</b> <b>tissues,</b> (ligaments and bone), {{muscle tissue}} and nervous tissue.|$|R

5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin {{at the top of the}} head is compacted and the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> called septum separates the glands from the kidneys.

5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery.
