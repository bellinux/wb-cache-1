40|$|The {{attenuation}} of {{an acoustic}} wavefront in metals comes from scattering caused by grain anisotropy and random grain orientation and from absorption caused by mechanisms such as dislocation and magnetic domain motion. In this paper laser ultrasonics, with its non-contact and broadband characteristics, {{is used for}} measuring and separating these two attenuation contributions {{as a function of}} frequency. Results obtained from the well-known pulse-echo method and reverberation technique are presented first. Then, a more recent approach using a time-frequency analysis with zerogroup velocity (ZGV) resonances is considered. It is shown that the <b>attenuation</b> <b>with</b> <b>scattering</b> and absorption components is obtained by fitting the temporal decay of the resonances of the coherent field, and that only the absorption component is obtained from the temporal decay of the diffuse field between resonances.

30|$|A phantom {{study with}} {{clinically}} realistic uptake patterns for {{the liver and}} lung demonstrated the improved accuracy of lung shunt estimates based on SPECT/CT <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> corrections over estimates from planar imaging. The patient studies demonstrated the same trend observed in the phantom study with substantially higher lung shunt estimates from planar imaging compared with those determined by SPECT/CT with corrections. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between LSFs from post-therapy 90 Y PET/CT and pre-therapy 99 mTc-MAA SPECT/CT <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> corrections. There was no correlation between lung shunt estimates and the time delay between MAA injection and scanning, although on visual assessment, there was evidence of increased off-target uptake in extra-hepatic organs with time. In summary, the improved accuracy demonstrated by the phantom study, the agreement with 90 Y PET/CT and practicality of using auto-contouring for liver/lung definition suggests that 99 mTc-MAA SPECT/CT should be used for lung shunt estimation in TARE.|$|R
30|$|Ameloblastoma and ameloblastic {{carcinoma}} {{most commonly}} {{occur in the}} posterior mandible, typically {{in the region of}} the third molar, with associated follicular cysts or impacted teeth. The slow growth of the tumor can lead to significant expansion of the mandible. Radiographically, both lesions can appear radiolucent, being either unilocular or multilocular, exhibiting a honeycomb-like appearance with tooth root resorption. Both lesions often have distinct borders, slight marginal sclerosis without periosteal new bone formation, loss of the lamina dura, resorption of the tooth apex and tooth displacement (Devenney-Cakir et al. 2010, Dunfee et al. 2006). CT findings include cystic areas of low <b>attenuation</b> <b>with</b> <b>scattered</b> isoattenuating regions, representating soft tissue components. The lesion can also erode through the cortex with extension into the surrounding oral mucosa (Dunfee et al. 2006). In addition, erosion of the roots of adjacent teeth is unique to ameloblastoma and indicates the aggressive behavior of the tumor. MRI demonstrates several common findings: multilocularity, mixed solid and cystic components, irregularly thick walls, papillary projections, and marked enhancement of the walls and septa (Dunfee et al. 2006, Minami et al. 1992). MRI is superior to conventional radiography and CT in demonstrating components of the tumor, extension within the bone marrow and involvement of adjacent extraosseous structures, which is important when considering surgical resection or reconstruction planning (Devenney-Cakir et al. 2010, Dunfee et al. 2006, Matsuzaki et al. 2011, Minami et al. 1992). Ameloblastic carcinoma generally exhibits more aggressive features such as dystrophic calcifications, cortical destruction, extraosseous extension and an extensive solid component.|$|R

In this study, we have considered the General Electric Infinia Hawkeye 4, Philips Brightview XCT, and Siemens Symbia T 6 SPECT-CT cameras, which have been on the market for several years, but we also looked at the very recently introduced General Electric Discovery NM/CT 670. The manufacturers’ 3 D iterative reconstruction <b>with</b> <b>attenuation,</b> <b>scatter,</b> and resolution corrections was systematically used. The manufacturers’ default parameters for these corrections were systematically used while the impact of the number of iterations was studied. Attenuation and scatter accuracy, contrast recovery of hot and cold regions of different sizes, and finally, quantification using three calibration phantoms of different sizes have been analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first homogeneous comparative study between the four state-of-the-art SPECT-CT systems of three major nuclear medicine vendors.|$|R

The use of hybrid images or studies in which simulated lesions are added to known normal clinical acquisitions represents a practical alternative to the use of purely clinical acquisitions for observer studies. The goal of this investigation was to use hybrid images of the lung tumor imaging agent Tc- 99 m NeoTect in Localization Receiver Operating Characteristic (LROC) studies to determine reconstruction parameters and whether iterative reconstruction <b>with</b> <b>attenuation,</b> <b>scatter,</b> and distance-dependent resolution compensation should replace FBP clinically.

40|$|Purpose: The {{combination}} of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computer tomography (CT) that incorporates iterative reconstruction algorithms <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> correction should facilitate accurate non-invasive quantitative imaging. Quantitative SPECT (QSPECT) may improve diagnostic ability {{and could be}} useful for many applications including dosimetry assessment. Using 177 Lu, we developed a QSPECT method using a commercially available SPECT/CT system. Methods: Serial SPECT of 177 Lu sources (89 – 12, 400 MBq) were acquired with multiple contiguous energy windows along with a co-registered CT, and were reconstructed using an iterative algorithm <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> correction. Camera sensitivity (based on reconstructed SPECT count rate) and dead-time (based on wide-energy spectrum count rate) were resolved by non-linear curve fit. Utilizing these parameters, a SPECT dataset {{can be converted to}} a QSPECT dataset allowing quantitation in Becquerels per cubic centimetre or standardized uptake value (SUV). Validation QSPECT/CT studies were performed on a 177 Lu cylindrical phantom (7 studies) and on 5 patients (6 studies) who were administered a therapeutic dose of [177 Lu]octreotate. Results: The QSPECT sensitivity was 1. 08 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 [*]±[*] 0. 02 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 s− 1 Bq− 1. The paralyzing dead-time constant was 0. 78 [*]±[*] 0. 03 [*]µs. The measured total activity with QSPECT deviated from the calibrated activity by 5. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 9 % and 2. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 8 %, respectively, in phantom and patients. Dead-time count loss up to 11. 7 % was observed in patient studies. Conclusion: QSPECT has high accuracy both in our phantom model and in clinical practice following [177 Lu]octreotate therapy. This has the potential to yield more accurate dosimetry estimates than planar imaging and facilitate therapeutic response assessment. Validating this method with other radionuclides could open the way for many other research and clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{dissipation}} during {{wave propagation}} in fragmented geomaterials {{can be caused}} by independent movement of fragments leading to energy loss on their impact. By considering a pair of impacting fragments at times much greater than the period of their oscillations, we show that at a large timescale, the dynamics of the pair can be described by a linear viscous model with damping coefficients expressed through the restitution coefficient representing energy loss on impact. Wave propagation in fragmented geomaterials is also considered at the large timescale assuming that the wavelengths are much larger than the fragment sizes such that the <b>attenuation</b> associated <b>with</b> wave <b>scattering</b> on the fragment interfaces can be neglected. These assumptions lead to the Kelvin–Voigt model of damping during wave propagation, which allows the determination of a dispersion relationship. As the attenuation and dispersion are not related to the rate dependence of rock deformation, but rather to the interaction of fragments, the increased energy dispersion at low frequencies can be seen as an indication of the fragmented nature of the geomaterial and the capacity of the fragments for independent movement...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the image {{quality and the}} accuracy of attenuation and scatter corrections methodologies provided with the microPET Focus 120 scanner. The protocol used here is described in the forthcoming NEMA NU 4 - 2008 document. This study included 1 h transmission experiments, with two sources (68 Ge and 57 Co, both one half-live old), in coincidence mode (Ge) with and without windowing, and singles mode (Ge and Co). Transmission data with Co were also collected for shorter acquisition times (515 / 1030 / 2060 s). Transmission <b>with</b> <b>scatter</b> correction, and emission <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>with</b> or without <b>scatter</b> correction, slices were reconstructed using 2 D-FBP (ramp filter). The uniformity, the recovery coefficients (RC) and the accuracy of corrections were evaluated {{as described in the}} NEMA document. We also determined the attenuation coefficient (AC) for water using the methodology applied to measure the mean pixel value for the emission slices of the uniform part of the phantom. The Co single mode measurements provided a mean AC for water closer to the theoretical value than the Ge measurements either in single or in coincidence mode even for the shortest acquisition time. Moreover, the lowest coefficients of variation per pixel of the uniform slices were measured for attenuation corrected data based on Co measurements. Also, spill-over ratio for non-emitting air and water compartments reflected a higher capability of this attenuation correction method for scatter correction. The RC measured on emission image corrected only for attenuation did not show any significant difference linked to the transmission measured methods. However, higher RC values were noted for Ge coincidence with windowing when emission data were corrected for both attenuation and scatter. Hence, Co singles transmission seems to be the most suitable method for attenuation correction on the microPET Focus 120 scanner. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|We {{have shown}} that planar {{acquisition}} of a point-like source provides CF very close to those obtained from tomographic images (reconstructed <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> corrections) of a phantom where the activity is distributed over the entire volume (with or without the hot object(s) in its center).

Usually, such phantom configuration {{is considered to be a}} good approximation of activity distribution encountered in clinical patient studies. However, our analysis suggests that, for all investigated radiotherapy isotopes, the camera calibration based on a planar scan of a point source must include scatter correction. This is because photopeak windows for 131 I and 188 Re, and to a lesser degree for 177 Lu, contain important component from scattered high-energy gamma emissions (and septal penetration for 131 I).|$|R

The dual-window method was used for scatter subtraction. We used a Monte Carlo simulation of the SPECT system to accurately determine the scatter multiplier factor k. Volume estimation using SPECT was performed by summing up the volume elements (voxels) lying within the contour of the object, determined by a fixed threshold and the gray level histogram (GLH) method. Thyroid phantom and patient studies were performed and the influence of 1) fixed thresholding, 2) automatic thresholding, 3) attenuation, 4) scatter, and 5) reconstruction filter were investigated.

Moreover, some studies used separate stand-alone SPECT and CT systems, and the data were reconstructed with a locally developed software. More recently, Zeintl et al.

30|$|The {{accuracy}} of semi-automatic segmentation {{is affected by}} a number of factors coupled to the characteristics of SPECT images. In Monte Carlo-simulated images a good tumour volume and activity concentration accuracy is obtained for two segmentation methods (Otsu method and Fourier surface method) when images are reconstructed <b>with</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>scatter</b> compensation, while if including resolution compensation underestimated volumes and overestimated activity concentrations are obtained. Using an adaptive surface based on Fourier descriptors has advantages if the image noise levels are high, for example if the tumour activity retention is to be followed {{for a long period of}} time. For images with less noise, for example early imaging time-points in the course of radionuclide therapy dosimetry, an adaptive thresholding algorithm like the Otsu method yields approximately equivalent results as the Fourier surface method. The results are encouraging for application in tumour dosimetry, although challenges can be foreseen due to the diversity of patient images. Further studies of the differences in tumour extension when visualized in functional SPECT and in morphological CT or MR images are of interest.|$|R

The results in patients showed a similar trend with planar imaging significantly overestimating LSF compared to SPECT/CT. There was no correlation between lung shunt estimates and the delay between 99 mTc-MAA administration and scanning, but off-target extra hepatic uptake {{tended to be more}} likely in patients with a longer delay. The mean lung absorbed dose predictions for the 28 patients who underwent therapy was 9.3  Gy (range 1.3 – 29.4) for planar imaging and 3.2  Gy (range 0.4 – 13.4) for SPECT/CT.

40|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) of the myocardium {{accounts for the}} vast majority of nuclear cardiology procedures performed worldwide. This is mainly due to its wide availability, and its established and clinically validated diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. It is due to the availability of quantitative software allowing for reliable and reproducible assessments of myocardial perfusion and function. For many SPECT images were obtained using the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm. Recently, due major advances in hardware and software developments 3 -D Iterative Reconstruction algorithms became widely available in nuclear cardiology departments. These SPECT reconstruction algorithms offer improved spatial resolution and image contrast as well as accurate implementation of attenuation and scatter corrections. More recently, the hybrid imaging modality SPECT/CT became more widely available radiotracer distribution as well as for computed tomography. In recent years, research into the effect of attenuation and scatter corrections has concluded that combining CT <b>attenuation</b> correction <b>with</b> <b>scatter</b> correcting provides a precise quantification of radiopharmaceutical distribution obtained in SPECT research. Although the method has been proven to attain “clean” images for a variety of diagnostic means, its effects under respiratory cardiac motions using SPECT and high resolution algorithms in 3 -D iterative reconstruction imaging is yet to be tested. This study aims to determine the efficacy and quantitative accuracy for 3 -D iterative reconstruction algorithms when compared to FBP techniques for cardiac SPECT images. The study will attempt to investigate the issue of respiratory induced cardiac motion and to demonstrate its effect on spatial resolution, image contrast and quantification in nuclear cardiology on SPECT images reconstructed using FBP and Flash (OSEM) 3 -D algorithms. We carried out two types of investigations involving experimental measurements carried out on three different phantoms, and Monte Carlo simulations using the GATE package.

We filled each of these spheres with a solution of 2.7 [*]kBq/ml of 223 Ra. In order to model the attenuation and scatter, the remaining portion of the phantom was filled with water. We placed the phantom on the table {{in the center of the}} field of view and positioned the gamma camera heads at 10 [*]cm in front of it. We acquired SPECT/CT images. The acquisition parameters were 6 ° between each projection, 128 [*]×[*] 128 matrix, pixel size 4.4 [*]mm, and circular orbit.

During the reconstructions, each image was corrected for attenuation using CT-based attenuation maps and for scatter using the Jaszczak method [25].

Functional images of the TBF, TMRO 2, OEF, and TBV were reconstructed using in-house software from the last 6 -min frame of each 15 O-labelled gases study. A tissue–blood partition coefficient for water was fixed at 0.91  mL/g [12]. The correction value of the hematocrit between the great vessels and the tissue was fixed at 0.70 [13]. The TBV data were used to correct for intravascular hemoglobin-bound 15 O 2 [14].|$|R

40|$|Measurements of fog {{characteristics}} are rare, and therefore models for predicting the attenuation caused by fog on {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic radiation are scarce. Using experimental transmissions through moderate radiation fogs on a 500 -m path, a method is developed to infer the physical characteristics of fog from <b>concurrent</b> <b>attenuation</b> measurements at millimeter, infrared, and visible wavelengths. It {{makes it possible to}} retrieve the fog drop size distribution, as well as its time evolution, during the life cycle of a fog event. It yields realistic values for fog features, such as liquid water content and average drop diameter, which are not easily measured. Furthermore, on an experimental basis, simple relationships between inferred fog characteristics and measured attenuation are proposed. It is found that while both millimetric and infrared attenuations are directly related to liquid water content, visible attenuation strongly depends {{on the size of the}} fog droplets. Overall, using these relationships together with statistical distributions of inferred fog characteristics enables predictions of fog attenuation at any wavelength from millimetric to visible...|$|R
