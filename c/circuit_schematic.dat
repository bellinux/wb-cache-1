40|$|MOOCs are disrupting {{educational}} technology by democratizing access to high quality courses offered {{by some of}} the most prestigious universities. However, due to low entry cost and multiple other factors, MOOCs suffer from low retention rates: making MOOCs more interactive and engaging is therefore an important goal. Educational games provide environments that mix both immersion and quick feedback cycles, and we consider that games also have the potential to improve interaction and assessment in MOOCs environments; indeed, many game-like simulations have already been successfully applied within MOOCs in domains such as electronic <b>circuits</b> (<b>schematic</b> <b>circuit</b> simulator) and biology (foldit, eyewire). In this work, we analyze multiple such experiences and propose a catalogue of best practices that could contribute to the successful integration of educational games into MOOC platforms...|$|R

50|$|The mutual goal of IEEE Std 91-1984 and IEC 60617-12 was {{to provide}} a uniform method of {{describing}} the complex logic functions of digital <b>circuits</b> with <b>schematic</b> symbols.

50|$|Inserting a norator in a <b>circuit</b> <b>schematic</b> {{provides}} whatever {{current and}} voltage the outside circuit demands, in particular, {{the demands of}} Kirchhoff's circuit laws.

50|$|Schematic-driven layout {{allows for}} several {{features}} {{that make the}} layout designer's job easier and faster.

40|$|Optimization-based design {{automation}} for analog ICs still remains behind the demands. A promising alternative {{is given by}} procedural approaches such as parameterized generators, also known as PCells. We {{are working on a}} complete analog design flow based on parameterized generators for entire circuits and corresponding layout modules. Because the conventional programming of such enhanced generators is far too complicated and costly, new methods are needed to ease their development. This paper presents gPCDS (graphical PCDS), a novel tool for a designer-oriented development of schematic module generators, integrated into a common schematic entry environment. The tool is based on PCDS (Parameterized Circuit Description Scheme), a meta-language for the creation of parametrized analog <b>circuits.</b> <b>Schematic</b> module generators are a very desirable complement to layout module generators in order to achieve a seamless schematic- driven layout design flow on module level. By facilitating a way of generator development that matches a design expert’s mentality, gPCDS contributes to close this gap in the analog design flow...|$|R
5000|$|Comparison: The {{extracted}} layout netlist is {{then compared}} to the netlist taken from the <b>circuit</b> <b>schematic.</b> If the two netlists match, then the circuit passes the LVS check.

5000|$|Since {{the current}} in a wire or {{component}} can flow in either direction, when a variable [...] is defined to represent that current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the <b>circuit</b> <b>schematic</b> diagram. This {{is called the}} reference direction of current [...] If the current flows in the opposite direction, the variable [...] has a negative value.|$|E
50|$|Inserting a nullator in a <b>circuit</b> <b>schematic</b> {{imposes a}} {{mathematical}} constraint on how that circuit must behave, forcing the circuit itself to adopt whatever arrangements {{needed to meet}} the condition. For example, the inputs of an ideal operational amplifier (with negative feedback) behave like a nullator, as they draw no current and have no voltage across them, and these conditions are {{used to analyze the}} circuitry surrounding the operational amplifier.|$|E
