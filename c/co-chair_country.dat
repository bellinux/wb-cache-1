5000|$|Inter ethnic {{fighting}} between Armenia and neighbouring Azerbaijan broke out {{shortly after the}} parliament of Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia on February 20, 1988. The Armenian demand to unify Karabakh with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, as the Soviet Union's disintegration neared, the dispute gradually grew into a violent conflict between the ethnic groups in Nagorno-Karabakh, resulting in ethnic cleansing by all sides.The joint declaration between Cyprus and Armenia in January 2011 mentions that the Republic of Cyprus expresses its support to the constructive efforts of the Republic of Armenia to resolve Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within the OSCE Minsk Group process through negotiations based {{on the principles of}} the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final act and the elements proposed by the Presidents of the OSCE Minsk Group <b>Co-Chair</b> <b>countries,</b> which include, inter alia, the determination of the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh through legally binding expression of will. In return Armenian President welcomed Cyprus position as a member of EU for its balanced stance on the Karabakh issue, drawing attention to determination of Nagorno-Karabakh’s final status in terms of legally binding free expression of will[...]|$|R
5000|$|Armenia responded {{again in}} saying that the”only gauge to measure Azerbaijan’s words is their {{participation}} of OSCE summits and the statements {{of the president of}} the <b>co-chair</b> <b>countries.</b> such Armenia was in line with these documents and Armenia and the international community speak in one language on Nagorno-Karabakh. It is time for Azerbaijan to listen to the UN.” He also sought appealed to the politics of memory and remind Azerbaijan: in 1988 Nagorno-Karabakh peacefully asked for independence and was then attacked by Azerbaijan; in 1992 after self-defence measures it declared independence, it is “not difficult to remember basic textbook facts” but Azerbaijan retells the story in a manner they would like to see themselves and the statements of Azerbaijan indicate it is a “racist and xenophobic state;” and that on 18 September 2013, Aliyev said: the [...] "national flag of Azerbaijan must be raised in Shusha and Hankandi and Azerbaijanis should live on all historic lands of Erevan...the time will come when we Azeris will live there I’m sure of that time is passing we simply want it to happen soon." [...] Armenia reminded the audience that the geographic names are distorted Azerbaijani versions of Armenian names and that “tomorrow Azerbaijan will give a brief on the programme for the month, the month of its presidency the UNSC, and will speak of peace. No one in their right mind will believe that. Azerbaijan can’t advocate for war on its neighbour and talk of peace. This sounds like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
