5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of {{species of plants}} have provided drugs to treat {{a wide range of}} conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, <b>colchicum,</b> henbane, opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
500|$|In botany, {{the term}} [...] "tessellate" [...] {{describes}} a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the fritillary and some species of <b>Colchicum</b> are characteristically tessellate.|$|E
500|$|De Materia Medica (Latin {{name for}} the Greek work Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, Peri hules iatrikēs, both meaning [...] "On Medical Material") is a {{pharmacopoeia}} of herbs and the medicines that {{can be obtained from}} them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, <b>colchicum,</b> henbane, opium and squill. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.|$|E

500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, <b>colchicum,</b> henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E

[...] These include the tubulin polymerization inhibitor colchicine isolated from the <b>Colchicum</b> autumnale (autumn crocus flowering plant), which is used to treat gout. [...] Colchicine is biosynthesized from the amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan. Paclitaxel, in contrast, is a tubulin polymerization stabilizer and is used as a chemotherapeutic drug.

50|$|Nerine bowdenii {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} in temperate regions, where it requires warmth and shelter in colder areas, but is quite hardy, {{being able to}} withstand temperatures of -15 C. It needs to be planted where it cannot be disturbed for several years, and blooms best when the bulbs are crowded. The species grows best in heat and well-drained soil. However, it will not tolerate tropical or very humid weather. It is suggested that <b>colchicums</b> and cyclamens are good choices of companion plants to grow with this species.|$|R

Accentuating the play between light and shade, its formal lawns are interspersed with areas of dark shrubbery. This garden features a number of specimens from North America including red oaks, western red cedars, and a meadow with a walled garden. There are double borders of mixed shrubs, a herbaceous border, and more. The orchard has been planted with varieties of fruit known to have grown in the garden during the 19th century. The gardens are home to the National Collection of <b>colchicums.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "--In {{the chamber}} of horrors! Gad, doosid good!" [...] Pop cried. [...] "They are old rogues, most of 'em, and no mistake. There's old Blondel; there's my Uncle <b>Colchicum,</b> the most confounded old sinner in Europe; there's--hullo! there's {{somebody}} rapping the window and nodding at us." ...|$|E
60|$|Here was {{delightful}} {{news for}} Pen! He professed himself very much obliged indeed to Lord <b>Colchicum,</b> {{and made him}} a handsome speech of thanks, to which the other listened with his double opera-glass up to his eyes. Pen was full of excitement {{at the idea of}} being a member of this polite Club.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is Lord Viscount <b>Colchicum,</b> Miss Fanny," [...] said Pen {{with an air}} of protection. He {{meant no}} harm; he was pleased to patronise the young girl, and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty, and that she should be hanging upon his arm, and that yonder elderly Don Juan should have seen her there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} much as that,--I knew her family in India,"--Major Pendennis said, [...] "I knew her family in India; her father was an {{enormously}} rich old indigo-planter,--know all about her;--Clavering has the next estate to ours in the country.--Ha! there's my nephew walking with"--"With mine,--the infernal young scamp," [...] said Lord <b>Colchicum</b> glowering at Popjoy out of his heavy eyebrows; and {{he turned away from}} the window as Major Pendennis tapped upon it.|$|E
60|$|Thus on {{the very}} first night of his arrival in London, Mr. Arthur Pendennis found himself {{introduced}} to a Club, to an actress of genteel comedy and a heavy father of the Stage, and to a dashing society of jovial blades, old and young; for my Lord <b>Colchicum,</b> though stricken in years, bald of head and enfeebled in person, was still indefatigable {{in the pursuit of}} enjoyment, and it was the venerable Viscount's boast that he could drink as much claret as the youngest member of the society which he frequented. He lived with the youth about town: he gave them countless dinners at Richmond and Greenwich: an enlightened patron of the drama in all languages and of the Terpsichorean art, he received dramatic professors of all nations at his banquets--English from the Covent Garden and Strand houses, Italians from the Haymarket, French from their own pretty little theatre, or the boards of the Opera where they danced. And at his villa on the Thames, this pillar of the State gave sumptuous entertainments to scores of young men of fashion, who very affably consorted with the ladies and gentlemen of the greenroom--with the former chiefly, for Viscount <b>Colchicum</b> preferred their society as more polished and gay than that of their male brethren.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is no need}} to give a {{prolonged}} detail of the animated conversation which ensued {{during the rest of the}} banquet; a conversation which would not much edify the reader. And it is scarcely necessary to say, that all ladies of the corps de dance are not like Miss Calverley, any more than that all peers resemble that illustrious member of their order, the late lamented Viscount <b>Colchicum.</b> But there have been such in our memories who have loved the society of riotous youth better than the company of men of their own age and rank, and have given the young ones the precious benefit of their experience and example; and there have been very respectable men too who have not objected so much to the kind of entertainment as to the publicity of it. I am sure, for instance, that our friend Major Pendennis would have made no sort of objection to join the a party of pleasure, provided that it were en petit comite, and that such men as my Lord Steyne and my Lord <b>Colchicum</b> were of the society. [...] "Give the young men their pleasures," [...] this worthy guardian said to Pen more than once. [...] "I'm not one of your strait-laced moralists, but an old man of the world, begad; and I know that as long as it lasts young men will be young men." [...] And there were some young men to whom this estimable philosopher accorded about seventy years as the proper period for sowing their wild oats: but they were men of fashion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys will be boys," [...] the mollified uncle {{thought to}} himself. [...] "He has written to me a devilish good letter. <b>Colchicum</b> {{says he has}} had him to dine, and thinks him a gentlemanlike lad. His mother {{is one of the}} best creatures in the world. If he has sown his wild oats, and will stick to his business, he may do well yet. Think of Charley Mirabel, the old fool, marrying that flame of his! that Fotheringay! He doesn't like to come here until I give him leave, and puts it in a very manly nice way. I was deuced angry with him, after his Oxbridge escapades--and showed it too when he was here before--Gad, I'll go and see him, hang me if I don't." ...|$|E
60|$|Pen, being {{new to the}} town, {{would have}} liked to listen to Mrs. Leary; but the other people in the box did not care about her song or her pantaloons, and kept up an incessant chattering. Tiptoff knew where her maillots came from. <b>Colchicum</b> saw her when she came out in '14. Miss Blenkinsop said she sang out of all tune, to the pain and astonishment of Pen, who thought that she was as {{beautiful}} as an angel, and that she sang like a nightingale; and when Hoppus came on as Sir Harcourt Featherby, the young man of the piece, the gentlemen in the box declared that Hoppus was getting too stale, and Tiptoff was for flinging Miss Blenkinsop's bouquet to him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Colchicum</b> was in {{attendance}} upon Mademoiselle Carandine, little Tom Tufthunt was {{in attendance}} upon Lord Colchicum; and rather pleased, too, with his position. When Don Juan scalles the wall, there's never a {{want of a}} Leporello to hold the ladder. Tom Tufthunt was quite happy to act as friend to the elderly viscount, and to carve the fowl, {{and to make the}} salad at supper. When Pen and his young lady met the Viscount's party, that noble poor only gave Arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordship's eyes passed from Pen's face under the bonnet of Pen's companion. But Tom Tufthunt wagged his head very good-naturedly at Mr. Arthur, and said, [...] "How are you, old boy?" [...] and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history.|$|E
60|$|Veratrine, Colchicine, Theine.--Solutions {{were made}} of these three {{alkaloids}} by adding one part to 437 of water. Half-minims were placed, in each case; on the discs of at least six leaves, but no inflection was caused, except perhaps a very slight amount by the theine. Half-minims of a strong infusion of tea likewise produced, as formerly stated, no effect. I also tried similar drops of an infusion of {{one part of the}} extract of <b>colchicum,</b> sold by druggists, to 218 of water; and the leaves were observed for 48 hrs., without any effect being produced. The seven leaves on which drops of veratrine had been left for 26 hrs. were given bits of meat, and after 21 hrs. were well inflected. These three alkaloids are therefore quite innocuous.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Foker {{found the}} dinner at Richmond {{to be the}} most dreary {{entertainment}} upon which ever mortal man wasted his guineas. [...] "I wonder how the deuce I could ever have liked these people," [...] he thought in his own mind. [...] "Why, I can see the crow's-feet under Rougemont's eyes, and the paint on her cheeks is laid on as thick as Clown's in a pantomime! The way in which that Calverley talks slang, is quite disgusting. I hate chaff in a woman. And old <b>Colchicum!</b> that old Col, coming down here in his brougham, with his coronet on it, and sitting bodkin between Mademoiselle Coralie and her mother! It's too bad. An English peer, and a horse-rider of Franconi's!--It won't do; by Jove, it won't do. I ain't proud; but it will not do!" ...|$|E
60|$|But Pen, on his part, {{had no such}} scruples. Miss Fanny Bolton did {{not make}} his bed nor sweep his chambers; {{and he did not}} choose to let go his pretty little partner. As for Fanny, her colour heightened, and her bright eyes shone the {{brighter}} with pleasure, as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as Mr. Pen. And she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place, and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there; and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and grander-looking than any other gent in the place. Of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks there--rakish young surgeons, fast young clerks and commercialists, occasional dandies of the Guard regiments, and the rest. Old Lord <b>Colchicum</b> was there in attendance upon Mademoiselle Caracoline, who had been riding in the ring; and who talked her native French very loud, and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about, leaning on the arm of his lordship.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Colchicum,</b> Blondel, and {{the senior}} bucks had just been conversing about the Clavering family, whose {{appearance}} in London had formed the subject of Major Pendennis's morning conversation with his valet. Mr. Blondel's house was next to that of Sir Francis Clavering, in Grosvenor Place: giving very good dinners himself, he had remarked some activity in his neighbour's kitchen. Sir Francis, indeed, had a new chef, who had come in more than once and dressed Mr. Blondel's dinner for him; that gentleman having only a remarkably expert female artist permanently engaged in his establishment, and employing such chiefs of note as happened to be free {{on the occasion of}} his grand banquets. [...] "They go to a devilish expense and see devilish bad company as yet, I hear," [...] Mr. Blondel said, [...] "they scour the streets, by gad, to get people to dine with 'em. Champignon says it breaks his heart to serve up a dinner to their society. What a shame it is that those low people should have money at all," [...] cried Mr. Blondel, whose grandfather had been a reputable leather-breeches maker, and whose father had lent money to the Princes.|$|E
6000|$|Any {{thing like}} a {{scientific}} {{use of the}} method of experiment, in these complicated cases, is therefore out of the question. We can generally, {{even in the most}} favorable cases, only discover by a succession of trials, that a certain cause is very often followed by a certain effect. For, in one of these conjunct effects, the portion which is determined by any one of the influencing agents, is usually, as we before remarked, but small; and it must be a more potent cause than most, if even the tendency which it really exerts is not thwarted by other tendencies in nearly as many cases as it is fulfilled. Some causes indeed there are which are more potent than any counteracting causes to which they are commonly exposed; and accordingly there are some truths in medicine which are sufficiently proved by direct experiment. Of these the most familiar are those that relate to the efficacy of the substances known as Specifics for particular diseases, “quinine, <b>colchicum,</b> lime-juice, cod-liver oil,”(151) and a few others. Even these are not invariably followed by success; but they succeed in so large a proportion of cases, and against such powerful obstacles, that their tendency to restore health in the disorders for which they are prescribed may be regarded as an experimental truth.(152) ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{lights and}} the music, the crowd and the gaiety, charmed and exhilarated Pen, as those sights will do young fellows from college and the country, to whom they are tolerably new. He laughed at the jokes; he applauded the songs, {{to the delight of}} some of the dreary old habitues of the boxes, who had ceased long ago to find the least {{excitement}} in their place of nightly resort, and were pleased to see any one so fresh, and so much amused. At {{the end of the first}} piece, he went and strutted about the lobbies of the theatre, as if he was in a resort of the highest fashion. What tired frequenter of the London pave is there that cannot remember having had similar early delusions, and would not call them back again? Here was young Foker again, like an ardent votary of pleasure as he was. He was walking with Grandy Tiptoff, of the Household Brigade, Lord Tiptoff's brother, and Lord <b>Colchicum,</b> Captain Tiptoff's uncle, a venerable peer, who had been a man of pleasure since the first French Revolution. Foker rushed upon Pen with eagerness, and insisted that the latter should come into his private box, where a lady with the longest ringlets and the fairest shoulders, was seated. This was Miss Blenkinsop, the eminent actress of high comedy; and in the back of the box snoozing in a wig, sate old Blenkinsop, her papa. He was described in the theatrical prints as the [...] "veteran Blenkinsop"--"the useful Blenkinsop"--"that old favourite of the public, Blenkinsop"--those parts in the drama, which are called the heavy fathers, were usually assigned to this veteran, who, indeed, acted the heavy father in public, as in private life.|$|E
6000|$|In the meantime, Sir Thomas {{himself was}} in a state of great misery. From hour to hour he was {{fluctuating}} between a desire to run away from the accursed borough, and the shame of taking such a step. The desire for the seat which had brought him to Percycross had almost died out amidst the misery of his position. Among all the men of his party with whom he was associating, there was not one whom he did not dislike, and by whom he was not snubbed and contradicted. Griffenbottom, who went through his canvass under circumstances of coming gout and <b>colchicum</b> with a courage and pertinacity that were heroic, was painfully cross to every one who was not a voter. [...] "What's the use of all that d----d nonsense, now?" [...] he said to Sir Thomas the evening before the nomination day. There were half-a-dozen leading Conservatives in the room, and Sir Thomas was making a final protest against bribery. He rose from his chair when so addressed, and left the room. Never in his life before had he been so insulted. Trigger followed him to his bedroom, knowing well that a quarrel at this moment would be absolutely suicidal. [...] "It's the gout, Sir Thomas," [...] said Mr. Trigger. [...] "Do remember what he's going through." [...] This was so true that Sir Thomas returned to the room. It was almost impossible not to forgive anything in a man who was suffering agonies, but could still wheedle a voter. There were three conservative doctors with Mr. Griffenbottom, each of them twice daily; and there was an opinion prevalent through the borough that the gout would be in his stomach before the election was over. Sir Thomas did return to the room, and sat himself down without saying a word. [...] "Sir Thomas," [...] said Mr. Griffenbottom, [...] "a man with the gout is always allowed a little liberty." ...|$|E
