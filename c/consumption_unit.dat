Thus, our goal in this work was to use a new finer spatial scale to find out whether or not observed spatial variations might mask intramunicipality spatial variations. METHODS: The use of a Bayesian smoothing approach allowed us to overcome problems related to the very small inframunicipality scale and {{to take into account the}} spatial autocorrelation existing between neighbouring units. The relative risks were adjusted on different socioeconomic variables like the median income per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit.</b> RESULTS: After smoothing, areas with statistically significant 30 to 40 % excess of cases and lack of cases were identified within the urban area of Grenoble. Median income per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit</b> appeared to be the most discriminating variable for characterizing the studied population. CONCLUSION: The inframunicipality scale enables the study of a health problem as the lung cancer within a context of strong demographic disparities...|$|E
40|$|This paper aimes {{to provide}} a multidimensional view {{on the topic of}} the {{sustainability}} of the social system in the long run. Psychology together with sociology indicate that the impact of genetic factors on the forming of an individual into a well-ordered member of society with a normal values is much smaller than the impact of the family and its social capital. Social system aspirates to motivate the needed ones to become financially independent again, but this simply does not work. On the other hand in the attempt to increase the household income especially the socially excluded households chose to change their characteristics {{in order to get the}} social benefits rather than to enter labour market. One of the most important and relatively easily changable characteristics in this context is the number of unprovided children in the family. Therefore to get a bigger amount of social benefits they have children. To proove the rationality of such behaviour the concept of the <b>consumption</b> <b>unit</b> is used. This concept quantifies the economies of scale in the common household. The result is that while in the typical family the income per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit</b> steadily decreases with the increasing number of children, in the family without any earnings this income approximatly doubles. The financial situation of the poor family improves with the number of children. This has an adverse effect on the society structure in the long run, because it encourages higher birth rate of the groups that do not contribute to the system. It is possible to lower the birth rate in the unfavourable families and increase it in the typical families by changing the rules of computing the benefits. It is necessary to keep the income per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit</b> independent from the number of children. This can be achieved for example by a tax abatement. It is also advisable to connect the social and retirement system in the manner that the amount of the retirement pension would be affected by the amount of money contributed to the system by the children of the retiree...|$|E

The data tonsist of five household budget surveys from the period 1971 - 1990 collected by Statistics Finland. The age- and cohort profiles of the variables are estimated using a nonparametric technique, relying purely on information from the data. The relevant decision making and <b>consumption</b> <b>unit</b> in the report is chosen to be the household, so no attempt is made to associate the different components of income, consumption and transfers with particular members of the household. The examinations are done both by household and by <b>consumption</b> <b>unit.</b> The number of consumption units in the household is determined as recommended by OECD. The age and cohort profiles are an interesting way of summarising data information and they can be also used as a first step in certain types of studies conceming welfare. The estimated age profiles of consumption are concave, as expected. Similar is the shape of age profiles of direct taxes and consumption. Disposable income is more evenly distributed than factor income, so direct taxes and income transfers equalise income among households of different age. Pensioner families are the most important recipients of income transfers, while households with children benefit most from public services. The results point out also to the fact, that the monetary value of benefits received by young families from society have in late eighties exceeded the amount of direct taxes paid by those families. age profile, consumption and income distribution, public transfers, nonparametric estimation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor each {{quartile}} {{of income}} per household or per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit,</b> annual time-series have been estimated from panel surveys, with annual waves of observations from 1974 to 2007 : INSEE 2 Households' "Conjoncture" survey from 1974 to 1994; panel "Parc-Auto" 3 Sofres 4 since mid- 80 's. In these data sources, household behaviour is described through; car ownership (percentage of households {{with at least}} one car, of which percentage of multi-car households, average number of cars per adult over 18, which is the minimum age for driving license in France); car use (annual mileage per household or per car). The repeated sample structure of data has been used for improving the accuracy of time-series of variables highly correlated for subsequent years [Cochran, 1977]. In mid- 70 's, car ownership and use were quite low for the poorest income quartile, but the difference has much decreased with all the three higher income groups, which are more homogeneous. Thus, multi-car ownership, which is mainly structured by geographic and demographic determinants, has slowed down -but not reversed- the social diffusion of automobile. As the curves representing car ownership (number of cars per adult) and car use (annual mileage per household) seem to become quite horizontal during the most recent period, logistic curves have been estimated according to time, then to real income. For each quartile of the distribution of households by income per <b>consumption</b> <b>unit,</b> saturation thresholds are estimated, as well as the date or the point of inflection. Follows a discussion on the legitimacy of pooling the data. The relationship between temporal elasticities (for each quartile) and cross-sectional income elasticities, which can be considered as a measurement of inequality at each point in time, will be discussed [Gardes and Madre, 2005]...|$|E

In our two-part model, the overall price elasticity is -Â  0. 82. Nevertheless, tobacco demand is influenced by both price and quality. We net out the quality effect of tobacco demand to obtain standard price elasticities, which are between -Â  0. 70 and -Â  0. 35. In addition, when we estimate two demand systems of Chinese households, the estimated own-price elasticities of cigarettes are -Â  0. 57 and -Â  0. 81.

40|$|This note {{discusses}} {{the implication of}} reverse capital deepening for neoclassical theory, placing special emphasis {{on the role of}} the numeraire.

The supply of capital is given in terms of the <b>consumption</b> <b>unit.</b> Reverse capital deepening is reflected in upward sloping segments of the corresponding demand function. A change in numeraire, while generally affecting the shape of the demand function, does not affect the stability property of equilibrium, because it will also affect the shape of the supply function. Hence, what matters is not whether the demand function is upward sloping or not, but whether it cuts the supply function from above or from below. This property, however, is preserved with a change in the numeraire. ...|$|E
