"It is {{doubtful}} whether {{the replacement of}} German agriculture on a sound basis {{in the last ten}} years is to be ascribed in a greater measure to technical advance in agricultural methods, or to the development of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>system.</b> Perhaps it would be right to say that for the large farms it is due to the first, and for the smaller farms (three quarters of the arable land in Germany) to the second. For it is only through co-operation that the advantages of farming on a large scale are made possible for smaller farmers. The more important of those advantages are the regulated purchase of all raw materials and half-finished products (artificial manures, feeding stuffs, seeds, etc.), better prices for products, facilities for making use, in moderation, of personal credit at a cheap rate of interest, together with the possibility of saving and putting aside small sums of interest; all these advantages of the large farmer have been placed within the reach of the small farmers by local co-operative societies for buying, selling, and farming co-operatively, as well as by saving and other banks, all connected to central associations and central co-operative societies.|$|E

However, the recent {{increase in the number}} of vehicles has resulted in many adverse consequences in terms of safety, efficiency and the environment. Traffic emissions are known to be the main source of air pollution in urban areas. Today while demand for environmental aspects has increased and is expected to increase even further, a new development has occurred in the applications of <b>co-operative</b> vehicle-infrastructure <b>systems.</b> Using <b>co-operative</b> <b>systems,</b> vehicles and road infrastructures can communicate with each other through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V 2 I or I 2 V) communication. Therefore, <b>co-operative</b> <b>systems</b> can be used to improve road safety, efficiency and air quality. This thesis gives more insight into the impacts of <b>co-operative</b> vehicle-infrastructure <b>systems</b> on the environment. To assess these impacts first, a modeling framework of traffic, emission and dispersion model was developed. Second, an indicator for local air quality was developed to support decision making on short-term local traffic measures. Third, an algorithm was developed using I 2 V communication to influence the traffic flow in real-time and help reducing traffic emissions. Finally, the developed algorithm was tested using the modeling framework. The results show that traffic emissions can be reduced for both actuated and adaptive controller using I 2 V communication...|$|R

Within the European project COOPERS, that is a 48 -month integrated project co-funded by the European Commission, a simulator tests of I 2 V communication systems have been performed with 51 participants to evaluate driver behavior and user acceptance. I 2 V communication systems influence the driver behavior in a positive manner. Drivers keep calmer in stress situations and the direct influence on road safety can be seen in reduced driving speeds previous to dangerous situations. So a positive support of the driver during dangerous situations could be achieved. User acceptance results show that the already high expectations of End Users towards <b>Co-operative</b> <b>systems</b> were outperformed.

However, {{it is not yet}} clear which concepts of <b>co-operative</b> <b>systems</b> would be viable from an implementation point of view. Therefore, the objective of the research presented in this paper was to gain knowledge into the expectations about <b>co-operative</b> road-vehicle <b>systems</b> and the driving forces and barriers of stakeholders. To obtain this information, semi-structured interviews were held with six experts and seventeen stakeholders. The qualitative interview data was structured in a database that was used to perform the analysis. Of all the concepts of <b>co-operative</b> road-vehicle <b>systems</b> mentioned by the interview participants, five were recognised as potentially viable: Navigation systems, Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA), Traffic responsive Adaptive Cruise Control, Intersection support and Information systems. A deployment path for these systems was constructed based on the two main routes for deployment recognised that focused on Telematics and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems respectively. Two viable concepts were identified at the point where positive expectations about cooperative road-vehicle systems and the driving forces of stakeholders coincided. Obligatory half-open ISA relieves barriers such as market penetration and profitability and is expected to have positive effects on efficiency and safety.
