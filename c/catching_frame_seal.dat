A strong opening period from the hometown Colts allowed for a 3-0 lead that was never breached by the Crushers.

25|$|The 1985 World Snooker Championship final, {{commonly}} known as the black ball final, was a snooker match played on the weekend of 27/28 April 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was contested between defending World Champion Steve Davis and Northern Irishman Dennis Taylor, appearing in his second final. Taylor produced a determined comeback to win the match on the final ball of the final <b>frame,</b> <b>sealing</b> his only world title.

The glasses are suitable for sealing stacks with CrFe 5 and ferritic steel interconnectors. In the crystallized glasses different crystal phases are present, which determine substantially the properties particular the thermal expansion coefficient. By tape casting green foils were manufactured from these glasses. From green foil pieces the sealing parts were punched out.

Each frame has a thickness selected to accommodate various tolerances of the fuel cell elements and are either bonded {{to one of the}} other frames or to a bipolar or end plate. One of the non-compliant frames is wider than the other frames forming an overlap of the matrix over the wider <b>seal</b> <b>frame,</b> which cooperates with electrolyte permeating the matrix to form a wet seal within the fuel cell that prevents process gases from intermixing at the periphery of the fuel cell and a dry seal surrounding the cell to keep electrolyte from the periphery thereof. The frames may be made in one piece, in L-shaped portions or in strips and have an outer perimeter which registers with the outer perimeter of bipolar or end plates to form surfaces upon which flanges of pan shaped, gas manifolds can be sealed...|$|R

The trees belonged to the cultivars ‘Cellina di Nardò’ and ‘Ogliarola Salentina’. They were 60 - 100 years old and 7 - 9 m tall with a canopy volume of 140 - 360 m 3. In the first half of November 2006, with a mechanical beater mounted on a tractor plus hand-held pneumatic combs, the harvesting yield was close to 90 % of the total olives present in the canopy, and the harvesting working productivity was around 60 kg of harvested olives h- 1 worker- 1. With a self-propelled shaker attached to the main branches the harvesting yield was about 73 % in ‘Cellina di Nardò’, and 40 % in ‘Ogliarola Salentina’, while the harvesting working productivities were around 103 and 85 kg of harvested olives h- 1 worker- 1, respectively. In the second half of No-vember 2009, in ‘Cellina di Nardò’, with a mechanical beater mounted on a tractor plus nets on the ground or a <b>catching</b> <b>frame</b> (reversed umbrella) mounted on another tractor, the harvesting yield was about 97 %.

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has {{invested}} considerable {{effort to develop}} new standard for nuclear grade HEPA filters that can withstand high temperatures along with methods to optimally test not only the experimental filter media, but also new <b>frame</b> <b>seals</b> and media binders. Therefore, LLNL in collaboration with Cal Poly has designed and built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) to recreate conditions observed during a fire and to test different materials in an effective, inexpensive, regulated and reliable method. The existing prototype was unable to achieve the ideal testing conditions of 1000 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM; therefore, this project looks to optimize previous efforts on building a portable and reliable MHTTU to collect more information and perform different tests in various materials utilized {{in the construction of}} ceramic HEPA filters. Based on previous teams’ inputs, our team performed a heat transfer analysis to determine critical heat loss points and to optimize the design of the MHTTU. After several idea generation sessions, it was decided to modified the geometry of the testing chamber and the insulation of the system. The MHTTU also lacks a robust control system and a user interface; therefore, a more reliable interface and more versatility during the tests were implemented in the system. With the current design, we were able to improve the maximum temperature of the system to 837 °F; however, {{we were not able to}} fulfill heat up time of 15 minutes. After carefully recording the temperature of the surrounding material during testing, we believe that the immersion heater is not powerful enough to have an effective heat transfer to air. After testing was completed, it was confirmed that the heater coils cannot reach 1000 °F in less than 15 minutes of heat up. Therefore, a more powerful heater is needed to achieve testing parameters...|$|R

In the current study we have investigated the application of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for assessing the quality of metal thermocompression bonds, both by evaluating its capabilities of localizing areas of poor bonding, and by finding defects in the integrity of the bond seal. Wafer laminates containing a test vehicle of <b>sealing</b> <b>frames</b> with pre-defined defects in the bond metal layer were sealed by Au–Au and Al–Al thermocompression bonding.

The dicing yield for <b>sealing</b> <b>frames</b> was above 96 % for all frames of widths 100 – 400 µm and for both bond metal systems.
