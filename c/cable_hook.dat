A key-sharing scheme operates by redistributing these keys in real-time to multiple receivers in an unlimited number of locations so that one valid smartcard may serve almost 10000 viewers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railways, {{locomotives}} and rolling stock were small enough to be re-railed manually using jacks and tackle, but as they became bigger and heavier this method became inadequate.Enter into this the steam crane and cable winch. Appearing about 1890, the cranes increased in size, commensurate with the rise of steel Pullman cars, so by 1910 steam cranes reached their peak of development. Many of these 1910-era cranes were so useful and powerful, that they remained in service until the 1980s. The combination of a quick-firing steam boiler, heavy steam winch, and <b>cable</b> <b>hook</b> could little be improved upon, and thus remained in service. Also, steam engines did not mind being parked for months, with a little care, and were ready to go to work when needed.|$|E

40|$|This {{probabilistic}} {{analysis of}} WIPP TRUDOCK crane failure {{is based on}} two sources of failure data. The source for operator errors is the report by Swain and Guttman, NUREG/CR- 1278 -F, August 1983. The source for crane <b>cable</b> <b>hook</b> breaks was initially made by WIPP/WID- 96 - 2196, Rev. O by using relatively old (1970 s) U. S. Navy data (NUREG- 0612). However, a helpful analysis by R. K. Deremer of PLG guided the authors to values that were more realistic and more conservative, with the recommendation that the crane cable/hook failure rate should be 2. 5 x 10 - 6 per demand. This value was adopted and used. Based on these choices a mean failure rate of 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr) was calculated. However, a mean rate by itself does not reveal the level of confidence {{to be associated with}} this number. Guidance to making confidence calculations came from the report by Swain and Guttman, who stated that failure data could be described by lognormal distributions. This is in agreement with the widely use d reports (by DOE and others) NPRD- 95 and NPRD- 91, on failure data. The calculations of confidence levels showed that the mean failure rate of 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr) corresponded to a percentile value of approximately 71; i. e. there is a 71 % likelihood that the failure rate is less than 9. 70 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr). One also calculated that there is a 95 % likelihood that the failure rate is less than 29. 6 x 10 - 3 (1 /yr). Or, as stated previously, there is a 71 % likelihood that not more than one dropped load will occur in 103 years. Also, there is a 95 % likelihood that not more than one dropped load will occur in approximately 34 years. It is the responsibility of DOE to select the confidence level at which it desires to operate...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of autonomous operation of ship-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in extreme sea conditions would greatly extend {{the usefulness of}} these aircraft for both military and civilian maritime purposes. Maritime operations are often associated with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) procedures, even though the advantages of conventional fixed-wing aircraft over VTOL aircraft in terms of flight speed, range and endurance are well known. In this work, current methods of shipboard recovery are analysed and {{the problems associated with}} recovery in adverse weather conditions are identified. Based on this analysis, a novel recovery method is proposed. This method, named <b>Cable</b> <b>Hook</b> Recovery, is intended to recover small to medium-size fixed-wing UAVs on frigate-size vessels. It is expected to have greater operational capabilities than the Recovery Net technique, which is currently the most widely employed method of recovery for similar class of UAVs, potentially providing safe recovery even in very rough sea and allowing the choice of approach directions. The recovery method is supported by the development of a UAV controller that realises the most demanding stage of recovery, the final approach. The controller provides both flight control and guidance strategy that allow fully autonomous recovery of a fixed-wing UAV. The development process involves extensive use of specially tailored Evolutionary Algorithms and represents the major contribution of this work. The Evolutionary Design algorithm developed in this work combines the power of Evolutionary Strategies and Genetic Programming, enabling automatic evolution of both the structure and parameters of the controller. The controller is evolved using a fully coupled nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom UAV model, making linearisation and trimming of the model unnecessary. The developed algorithm is applied to both flight control and guidance problems with several variations, from optimisation of a routine PID controller to automatic control laws synthesis where no a priori data available. It is demonstrated that Evolutionary Design is capable of not only optimising, but also solving automatically the real-world problems, producing human-competitive solutions. The designed UAV controller has been tested comprehensively for both performance and robustness in a nonlinear simulation environment and has been found to allow the aircraft to be recovered in the presence of both large external disturbances and uncertainty in the simulation models...|$|E

50|$|Investigators {{with the}} Civil Aeronautics Board {{determined}} that the cable physically connecting the first officer's control wheel to the aileron boost unit had disconnected. This had caused the ailerons to put the aircraft in a starboard-wing-down attitude, and had prevented the pilots {{from being able to}} correct the bank. The cables attaching the pilots' control wheels to the aileron boost unit had been removed two months before the accident during routine maintenance; a safety cable that held part of the assembly together had not been replaced when the <b>cables</b> were <b>hooked</b> back up.

2500|$|On May 1, 1988, The Movie Channel debuted its [...] "eye and profile" [...] logo, which {{utilized}} various designs incorporating facial expressions, {{with the}} channel's name rendered in Helvetica Extended on tilted black bars {{at the top}} and bottom of the logo; some viewers have commented on online blogs and video websites such as YouTube that this logo, due to the eyes being prominently displayed, had frightened them as young children (this logo was replicated somewhat when WGN America used a logo featuring a set of female eyes rimmed with green mascara from 2008 to 2009). The channel ran different and unique feature presentation opens and network IDs during the nine-year period it was in use (among which included intros in which the logo changed facial expressions at the draw of a curtain, set to a bouncy keyboard tune; a grayscale version of the logo – which then winked – rotating to face the screen in front of a gray background accompanied by a steady drumbeat; and a live-action/partially computer-animated sequence set to Indiana Jones-style adventure music in which the logo shoots lasers from its eyes to escape from the newspaper it is printed on – which is set afire as kindling in a fireplace – and embarks on a calamity-filled journey through a family's living room, seen from its point of view, as it heads toward the safety of a TV set it rappels into on a <b>cable</b> <b>hooked</b> up to a wall outlet above the fireplace's mantle).|$|R
2500|$|Power {{is always}} {{required}} {{to establish an}} outgoing wormhole, and is usually supplied by the DHD, but any Stargate can receive a wormhole whether it has a power supply or not; either gate may supply the power once a wormhole has been established. In a few cases, Stargates have been dialed [...] "manually" [...] when more sophisticated means were not available. This was accomplished by providing sufficient raw power to the gate and then rotating the symbol ring by hand to encode each chevron. Power can be fed directly into the Naquadah that composes the gate; power harnessed from lightning strikes {{has been shown to}} be sufficient, as has the energy from the core of a naquadah bomb., however the minimum requirement for a stable wormhole appears to be a 12 or 24 volt current (depending on wiring) as shown in the episode [...] "1969" [...] where the team powers the gate using jumper <b>cables</b> <b>hooked</b> up to two military transport trucks. The Stargate that establishes an outgoing wormhole determines how long the wormhole is held open, and can generally close the wormhole at will. Under some conditions, a gate only needs enough power to connect briefly, then the receiving gate can provide enough power to maintain the connection. The same is true if the outgoing gate loses power while transmitting; if the incoming gate has a DHD, it will take over powering the gate until reintegration is complete. The System Lord Anubis possessed an Ancient weapon that would channel energy into a receiving Stargate through an open dialed gate; prolonged use of this weapon would cause the gate's Naquadah to continue to absorb the energy until a significant explosion would take place.|$|R

50|$|The {{pilot line}} {{circuitry}} examples in SAE J1772:2001 {{show that the}} current loop CP-PE is connected permanently via a 2.74 kΩ resistor making for a voltage drop to from +12 V to +9 V when a <b>cable</b> is <b>hooked</b> up to the charging station which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the car by adding parallel 1.3 kΩ resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6 V or by adding a parallel 270 Ω resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3 V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP-PE loop. Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP-PE loop will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins).|$|R

500|$|In general, USB cables {{have only}} plugs on their ends, while hosts and devices have only receptacles.

50|$|Overrun gear {{consisting}} of <b>hook</b> <b>cables</b> and/or elastic nets known as barriers {{are commonly used}} as a backup system. Barrier nets catch the wings and fuselage of an aircraft and use an arresting engine or other methods such as anchor chains or bundles of woven textile material to slow the aircraft down. On some land-based airfields where the overrun area is short, a series of concrete blocks referred to as an engineered materials arrestor system is used. These materials are used to catch the landing gear of an aircraft and slow it via rolling resistance and friction. Aircraft are stopped by the transfer of energy required to crush the blocks.|$|R

Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.|$|R

Gabe and Ryan, each still wanting to make an impression, soon follow, with Gabe getting his pants caught around his ankles and tripping in. At the end of the episode, Gabe and Ryan are shown to have stayed far long after the other guests have left, dancing to erotic music, with Robert, in his home theater room. After Robert falls asleep, Ryan informs Gabe that they can now leave, only for Gabe to remark [...] "So, leave", before returning to dancing.|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} is a {{compilation}} of recent efforts and findings intended to solicit feedback on the approach, scenarios analyzed, findings, interpretations, conclusions, and implications for practice resulting from {{the efforts of the}} research team. Please forward comments or questions to the authors noted above. These efforts will ultimately be documented and made available to advance research efforts related to this topic and guidance for practice. The primary purpose of longitudinal safety barriers, such as cable barriers, is to contain and/or redirect errant vehicles that depart the roadway, hence keeping them from entering opposing travel lanes or encountering terrain features and roadside objects that may cause severe impacts. In this study, a detailed finite element model of a three-strand cable barrier was developed and validated against a previously conducted full-scale crash test. The full-scale crash test and simulation were setup for an impact of the cable barrier with a 2000 kg pickup truck at an angle of 25 deg and an initial velocity of 100 km/hr. This setup is in accordance with the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 guidelines for Test Level 3 safety performance. This paper provides guidelines for simulating cable barrier guardrail systems. Detailed methods for system simulation involving dynamic interactions of soil/post, post/hook bolts, <b>cable</b> / <b>hook</b> bolts and cable/truck are discussed. Results from the simulation and comparisons with the full-scale crash test are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Kandahar design offered two {{advantages}} over the earlier designs. The {{use of a}} spring to provide tension allowed fine control over the mechanics, and a smooth action that did not suddenly increase tension {{at the end of}} the stroke. It also allowed the skier to adjust the tension by moving the spring or turning a control knob, allowing for different conditions and skiing style and stride. More important was the addition of two small hooks on either side of the ski near the heel. When skiing downhill, the skier could clip the <b>cable</b> under the <b>hooks,</b> locking down the heel and providing much greater control. Now the ski could be turned by rotating the leg, forcing the ski to stem. When it was time to climb back up the hill, the cable was unhooked and returned to being a normal cross-country binding.|$|R
