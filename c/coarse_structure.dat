Several parameters from the scale evolution of the multiple scale edges detected by a discrete wavelet decomposition of an image are used in a clustering algorithm to classify the edges belonging to various structures.

We propose a novel multigrid-like technique for the analysis of power grids. The grid is reduced to a <b>coarser</b> <b>structure,</b> and the solution is mapped back to the original grid.

40|$|Wir behandeln das von Bowditch eingeführte Konzept eines coarse median. Ein coarse median auf einem metrischen Raum ist eine ternäre Operation auf der zugrunde liegenden Menge, die - in einem gewissen präzisen Sinn - die Axiome einer median algebra bis auf beschränkten Fehler erfüllt. Wir führen den Begriff einer <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> als Äquivalenzklasse von coarse medians bezüglich der Relation „bis auf beschränkten Fehler übereinstimmen“ ein. Wir definieren den Pushforward beziehungsweise den Pullback einer <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> durch eine Quasi-Isometrie. Im Sinne der Pushforward/Pullback Notation stellen wir fest, dass die <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> eines Gromov hyperbolischen geodätischen metrischen Raum stabil unter Quasi-Isometrien ist. Auf spaces with {{measured}} walls, die endliche Hausdorffdistanz zu ihrer medianization haben, beschreiben wir einen coarse median unter Verwendung der Pullback Konstruktion. Dies wird auf den reell hyperbolischen Raum sowie auf klassische small cancellation Gruppen angewandt. Wir verallgemeinern das fundamentale Resultat über approximierende Bäume in Gromov hyperbolischen geodätischen Räumen und erhalten einen Satz über „approximierende CAT(0) kubische Komplexe“ in Räumen mit einem coarse median. Wir erweitern Bowditch' Definition von coarse median groups von der Klasse der endlich erzeugten diskreten Gruppen in die Klasse der kompakt erzeugten lokal-kompakten Gruppen. Wir beweisen, dass kompakt erzeugte lokal-kompakte coarse median Gruppen kompakt präsentiert sind. Wir vergleichen bekannte Stabilitätsresultate, die die Klassen der endlich erzeugten coarse median groups, a-T-menable Gruppen, und Gruppen mit Kazhdans Eigenschaft (T) betreffen. Zusätzlich präsentieren wir die auf Ballmann-Swiatkowski zurückgehende Konstruktion von endlich erzeugten hyperbolischen Gruppen mit Kazhdans Eigenschaft (T). Wir zeigen, dass es viele Beispiele von nicht hyperbolischen Gruppen mit Kazhdans Eigenschaft (T) gibt, die einen links-äquivarianten coarse median besitzen. We study Bowditch' {{concept of}} a coarse median on many examples of metric spaces and groups. A coarse median on a metric space is a ternary operation on the underlying set which satisfies the axioms of a median algebra up to bounded error (in a certain precise sense). We introduce the {{concept of a}} <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> as an equivalence class of coarse medians up to uniformly bounded error. We define the pushforward and the pullback of a <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> via a quasi-isometry. In terms of the pushforward/pullback notation, we note that the <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> on a Gromov hyperbolic geodesic metric space is stable under quasi-isometries. Using the pullback construction, we describe a <b>coarse</b> median <b>structure</b> on spaces with measured walls which are at finite Hausdorff distance to their associated median spaces. We apply this to the measured wall structure on the real hyperbolic space and to the discrete wall structures obtained from Wise's cubulation of classical small cancellation groups. We prove the existence of “approximating CAT(0) cubical complexes” in coarse median spaces and thereby generalize the fundamental result on approximating trees in Gromov hyperbolic geodesic spaces. We extend Bowditch' theory of coarse median groups from finitely generated discrete groups to compactly generated locally compact groups. We show that a compactly generated locally compact coarse median group is compactly presented. Among finitely generated groups, we compare known permanence results concerning the classes of coarse median groups, a-T-menable groups, and groups with Kazhdan's property (T). We present the explicit construction due to Ballmann-Swiatkowski of finitely generated hyperbolic groups with Kazhdan's property (T). We show that there exist many examples of non-hyperbolic groups with Kazhdan's property (T) which admit a left-equivariant coarse median...|$|R
