25|$|Of a {{different}} kind is the approach made by James Lovelock. In the 1970s he and microbiologist Lynn Margulis presented the Gaia theory or hypothesis, that states that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system. The system {{has the ability to}} react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature (homeostasis). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth {{may not be able to}} react to large deviations in <b>critical</b> <b>parameters.</b> In his book The Revenge of Gaia, he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of greenhouse gases made by humans, is producing global warming.|$|E

2500|$|William Joseph Hammer, a {{consulting}} electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked {{primarily on the}} incandescent electric lamp and {{was put in charge}} of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was [...] "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting". Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.|$|E

40|$|The {{reproduction}} {{speed of}} a continuous-time branching random walk is proportional to a positive parameter λ. There is a threshold for λ, which is called λ_w, that separates almost sure global extinction from global survival. Analogously, there exists another threshold λ_s below which any site is visited almost surely {{a finite number of}} times (i. e. local extinction) while above it there is a positive probability of visiting every site infinitely many times. The local <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> λ_s is completely understood and can be computed {{as a function of the}} reproduction rates. On the other hand, only for some classes of branching random walks it is known that the global <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> λ_w is the inverse of a certain function of the reproduction rates, which we denote by K_w. We provide here new sufficient conditions which guarantee that the global <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> equals 1 /K_w. This result extends previously known results for branching random walks on multigraphs and general branching random walks. We show that these sufficient conditions are satisfied by periodic tree-like branching random walks. We also discuss the <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> and the <b>critical</b> behaviour of continuous-time branching processes in varying environment.
