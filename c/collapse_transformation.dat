Besides, we propose a modification of Multiple Choice technique (MC) [10] that {{is used as a}} decimation framework instead of greedy design technique (GD) for iterative simplification of triangle meshes. We compare various triangle mesh decimation algorithms, that use the stated error metrics to compute the geometric fidelity every time a half-edge <b>collapse</b> <b>transformation</b> is applied and employ GD approach, MC technique and its modification as decimation frameworks, with the state-of-the-art decimation algorithms.

These meshes are normally the important basic features of the model. If the simplification process continues, these features will either lost or to be modified critically. In this paper, we have proposed two new methods to preserve these features while the simplification process proceeds down to lower level of detail meshes. These methods are simple to implement and the measures reflect the importance of the triangular meshes. They base the criteria on the dihedral angle, triangle centre and edge distance measures to determine the ordering of the candidate edges to be simplified. We use Half-edge <b>Collapse</b> <b>Transformation</b> Method to generate the new meshes. At the end of this paper, we compare numerically the quality and the computation efficiency of these methods with the existing method proposed by the other researchers...|$|E

40|$|In {{automatic}} decimation of polygonal models, {{the measure}} of geometric fidelity plays the key role. Among the existing measures, volume based error measure results in better quality approximations whereas the one based on normal field variation better preserves salient features. We exploit both volume and normal field to develop a more reliable and efficient two phase greedy algorithm. In the first phase, vertices are ordered; the priority of each vertex is defined using the normal field variation across its one-ring neighborhood. In the second phase, desired number of vertices is removed according to their priorities by applying half-edge <b>collapse</b> <b>transformations.</b> Once a vertex {{is a candidate for}} removal, it is eliminated by collapsing an outgoing half-edge that is selected by using {{the measure of}} geometric fidelity based on volume loss. Subjective and objective comparisons validate that the proposed algorithm not only has better speed-quality trade-off but also consumes less memory space and keeps visually important features even after drastic simplification in a better way than the similar state-of-the-art best algorithms. This method is useful for applications where computing coordinates and/or attributes other than those attached to the original vertices is not allowed by the application and the focus is on both speed and quality of LODs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel selective refinement scheme of progressive meshes. In previous schemes, topology {{information in the}} neighborhood of a collapsed edge is stored in the analysis phase. A vertex split or edge <b>collapse</b> <b>transformation</b> is possible in the synthesis phase only if the configuration of neighborhood vertices in the current mesh corresponds to the stored topology information. In contrast, the proposed scheme makes it possible to apply a vertex split or an edge collapse to any selected vertex or edge in the current mesh without a precondition. Our main observation is that the concept of a dual piece can be used to clearly enumerate and visualize the set of all possible selectively refined meshes for a given mesh. Our refinement scheme is truly selective in the sense that each vertex split or edge collapse can be performed without incurring additional vertex split and/or edge collapse transformations...|$|E

40|$|This paper revisits {{the widely}} known and used concept of soft budget {{constraints}} in party-states introduced by Kornai (1980), {{from the point}} of view of a comparative analytical model (Csan 1 di, 2003). It embeds budget constraints in the structure of power relations described by the model as the interactive structure of interrelations between party-, state- and economic decision-makers on the level of individual actors. In this respect, we argue, that soft budget constraints will acquire several new structure-specific traits presented in the paper that are worth to consider. The new properties of budget constraints nested in power relations will define the selectively soft and hard constraints of self-reproduction of the net. The distribution of power will define the dynamics of reproduction of the structure as a whole. The differences in the distribution of power will be responsible for the frequency of its hardening reproduction constraints. Soft and hard reproduction constraints and its dynamics in different power distributions will contribute to several theoretical conclusions concerning the selfsimilarities and structural differences in the operation and different paths of disintegration, <b>collapse</b> and <b>transformations</b> of party-states...|$|R

40|$|Spain is {{the fifth}} country {{generating}} construction and demolition waste (CDW) and unfortunately, is one which does the least to recuperate them, {{as stated in the}} Symonds & Ass report. This report indicates that 95 % of the 13 million tons of waste materials yearly generated end up in the dump. In our country the rnanagement of CDW belongs to the Autonomous Regions {{with the exception of the}} waste originated from minor house works. Trying to solve this problem the Autonomous Regions are defining their rnanagement plans according to the hierarchy principle, stated in the title 1. 1 of the Law 10 / 1998 referring to waste products. his principle establishes as a top priority the prevention ?whenever possible [...] the reutilization and recycling through a thorough selection on site, in order to fu 1 iher treatment, both of the mixed recycled materials as well as the ones used in treatment plants and to clearly assess all that cannot be reused o recycled. The final deposit in the dump is the last option, and the least satisfactory one. A main aspect to be considered when dealing with construction-demolition waste recuperation and recycling is that econornic and environrnental interests are al so part of this issue. The challenge for the future is, to make the human economic development compatible with the environment preservation supporting it; that is sustainable growth. Therefore, regarding this, all the recuperating and recycling activities are of great importance. The demolition waste has a well known reuse potential. This reuse has, nevertheless, certain limitations due to the characteristics of the waste itself. The construction waste (debris) that can be reused is mainly produced during the phases of demolition, <b>collapse,</b> <b>transformation</b> or building enlargement, as well as in those civil works such as roads, airports, driveways or other traffic surfaces. Due to its heterogeneity, the waste derived from construction presents more difficulty, because the compound construction materials make the recuperation more complex. The recycled aggregate can be applied for many different uses, but the main recycling plants in Europe rework them into materials not demanding high quality; normally they are used as fillings, packings or sub-bases for road construction. This is due to the lack of quality control in these fields. In countries where the quality standards are further developed, as in the Netherlands, the recycled material is used for other items with greater specific value, as in the manufacturing of concretes and mortars. In Spain, recycling of CDW is not common yet due, mainly, to an absence of politic aims and the lack of legislation and appropriate control, with the exception of sorne precise movable grinding or recycling plants. Of all the CDW generated in Spain, approximately a 60 % is made up of masonry and about a 20 % corresponds to concrete debris. Presently there are six aggregate recycling plants in Spain: three in Barcelona, two in the Basque Country and one in Madrid.

40|$|The {{collapse}} {{and end of}} Roman Britain remains a topic of interest and debate, related to conceptual issues found in the disciplines ofboth archaeology and history. The collapse of Hadrian's Wall and the frontier ofnorthern England as a region also {{have yet to be}} adequately explained. Excavations on Hadrian's Wall over the past 25 years have revealed excellent evidence for late Roman military occupation as well as sub-Roman occupation at a number of sites (e. g. South Shields, Newcastle, Vindolanda, Birdoswald, and Carlisle). While each site has been considered individually, there has been limited comprehensive treatment. When all ofthese sites have been examined together, scholars have presented models oflimited use, due to their reliance on historical frameworks. A review ofthe organization ofthe late Roman military and the concept of frontiers suggests that a theoretically based perspective would generate more useful models for understanding the decline and collapse ofRoman frontiers. Community studies, with particular emphasis on military communities, are applied to the limitanei and late Roman frontier archaeology. A synthetic evaluation ofoccupation and activity along Hadrian's Wall from the 4 th to 5 th centuries AD was undertaken to consider the problem oflate Roman frontier <b>collapse</b> and <b>transformation.</b> Detailed case studies ofthree sectors ofHadrian's Wall indicated that there were more than 10 traits typical oflate Roman military sites. Extending detailed examination. to all the forts on the Wall and a number of forts throughout northern England revealed that these traits are found at all forts occupied in the later 4 th century. Considered individually or en masse, these traits indicate the changing nature of military occupation ofnorthern England through the 4 th century. The changing role of Hadrian's Wall through the 4 th century is summarized, and a number ofinterpretations are provided by which to understand the archaeological evidence, followed by recommendations for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mineralogical, textural and {{chemical}} analyses of clay-rich materials following firing, evidence that initial mineralogical differences between two raw materials (one with carbonates {{and the other}} without) influence the textural and mineralogical evolution of the ceramics as T increases from 700 to 1100 °C. Mineralogical and textural changes are interpreted considering local marked disequilibria {{in a system that}} resembles a small-scale high-T metamorphic process (e. g., contact aureoles in pyrometamorphism). In such conditions, rapid heating induces significant overstepping in mineral reaction, preventing stable phase formation and favoring metastable ones. High-T transformations in non-carbonate materials include microcline structure <b>collapse</b> and/or partial <b>transformation</b> into sanidine; and mullite plus sanidine formation at the expenses of muscovite and/or illite at T � 800 °C. Mullite forms by muscovite-out topotactic replacement, following the orientation of mica crystals: i. e., former (001) muscovite are ^ to (001) mullite. This reaction is favored by minimization of free energy during phase transition. Partial melting followed by fingered structure development at the carbonate-silicate reaction interface enhanced high-T Ca (and Mg) silicates formation in carbonate-rich materials. Gehlenite, wollastonite, diopside, and anorthite form at carbonate-silicate interfaces by combined mass transport (viscous flow) and reaction-diffusion processes. These results may add {{to a better understanding of}} the complex high-T transformations of silicate phases in both natural (e. g., pyrometamorphism) and artificial (e. g., ceramic processing) systems. This information is important to elucidate technological achievements and raw material sources of ancient civilizations and, it can also be used to select appropriate clay composition and firing temperatures for new bricks used in cultural heritage conservation interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} trauma is {{precisely}} {{that it is}} too horrible to be remembered, to be integrated into our symbolic universe. All {{we have to do is}} to mark repeatedly the trauma as such. - Slavoj Žižek This thesis re-examines the role of ruins preservation by speculating on the inherent tension between disaster ruins, psychological interventions and collective memorialization. It challenges the misconception of architectural preservation which is against human interaction as well as possibilities for future change. In other words, the historicization of past events should not only be manifested as the physical integrity of artifacts, but rather shape and be shaped by the present and future of a place. The thesis seeks to rethink the act of preservation as a means of integrating memorialization into the everyday experience of the inhabitants. Sited in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in China, the thesis proposes an alternative way to restore and memorialize the aftermath of the Beichuan town. By establishing a live memorial versus a frozen ghost town, the thesis positions the quake aftermath in a direct relationship with the contemporary citizens and thus projects the site towards its future. The thesis traces the frozen ruins in both geographical and ideological terms. It explores preservation through memorialization by embracing future <b>collapse,</b> growth or <b>transformation.</b> After analyzing the existing urban context, the thesis welcomes change as a positive element in the preservation process.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained papers on business cycle fluctuations {{in the context of}} the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework. The first paper examines how maintenance expenditures affect the occurrence of indeterminacy in a two-sector model economy, motivated by the empirical fact that equipment and structures are maintained and repaired. McGrattan and Schmitz's (1999) survey on `Capital and Repair Expenditures' in Canada indicates that maintenance expenditures account for a substantial fraction of output and new investment. It is shown that the endogenous maintenance expenditures reduce the requirement of the degree of increasing returns to scale to generate sunspot equilibria. In fact, the minimum level of the returns to scale required could be as low as 1. 0179. This aspect is important since empirical works such as Basu and Fernald (1997) suggests that returns to scale is close to constant. The second paper addresses the following questions in the context of a neoclassical model of the business cycle: what caused the 1890 s and 1907 recessions in the U. S. ? In particular, we apply the Business Cycle Accounting method to decompose the economic fluctuation into its sources: productivity, the labour wedge, the investment wedge and the government consumption wedge. Our results suggest that the economy downturn is primarily attributed to frictions that reduce productivity and the wedge capturing distortions in labour-leisure decision. The financial market frictions would have accounted for the drop of the efficiency wedge. A contractionary monetary shock could generate a gap between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labour. The third paper applies the accounting method proposed by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007) to identify the primary sources of economic slumps in South Australia from 1990 to 2014. We focus on three major stages: the recession in the early- 1990 s, the Asian Financial Crisis and the 2008 - 2012 South Australian slump. Our results show that the efficiency wedge is the primary transmission channel through which the primitive shocks hit the South Australian economy. Shocks such as structural <b>transformation,</b> <b>collapse</b> of motor vehicle industry might have affected the efficiency wedge. Moreover, it is illustrated that infrastructural expenditures are important in increasing the efficiency wedge. This is conformity with the fact that South Australian government is keen to support its development through the Economic Stimulus Plan. Trade openness might also be a contributor. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Drugi svjetski rat i njegov završetak u Sloveniji je, kao i drugdje u svijetu, bio prijelomni događaj u odnosu na predratno stanje koji je označio početak novoga. Sa završetkom rata počelo se s promjenama. One su bile posljedica posebnosti rata kakav se odvijao na području jugoslavenske države: kao oslobodilački rat i kao revolucija. Posljedice su bile uglavnom političke i teritorijalne. Za Sloveniju je kao rezultat rata bilo značajno granično, tj. teritorijalno pitanje, koje se rješavalo još nekoliko godina nakon rata s različitim uspjehom, i to na temelju činjenice da je Jugoslavija sa svojim oslobodilačkim pokretom bila na strani pobjednika. Političke promjene koje je donio Drugi svjetski rat i njihovo značenje za jugoslavensku državu bile su jednake za cijelu državu, ali su odražavale i mnoge posebnosti karakteristične za Sloveniju i različite od drugih dijelova Jugoslavije. One su proizlazile iz značajki Drugoga svjetskog rata u Sloveniji. Ipak, i te su značajke bile dio jugoslavenskih ratnih prilika i odnosa, iako s nizom razlika i iznimaka karakterističnih za Sloveniju koje su joj dale pečat određene posebnosti i u prvom razdoblju neposredno nakon završetka rata. War {{changes the}} world. The world changes through war. War {{is a cause}} of changes. War is an agent of change. Wars are started due to a desire for change. Wars have {{long-term}} and far-reaching consequences. World War II was a war for changes. The consequences of World War II were the <b>collapse,</b> restoration, and <b>transformation</b> of the Yugoslav state. On one side there was aggression, occupation, and defeat, while on the other there was the struggle for freedom. The victors of the conflict were political and military forces that wanted not only {{the restoration of the}} Yugoslav state, but also its transformation. In order for this to take place, a change of government was needed. In summer 1941, when the war had not yet spread so far that it could truly be called a world war, Churchill and Roosevelt issued the Atlantic Charter, in which they set down the principles upon which the post-war world was to be built. One of the articles of the Charter set the principle that all nations had the right to choose the form of government under which they wanted to live. This heralded the changes to come. A time of changes (and settling scores) followed {{after the end of the}} war. Not only Yugoslavia, but the entire world began to change. Yugoslavia, even though it stood against those changes the aggressors wanted to implement during World War II, nonetheless underwent a period of fundamental change. These changes were the result of a successful political revolution. However, another revolution was undertaken by each nation that lived on the territory of the Yugoslav state, a revolution aimed at achieving its own interests. Without a doubt, this also applies to Slovenia and the Slovenians as a people. In the case of Slovenia, there were two revolutions, one class-based and one national. The Slovenians undertook not only a class-based, i. e. communist revolution as part of the people’s liberation war, but also a national revolution, i. e. a struggle for the national emancipation and state independence of Slovenia. The Slovenian struggle for freedom under the leadership of the Liberation front (Oslobodilački front – OF) can be viewed as a national liberation struggle, as a revolution in the American sense, a so-called American revolution and its related struggle for independence. They achieved national emancipation and statehood. The war and their victory in it brought the Slovenians a country that they had never had before. The appointment of the People’s Government of Slovenia on 5 May 1945 in Ajdovščina was a symbolic expression of Slovenian statehood in the process of assuming political power. While it is true that, as a people’s/popular government, it had a class-based character, it was primarily seen as a national government, as an expression of Slovenian statehood achieved during the war. Regarding its ministers – including a female minister, since the Yugoslav leadership believed every federal unit’s government should include at least one woman – it was a coalition government since the ministers came from the ranks of the basic component groups of the OF founded in 1941. In its programme issued in autumn 1941, the OF promised it would take power over Slovenian territory after the end of the liberation struggle as a unified founding group. In addition, a member of the government was a pre-war politician, Franc Snoj, a minister of the royal government in exile who had returned from London to Slovenia in September 1944 and begun cooperating with the liberation movement. The changes in post-war Slovenia had a “unified” Yugoslav character, but still expressed certain particularities. What they had in common was precisely that which referred to their basic goal and was happening in summer, autumn, and winter 1945. These events were expressed in the strengthening of the power that had been achieved through armed struggle. The taking of power in Slovenia should be understood as an integral series of moves and activities of the new Yugoslav government made in order to build and stabilize the country near the end of the war and in its immediate aftermath. In order to understand the situation and relations at the end of the war in Slovenia, one must first comprehend the situation and relations at the beginning of the war, during the war, and at the war’s end, both on the side of the liberation movement and among those who opposed the resistance movement for political reasons. There was no organised political opposition in post-war Slovenia, especially none whose foundations lay in the pre-war parties. There was no so-called bourgeois opposition in Slovenia. The political activities of Slovenian politicians from both traditional political camps – clerical and liberal – during the war, regarding both the liberation movement and the occupiers, forced them to emigrate towards the end of the war. The lack of opposition parties or individuals with political standing in lovenia doesn’t imply that Slovenia was the “reddest” part of the Yugoslav state or that it was the least critical towards the new regime. Slovenian politics, despite fulfilling the demands of the central government in all matters, had certain particularities in 1945. Some attempts were made to oppose centralism. To the leadership of the Yugoslav Party, and thus the state, having one’s own opinion and trying to realise it was “nationalism”. The foremost critic of this Slovenian “nationalism” was Edvard Kardelj. The state and Party assessed the political situation in Slovenia as poor. Factors that led to this assessment included the election results for the Constituent Assembly (in two Slovenian districts, Gornja Radgona and Donja Lendava, most voters cast their votes in the “black box”) and the politically incorrect stance towards “reactionaries”; namely, this stance was judged as too liberal (“putrid liberalism”) and “social-democratic”. In addition to all the “errors” in the political activities of the Slovenian Party – which were, according to the opinion of the Yugoslav political leadership, reflected in the poor political situation in Slovenia – Kardelj criticised the Communist Party of Slovenia (Komunistička Partija Slovenije – KPS) as too “petit bourgeois” and for having too many intellectuals. Because of this, the Politburo of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia decided to make changes in the Party’s leadership. The political secretary of the KPS from its founding in April 1937, Franc Lekošek Luka, was replaced by Boris Kidrič. Regarding post-war repression, according to the reports about the situation in the country made by a British diplomat who had travelled throughout Yugoslavia in spring 1946 and met many of the local people, Slovenia was the “most repressive” and “depressive” republic. Immediately after the end of the war, Slovenia’s territory became the site of reprisals against military opponents both on a class and national basis, which lasted a good month after the war’s end. Slovenia thus became the site of such acts committed by the victors of the war, and this was part of the general atmosphere in Yugoslavia at that time. These reprisals were extrajudicial and carried out mostly by Yugoslav Army units as revenge for crimes committed during the war. These events had an all-Yugoslav character, but Slovenia became the site of most reprisals due to its geographic position...|$|R
