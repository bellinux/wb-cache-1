5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as <b>crochets.</b> The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are <b>crochets</b> present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the <b>crochets</b> entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct <b>crochets</b> of its molars.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called <b>crochets</b> that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E

25|$|Some larvae of the Hymenoptera order (ants, {{bees and}} wasps) can appear like the {{caterpillars}} of the Lepidoptera. Such larvae are mainly {{seen in the}} sawfly suborder. However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars, they can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} prolegs on every abdominal segment, an absence of <b>crochets</b> or hooks on the prolegs (these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars), one pair of prominent ocelli on the head capsule, and an absence of the upside-down Y-shaped suture {{on the front of the}} head.|$|E
500|$|Vittoria's {{theme is}} also used (with little development) as {{the subject of the}} fugue. This section is in [...] time (three <b>crochets</b> to a bar) and is marked [...] "Andante con moto" [...] ("at a walking pace, with movement"). The fugue, which is mainly in four-part writing with {{frequent}} rhythmic changes, gradually builds to a climax. In bar 69, a new louder melody is added in the right hand against the fugue theme in the pedals. Gradually, the piece dies away to two parts and ppp (pianississimo, [...] "very, very quietly") as the left and right hands play the fugue theme a bar apart from each other, in canon. The whole piece lasts about five minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Amigurumi can be knitted, {{though they}} are usually <b>crocheted</b> out of yarn or thread, using the basic {{techniques}} of <b>crochet</b> (such as single <b>crochet</b> stitch (sc), double <b>crochet</b> (db), invisible decrease (inv.dec)). Amigurumi can be worked as one piece or, more usually, in sections which are sewed or <b>crocheted</b> together. In <b>crochet,</b> amigurumi are typically worked in spiral rounds to prevent [...] "striping", a typical feature of joining <b>crochet</b> rounds in a project.|$|R
5000|$|Filet <b>crochet</b> {{is a type}} of <b>crocheted</b> fabric. This type of <b>crocheted</b> lace is gridlike {{because it}} uses only two <b>crochet</b> stitches: the chain stitch and the double <b>crochet</b> stitch (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than double <b>crochet</b> stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet <b>crochet</b> forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double <b>crochet</b> stitches. [...] Filet <b>crochet</b> is usually constructed from monotone <b>crochet</b> thread made of Mercerised cotton in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet <b>crochet</b> is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crochet</b> thread is {{specially}} formulated thread {{usually made}} from mercerized cotton for crafting decorative <b>crochet</b> {{items such as}} doilies or filet <b>crochet.</b> <b>Crochet</b> thread produces fabric of fine gauge that may be stiffened with starch.|$|R

2500|$|The shape, size, stretch, {{and hair}} type of the ink brush, the color, color density and water {{density of the}} ink, {{as well as the}} paper's water {{absorption}} speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and <b>crochets,</b> and the stroke order give the [...] "spirit" [...] to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.|$|E
2500|$|During the anti-patrician {{unrest in}} the Lower Valais {{at the end}} of the 18th Century, Sion {{remained}} a bastion of the aristocracy. [...] The leaders of the Les <b>Crochets</b> conspiracy were executed in 1791 in Sion to avoid riots. [...] After the French invasion of Switzerland on 5 March 1798, Sion was caught between the revolutionary spirit of a portion of its population (who established a liberty pole in town on 10 March) and conservative elements who wanted to prevent any change in the Valais. [...] Following the creation of the Helvetic Republic in May 1789, a counter-revolutionary rebellion erupted in the upper Valais. [...] This short-lived rebellion was crushed on 17 May by French and Vaudois troops and Sion was plundered.|$|E
50|$|Tunisian <b>crochet,</b> {{also known}} as Afghan <b>crochet,</b> {{is a type of}} <b>crochet</b> that uses an {{elongated}} hook, often with a stopper on the handle end, called an Afghan hook. It is sometimes considered to be a mixture of <b>crocheting</b> and knitting. As such, some techniques used in knitting are also applicable in Tunisian <b>crochet.</b> One example is the intarsia method.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>crochet</b> {{underwent}} a subsequent decline in popularity, the early 21st century {{has seen a}} revival of interest in handcrafts and DIY, as well as great strides in improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. There are many more new pattern books with modern patterns being printed, and most yarn stores now offer <b>crochet</b> lessons {{in addition to the}} traditional knitting lessons. There are many books you can purchase from local book stores to teach yourself how to <b>crochet</b> whether it be as a beginner or intermediate. There are also many books for children and teenagers who are hoping to take up the hobby. Filet <b>crochet,</b> Tunisian <b>crochet,</b> tapestry <b>crochet,</b> broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish <b>crochet</b> are all variants of the basic <b>crochet</b> method.|$|R

[...] "The law of England says, Yes, but the {{conscience}} of Fosco says, No." [...] He spread out his fat fingers on the bosom of his blouse, and bowed solemnly, as if he wished to introduce his conscience to us all, {{in the character of}} an illustrious addition to the society. [...] "What this document which Lady Glyde is about to sign may be," [...] he continued, [...] "I neither know nor desire to know. I only say this, circumstances may happen in the future which may oblige Percival, or his representatives, to appeal to the two witnesses, in which case it is certainly desirable that those witnesses should represent two opinions which are perfectly independent the one of the other. This cannot be if my wife signs as well as myself, because we have but one opinion between us, and that opinion is mine. I will not have it cast in my teeth, at some future day, that Madame Fosco acted under my coercion, and was, in plain fact, no witness at all. I speak in Percival's interest, when I propose that my name shall appear (as the nearest friend of the husband), and your name, Miss Halcombe (as the nearest friend of the wife). I am a Jesuit, if you please to think so--a splitter of straws--a man of trifles and <b>crochets</b> and scruples--but you will humour me, I hope, in merciful consideration for my suspicious Italian character, and my uneasy Italian conscience."

60|$|The Cork School of Art then {{acquired}} {{a collection of}} finely-patterned old laces, selections from which are freely circulated through the different convents connected with that school. They have also the privilege of borrowing similar specimens of old lace from the South Kensington Museum. So successful has been the system of education pursued by Mr. Brennan, the head-master of the Cork School of Art, that two female students of his school last year gained the gold and silver medals for their designs for laces and <b>crochets</b> at the national competition which annually takes place in London between all the Schools of Art in the United Kingdom. As for the many lace-makers who were not connected either with the convents or with the art schools, in order to assist them, a committee of ladies and gentlemen interested in Irish lace-making raised subscriptions, and offered prizes to be competed for by designers generally. The best designs were then placed out with lace-makers, and carried into execution. It is, of course, often said that the proper person to make the design is the lace-maker. Mr. Cole, however, points out that from the sixteenth century forward the patterns for ornamental laces have always been designed by decorative artists having knowledge of the composition of ornament, and of the materials {{for which they were}} called upon to design. Lace pattern books were published in considerable quantity in Italy, France and Germany during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and from these the lace-makers worked. Many lace- makers would, no doubt, derive benefit from practice in drawing, in discriminating between well and badly shaped forms. But the skill they are primarily required to show and to develop is one of fine fingers in reproducing beautiful forms in threads. The conception, arrangement, and drawing of beautiful forms for a design, have to be undertaken by decorative artists acquainted with the limitations of those materials and methods which the ultimate expression of the design involves.|$|E
50|$|Tapestry <b>crochet</b> is {{sometimes}} called jacquard <b>crochet,</b> intarsia, mosaic, fair isle, and colorwork, but today these terms usually describe different techniques.

2500|$|<b>Crochet</b> ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a process}} of {{creating}} fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials using a <b>crochet</b> hook. The name is derived from the French term <b>crochet,</b> meaning 'small hook'. These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between <b>crochet</b> and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in <b>crochet</b> is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time.

25|$|While most <b>crochet</b> is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of <b>crocheting</b> with a {{knitting}} loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch <b>crochet</b> is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch <b>crochet</b> is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch <b>crochet</b> can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.|$|R

5000|$|Cro-tatting {{combines}} needle tatting with <b>crochet.</b> The cro-tatting tool is a tatting needle with a <b>crochet</b> hook at the end. One {{can also}} cro-tat with a bullion <b>crochet</b> hook {{or a very}} straight <b>crochet</b> hook. In the 19th century, [...] "crochet tatting" [...] patterns were published which simply called for a <b>crochet</b> hook. One of the earliest patterns is for a <b>crocheted</b> afghan with tatted rings forming a raised design. [...] Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are tatted with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle tatting. In modern patterns, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, the rings are tatted and the arches or chains are <b>crocheted.</b> Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than <b>crochet</b> or needle tatting. Some tatting instructors recommend using a tatting needle and a <b>crochet</b> hook to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and needle tatting before a ring is closed) unravel easily, unlike tatting made with a shuttle.|$|R
