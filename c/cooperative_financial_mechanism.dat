We focus on the magnitude and sources of variation in the dividend that cooperatives are presumed to maximize. Variation in the dividend leads to an inefficient allocation of labor among cooperatives.

We use a self-constructed database (1990 - 2011) of <b>financial</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in 55 developing countries. Our empirical results are threefold. First, <b>financial</b> <b>cooperatives</b> tend to reach more members in countries where the commercial banking sector is weak. This validates their role as a market failure solution. Second, {{in the process of}} commercial bank expansion, <b>financial</b> <b>cooperatives</b> run the risk of being crowded out.

40|$|Cooperative-type {{financial}} institutions {{are required by}} law to specify a certain geographic "area" in the articles of association and the members of each institution must have a certain degree of association with its designated area such as being a resident of the area. As such, the designation of such an area serves as a factor that effectively restricts the qualification of members, thereby indirectly restricting the area in which each <b>cooperative</b> <b>financial</b> institution can operate. It is often pointed out that local {{financial institutions}}' loan portfolios are prone to concentration in a specific business sector. In this regard, the way in which <b>cooperative</b> <b>financial</b> institutions operate - providing financial services within or to those associated with their designated areas - can potentially be seen as problematic in terms of maintaining safe and sound management. This paper attempts to make clear why cooperative banks were made subject to the requirement regarding area designation in the first place, seeking clues in documents on the now-defunct Industrial Cooperatives Law enacted in 1900. The reasons have two aspects: (1) organizational factors inherent to <b>cooperative</b> <b>financial</b> institutions and (2) factors related to administrative and financial supervision. The first type of factor can be further classified into two types, namely, factors related to the need to secure personal links as a cooperative organization and factors related to the need to implement strict control over loan management. The Industrial Cooperatives Law sought locality connection as a basis for personal links by mandating cooperative banks to set their respective designated areas. With this, the law aimed to enable cooperative banks to collect qualitative information necessary to properly extend unsecured loans and to assure ex-post loan management. In the light of these reasons, this paper argues that the necessity of area designation has ceased to be relevant to many <b>cooperative</b> <b>financial</b> institutions operating today. ...|$|R
