40|$|Abstract. In dense {{molecular}} clouds, {{the birthplace}} of stars and plan-ets, interstellar atoms and molecules freeze onto extremely cold dust and ice particles. These ices are processed by ultraviolet light and cos-mic rays forming hundreds of far more complex species, some of astro-biological interest. Eventually, these rain down on primordial planets where they {{take part in the}} young chemistry on these new worlds. Although the IR spectroscopy and energetic processing of interstel-lar ice analogs have been studied for nearly 30 years, similar studies of PAH containing ices have only just begun. This paper presents re-cent results from laboratory studies on the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photochemistry of PAHs in water ice at low temperatures to assess the roles they play in the photochemical evolution of interstellar ices and their relevance to astrobiology. A number of “surprises ” were found in these studies on PAH containing water-rich ices, indicating that PAHs likely play very important, unexpected roles in <b>cosmic</b> ice <b>chemistry,</b> physics and astrobiology. ...|$|R
40|$|The PAH radical cation quaterrylene+ (QTR+, C 40 H 20) {{is found}} to be stable in {{amorphous}} water ice up to 120 K. A careful, 30 day, slow warm-up of water ice containing QTR+from 20 to 190 K revealed that QTR+ does not show any sign of reactivity up to 120 K, the temperature at which the phase transition of amorphous to crystalline water ice begins. At higher temperatures the absorption due to the QTR radical cation diminishes rapidly but persists until the water ice itself sublimes around 170 K. From the absence of evidence for the recovery of neutral QTR upon warm-up or reactions with other trapped reaction intermediates in the ice, we infer that QTR+ reacts with the water ice itself during warm-up above 120 K. Earlier we found that PAH ionization is quantitative in water ice and PAH ionization energy is lowered by up to 2 eV. Some implications of these unusual findings for <b>cosmic</b> ice <b>chemistry</b> and physics are briefly discussed.

This “bibliometric” method of quantifying complexity is described in detail and related to analogous methods employed in paleontology. The process is pedagogically divided into 6 phases: The Phase of No Chemistry, The Phase of Prestellar Chemistry, The Phase of Galactic Chemistry, The Phase of Planetary Chemistry, The Phase of Biological Chemistry and The Phase of Human History. These are separated by periods of intensive chemical innovation, likened to phase changes based on four similarities: the rapidity of change, its intensity, the presence of nucleation-like dynamics and dependence of outcome on history. The limitations and perspectives of the method are described, including the extension of the analysis to all 893 UDC classes relevant to the study of nature.

We explore the effect of cosmic rays in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, as a proof-of-concept that ion-neutral chemistry may be important for modelling hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. In order to accomplish this, we utilize Monte Carlo cosmic ray transport models with particle energies of $ 10 ^ 6 $ eV $< E < 10 ^{ 12 }$ eV in order to investigate the cosmic ray enhancement of free electrons in substellar atmospheres. Ion-neutral chemistry is then applied to a Drift-Phoenix model of a free-floating giant gas planet. Our results suggest that the activation of ion-neutral chemistry in the upper atmosphere significantly enhances formation rates for various species, and we find that C$_ 2 $H$_ 2 $, C$_ 2 $H$_ 4 $, NH$_ 3 $, C$_ 6 $H$_ 6 $ and possibly C$_{ 10 }$H are enhanced in the upper atmospheres because of cosmic rays.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} some experiments {{the author}} {{would have liked to}} carry out if he had started earlier in the origin-of-life field. The proposal is preceded by a hypothetical outline of the main events in the origin of life. According to this outline, the emergence of life amounts to the transition between two kinds of chemistry: 1) <b>cosmic</b> <b>chemistry,</b> which is beginning to be understood and most likely provided the building blocks with which life was first constructed; and 2) biochemistry, the well-known set of enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions that support all living organisms today and must have supported the universal common ancestor, or LUCA, from which all known forms of life are derived. The pathway leading {{from one to the other}} of those two chemistries may be divided into three stages, defined as the pre-RNA, RNA, and protein-DNA stages. A brief summary of the events that may have occurred in these three stages and of the possible underlying mechanisms is given. It is emphasized that these events were chemical in nature and, especially, that they must have prefigured present-day biochemical processes. Protometabolism and metabolism, it is argued, must have been congruent. With congruence as the underlying working hypothesis, three problems open to experimental investigation are considered: 1) the involvement of peptides and other multimers as catalysts of early biogenic chemistry; 2) the participation of thioesters in primitive energy transactions; and 3) the influence of amino acids on the molecular selection of RNA molecules...|$|E

More important than the chemical reactions of the primary projectiles seem to be those of the energetic secondaries, created by knock-on of target atoms (5).

This review discusses the observations and theory of these effects. Metallicity fluctuations are summarized, and the theory of turbulent transport of passive tracers is reviewed. Modeling methods, turbulent concentration of dust grains, and the turbulent washout of radial abundance gradients are discussed. Interstellar chemistry is affected by turbulent transport of various species between environments with different physical properties and by turbulent heating in shocks, vortical dissipation regions, and local regions of enhanced ambipolar diffusion. Cosmic rays are scattered and accelerated in turbulent magnetic waves and shocks, and they generate turbulence {{on the scale of}} their gyroradii.

Themes range from astro-particle physics to chemical evolution in the Galaxy to <b>cosmic</b> nucleosynthesis and <b>chemistry</b> in an anticipation of a full account of matter in the Universe. Studies of chemical evolution in the early Universe will answer questions about when and where the majority of metals were formed, how they spread and why they appar today as they are. The evolution of matter in our Universe cannot be characterized as a simple path of development. In fact the state of matter today tells us that mass and matter is under constant reformation through on-going star formation, nucleosynthesis and mass loss on stellar and galactic scales. X-ray absorption studies have evolved in recent years into powerful means to probe the various phases of interstellar and intergalactic media. Future observatories such as IXO and Gen-X will provide vast new opportunities to study structure and distribution of matter with high resolution X-ray spectra.
