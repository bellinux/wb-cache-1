50|$|Most {{turbine blades}} are {{manufactured}} by investment casting (or lost-wax processing). This process involves making a precise negative die {{of the blade}} shape that is filled with wax to form the blade shape. If the blade is hollow (i.e., it has internal cooling passages), a <b>ceramic</b> <b>core</b> {{in the shape of}} the passage is inserted into the middle. The wax blade is coated with a heat-resistant material to make a shell, and then that shell is filled with the blade alloy. This step can be more complicated for DS or SC materials, but the process is similar. If there is a <b>ceramic</b> <b>core</b> in the middle of the blade, it is dissolved in a solution that leaves the blade hollow.
