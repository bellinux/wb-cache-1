5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) <b>canalisation</b> of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a {{junction}} with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and <b>canalisation.</b> Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder is a <b>canalisation</b> of the River Calder from Wakefield to Castleford, {{where it}} joins the branch from Leeds, which follows the River Aire. The Aire {{continues}} to flow eastwards to Bank Dole Junction, then {{continues in a}} north-easterly direction to Haddlesey, from where it follows a winding course to join the River Ouse at Airmyn. The section below Haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation, as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river. Instead, the Selby Canal flows northwards from Haddlesey to the Ouse at Selby. Below Dole Bank Junction, the Knottingley and Goole Canal flows eastards to join the Ouse at Goole. From just before Newbridge, where the modern A614 road crosses the waterway, this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the Dutch River, an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by Cornelius Vermuyden's original diversion of the River Don northwards to the River Aire in 1628.|$|E

5|$|<b>Canalisation</b> of the River Slea {{began in}} the 1790s. Canals in England were {{constructed}} from the 1760s to make inland trade easier; Sleaford's businessmen were keen {{to benefit from the}} improved communication they allowed. Sleaford Navigation opened in 1794. It facilitated the export of agricultural produce to the Midlands, and the import of coal and oil. Mills along the Slea benefited and wharves were constructed around Carre Street. Between 1829 and 1836 the navigation's toll rights increased in value by 27 times. The railways emerged in the 19th century as an alternative to canals and arrived at the town in 1857, when a line from Grantham to Sleaford opened. It made agricultural trade easier and improved communication, but led to the decline of the Navigation Company. Income from tolls decreased by 80% between 1858 and 1868; it made its first loss in 1873 and was abandoned in 1878. The town's rural location and transport links meant that the late 19th century saw the rise of two local seed merchants: Hubbard and Phillips, and Charles Sharpe; the former took over the Navigation Wharves, and the latter was trading in the US and Europe by the 1880s. The railway, Sleaford's rural location and its artesian wells, were key factors {{in the development of the}} 13-acre Bass & Co maltings complex at Mareham Lane (1892–1905).|$|E
5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the <b>canalisation</b> of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E
5|$|The 18th and 19thcenturies saw {{first the}} {{expansion}} of canals and then the construction of rail links. The River Derwent was canalised as far upstream as Malton and was linked to Pocklington by the cutting of the Pocklington Canal. Other canals were cut to join the towns of Beverley and Driffield to the River Hull, which was also improved to aid navigation. The Market Weighton Canal connected the town directly to the Humber Estuary. An early rail link was constructed between Filey and Bridlington in 1847 and the Malton to Driffield railway {{was the first to}} cross the Wolds in 1853. These routes primarily served the agricultural community in helping to get their products to the expanding industrial markets in the West Riding of Yorkshire and to the port of Hull for export. The rail links served also to transport holidaymakers to the expanding coastal resorts of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. The canals and <b>canalisation</b> of some of the rivers helped to aid drainage in such of the low-lying ill-drained areas that then still existed. The landscape in the East Riding had changed little since the enclosure of the open fields in the 18th and 19thcenturies, except for the removal of some hedgerows to allow for the use of large agricultural machinery in the 20thcentury.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Present and {{potential}} petroleum development in Alaska {{is directly related}} to public-policy issues. The Prudhoe Bay oil discovery signaled the need for determination of a transportation route to market. Pipeline location became a function of political boundaries, with an all-American route preferred. Actual pipeline construction was dependent on settlement of land claims with Alaska’s indigenous peoples and the development of environmental safeguards. However, implicit in the U. S. Congressional decision to build the pipeline was acceptance that expanded human activity would impinge on northern Alaska’s pristine wilderness and that there was probable risk of environmental damage. Another major public-policy decision was to allow construction of a pipeline for Prudhoe Bay natural gas. The problem that remains is uncertain economics; thus no Alaskan construction has occurred to date. Public policy also was advanced in windfall-profit taxation, and towards exploration and development of new petroleum areas. Each policy has generated conflict between state and federal governments and private groups, but overall public-policy decisions and related judicial actions continue to favor a development stance. This is likely to persist as long as U. S. national attention is drawn to the uncertainty of foreign sources for petroleum. Key words: Alaska, petroleum, public policy RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|The Petra monumental site {{is located}} on the left rim of the Rift Valley in central-southern Jordan. The entire valley, which is tectonic in origin, rests on Late Cambrian quartzarenite rock {{formations}} of continental origin. Past research conducted by our team has allowed us to identify the following main causes of the weathering processes: thermal expansion and shrinkage of rocks caused by the great differences in day and night temperatures contribute to the loosening of quartz grains that lead to the disintegration of the rock. Heavy rainfall and above all surface runoff contribute significantly to the removal of weathered materials from the surface. Other forms of decay are caused by the presence of salts along the fractures. Both fieldwork and laboratory analyses performed in the past in a climate chamber have demonstrated that the products usually used in conventional restoration work are not very effective, due to the “extreme” climate and the chemical and physical characteristics of the rocks. The project proposes the realization of a GIS aimed at acquiring complete knowledge of the man-made structures and hydraulic system underlying the routes of the <b>canalisations</b> and identifying the cisterns.

In July 1792, the Aire and Calder Canal Company asked William Martin, who was the manager of the canal, to prepare plans for a link from near Wakefield to the Barnsley mines. Hearing of the plans, the River Don Navigation Company proposed an alternative, which involved the <b>canalisation</b> of the River Dearne, to reach the same destination.

25|$|The {{landscape}} of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area {{with an average of}} two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal.

40|$|The {{basin of}} the Sinos River, {{located in the}} northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly {{impacted}} by industrial and urban activities.

The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4, 869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat...|$|R
40|$|The River Scheldt {{currently}} has a macrotidal estuary with a tidal reach of 160 km. It covers a complete salinity gradient with a polyhaline, mesohaline and oligohaline zone {{and a fresh}} water part with long and short retention time of chloride. The estuary and its tidal tributaries Durme and Rupel have been heavily influenced by anthropogenic pressures such as land reclamation, harbour expansion, dredging activities, embankments and urbanisation. A good understanding {{of the impact of}} human interventions on the ecological functioning of the estuarine ecosystem is required. Based on this knowledge appropriate compensation or mitigation measures can be taken in response or anticipation to future negative effects of anthropogenic changes and relative sea level rise. In this study, all available data on tidal regime (1850 - 2000), bathymetric charts (1930, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000) historical maps {{from the beginning of the}} 19 th century onwards and aerial photographs from 1944 onwards were compiled and analysed for the Zeeschelde (Belgian part of the Scheldt estuary) and the tidal tributary river sections. The report deals with three main issues:(1) Ecological changes during the past century are analysed using a hierarchical ecotope approach. The evolution of the acreage of the distinguished physiotopes (physically characterised units) andecotopes such as shallow waters, tidal mudflats and marshes are analysed for each salinity zone or river section;(2) Changes in hydrodynamic and morphological parameters are analysed over the past century;(3) An overview of anthropogenic interventions and natural changes with potential effects onhabitat acreage and quality in the Zeeschelde and its tidal tributaries in the past two centuries. Thenature of the interventions is very diverse: reclamations, diking, land use change, infrastructureworks, dredging activities, <b>canalisations,</b> discharge manipulations and changes in river dynamics. Changes in tidal regimeBecause tidal regime is a key factor in an estuarine ecosystem, we analysed the characteristics ofthe ten year mean high water (MHW), mean low water (MLW), tidal asymmetry and the tidalamplitude. Temporal and spatial patterns of these parameters are examined within differentsalinity zones in the Scheldt, the Durme and the Rupel. MHW shows a gradual increase in the whole Scheldt estuary. The highest rise is located in the freshwater part with short retention time. Maximum MHW shifted 32 km upstream from Antwerp to Sint-Amands within one century. MLW and tidal asymmetry show a more irregular pattern and are more sensitive to anthropogenicactivities such as dredging and deepening in the navigation channel. MLW dropped in the pastcentury in the harbour zone of the Scheldt between the Dutch-Belgian border and the confluence ofthe Rupel and along the Rupel. In the fresh water zone with long retention time, MLW and tidalasymmetry changed little till 1970 (1 st deepening of the Scheldt). After this period MLW strongly dropped as in most other river sections. MLW and tidal asymmetry in the fresh water zone with short retention time increased between 1900 and 1970 and were presumably affected by river discharge reductions and <b>canalisations.</b> After the 70 ’s MLW and tidal asymmetry decreased again. In the Durme MLW dropped at the confluence, more upstream it rised because of sedimentation in the riverbed. Discharge deviation, damming and channel straighthening played an important role here as well. At the same time tidal asymmetry increased in the whole Durme. MHW and MLW changes resulted in a high increase of tidal amplitude in the Scheldt and Rupel. In the River Scheldt the highest tidal amplitude was recorded at Lillo (62 km to North Sea) around 1890, while in the last ten years the maximum occurs in Temse (98 km to Sea); a shift of 36 km upstream in a bit more than a century.

La Compagnie Générale des Eaux, gestionnaire de son alimentation en eau potable, applique depuis sa mise au point au début du siècle le procédé de désinfection par l'ozone et distribue une eau sans ajouter de chlore. Un diagnostic complet de la qualité microbiologique et sanitaire de ce réseau non chloré et sans Carbone Organique Dissous Biodégradable (CODB) a été entrepris. Le suivi de la qualité de l'eau dans le réseau a consisté en des campagnes de prélèvements à partir de plusieurs points d'observation répartis sur l'ensemble du réseau. Ce suivi a permis de confirmer la bonne qualité de l'eau distribuée et le maintien de cette qualité tout au long de son transport dans les <b>canalisations.</b> Le CODB est absent sur l'ensemble des points confirmant l'absence de relargage et de contamination pendant le transport. La récupération des dépôts présents dans les <b>canalisations</b> n'a pas révélé de colonisation du réseau par des micro-organismes supérieurs. La quantité de biofilm présente sur les parois des <b>canalisations</b> a été évaluée en suivant la colonisation de pastilles de matériau immergées dans les réservoirs. Ce diagnostic complet de l'état microbiologique et sanitaire du réseau de Nice {{montre que}} l'absence de chloration n'entraîne pas de dégradation de la qualité bactériologique de l'eau et que c'est essentiellement l'absence de matière organique biodégradable qui limite la croissance bactérienne et qui contribue au maintien de la qualité de l'eau dans le réseau de distribution. Within {{the more general}} scope of studies aiming at a better knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for biological biodegradation in water systems, {{it was interesting to}} learn the microbiological behaviour of a drinking water network supplied with water free of biodegradable organics. The case in point is the town of Nice which enjoys excellent quality water ressources, {{to the extent that the}} Compagnie Générale des Eaux, managers of the municipal water utility, were able to apply ozonation as a disinfectant when the technique first appeared at the beginning of the century, and supply chlorine free water. The Municipal Services of the Town of Nice, the Nice Health Laboratory and the Compagnie Générale des Eaux bave therefore combined forces to carry out a study on the development of water quality in the supply network in such an animal environment. The objective is to make a complete diagnosis of the microbiological and hygienic quality of a chlorine-free network which would confirm the excellent quality of the distributed water and serve as a reference within the scope of general research on the removal of biodegradable organics for the supply of non chlorinated water. The study consisted of monitoring three supply systems fed by three different water works :- the Super Rimiez plant treating water from the river Vésubie in the following stages : flocculation, primary clarification, sand filtration and virucidal ozonation;-the Jean Moreno plant : water pumped from the alluvion layers of the Var and ozonated;-the Prairies plant : pumping and temporary chlorination of the Var aquifer with chlorine dioxyde. In order to take seasonal variations info account, our study lasted for a whole year, with sampling campaigns every two weeks on 20 observation points along the network, and on the raw water treated in three production plants. The physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of the water samples were analyzed. Samples were collected at a high flow rate from fire hydrants near the observation points. The sediments were gathered in a plankton net and analyzed to detect the presence of possible animalcules. The immersion of PVC coupons in two reservoirs, fed respectively with the two types of water, enabled the growth kinetics of fixed bacteria to be followed, and the quantifies of fixed biomass at steady state to be compared. It was possible, by monitoring the chloride content (on average 25 mg Cl¯/l in Var water compared with 5 mg Cl¯/l in Vésubie water), to identify the precise influence of the two water resources. Total bacteria measured by epilluorescence are not very high compared with networks in other large towns. It will be noted, however, that the figure is higher in the network supplied from the Vésubie than in those treating water from the Var aquifer. Bacterial regrowth in circulating water is minor, showing that the influence of bacteria released by the biofilm installed on the pipe walls is minimized. This biofilm is present just the same, as is shown by the results of colonization an the immersed coupons in reservoirs. The quantity of fixed bacteria at steady state is different according to the type of water but, in both cases, it was lower than the figure obtained with water loaded with biodegradable organics. The total plate count remains low on the whole, even at end sections of the network. The presence at fecal bacteria was only observed at a few points during some of the studies and the Nice network, on the whole, is of excellent quality judged by the very few fecal contamination indicators found. The presence of Aeromonas hydrophila was detected in very small quantities and at a few of the sampling points only. Analyses of Dissolved Organic Carbon (on average 0. 3 mgC/l) and Biodegradable Dissolved Organic Carbon (less than 0. 1 mgC/l, by the minimum detection threshold method) reveal a very low concentration in organics and a total absence of BDOC on all sampling points, thus confirming the good quality of the water supplied and the tact that these is very little bacteria) remise and contamination while the water is in transit. Examination of the sediments in water mains and at the bottom of reservoirs did not reveal the existence of higher forma of microorganisms. This complete diagnosis of the mirobiological and health condition of the Nice water system has brought confirmation of the good quality of the water supplied throughout its transit in the water mains. The lack of chlorination dues not cause a deterioration of the bacteriological quality of the water, the sustainable quality of which is essentially linked with the absence of BDOC which restricting the growth of bacteria. The importance of these findings on such a distinctive network as that of the Nice utility will enable this study to be used as reference for future research on the means of maintaining the quality of water in supply networks without using chlorine...|$|R

Prior to its final destruction in 1869, the hall was rebuilt in 1829. Wigan's status as a centre for coal production, engineering and textiles in the 18th century led to the Douglas Navigation in the 1740s, the <b>canalisation</b> of part of the River Douglas and later the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The canal from Liverpool to Leeds was originally to serve Wigan on a spur, transporting cloth and food grown on the West Lancashire Plain to the Port of Liverpool. When construction restarted in the 1790s after a decades pause with coal rising in importance during the intervening years due to the progress of the Industrial Revolution the route was altered at the request of mill owners with the spur becoming the primary route and Wigan a hub for transport of coal from the Lancashire coal pits to Liverpool and Leeds. As a mill town, Wigan was an important centre of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, {{but it was not until}} the 1800s that cotton factories began to spread into the town. This was due to a dearth of fast-flowing streams and rivers in the area, but by 1818 there were eight cotton mills in the Wallgate part of Wigan. In 1818 William Woods introduced the first power looms to the Wigan cotton mills. These mills swiftly became infamous for their dangerous and unbearable conditions, low pay and use of child labour. As well as being a mill town, Wigan was also an important centre for coal production.

Des éprouvettes de matériaux neufs introduites dans des eaux présentant des concentrations en chlore total variant de 2, 4 à 0, 02 mg/l et véhiculant entre 0, 5 x 106 et 5 x 105 cellules bactériennes/mi (dont 1 à 10 % de bactéries cultivables) sont rapidement colonisées (106 à 108 cellules/cm 2). L'effet du chlore est sensible sur les cellules totales pour des concentrations de l'ordre de 1 à 2, 4 mg/l. Sur les bactéries cultivables, un ralentissement de la croissance du biofilm est observé dès 0, 3 mg/ 1 de chlore total. Par contre, des résiduels de 0, 02 ou 0, 05 mg/l sont sans effet sur la cinétique de formation des biofilms. Des résiduels moyens de chlore total compris entre 2, 3 et 3, 4 mg/l appliqués en continu pendant 14 jours sur un biofilm constitué d'environ 8, 7 x 106 cellules par cm 2 (1, 7 % de bactéries cultivables), entraînent l'élimination d'environ 90 % des bactéries fixées (abattement d' 1 logarithme) durant les premiers jours d'exposition. L'altération du biofilm exposé à un résiduel de chlore total de l'ordre de 1, 3 mg/l est identique, mais toutefois plus étalée dans le temps. Ces essais réalisés sur des éprouvettes de PVC, PE et mortier de ciment n'ont pas permis la mise en évidence de comportements différents de ces 3 supports [...] Bacterial accumulation {{in drinking water}} systems results both of cell deposition on the pipe walls and attached bacteria growth. The presence of a complex biofilm (cells embedded in a matrix of exopolymers) leads to a continuous contamination of the water phase resulting from {{the erosion of the}} attached growing biomass. Then, many tentatives to lmit the formation of such a biofilm have been suggested as the removal of biodegradable organic matter fram water or as the application of disinfectant. However, the efficiency of chlorination of the distribution system is debatable. Indeed, adhesion is often described as a factor of protection of attached bacteria which counterbalances the expected effect of disinfectant. Then, the aim of this experimental work is using a model distribution system to evaluate (i) the kinetics of biofilm accumulation on coupons of new materials (Polyvinyl chlorure : PVC, polyethylene : PE, cement) disposed in a constantly chlorinated system (residual total chlorine from 0. 021 o 2. 4 mg. l- 1), (ii) the effect of chlorination on previously accumulated biofilms. The industrial pilot plant used in this study is comprised of five loops serially disposed (fig. 1). From previous study of simulation, one may assume that each loop works like a perfectly mixed reactor when the whole pilot plant is equivalent to an infinite tubular reactor with high axial dispersion coefficient. During the experiment, the pilot was continuously fed with finished drinking water front the surface water treatment plant of city of Nancy (i. e. natural finished water with its own chlorine demand, organic nutrients and heterotrophic bacteria). Total number of cells (epifluorescence counts) and heterotrophic plate count bacteria (15 days of incubation at 20 °C) were enumerated both in the water and, after sonication, {{on the surface of the}} coupons of tested materials. The first experimentations show that chlorine slows clown the kinetic of deposition of bacteria onto the pipe wall but never prohibits biofilm formation. When the drinking waters carried from 2. 4 to 0. 02 mg. 1 - 1 of chlorine and from 0. 5 to 5 x 105 ml- 1 bacterial cells, biofilm is observed after 24 hours of immersion of the coupons with at least 101 to 106 bacteria/cm 2. Respectively, the deposition or/and growth rates of total cells are drastically affected only for chlorine residual as high as 1 to 2. 4 mg. 1 - 1. The number of heterotrophic plate count of the biofilm is affected with lower chlorine residual (around 0. 3 mg. 1 - 1) but residual concentration as low as 0. 05 mg. 1 - 1 are ineffective. The tentatives carried out in the second experience on preformed biofilms (2 months old biofilms, 8. 7 x 106 cells/cm 2) show that the continuous application of 2. 3 to 3. 4 mg. 1 - 1 of residual chlorine for 14 days, leads to the removal of only 90 % of attached total cells without modifications of the proportion of attached alive bacteria (around 1. 7 %) into the biofitm. In other wards, a highly chlorinated networks shows at minima 106 attached cells/cm 2. Its generally takes several days to reply to the chlorine demand of the system and to have a quasi steady state reactor in terms of residual chlorine. These assays carried out with three types of coupons (PVC, PE, cement lined cast iron) did not show any difference between the tested materials. The limited efficiency of chlorine against the biofilm can be explained by transfert limitations within the visquous layer, high consumption of chlorine by the biopolymers of the attached matrix (proteins [...] .) or low sensitivity to the disinfectant of the slow growing attached bacteria. Then chlorination is really not a panacea in biofilm war but has to be applied in combination with other methods as biodegradable organic matter removal, hydraulic regime improvement [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Se presentan resultados hidráulicos y sedimentológicos de una campaña al arroyo Napostá Grande. A pesar que existe un gran número de obras hidráulicas sobre el curso {{inferior}} del arroyo, no existen aún datos publicados acerca del caudal sólido transportados por el mismo. Se ubicó una sección de aforo adecuada, sobre la cual se determinó la batimetría del área. Se midieron las velocidades en verticales separadas 0. 5 m en toda la sección y a partir de estos valores se determinaron las curvas de igual velocidad en la sección con las que se calculó el caudal y la distribución de los esfuerzos de corte del fondo. Se obtuvieron muestras del sedimento transportado como carga de fondo {{por medio de}} trampas, verificándose transporte diferentes en cada faja. Paralelamente se calculó el transporte como carga de fondo por medio de cuatro diferentes ecuaciones y se comparó con los valores medidos, determinándose cual de las ecuaciones predijo mejor el valor del transporte. De las muestras de sedimento en suspensión se realizaron las curvas granulométricas y se calculó la velocidad de caída ponderada de esos sedimentos. Se estimó la concentración y el transporte de sedimento en suspensión por el método de difusión, determinándose además la distribución de concentraciones en la sección de aforo. Las características particulares del transporte en el curso inferior de arroyo Napostá llevan necesariamente a determinar el transporte como carga de fondo en distintas fajas ya que la influencia de las orillas provoca una considerable diferencia en el transporte entre la zona de mayor profundidad y las zonas cercanas a las orillas, haciendo riesgoso considerar una sola posición como representativa de la sección en su totalidad. Las comparaciones entre las fórmulas de predicción de transporte como carga de fondo sugieren como la más adecuada a la de Einstein aunque predice en defecto. Le siguen las formulas de Yalin y de Bagnold. La fórmula suiza arrojó resultados muy por encima de los reales, debiéndose esto a que la arena del arroyo es muy fina y dicha ecuación es valida para partículas relativamente grandes (D> 2 mm). Hydraulic and sedimentological {{results of}} a field survey to the Napostá Grande Creek are presented. The lower, highly meandering course flows through Bahía Blanca City. This part of the creek is greatly affected by hydraulic man-made features such as railways, car and walking bridges, <b>canalisations,</b> a structure that separates the extreme flood water, urban rainwater collection, cleaning, etc. In addition, sand is being extracted from the channel for construction. Despite the remarkable influence that the stream has on the city, there are no quantitative records of the sediment transport within the stream. The objective of this work {{is to determine the}} liquid an solid flux over a section, evaluate the dynamic and turbulent characteristics of the flux, find a proper methodology suitable for this particular situation and define a formulation that predicts most accurately the bed load transport in the Napostá Creek. A proper cross-section after a recognition walk along several kilometres along the course of water has been done. As the stream shows several meanders it was difficult to locate an ideal cross section. The one chosen had some problems from the hydraulic point of view (partially symmetrical area, presence of a sand bar located in a rather short straight length), but on the other hand, the accessibility was excellent with available electric supply. Bathymetry of the surrounding area was carried out and a map was produced with isobaths with 0. 5 m equidistance. Velocities at vertical profiles separated 0. 5 m were obtained with a propeller along the cross-section and, based on these data, equal- velocity curves were drawn over the transversal section. These allowed the determination of the water flux and the bottom shear stress distribution along the cross section and wet perimeter. Within the section, bedload sediment transport was sampled using Helley-Smith kind bedload traps, at various locations, confirming different transport rates at each point. Traps gathered the sediments over 13 minute at each strip in five points, which led to a distribution of the sediment dragged close to the bottom. Higher transport rates were verified on the section thalweg diminishing shorewards. Granulometric curves were determined for the bed load samples and bottom ones. The coarser sediment was trapped only near the thalweg where there is an important velocity concentration. Close to the shores, only the finer fraction of the bedload was captured by the traps meaning that the energy available there does not involve all particle sizes in the movement. Calculation of the predicted bedload sediment transport was done, considering four well known equations (Meyer- Peter-Muller, Einstein, Bagnold and Yalin). The D 50 criteria was adopted for the calculation of the bedload. The Swiss formula gave a 100 % error in comparison with the measured values, whereas the rest of them showed great accuracy for the methodology employed. Einstein's formula gave the closest value to the measured one but underestimated it. On the other hand Bagnold's equation resulted in 17 % in excess. Yalin's formula produced a 15 % understimation, about the same order than Einstein's formulation. Suspended sediment samples were obtained and their granulometry determined through the Oden's Curve technique. Based on them, weighted settling velocities were calculated for each sample (Perez et al., 1997). Suspended sediment concentration profiles were determined by the diffusion method. Then the concentration distribution was integrated over the area so that total flux and flux distribution were obtained. Also a grid was calculated and curves of equal flux are presented. Net suspended sediment transport across the area was found as the addition of the two kind of transports...|$|R

60|$|In antiquity, {{so long as}} the <b>canalisation</b> of {{the country}} was {{properly}} carried out, the fertility of the alluvial plain enabled great and prosperous nations to have their home in the Euphrates valley. Its abundant clay furnished the materials for the masses of sun-dried and burnt bricks, the remains of which, in the shape of huge artificial mounds, still testify to both the magnitude and the industry of the population, thousands of years ago. Good cement is plentiful, while the bitumen, which wells from the rocks at Hit and elsewhere, not only answers the same purpose, but is used to this day, as it was in Hasisadra's time, to pay the inside and the outside of boats.|$|E
60|$|In the {{occurrence}} of these annual inundations lies one of several resemblances between {{the valley of the}} Euphrates and that of the Nile. But there are important differences. The time of the annual flood is reversed, the Nile being highest in autumn and winter, and lowest in spring and early summer. The periodical overflows of the Nile, regulated by the great lake basins in the south, are usually punctual in arrival, gradual in growth, and beneficial in operation. No lakes are interposed between the mountain torrents of the upper basis of the Tigris and the Euphrates and their lower courses. Hence, heavy rain, or an unusually rapid thaw in the uplands, gives rise to the sudden irruption of a vast volume of water which not even the rapid Tigris, still less its more sluggish companion, can carry off in time to prevent violent and dangerous overflows. Without an elaborate system of <b>canalisation,</b> providing an escape for such sudden excesses of the supply of water, the annual floods of the Euphrates, and especially of the Tigris, must always be attended with risk, and often prove harmful.|$|E
