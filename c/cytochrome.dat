Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the <b>cytochrome</b> b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their <b>cytochrome</b> b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Copper is {{essential}} in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is found in <b>cytochrome</b> c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. <b>Cytochrome</b> c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and {{the reduction}} of two molecules of <b>cytochrome</b> c, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{respiratory}} electron-transport {{chain of}} heterotrophically dark-grown Chloroflexus aurantiacus has been investigated. Membranes isolated from these cells {{have been shown}} to contain at least three c-type <b>cytochromes</b> (Em, 7. 0 255, 180, and 10 mV), three b-type <b>cytochromes</b> (Em, 7. 0 of 210, 60 and − 65 mV) and two <b>cytochromes</b> of the a type with Em, 7. 0 of 330 and 190 mV. Spectroscopic evidence from CO-difference spectra, CN−-duference spectra and spectra at fixed oxidation-reduction potentials suggests that the two a-type components may be analogous to <b>cytochromes</b> a and a 3 of mitochondria. The analyses of the effects induced by CN−, myxothiazol and antimycin A on both steady-state respiratory activities and semi-rapid oxidation-reduction kinetic patterns of c- and a-type <b>cytochromes</b> indicate the presence of a branched respiratory chain. Growth of Chloroflexus in medium lacking added copper diminished the concentration of the a-type <b>cytochromes</b> but not those of <b>cytochromes</b> of the b and c type...|$|R
40|$|Several strains and mutants of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides can {{be grown}} anaerobically in the dark in the {{presence}} of dimethyl sulphoxide as an electron acceptor. During adaptation to this fermentative mode of growth, two major c-type <b>cytochromes</b> are synthesized, one with Mr 45 000 and the second with Mr 20 000 and a midpoint potential of + 120 mV. These <b>cytochromes</b> are barely detectable in membranes prepared from cells grown in aerobic or photosynthetic conditions. An electrophoretic method is presented for the detection of the b-type and c-type <b>cytochromes</b> of pigmented or unpigmented membranes.

5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to <b>cytochrome</b> oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and <b>cytochrome</b> oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of <b>cytochrome</b> c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per <b>cytochrome</b> c reduced.|$|E
5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a <b>cytochrome</b> c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, <b>cytochrome</b> c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a <b>cytochrome</b> c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the in situ reduction levels of <b>cytochromes</b> b and c in growing bacteria is achieved by coupling a chemostat with a dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Visible light absorption spectra of <b>cytochromes</b> present in bacterial cells actively growing in a chemostat at a specific growth rate of 0. 1 h- 1 are recorded. This is accomplished by transporting the emitted light from the spectrophotometer via glass fibers {{to one side of}} the chemostat vessel and detecting the transmitted light via a photomultiplier at the other side. The vessel itself is enclosed in a dark box, which contains mirrors on the inside surfaces. The reduction levels of <b>cytochromes</b> b and c during steady state in chemostat cultures are expressed as percentage absorbance of fully reduced <b>cytochromes</b> in the alpha-region of the spectrum. Steady state spectra are recorded in N 2 -fixing, succinate-limited continuous cultures of Azorhizobium caulinodans at dissolved oxygen tensions in the range between 0. 1 and 3. 5 % O 2. Spectra of fully reduced <b>cytochromes</b> are obtained on the basis of spectra recorded after having reached anoxic conditions by sparging pure nitrogen gas through the culture. These spectra of <b>cytochromes</b> b and c reduced by endogenous substrates are corrected as to give the spectrum of fully reduced <b>cytochromes.</b> The respective contributions of <b>cytochromes</b> b and c to spectra in the alpha-region are estimated by deconvolution using best-fit analysis.

5|$|During 2009, Steven Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{published}} two papers that found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which {{can be found in a}} single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, Goodman and Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (the site where the original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. Among the five species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from the eastern edge of the Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of <b>cytochrome</b> b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. <b>Cytochrome</b> b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar.

5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane.

Study of Geobacter sulfurreducens has shown that TCA cycle enzymes, inner-membrane respiratory enzymes, and periplasmic and outer-membrane <b>cytochromes</b> are required. Here we present comparative analysis of six Geobacter genomes, including species from the clade that predominates in the subsurface. Conservation of proteins across the genomes was determined {{to better understand the}} evolution of Geobacter species and to create a metabolic model applicable to subsurface environments. Results The results showed that enzymes for acetate transport and oxidation, and for proton transport across the inner membrane were well conserved. An NADH dehydrogenase, the ATP synthase, and several TCA cycle enzymes were among the best conserved in the genomes. However, most of the <b>cytochromes</b> required for Fe(III) -reduction were not, including many of the outer-membrane <b>cytochromes.</b> While conservation of <b>cytochromes</b> was poor, an abundance and diversity of <b>cytochromes</b> were found in every genome, with duplications apparent in several species. Conclusions These results indicate there is a common pathway for acetate oxidation and energy generation across the family and in the last common ancestor. They also suggest that while <b>cytochromes</b> are important for extracellular electron transport, the path of electrons across the periplasm and outer membrane is variable. This combination of abundant <b>cytochromes</b> with weak sequence conservation suggests they may not be specific terminal reductases, but rather may be important in their heme-bearing capacity, as sinks for electrons between the inner-membrane electron transport chain and the extracellular acceptor. </p...|$|R
