Similar machines can also be used for placing trees in pots or baskets for <b>commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> operations. Tree spades are available {{in a wide variety of}} sizes and designs that are made to suit varied soil conditions and customer requirements. Typical design variations can include straight vs curved blades, root ball diameter, root ball depth, and root ball cone angle.|$|E
40|$|Blight-resistant American {{chestnut}} (Castanea dentata) {{may soon}} be commercially available, but few studies have tested methods to produce high quality seedlings that will be competitive after planting. This study evaluated the performance of one American, one Chinese (C. mollissima), one second-generation backcross (BC 3 F 2), and 10 third-generation backcross chestnut families (BC 3 F 3). We examine growth over one year in a <b>commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> in east Tennessee. We examined relationships among nut size and weight and seedling growth, between germination timing and seedling survival, and between germination percentage and growth. Across the population tested, a 1 g increase in nut weight corresponded to a 6 cm increase in seedling height, a 0. 5 mm increase in root collar diameter and one additional first order lateral root, but models had low predictive power. BC 3 F 3 chestnuts grew similarly to American chestnuts, with substantial differences in growth among chestnut families within generation. Nuts that germinated by 23 April had greater than 1955 odds of surviving the first growing season than nuts that germinated in late May. American and backcross chestnut growth slowed in late June, presumably due to exhaustion of their cotyledons before leaf expansion. These results will help nursery managers refine cultural practices to maximize growth of backcross chestnuts...|$|E

Much of the northern section of Kissena Park, former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees.

Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan.|$|R

40|$|The {{desire for}} instant {{landscaping}} effect in China’s high volume residential development sector has recently generated an extreme form of arboricultural practice. Very mature trees (trunk diameter up to 3000 mm, dbh) are being extracted from areas of natural vegetation, and having {{most of their}} root systems and all of their canopy removed {{to allow them to}} be transported to <b>commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries,</b> where they are brought back to life and sold on. Four commercial nurseries near Guangzhou specializing in this form of extreme transplantation, and three landscaping sites that had used <b>trees</b> from the <b>nurseries,</b> were visited to make detailed observations and to conduct interviews with the operators and site managers to understand the specific operations and techniques employed in handling the trees, and the values associated with this practice. Current scientific literature on the responses of mature trees to transplanting and physical damage gives us some insight into the arboricultural condition of these trees and how {{they might be able to}} survive such treatment, and allows us to speculate on how their condition might develop afterwards. This ‘extreme transplantation’ is contrary to all established arboricultural science and practice guidelines for transplanting mature trees. The apparent commodification of our green heritage seemingly contradicts the principles of environmental preservation and stewardship that underpin the landscape profession...|$|R

40|$|The fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> {{accreditation}} scheme {{implemented by the}} Philippine Department of Agriculture (DA) has been promoted to enhance the supply of high quality fruit tree planting materials and {{reduce the number of}} dubious seedling market players. This paper examines the advantages of the fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> {{accreditation scheme}} and draws implications for possible formulation of a scheme to accredit forest <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries</b> in the Philippines. Data were collected from interviews with accredited fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> operators and the nursery accreditation officer-in-charge in Northern Mindanao. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of applicants for nursery accreditation each year since 2004, as a result of the advantages nursery operators observed from those who had already been accredited. A major advantage is that only accredited fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nursery</b> operators can join in the government procurement of seedlings through a bidding process which is always for substantial volumes. As a form of advertisement, accredited nurseries are posted on the government website thus creating a wide range of market opportunities which results in increased sales. Other advantages such as receiving free training in improving seedling production and occasionally receiving high quality propagation materials (scions and seedlings), subsidies for pesticides and fertilizers and free soil tests were enjoyed by accredited fruit <b>tree</b> <b>nurseries.</b> These opportunities encouraged other nursery operators to apply for accreditation. Accreditation by the DA places emphasis on maintaining high genetic quality of planting materials as well as the physical quality of the seedlings. Accrediting forestry nurseries is seen as a potential policy option that can expand the supply of high quality tree seedlings in the Philippines, as is the case with fruit tree seedlings...|$|R
