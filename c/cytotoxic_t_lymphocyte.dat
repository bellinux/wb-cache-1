Cytotoxic responses would imply the involvement of CD4+ T helper cells in the response to AAV and in vitro data from human studies suggests that the virus may indeed induce such responses, including both Th1 and Th2 memory responses. A number of candidate T cell stimulating epitopes have been identified within the AAV capsid protein VP1, which may be attractive targets for modification of the capsid if the virus is to be used as a vector for gene therapy.|$|E

The importance of IFNÎ³ in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNÎ³ is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and CD8 <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops.

50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of immunodominance are very poorly understood. What determines <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) immunodominance {{can be a}} number of factors, many of which are debated. Of these, one in particular focuses on the timing of CTL clonal expansion. The dominant CTLs that arise were activated sooner so therefore proliferate faster than subdominant CTLs that were activated later, thus resulting in a greater number of CTLs for that immunodominant epitope. This can be in concordance with an additional theory which states that immunodominance may be dependent on the affinity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to the immunodominant epitope. That is, T cells with a TCR that has high affinity for its antigen {{are most likely to be}} immunodominant. High affinity of the peptide to the TCR contributes to the T cellâ€™s survival and proliferation, allowing for more clonal selection of the immunodominant T cells over the subdominant T cells. Immunodominant T cells also curtail subdominant T cells by outcompeting them for cytokine sources from antigen-presenting cells. This leads to a greater expansion of the T cells that recognize a high affinity epitope and is favoured since these cells are likely to clear the infection much more quickly and effectively than their subdominant counterparts. It is important to note, however, that immunodominance is a relative term. If subdominant epitopes are introduced without the dominant epitope, the immune response will be focused to that subdominant epitope. Meanwhile, if the dominant epitope is introduced with the subdominant epitope, the immune response will be directed against the dominant epitope while silencing the response against the subdominant epitope.|$|E
