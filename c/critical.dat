5|$|As of 2011, {{there are}} 33 horse breeds on the equine CPL, {{comprising}} seventeen in the <b>critical</b> category, {{seven in the}} threatened, five in the watch, three in the recovering and one in study. There are also three breeds of asses, one {{in each of the}} <b>critical,</b> threatened and recovering categories. On the CPL for all other livestock species there are 10 pig breeds: seven in the <b>critical</b> category, one threatened, one watched, and one in the study. The 19 cattle breeds listed include eight in the <b>critical</b> category, two in the threatened, three in the watch, five recovering and one in the study. The list contains 23 sheep breeds: five in the <b>critical</b> category, six in the threatened, three in the watch, eight in the recovering and one in the study. Of seven goat breeds listed, two are in the <b>critical</b> category, two in the watch, two recovering and one in the study. Finally, there are 11 rabbit breeds listed on the CPL: three in the <b>critical</b> category, three threatened, and five in the watch.|$|E
5|$|Californium-251 has a {{very small}} {{calculated}} <b>critical</b> mass of about , high lethality, and {{a relatively short period}} of toxic environmental irradiation. The low <b>critical</b> mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach <b>critical</b> mass, particularly because plutonium's <b>critical</b> mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A <b>critical</b> mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a <b>critical</b> mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, <b>critical</b> mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two <b>critical</b> masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one <b>critical</b> mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the <b>critical</b> supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of <b>critical</b> supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant <b>critical</b> ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the <b>critical</b> event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an {{arterial}} bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a <b>critical</b> radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The <b>critical</b> parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the <b>critical</b> event {{is assumed to}} be the {{presence}} of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a <b>critical</b> volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the <b>critical</b> parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a <b>critical</b> volume.|$|E

5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as <b>critical</b> points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a <b>critical</b> point of such a map can be described by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), by considering {{the way in which}} a small m minus& 1 sphere around the <b>critical</b> point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the <b>critical</b> value.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} phase {{transition}} and the <b>critical</b> behavior of observables, termed <b>critical</b> phenomena, {{was a major}} field {{of interest in the}} 1960s.

Wilson in 1972, under the formalism of the renormalization group in the context of quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{table to}} the right lists the <b>critical</b> masses for curium {{isotopes}} for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the <b>critical</b> masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the <b>critical</b> mass can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these <b>critical</b> mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E

25|$|In the diagram, {{the blue}} line marking the {{boundary}} between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the <b>critical</b> point. As the temperature and pressure approach the <b>critical</b> point, {{the properties of the}} liquid and gas become progressively more similar. At the <b>critical</b> point, the liquid and gas become indistinguishable. Above the <b>critical</b> point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a supercritical fluid. In water, the <b>critical</b> point occurs at around 647 K (374°C or 705°F) and 22.064 MPa.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} the {{functional}} equation of the Riemann zeta-function that the Z-function is real for real values of t. It is an even function, and real analytic for real values. It {{follows from the}} fact that the Riemann-Siegel theta-function and the Riemann zeta-function are both holomorphic in the <b>critical</b> strip, where the imaginary part of t is between -1/2 and 1/2, that the Z-function is holomorphic in the <b>critical</b> strip also. Moreover, the real zeros of Z(t) are precisely the zeros of the zeta-function along the <b>critical</b> line, and complex zeros in the Z-function <b>critical</b> strip correspond to zeros off the <b>critical</b> line of the Riemann zeta-function in its <b>critical</b> strip.|$|E
