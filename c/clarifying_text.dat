The test relies on geometrical optics, it is independent of the matter content of the universe and the applicability of the Einstein equation on cosmological scales. We apply the test to observations, using the Union 2. 1 compilation of supernova distances and Sloan Lens ACS Survey galaxy strong lensing data. The FLRW metric is consistent with the data, and the spatial curvature parameter is constrained to be - 1. 22 <Ω_K 0 < 0. 63, or - 0. 08 <Ω_K 0 < 0. 97 with a prior from the cosmic microwave background and the local Hubble constant, though modelling of the lenses is a source of significant systematic uncertainty.

This approach combines data on e^+e^- annihilation into hadrons, perturbative QCD and lattice QCD results for the first derivative of the electromagnetic current correlator at zero momentum transfer, Π_ EM^'(0). The idea {{is based on the}} observation that, in the relevant kinematic domain, the integration kernel K(s), entering the formula relating a_μ^ hvp to e^+e^- annihilation data, behaves like 1 /s times a very smooth function of s, the squared energy. We find an expression for a_μ in terms of Π_ EM^'(0), which can be calculated in lattice QCD.

40|$|We {{find new}} sum rules between direct CP asymmetries in D meson decays with {{coefficients}} {{that can be}} determined from a global fit to branching ratio data. Our sum rules eliminate the penguin topologies P and PA, which cannot be determined from branching ratios. In this way we can make predictions about direct CP asymmetries in the standard model without ad hoc assumptions on the sizes of penguin diagrams. We consistently include first-order SU(3) _F breaking in the topological amplitudes extracted from the branching ratios. By confronting our sum rules with future precise data from LHCb and Belle II one will identify or constrain new-physics contributions to P or PA.

40|$|Binary {{black hole}} (BBH) mergers provide a prime source for {{current and future}} {{interferometric}} GW observatories. Massive BBH mergers may often take place in plasma-rich environments, leading to the exciting possibility of a concurrent electromagnetic (EM) signal observable by traditional astronomical facilities. However, many critical questions about the generation of such counterparts remain unanswered. We explore mechanisms that may drive EM counterparts with magnetohydrodynamic simulations treating a range of scenarios involving equal-mass black-hole binaries immersed in an initially homogeneous fluid with uniform, orbitally aligned magnetic fields. We find that the time development of Poynting luminosity, which may drive jet-like emissions, is relatively insensitive to aspects of the initial configuration. In particular, over a significant range of initial values, the central magnetic field strength is effectively regulated by the gas flow to yield a Poynting luminosity of 10 ^ 45 - 10 ^ 46 ρ_- 13 M_ 8 ^ 2 erg s^- 1, with BBH mass scaled to M_ 8 ≡ M/(10 ^ 8 M_) and ambient density ρ_- 13 ≡ρ/(10 ^- 13 g cm^- 3).

40|$|Abridged) In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{compilation}} of results from our most advanced neutron star merger simulations, including {{a description of the}} employed numerical procedures and a more complete overview over a large number of computed models. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were done with a code based on the Piecewise Parabolic Method with up to five levels of nested Cartesian grids. The simulations are basically Newtonian, but gravitational-wave emission and the corresponding back-reaction are taken into account. The use of a physical nuclear equation of state allows us to follow the thermodynamic history of the stellar medium and to compute the energy and lepton number loss due to the emission of neutrinos. The computed models differ concerning the neutron star masses and mass ratios, the neutron star spins, the numerical resolution expressed by the cell size of the finest grid and the number of grid levels, and the calculation of the temperature from the solution of the entropy equation instead of the energy equation. Our simulations show that the details of the gravitational-wave emission are still sensitive to the numerical resolution, even in our highest-quality calculations. The amount of mass which can be ejected from neutron star mergers depends strongly on the angular momentum of the system. Our results do not support the initial conditions of temperature and proton-to-nucleon ratio assumed in recent work for producing a solar r-process pattern for nuclei around and above the A approx 130 peak. The improved models confirm our previous conclusion that gamma-ray bursts are not powered by neutrino emission during the dynamical phase of the merging of two neutron stars.

We confirm that the previously reported warp in the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~ 5 deg from the main disk. The main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 AU, but the southwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~ 1 AU over the same region. Both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but not collinear, from 80 to 150 AU. Within ~ 120 AU of the star, the main disk is ~ 50 % thinner than previously reported. The surface-brightness profiles along {{the spine of the}} main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between 40 and 250 AU, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 AU are fitted with single power laws. These discrepancies suggest that the two disks have different grain compositions or size distributions. The F 606 W/F 435 W and F 814 W/F 435 W flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetric about both projected axes of the disk. Within ~ 120 AU, the m_F 435 W-m_F 606 W and m_F 435 W-m_F 814 W colors along the spine of the main disk are ~ 10 % and ~ 20 % redder, respectively, than those of Beta Pic. These colors increasingly redden beyond ~ 120 AU, becoming 25 % and 40 % redder, respectively, than the star at 250 AU. We compare the observed red colors within ~ 120 AU with the simulated colors of non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^- 3 and different compositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. The observed colors are consistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomical silicate and/or graphite with sizes > 0. 15 - 0. 20 um, but the colors are inconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities > 90 %.
