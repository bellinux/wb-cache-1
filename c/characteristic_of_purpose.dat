40|$|The {{development}} of purpose-built office market in Malaysia is basically {{determined by a}} supply-demand market. Since the purpose built office market in Malaysia has shown positive developments and increasing level of competitiveness, many building and locational characteristics have emerged and become important {{during the process of}} assessment of the office property involving property market appraisal and building performance evaluation. With these characteristics, property market participants can evaluate their property efficiently based on their needs such as for investment, management, or business planning. Recently, many new <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> built office have also been revealed according to technology growth and national policy such as green technology, green building index classification, energy saving and sustainable development. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> this paper is to identify the existing <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> built office in Malaysia and discuss the importance <b>of</b> these <b>characteristics.</b> Integral to achieving this objective, research on purpose built office characteristics in a global and local context will also be reviewed.

40|$|Geographic Information System (GIS) {{provides}} good spatial data. Using map as a {{main feature}} helps to capture, analyse, manage, as well as present geographic location data. Many location analysis techniques, including GIS, have developed, mainly on a specific field. In order to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> locational <b>characteristics</b> on a commercial building such as purpose-built office (PBO), GIS application is needed. Combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and GIS provide an effective evaluation whereby the needs of property market participants on purpose built offices can be fulfilled. AHP is a method that specialises in identifying the importance <b>of</b> any locational <b>characteristics</b> on commercial building from the tenants or occupiers perception. Thus, integration from AHP and GIS will capture the subjective {{as well as the}} objective locational quality of PBO in terms of their commercial aspects. The evaluation index system which is Locational Quality Index (LQI) has been set up through locational <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> built office, namely the location of the commercial features, availability of transport options, transportation/ parking distance, vehicle flow, efficiency of property market. Supported by GIS improves AHP in evaluating the quality <b>of</b> locational <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> PBO which matches the need of commercial property market participants. ...|$|R

An algorithm based on kruskal method is introduced to construct cycling network.

A short-time traffic assignment is also proposed considering some trips do not always arrive at a destination within the same time class and link into the next phase. Also, sequential short-time modal split must consider traffic conditions of each time class. Therefore, joint modal split and assignment model is constructed. In these models, time distributions and trip-length are required.

Our definition includes multipurpose and single-purpose technologies, defining {{them according to}} their micro-technological characteristics, not their macro-economic effects. Identifying technologies as GPTs requires recognizing their evolutionary nature, and accepting possible uncertainties concerning marginal cases. Many of the existing ‘tests’ of whether particular technologies are GPTs are based on misunderstandings either of what GPT theory predicts or what such tests can establish. The development of formal GPT theories is outlined, showing that only the early theories predicted the inevitability of GPT-induced showdown and surges. More recent GPT theories, designed to model the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> GPTs, do not imply the necessity of specific macro effects. We show that GPTs can rejuvenate the growth process without causing slowdowns or surges. We conclude that existing criticisms of GPT theory can be resolved and that the concept remains useful for economic theory...|$|R

The researcher utilized two primary sources of data, (1) an autobiographical, qualitative survey, and (2) individual in-depth, semi-structured interviews. As a secondary source, the researcher used academic documents to provide context for student success in the program. The internal <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> and a future (demonstrated in participants’ determination, identity, and responsibility) proved to be most protective for participants’ resiliency.
