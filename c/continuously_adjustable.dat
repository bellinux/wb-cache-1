This approach presents an interaction and representation scheme for the visualization and exploration of complex hierarchical graphs to analyze relations within software systems. Thereby aggregated parts of the software system are represented as Treemaps that visualize the structure of the contained software entities. An adaption of existing rectangle-based treemap algorithms for layouts within convex polygonal bounding geometries is introduced to allow for a differentiation of various entity types in the graph visualization. Furthermore, a visual clustering method based on implicit surfaces is presented to create meaningful visualizations of distorted hierarchical graphs of software systems...|$|R

50|$|For {{high quality}} {{rotating}} drive systems plunger motors are generally used.

For a <b>continuously</b> <b>adjustable</b> swept volume, axial piston motors are used.PISTON TYPE.— Like piston (reciprocating) type pumps, the most common design of the piston type of motor is the axial. This type of motor is the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. These motors are, like their pump counterparts, available in both variable and fixed displacement designs. Typical usable (within acceptable efficiency) rotational speeds range from below 50 rpm to above 14000 rpm. Efficiencies and minimum/maximum rotational speeds are highly dependent on the design of the rotating group, and many different types are in use..|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) {{introduced}} the series production version of PRE-SCAN, {{but with a}} stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 kph mph, and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the wheel damping is now <b>continuously</b> <b>adjustable,</b> the spring strut response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced.

5000|$|Starks {{claimed that}} Nishika {{also made a}} 3 lens camera, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that such a camera ever existed outside his article. It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", <b>continuously</b> <b>adjustable</b> aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E
