The participants {{were divided into two}} groups: one half received traditional classroom training with visual aids; and the other half were trained using a 3 D immersive VR power-wall. The results showed that the VR training provides advantage for specific site activities – e.g. stone <b>cladding</b> <b>work</b> and for cast-in-situ concrete work – but not for general site safety. It was also found that generally the VR training is more effective that the traditional classroom in maintaining the trainees’ attention and concentration.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the hot forging of multi-material <b>cladded</b> <b>work</b> pieces using {{upsetting}} tests. Thecase study corresponds to {{gas metal arc welding}} cladding of a SS 316 L on a mild steel (C 15). Experimentaltests and simulations using a slab model and the finite element method were performed using differenttemperatures and die/billet tribological conditions. As a result, a crack mode, specific to clad billets, wasobserved experimentally and can be predicted by the FE method using a Latham and Cockcroft criterion. The material distribution was well simulated by the FE method; in particular, the effects of the frictionat die/work piece interface on the crack occurrence, the material distribution and, to a lesser extent,the forging load are well predicted. However, the latter was underestimated, highlighting the fact thatthe effect of the dilution associated with the cladding process on the material behavior of the clad layercannot be neglected...|$|R
40|$|Weld {{cladding}} {{is employed}} {{to improve the}} service life of engineering components by increasing corrosion and wear resistance and reducing the cost. The acceptable multi-bead cladding layer depends on single bead geometry. Hence, in first step, the relationship between input process parameters and the single bead geometry is studied and in second step a comprehensive study on multi bead clad layer deposition is carried out. This paper highlights an experimental study carried out to get single layer cladding deposited by automated GMAW process and to find the possibility of hot forming of the <b>cladded</b> <b>work</b> piece to get the final hot formed improved structure. The experiments for single bead were conducted by varying the three main process parameters wire feed rate, arc voltage and welding speed while keeping other parameters like nozzle to work distance, shielding gas and its flow rate and torch angle constant. The effect of bead spacing and torch orientation on the cladding quality of single layer {{from the results of}} single bead deposition was studied.

On 20 June, Wang Yaping delivered a remote video lecture from orbit to students across China, demonstrating physics in microgravity with her colleagues. On 24 June, CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping contacted the astronauts via remote video link to congratulate them. After a series of successful docking tests, Shenzhou 10 undocked and returned safely to Earth on 26 June 2013. With a duration of 15 days, Shenzhou 10 was China's longest manned space mission, until Shenzhou 11's 30 day mission to Tiangong-2 in 2016.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is {{to build on the}} results {{reported}} in the M 2 milestone M 2 FT 13 PN 0805051, document number FCRD-USED- 2013 - 000151 (Hanson, 2013). In that work, it was demonstrated that unirradiated samples of zircaloy- 4 cladding could be pre-hydrided at temperatures below 400 °C in pure hydrogen gas and that the growth of hydrides on the surface could be controlled by changing the surface condition of the samples and form a desired hydride rim on the outside diameter of the <b>cladding.</b> The <b>work</b> performed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since the issuing of the M 2 milestone has focused its efforts to optimize the formation of a hydride rim on available zircaloy- 4 cladding samples by controlling temperature variation and gas flow control during pre-hydriding treatments. Surface conditioning of the outside surface was also examined as a variable. The results of test indicate that much of the variability in the hydride thickness is due to temperature variation occurring in the furnaces as well as how hydrogen gas flows across the sample surface. Efforts to examine other alloys, gas concentrations, and different surface conditioning plan to be pursed in the next FY as more cladding samples become availabl...|$|R

Such parts as frames, joints or buckets can be renewed to an excellent standard using insitu technologies. In-situ renovation technology is itself a non-conventional operation, even though the techniques of turning and installation are relatively well studied and developed. Conversely, build-up welding processes can be studied further and potentially substituted by more advanced and economically more viable, modern surface-renovation technologies. Emphasis will be placed on cladding technologies. By examining the literature, {{the objective is to}} identify and justify the most appropriate surface-coating technology. The best results were achieved by Gas metal arc welding, Plasma arc welding and Laser <b>cladding</b> technologies. Experimental <b>work</b> will follow for these three technologies...|$|R
40|$|Conditions were {{optimized}} {{for the first}} plant-scale dissolution of an aluminum-containing nuclear material without using mercury as a catalyst. This nuclear material was a homogeneous mixture of plutonium oxide and aluminum metal that had been compounded for use as the core matrix in Mark 42 nuclear fuel. Because this material had later failed plutonium distribution specifications, it was rejected {{for use in the}} fabrication of Mark 42 fuel tubes, and was stored at the Savannah River Site (SRS) awaiting disposition. This powder-like material was composed of a mixture of approximately 80 percent aluminum and 11 percent plutonium. Historically, aluminum-clad spent nuclear fuels [13] have been dissolved using a mercuric nitrate catalyst in a nitric acid (HNO 3) solution to facilitate the dissolution of the bulk aluminum <b>cladding.</b> Developmental <b>work</b> at SRS indicated that the plutonium oxide/aluminum compounded matrix could be dissolved without mercury. Various mercury-free conditions were studied to evaluate the rate of dissolution of the Mark 42 compact material and to assess the corrosion rate to the stainless steel dissolver. The elimination of mercury from the dissolution process fit with waste minimization and industrial hygiene goals to reduce the use of mercury in the United States. The mercury-free dissolution technology was {{optimized for}} Mark 42 compact material in laboratory-scale tests, and successfully implemented at the plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} grain size in wrought Alloy 718 and Waspaloy on the wear of {{cemented}} carbide tools was examined {{by measuring the}} progression of wear in a specific transverse turning operation. Work material with different microstructure was achieved through heat treatments of the material from a single batch, for each alloy. The worn cutting tools were analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis to study the wear mechanism. The grain size of the work material in relation to undeformed chip thickness is found to control the depth of cut (DOC) notch wear, which is the tool life limiting factor when machining the work material with large grain size. The adhesive wear is shown to dominate on the rake face, but this wear is not tool life limiting since the <b>cladding</b> of <b>work</b> material to the tool surface basically protects the tool from further wear. Concerning the flank wear, machining of Waspaloy is associated with less such wear than machining of Alloy 718 irrespective of grain size. The analysis shows that higher cutting forces and expected cutting resistance due to higher work to fracture cannot explain the difference in flank wear. Instead, from {{the analysis of the}} oxidized surface below the flank wear it is supposed that the difference in tribological conditions is an important factor for flank wear development...|$|R
40|$|The bottom {{cladding}} {{design of}} semipolar III-nitride laser diodes {{is limited by}} stress relaxation via misfit dislocations that form via the glide of pre-existing threading dislocations (TDs), whereas the top cladding {{is limited by the}} growth time and temperature of the p-type layers. These design limitations have individually been addressed by using limited area epitaxy (LAE) to block TD glide in n-type AlGaN bottom cladding layers and by using transparent conducting oxide (TCO) top cladding layers to reduce the growth time and temperature of the p-type layers. In addition, a TCO-based top cladding should have significantly lower resistivity than a conventional p-type (Al) GaN top <b>cladding.</b> In this <b>work,</b> LAE and indium-tin-oxide cladding layers are used simultaneously in a (202 ⎯⎯ 1) III-nitride laser structure.

40|$|A thick {{metallic}} coating that is resistant against high loading impact, severe wear and corrosion at high temperatures {{can be produced}} through the laser <b>clad</b> method. This <b>work</b> introduces the Orientation Imagining Microscopy based on electron backscatter diffraction in a scanning electron microscope as a very powerful instrument for studying relationships between processing parameters and the microstructure of individual laser tracks and final coatings formed by overlap. The study has been performed on thick (similar to 1 mm) Co-based coatings prepared by a 2 kW CW Nd:YAG laser cladding on 42 CrMo 4 steel substrate using Substantially different laser beam scanning speeds. OIM provides {{new insights into the}} microstructure of laser clad coatings and yields very useful information concerning the directional grow of individual grains, the solidification texture and the shape of solidification front during laser cladding.

40|$|The efforts {{represent}} the {{concerns for the}} basic understanding of the weldability and fabricability of the advanced high temperature alloys so necessary to affect increases in {{the efficiency of the}} next generation Fossil Energy Power Plants. The effort was divided into three tasks with the first effort dealing with the welding and fabrication behavior of 310 HCbN (HR 3 C), the second task details the studies aimed at understanding the weldability of a newly developed 310 TaN high temperature stainless (a modification of 310 stainless) and Task 3 addressed the cladding of austenitic tubing with Iron-Aluminide using the GTAW process. Task 1 consisted of microstructural studies on 310 HCbN {{and the development of a}} Tube Weldability test which has applications to production welding techniques as well as laboratory weldability assessments. In addition, the evaluation of ex-service 310 HCbN which showed fireside erosion and cracking at the attachment weld locations was conducted. Task 2 addressed the behavior of the newly developed 310 TaN modification of standard 310 stainless steel and showed that the weldability was excellent and that the sensitization potential was minimal for normal welding and fabrication conditions. The microstructural evolution during elevated temperature testing was characterized and the second phase particles evolved upon aging were identified. Task 3 details the investigation undertaken to clad 310 HCbN tubing with Iron Aluminide and developed welding conditions necessary to provide a crack free <b>cladding.</b> The <b>work</b> showed that both a preheat and a post-heat was necessary for crack free deposits and the effect of a third element on the cracking potential was defined together with the effect of the aluminum level for optimum weldability...|$|R
60|$|Later, {{the ladies}} brought Jeff {{with them when}} they came to Westover's studio, and the painter {{perceived}} that they were very good friends, as if they must have met several times since he had seen them together. He interested himself in the growing correctness of Jeff's personal effect. During his Freshman year, while the rigor of the unwritten Harvard law yet forbade him a silk hat or a cane, he had kept something of the boy, if not the country boy. Westover had noted that he had always rather a taste for clothes, but in this first year he did not get beyond a derby-hat and a sack-coat, varied toward the end by a cutaway. In the outing dress he wore at home he was always effective, but there was something in Jeff's figure which did not lend itself to more formal fashion; something of herculean proportion which would have marked him of a classic beauty perhaps if he had not been in clothes at all, or of a yeomanly vigor and force if he had been <b>clad</b> for <b>work,</b> but which seemed to threaten the more worldly conceptions of the tailor with danger. It {{was as if he were}} about to burst out of his clothes, not because he wore them tight, but because there was somehow more of the man than the citizen in him; something native, primitive, something that Westover could not find quite a word for, characterized him physically and spiritually. When he came into the studio after these delicate ladies, the robust Jeff Durgin wore a long frockcoat, with a flower in his button-hole, and in his left hand he carried a silk hat turned over his forearm as he must have noticed people whom he thought stylish carrying their hats. He had on dark-gray trousers and sharp-pointed enamelled-leather shoes; and Westover grotesquely reflected that he was dressed, as he stood, to lead Genevieve Vostrand to the altar.|$|R
40|$|Direct metal {{deposition}} (DMD) is {{a leading}} process for rapid prototyping of close dimensional objects by cladding a surface layer of intermediate thickness strongly bonded to a substrate. DMD {{can be used as}} a potential technique for laser cladding of steel on copper substrate to be used in high pressure die casting application. Properties of the laser cladding steel on copper should be well studied before its application in high pressure and temperature environment. When H 13 tool steel is deposited on high strength copper alloy, the characteristics of the clad depend on the DMD process parameters. Precise selection of the parameters like laser power and powder mass flow rate can improve the properties of the <b>clad.</b> In this <b>work,</b> effect of laser power and powder mass flow rate on the hardness and micro structure has been examined. The micro hardness measurement across the interface of the clad and substrate shows significant variation with changing laser power and powder mass flow rate. Hardness variation is also observed between the top surface and cross section surface. Results show high level of reduction of hardness in the heat affected zone (HAZ) in the substrate.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the fuel cladding in present and future nuclear fuel concepts is critical for the safe perfor-mance of the power plants. The material performance of 15 - 15 Ti (1. 4970) thin walled fuel cladding tubes are presently being evaluated in the EERA JPNM pilot project TASTE. The TASTE objectives are to compare existing testing methodologies for claddings and to determine the tensile and creep properties of the 15 - 15 Ti (1. 4970) steel in the final product form. In this paper the small punch (SP) test technique is assessed in more detail for testing the 24 % cold <b>worked</b> <b>cladding</b> provided by SCK·CEN. The SP test results are compared with results from tensile (axial) tube tests and ring tension (hoop) tests. It is shown that the SP tensile test can produce robust estimates on the tensile strength in the temperature range from room temperature to 800 °C. The presented equation for transfering maximum force to engineering stress is shown to work for all the three test set-ups of the participating laboratories. For creep it is shown that the SP tests do not provide comparable results to internal pressure of classical creep test due to low creep ductility and premature creep cracking already at low deflections imposed at by the testing technique.

40|$|Laser {{cladding}} is {{an effective}} technique to coat a metallic substrate {{with a layer of}} a different nature. It has been widely reported that the most important combined parameters controlling the quality ofthe coating are the specific energy (E) and the powder density (). In the present <b>work,</b> <b>clad</b> depositsof Ti 6 Al 4 V + 60 wt. % TiC were prepared on a Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate using an optimum combination ofEc= 24 J/mm 2 and c= 3 mg/mm 2. These experiments were performed using a laser power of 400 and 600 W, in order to study the effect of laser power on the properties of the clad. The microstructure, phasecomposition and nanohardness of the coatings were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning elec-tron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. During laser processing, TiC can be partially converted to TiCX(X = 0. 5) due mainly to the TiC dissolution into the laser-generated melting pool and subsequent precipi-tation during cooling. It was observed that the lower laser power limit reduces primary TiC dissolution butit also promotes secondary carbide alignment at the interface. On the other hand, the damage mechanisminduced by high laser power is dominated by primary TiC particle cracking by the high stress concentra-tion at the particle¿matrix interface followed by ductile failure of the matrix. It is also remarkable thatirradiance affects the TiC/TiCxratio despite Ecand care fixed and it determines hardness distributioninside the coating. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{resistant}} surfaces {{with high}} toughness and impact resistant properties {{are to be}} created to improve the life cycle cost of brake discs for trains. A potential solution to this industrial problem is to use an arc <b>cladding</b> process. This <b>work</b> describes the application of {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW) for a structural ceramic Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) on steel. The structure of the two ceramics examined indicates the possibility of development of a wear resistant surface, which would extend the life of the brake disc. Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Tungsten Carbide (WC) ceramics were studied to embed them in a steel matrix by an advanced GTAW method. WC particles penetrated the liquid weld pool and also partially dissolved in the steel matrix, whereas, SiC because of the physical properties never penetrated deeper into the weld pool but segregated on the surface. Successful embedding and bonding of WC led to the decision to exercise an in-depth analysis of the bonding between the WC particles and the matrix. Chemical analysis of the matrix revealed more WC dissolution as compared to particle form within the clad. It was observed that WC reinforcement particles built a strong chemical bond with the steel matrix. This was shown by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The hard clad layer composed of WC reinforced steel matrix gave an matching friction coefficient to high-strength steel in cold wear conditions through Pin-on-Disc wear and friction testing. A prototype railway brake disc was created with the established GTAW parameters to find out the difficulties of producing industrial scale components...|$|R
5000|$|Within Ginsweiler’s own {{municipal}} area, no prehistoric archaeological ﬁnds {{are thus}} far known, but as witnessed by those unearthed in neighbouring places, human beings were already {{living in the}} area in prehistoric times. That the immediate area was settled in Gallo-Roman times might be proved by a piece of spolia that is today part of a wall in a building at the Naumburgerhof. Moreover, unearthed in 1833, during building work on a house, were a Roman relief and two lions. These ﬁnds were described by the Odenbach pastor Philipp Wilbrand Jakob Müller as follows: “A 3¾-foot-tall tableau chiselled out of ﬁne sandstone; showing three well <b>worked,</b> <b>clad</b> human ﬁgures, not hewn into the stone, but rather standing out in a statuelike way, the middle ﬁgure was missing its head, which was broken off at the torso. It must, given the clothing and the whole composition, be explained as a female person, a mother who carries and leads her children with devoted love. On her left arm sits a small child wrapped in a cloth folded over and over. The child’s head is likewise broken off at the torso. With the hand hanging down on the right side, the ﬁgure leads a lad briskly and ably walking behind. A male lion broken into two pieces, about half life size, lying, resting on his forelegs, holding a sheep’s head between them.

40|$|Clad pipes {{are used}} in the oil and gas {{industry}} for transportation of corrosive substances. Maintenance, repairs and tie-in connections to existing subsea structures is done by hyperbaric welding. There is per today no repair contingency available for clad pipes, so that a knowledge basis must be established in order to maintain pipeline integrity. Welding of clad pipes can result in a variety of complex microstructures due to the presence of dissimilar alloys. The difference in chemical composition and thermal properties will influence the integrity of the welded joint, and may result in a crack susceptible microstructure. Previous work has shown that carbon migration and subsequent carbide precipitation in the clad, mainly during production, results in a hardened region in the clad. After welding, this region is susceptible to cracking. However, adding a Ni-interlayer between the clad and base metal (BM) provides a solution to the cracking related to the formation of a hard zone in the clad. Nevertheless, cracks may also arise from hydrogen charging from welding or from cathodic protection (CP) or H 2 S during service, so that the cold cracking mechanisms of clad pipes is still highly relevant. In this master s thesis, clad pipes with and without a Ni-interlayer have been investigated. The dissimilar interface region and carbides in the clad adjacent to the interface have been investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The clad immediately adjacent to the interface contained Cr 23 C 6 carbides, present both inside grains and at grain boundaries. The dissimilar interface showed a jagged distribution of Ni towards the clad side and segregation of Cr to carbides. The dissimilar interface showed a lath-like structure, however, there was no clear evidence of martensite. This should be further investigated. Slow strain rate (SSR) testing was successfully performed on miniature compact tension (CT) specimens in air and under CP to evaluate the fracture mechanical properties of the dissimilar interface, with respect to material combination and environment. Generally, samples without a Ni-interlayer tested in air showed the highest fracture toughness values, followed by samples with a Ni-interlayer tested in both air and under CP. The lowest fracture toughness values were obtained for samples without a Ni-interlayer tested under CP. Samples with a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 7 % in the presence of hydrogen. The minute effect of hydrogen is attributed to the samples failing mainly in the softer Ni-interlayer close to the BM, which has low susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Samples without a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 77 % in the presence of hydrogen. The samples failed mainly in the decarburized BM adjacent to the interface, and along the interface. None of the samples failed in the previously suspected crack susceptible region in the <b>clad.</b> Future <b>work</b> should focus on determining the mechanisms behind cracking in the clad by physical weld simulations combined with fracture mechanical testing, and numerical weld simulations to assess any residual stresses...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{analysis}} for medical diagnostics is normally {{carried out by}} trained operators in sophisticated laboratories using large instruments. These techniques are out of reach to many people living in remote areas or are too slow for critically ill patients who need urgent care. A rapid, automated, compact, low cost and disposable integrated lab on a chip device which can be operated by a minimally trained person is required {{not only for the}} detection and diagnosis of the diseases, but also for water, food and environmental safety. Optical waveguide devices allow integration of various optoelectronic and microfluidic components to help in realizing sensing of liquid analytes and require 3 - 6 orders less sample volume compared with many conventional medical tests. The mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral window covering wavelengths from 2 to 14 µm is ideal for biochemical analysis due to the fundamental fingerprint molecular absorption, and waveguide evanescent field based spectroscopy can potentially offer rapid high sensitivity, real-time measurement of complex mixtures to identify and quantify species in clinical samples for point of care diagnosis without any biomarkers. To realize such devices, mid-IR transparent chalcogenide materials are used to fabricate optical waveguides. In our previous work, we have demonstrated waveguiding in the mid-IR region using germanium telluride (GeTe 4) waveguide cores on zinc selenide (ZnSe) substrates [1]. In this work, ZnSe rib waveguides were fabricated on oxidized silicon with the dimensions shown in Fig 1 (a). ZnSe films were deposited by thermal evaporation and the ribs were fabricated using photolithography and Ar + ion-beam etching. Light from a tunable optical parametric oscillator (M-squared) operating between 2. 5 - 3. 7 µm wavelengths was butt-coupled into the waveguide using a single mode ZrF 4 fibre (core diameter ~ 9 µm) and the waveguide output was collected using a multimode InF 3 fibre (core diameter ~ 100 µm), directed onto a TE cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector (MCT, Vigo System) and recorded on a computer. After optimizing coupling into the waveguide by imaging the waveguide output using a mid-IR camera from above, as shown in Fig 1 (b), two spectral scans were recorded, one of the output power from the waveguide alone and the other with a 10 µL DI water droplet on the waveguide surface of length ~ 0. 6 cm shown in Fig 1 (c) inset. The ratio, representing the waveguide absorption spectrum of water, is plotted in Fig 1 (c) (black points) and compared with a numerical model of the water-coated waveguide (blue line) using the published complex refractive index of water [2], for a waveguide length of 0. 6 cm. These preliminary experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results. The elevated transmission in the absorption band is due to substrate radiation and the transmission above unity is due to reduction in waveguide scattering loss with the water <b>cladding.</b> Future <b>work</b> will study the absorption spectra of clinically relevant analytes.

40|$|Limited {{data has}} been {{published}} (especially on experimental work) on integrated multilayer SiC/SiC prototypical fuel <b>cladding.</b> In this <b>work</b> the mechanical performance of three unique architectures of three-layer silicon carbide (SiC) composite cladding is experimentally investigated under conditions associated {{with the loss of}} coolant accident (LOCA), and analytically under various conditions. Specifically, this <b>work</b> investigates SiC <b>cladding</b> mechanical performance after exposure to 1, 400 °C steam for 48 hours and after thermal shock induced by quenching from 1, 200 °C into either 100 °C or 90 °C water. Mechanical performance characteristics are thereafter correlated with sample architecture through void characterization and ceramography. The series with a reduced thickness did not have a pseudo-ductile regime due to overloading of the composite layer. The presence of the axial tow did not yield significant difference in the mechanical behavior most likely because samples were tested in the hoop direction. While as-received and quenched samples behaved similarly (pseudo ductile failure except for one series), non-frangible brittle failure (single-crack failure with no release of debris) was systematically observed after oxidation due to silica buildup in the inner voids of the ceramic matrix composite (CMC) layer. Overall, thermal shock had limited influence on sample mechanical characteristics and oxidation resulted in the formation of silica on the inner wall of the CMC voids leading to the weakening of the monolith matrix and brittle fracture. Stress field in the cladding design is simulated by finite element analysis under service and shutdown conditions at both the core's middle height {{and at the end of}} the fuel rod. Stresses in the fuel region are driven by the thermal gradient that creates stresses predominantly from irradiation induced swelling. At the endplug, constraints are mainly mechanical. Stress calculations show high sensitivity to the data scatter and especially swelling and thermal conductivity. No cladding with the design studied here can survive either service or shutdown conditions because of the high irradiation-induced tensile stresses that develop in the hot inner monolith layer. It is shown that this peak tensile stress can be alleviated by adjusting the swelling level of the different layers. The addition of an under-swelling material such as PyC or Si can reduce the monolith tensile stress by 10 %. With a composite that swells 10 % less than the monolith, the stress is reduced by 20 %. by Pierre Guenoun. Thesis: S.

40|$|To {{research}} {{the management of}} risk and cost in the <b>cladding</b> industry, this <b>work</b> has evaluated current practice and deficiencies, concentrating {{on the lack of}} integration or standardisation resulting in inaccurate cost estimates, unacceptable risks and loss of profit in cladding manufacture. The research presents an approach for integrating process- and technology-orientated improvements into a knowledge-based model to improve a cladding manufacturing SME’s performance. The research also presents a management method for the selection, integration, control and implementation of this approach. Controlling data transfer between systems produces a knowledge-based model, allowing cladding industry designers and estimators to take more accurate decisions, with the objective of reducing risk and improving company profitability. This model, with the addition of external supply chain elements, is a management framework, which can be termed an agile manufacturing system. The development of this framework has raised the following data certainty questions: • What is the measured uncertainty of that data? • How can the industry control and structure high data volumes transferred between systems to produce more accurate cost models? The answers to these questions were found by applying a structured methodology for the selection, integration and control of technology in the cladding industry, but involving the human factor. In this approach, the principle of entropy was adopted to measure data uncertainty. The structured methodology was made possible by a new categorisation into Innovative, Standard and Semi-Standard cladding projects. The research applied this structured methodology, combining qualitative and quantitative methods for validating assumptions, to a cladding industry SME case-study. The case-study investigated the validity of real cost and project data and calculated data uncertainty for specific projects, categorised as described, using a risk factor percentage predicted on entropy principles, based on historical data fed back from the SME’s ERP system. This risk factor approach was similar to that previously used in the insurance and banking industries. The risk percentage formulae used were based on assumptions extracted from qualitative and quantitative methods applied to the SME, its partner companies and industry specialists. Assumptions about the gross margins for UK metal cladding projects formed part of the risk percentage formulae. The results of this case-study found that gross margins varied from 5 % in standard projects to 40 % in the Innovative projects. An entropy scale was proposed as a basis for comparing risk calculation results, with the highest entropy equalling 100 %, signifying the highest risk possible. It was found that risk rises in the case-study were from 23 % for Standard to 93 % for Innovative projects. This principle of a risk factor percentage was tested in the UK cladding manufacturer SME case-study and its value to the SME was demonstrated.  EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The polarimetric assessment of the integrated transverse fiber birefringence serves as a means to gather information about both stress and strain profiles of the fiber. Birefringence is introduced in the optical fiber due to the photo-elastic effect. In this work, a highly sensitive polariscope with sub-micron resolution has been developed. The captured birefringence data has been interpreted to be basically strain and not stress-induced, which allowed the proper discrimination between an inelastic, stress-free strain contribution and a strain part essentially accompanied by elastic stress. In earlier interpretations of the polarimetric data, all birefringence had been attributed to be purely stress-induced, which excluded the existence of inelastic strain and even led to contradictory results in some cases. The reinterpretation in terms of strain, however, results in a consistent picture of both stress and strain-induced birefringence. The polariscope has been used in the following to determine radiation-induced stress changes for different optical fibers and irradiation sources. Femtosecond-laser induced core stress changes in SMF- 28 ® standard telecommunication fibers have been measured tomographically and correlated with corresponding index changes. Furthermore, stress has been correlated to the refractive index change in highly germanium-doped fibers irradiated with cw-irradiation at 244 nm. The annealing behavior of stress, strain and index in this fiber has been studied. Approximately the same linear correlation between stress and index change was found for all germanium-doped fibers under investigation. In addition, stress changes were measured for phosphorus- and nitrogen-doped fibers drawn at different tensions before and after irradiation with an ArF excimer-laser. The impact of the drawing force on fiber stress and inelastic strain anisotropy has been determined as well as radiation-induced stress modifications. The observed stress increase has been compared to those obtained for germanium-doped fibers. Atomic Force Microscopy of cleaved and subsequently etched fiber end-faces is a powerful means to gather topographic information on a nanometer scale due to differential etching of the doped core and the undoped silica <b>cladding.</b> Within this <b>work,</b> the technique has been used to acquire information about etch rate changes in fibers drawn from the same nitrogen-doped preform with different drawing conditions. Furthermore, the impact of UV-irradiation on the etch rate has been determined for phosphorus- as well as nitrogen-doped fibers. Comparison of the results, with stress measurements allowed the attribution of the etch rate changes to a modification of the color center population...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving motors and rollers which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser <b>cladding.</b> ORNL <b>worked</b> with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|R
