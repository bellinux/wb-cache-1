It was initially tuned to meantone temperament to the specification of S.S.Wesley but in 1867 W.T.Best, city organist, retuned it to equal temperament.

The studied successions include the uppermost {{part of the}} Sudr, Dakhla, and their lateral coeval Beida Formation. Biostratigraphic analysis has allowed recognition from Zone CF 2 to Zone P 4 in terms of planktonic foraminifera and from Zone <b>CC</b> 26 <b>c</b> <b>to</b> Zone NP 7 / 8 in terms of calcareous nannofossils. Maastrichtian/Palaeogene (K/Pg) boundary is characterized by an erosional surface that marks a hiatus between theSudr/Dakhla or Sudr/Beida formation boundaries, as conﬁ rmed {{by the absence of}} the planktonic foraminiferal CF 1 to P 1 a zones and their equivalent nannofossil zones (top part of <b>CC</b> 26 <b>c</b> <b>to</b> lowest part of Zone NP 3).

CC C retreated, losing 46 medium tanks, 130 vehicles and 9 self-propelled guns, narrowly regaining the position at Djebel Hamra. By the evening, Arnim had ordered three of the battle groups to head towards Sbeitla and were engaged by the remnants of CC A and CC C which were forced back. On 16 February, helped by intensive air support, they drove back the fresh Combat Command B (CC B) and entered Sbeitla.|$|R
40|$|Calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy and the paleoclimatic/paleoceanographic {{histories}} of the late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian-late Campanian) from Ninetyeast Ridge (Sites 217 and 758 A) and Mozambique Ridge (Site 249) in Indian Ocean were investigated based on the quantitative studies of calcareous nannofossils and down-core distribution patterns of several environmental variables. The cosmopolitan zonation scheme of Perch-Nielsen (1985) was used in sediment age-dating. Marker species occur continuously and relatively abundantly at three sites. Five zones (<b>CC</b> 22 <b>to</b> <b>CC</b> 26) were identified at Sites 217 and 758 A. Site 249 contains five zones (<b>CC</b> 19 <b>to</b> <b>CC</b> 23). Diagenetic alteration and bottom current effects are minor or negligible in most of samples from these sites. ^ Site 249 was characterized by relatively minor dissolution, low productivity, and unstable surface water conditions in Zones CC 19 and CC 20. Zones CC 21 and CC 22 (late Campanian) was characterized by stable surface water conditions. Bottom water became less corrosive from Zone <b>CC</b> 19 <b>to</b> <b>CC</b> 22 (early <b>to</b> late Campanian). The late Campanian at Sites 217 and 758 A is characterized by lower species diversity and less stable surface water conditions than the Maastrichtian. The Maastrichtian at both sites shows greater species diversity and stable open oceanic conditions. At Site 217, the bottom water becomes less corrosive from Subzone <b>CC</b> 22 <b>c</b> <b>to</b> Subzone <b>CC</b> 23 a. At Site 758 A, no changes of bottom water occur from Subzone <b>CC</b> 22 b <b>to</b> the 360 mbsf (upper part of CC 23 and CC 22 c+CC 22 b). The corrosiveness of bottom water increases from Subzone <b>CC</b> 23 b <b>to</b> the top of Maastrichtian at both sites. ^ Greater species diversity occurs during warm climatic conditions. The surface water temperature becomes warm from Zone <b>CC</b> 19 <b>to</b> the middle of Zone CC 22. Then, surface water temperatures cooled {{from the middle of}} Zone <b>CC</b> 22 <b>to</b> Zone <b>CC</b> 23 at Site 249. At Sites 217 and 758 A, the early late Campanian was characterized by cool surface water temperatures compared to late late Campanian and Maastrichtian. The surface water temperatures cooled from Subzone CC 23 b through the Maastrichtian at three sites. This early Maastrichtian cooling event occurred globally by the comparison with several previous workers. Cooling started at (or near) the last appearance datum (LAD) of Aspidolithus parcus constrictus. ...|$|R
