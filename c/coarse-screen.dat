40|$|In the Joint Center for Structural Genomics, {{one-dimensional}} (1 D) 1 H NMR spectroscopy {{is routinely}} used {{to characterize the}} folded state of protein targets and, thus, serves to guide subsequent crystallization efforts and to identify proteins for NMR structure determination. Here, we describe 1 D 1 H NMR screening {{of a group of}} 79 mouse homologue proteins, which correlates the NMR data with the outcome of subsequent crystallization experiments and crystallographic structure determination. Based on the 1 D 1 H NMR spectra, the proteins are classified into four groups, “A” to “D. ” A-type proteins are candidates for structure determination by NMR or crystallography; “B”-type are earmarked for crystallography; “C” indicates folded globular proteins with broadened line shapes; and “D” are nonglobular, “unfolded” polypeptides. The results obtained from coarse- and fine-screen crystallization trials imply that only A- and B-type proteins should be used for extensive crystallization trials in the future, with C and D proteins subjected only to <b>coarse-screen</b> crystallization trials. Of the presently studied 79 soluble protein targets, 63 % yielded A- or B-quality 1 D 1 H NMR spectra. Although similar yields of crystallization hits were obtained for all four groups, A to D, crystals from A- and B-type proteins diffracted on average to significantly higher resolution than crystals produced from C- or D-type proteins. Furthermore, the output of refined crystal structures from this test set of proteins was 4 -fold higher for A- and B-type than for C- and D-type proteins...|$|E
