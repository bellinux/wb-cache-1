5|$|<b>Clotted</b> <b>cream</b> {{can be used}} as an {{accompaniment to}} hot or cold desserts. <b>Clotted</b> <b>cream,</b> {{especially}} <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him <b>clotted</b> <b>cream.</b> He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess <b>clotted</b> <b>cream,</b> which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E

5|$|A tea shop {{is a small}} {{restaurant}} that serves soft drinks and light meals, often in a sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a cream tea or a Devonshire tea, served from a china set, and a scone with jam and <b>clotted</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been the {{practice}} for local residents in southwest England, or those on holiday, to send small tins or tubs of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> by post to friends and relations {{in other parts of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Originally made {{by farmers}} {{to reduce the}} amount of waste from their milk, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> has become so deep-rooted in the culture of {{southwest}} Britain that it is embedded as part of the region's tourist attraction. While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear of its actual antiquity, or more recent development.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford Companion to Food follows {{traditional}} folklore {{by suggesting}} {{it may have}} been introduced to Cornwall by Phoenician traders in search of tin. It is similar to kaymak (or kajmak), a Near Eastern delicacy that is made throughout the Middle East, southeast Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, India, and Turkey. A similar <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> known as 'urum'(өрөм) is also made in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} tea {{offered to the}} guests is diverse, and {{includes}} the hotel's own Dorchester Blend. The service includes a first course consisting of finger sandwiches with sliced cucumber, cream cheese, and smoked salmon, all served in silver trays, a second course consisting of scones with <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> and jam, followed by a pastry tray with a selection of freshly-made patisseries.|$|E
5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common {{variation}} is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> and adds cream to thicken.|$|E
25|$|The wet {{climate and}} {{relatively}} poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops. However, it {{is ideal for}} growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading {{to the production of}} Cornwall's other famous export, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream.</b> This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream. Cornish <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> has Protected Geographical Status under EU law, and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is A. E. Rodda & Son of Scorrier.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture, once an {{important}} part of the Cornish economy has declined significantly. However, there is still a strong dairy industry producing products such as Cornish <b>Clotted</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|E
25|$|Major {{companies}} in Cornwall include Imerys who are major producers of kaolin, Dairy Crest {{who have their}} main cheese creamery in Davidstow making Cathedral City Cheddar on the former RAF Davidstow Moor, and Ginsters have a food production plant in Callington, off the A390 between Liskeard and Tavistock. Rodda's make <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> near Scorrier, off the A30 east of Redruth. Fugro Seacore in Mongleath near Falmouth are leading offshore drilling contractors. Kensa Heat Pumps are west of Truro.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, tea is {{consumed}} daily and often {{by a majority}} of people, and indeed is perceived as one of Britain's cultural beverages. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea {{is consumed}} both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of scones, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream,</b> and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some parts of Britain, 'tea' may also refer to the evening meal.|$|E
25|$|Serbian cuisine {{is largely}} heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences. Despite this, it has evolved and {{achieved}} its own culinary identity. Food {{is very important}} in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, Turkish coffee is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it {{plays an important role in}} Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and salt to guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to <b>clotted</b> <b>cream),</b> proja (cornbread), kačamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie). Ćevapčići, caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the national dish of Serbia.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Cornwall and {{southwest}} England, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> manufacture is a cottage industry, with many farms and dairies producing cream {{for sale in}} local outlets. [...] <b>Clotted</b> <b>cream</b> is also produced in Somerset, Dorset, Herefordshire, Pembrokeshire, [...] and the Isle of Wight.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, an {{application}} {{was made for}} the name Cornish <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> to have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall. This was [...] accepted in 1998. Cornish <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum butterfat content of 55 percent. The unique, slightly yellow, Cornish <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> colour {{is due to the}} high carotene levels in the grass.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{its high}} {{saturated}} fat content, the regular consumption of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> was, until recently, {{thought to be}} bad for health, though now dairy fat in the diet, in moderation, is considered beneficial by some researchers. A 2006 survey of nutrition professionals ranked <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> as the least healthy of 120 foods selected to {{be representative of the}} British diet. According to the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, a [...] tub of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> provides , roughly equivalent to a [...] cheeseburger.|$|E
500|$|It {{has long}} been disputed whether <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> {{originated}} in Devon or Cornwall, and which county makes it the best. There {{is evidence that the}} monks of Tavistock Abbey were making <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> in the early 14th century. After their abbey had been ransacked by Vikings in 997 CE, the monks rebuilt it with the help of Ordulf, Earl of Devon. Local workers were drafted in to help with the repairs, and the monks rewarded them with bread, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream,</b> and strawberry preserves. [...] The 1658 cookery book The Compleat Cook had a recipe for [...] "clouted cream".|$|E

500|$|Although its [...] origin is uncertain, the cream's {{production}} is {{commonly associated with}} dairy farms in southwest England {{and in particular the}} counties of Cornwall and Devon. The current largest commercial producer in the UK is Rodda's at Scorrier, Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25tonnes (25,000kg; 55,000lb) of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> a day. In 1998 the term Cornish <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> became a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) by European Union directive, as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55%.|$|E
500|$|Cabbage cream (which {{does not}} contain cabbage) was a {{delicacy}} in the mid-17th century: layers of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> were interspersed with sugar and rosewater, creating a cabbage effect when served. [...] It was a common accompaniment to junket, a milk-based dessert which went out of fashion in the mid-20th century.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> {{was created}} by {{straining}} fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream {{to rise to the}} surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer. [...] By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, [...] "the separator saves a whole cow!" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} to the squab pie in England, although it traditionally includes mutton, {{it has come}} to mean a pie with many ingredients or a [...] "scraps pie". Squab pie in Devon can be served with <b>clotted</b> <b>cream.</b> Alternatively, in America, it is cooked with squab, and is synonymous with pigeon pie.|$|E
500|$|<b>Clotted</b> <b>cream</b> (sometimes called scalded, clouted, Devonshire or Cornish cream) is a thick cream made by {{indirectly}} heating full-cream cow's milk using steam or a {{water bath}} and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content {{rises to the}} surface and forms [...] "clots" [...] or [...] "clouts". It forms an essential part of a cream tea.|$|E
500|$|A pasty {{is known}} as a [...] "tiddy oggy" [...] when steak is {{replaced}} with an extra potato, [...] "tiddy" [...] meaning potato and [...] "oggy" [...] meaning pasty and was eaten when times were hard and expensive meat could not be afforded. Another traditional meatless recipe is 'herby pie' with parsley, freshly gathered wild green herbs and chives, ramsons or leeks and a spoonful of <b>clotted</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Clotted</b> <b>cream</b> is an {{essential}} part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional [...] "splits" [...] in Cornwall—with strawberry jam (other flavours are generally less acceptable), along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire Teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for [...] "Devon cream tea" [...] to have protected designation of origin similar to [...] "Cornish clotted cream". One variation on a cream tea is called [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] which consists of a round of bread topped with <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> and golden syrup, honey, or treacle.|$|E
500|$|<b>Clotted</b> <b>cream</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as having a [...] "nutty, cooked milk" [...] flavour, and a [...] "rich sweet flavour" [...] with a texture that is grainy, sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface. It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum of 55 percent, but an average of 64 percent); in the United States it would be classified as butter. For comparison, the fat content of single cream is only 18 percent.|$|E
500|$|In 1953, Britain's first celebrity chef, Philip Harben, {{published}} Traditional Dishes of Britain. Its chapter titles simply listed [...] "the stereotypical stalwarts of the British diet", from Cornish pasty and Yorkshire pudding to shortbread, Lancashire hotpot, {{steak and}} kidney pudding, jellied eels, <b>clotted</b> <b>cream</b> and fish and chips. Panayi noted that Harben began with contradictions and unsupported claims, naming Britain's supposed reputation {{for the worst}} food in the world, but claiming that the country's cooks were technically unmatched and that the repertoire of national dishes was the largest of any country's.|$|E
