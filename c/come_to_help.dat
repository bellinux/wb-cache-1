5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him finish it.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of Nestorian Christianity was somewhat {{different from that}} practiced in the West, and Europeans tended to regard Nestorianism as heretical for its beliefs {{about the nature of}} Jesus.

In this they were seconded by Mamerto Natividád and other bona fide supporters of Aguinaldo. The Bonifacio {{brothers were}} executed on May 10, 1897 in the mountains of Maragondon. Apolinario Mabini wrote that Bonifacio's death demoralized many rebels from Manila, Laguna and Batangas who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> those in Cavite, and caused them to quit.

They find that Edna and Kid had fallen in love while in jail, and afterwards married and both became much happier and friendlier since. Doc reveals his previous absence to Marty, that he had been traveling in time to compile a history of the McFly family to present to Marty as a graduation gift. Suddenly, three separate DeLoreans appear, each with a different future version of Marty driving them.

25|$|On {{the other}} side Haynau knew that if {{in the next day}} his troops will achieve a victory against the Hungarians, he will make Görgei to believe that he is {{preparing}} his main attack on the northern banks of the Danube. This is why he ordered to the IV. (reserve) corps to start a counterattack against the Hungarian troops in the next day. Csorich's II. corps and Panyutyin's division were appointed to sustain the attack of the reserve corps. Wohlgemuth ordered to his troops stationed at Sempte and Szered, to destroy the bridge between the two villages, and to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his main troops. The Panyutyin division was placed on the left flank of Wohlgemuth's IV. (reserve) corps. Wohlgemuth's main goal was to cut the retreat route of the Hungarians, and therefore units of his troops occupied the village of Királyrév, through which the main Hungarian forces could return to the bridge from Aszódpuszta.|$|E

500|$|Rupert was {{accordingly}} {{a prominent}} figure in Parliamentary propaganda. He faced numerous accusations of witchcraft, either personally or by proxy through his pet dog. Boy, sometimes called Pudel; {{a large white}} hunting poodle, accompanied Rupert everywhere from 1642 up until the dog's death at Marston Moor and was widely suspected of being a witch's familiar. There were numerous accounts of Boy's abilities; some suggested {{that he was the}} Devil in disguise, <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Rupert. Pro-Royalist publications ultimately produced parodies of these, including one which listed Rupert's dog as being a [...] "Lapland Lady" [...] transformed into a white dog; Boy was able, apparently, to find hidden treasure, possessed invulnerability to attack, could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth, and could prophesy as well as the 16th century soothsayer, Mother Shipton. Similar stories from the period relate to Rupert's pet monkey. [...] Like his dog, the monkey was featured in newsprint of the day and was also reputed to have shape shifting powers, being able to disguise itself behind enemy lines.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side, [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, always a good and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to do it for him (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, they will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E
500|$|Driving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a {{young girl}} walking towards them, and signalled Hindley to stop, which she did not do until she had passed the girl. Brady drew up {{alongside}} on his motorbike, demanding to know why she had not offered the girl a lift, to which Hindley replied that she recognised her as Marie Ruck, a near neighbour of her mother. Shortly after 8:00pm, continuing down Froxmer Street, Brady spotted a girl wearing a pale blue coat and white high-heeled shoes walking away from them, and once again signalled for the van to stop. Hindley recognised the girl as Pauline Reade, a friend of her younger sister, Maureen. Reade got into the van with Hindley, who then asked if she would mind helping to search for an expensive glove she had lost on Saddleworth Moor. Reade said she was in no great hurry, and agreed. At 16, Pauline Reade was older than Marie Ruck, and Hindley believed {{that there would be}} less of an outcry over the disappearance of a teenager than there would over a child of seven or eight. When the van reached the moor, Hindley stopped and Brady arrived shortly afterwards on his motorcycle. She introduced him to Reade as her boyfriend, and said that he had also <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> find the missing glove. Hindley claimed Brady took Reade onto the moor while Hindley waited in the van. After about 30minutes Brady returned alone, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying. Her throat had been cut twice with a large knife. The larger of these wounds was a four-inch incision across her voice box, and the collar of Reade's coat had been deliberately pushed into this wound. He told her to stay with Reade while he fetched a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit to the moor, to bury the body. Hindley noticed that [...] "Pauline's coat was undone and her clothes were in disarray... She had guessed from the time he had taken that Brady had sexually assaulted her." [...] Brady's account differed from Hindley's. He claimed that Hindley was not only there at the scene, but that she assisted him with the sexual assault on Pauline. Returning home from the moor in the van—they had loaded the motorcycle into the back—Brady and Hindley passed Reade's mother, Joan, accompanied by her son, Paul, searching the streets for Pauline.|$|E
