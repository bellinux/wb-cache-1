50|$|The {{motivation}} for this representation of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> will be explained shortly. Note that the construction can be iterated; A and B can themselves be <b>conditional</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, however, {{for events}} A and B, let the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> A → B be {{represented}} {{as the following}} infinite union of disjoint sets: ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is tempting}} to write, instead, P(A → B) = 0.24, where A → B is the <b>{{conditional}}</b> <b>event</b> [...] "If A, then B." [...] That is, given events A and B, one might posit an event, A → B, such that P(A → B) {{could be counted on}} to equal P(B|A). One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> descriptions within larger constructions. Then, for instance, one could write P(A ∪ (B → C)) = 0.51, meaning, [...] "The probability that either A, or else if B, then C, is 51%." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{right side}} of the {{equation}} is exactly the expression for the probability [...] of A → B, just defined as a union of carefully chosen disjoint sets. Thus that union can be taken to represent the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> A→ B, such that (A → B) = P(B|A) for any choice of A, B, and P. But since [...] = P over the domain of P, the hat notation is optional. So long as the context is understood (i.e., <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> algebra), one can write P(A → B) = P(B|A), with P now being the extended probability function.|$|E
5000|$|Let [...] now be {{a set of}} subsets of , which {{contains}} representations of all events in F and is otherwise just {{large enough to be}} closed under construction of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> and under the familiar Boolean operations.

40|$|This article {{begins by}} {{outlining}} {{some of the}} history—beginning with brief remarks of Quine's—of work on conditional assertions and <b>conditional</b> <b>events.</b> The upshot of the historical narrative is that diverse works from various starting points have circled around a nexus of ideas without convincingly tying them together.

50|$|In {{order to}} make an {{efficient}} use of the signaling messages, {{it is also possible}} to establish a limited notification rate (not real-time notifications) through a mechanism called event throttling.

50|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>event</b> algebras {{circumvent}} the obstacle identified by Lewis {{by using a}} nonstandard domain of objects. Instead of being members of a set F of subsets of some universe set Ω, the canonical objects are normally higher-level constructions of members of F. The most natural construction, and historically the first, uses ordered pairs of members of F. Other constructions use sets of members of F or infinite sequences of members of F.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> algebra (CEA) is an {{algebraic}} structure whose domain {{consists of}} logical objects described by statements of forms such as [...] "If A, then B," [...] "B, given A," [...] and [...] "B, in case A."

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{concepts}} of partial and complete logical dependence among <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> are studied and a comparison is made with some definitions given by other authors. Then, some logical and probabilistic relations are considered {{in the framework of}} coherent probabilistic assessments. A particular class of logically dependent <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> is considered and, based on some results on coherence of precise and imprecise probability assessments, the probabilistic relations implied by logical dependence are studied. It is shown that logical dependence does not necessarily imply probabilistic relations. Finally, given two logically independent events, we examine the coherence of some probability assessments which are relevant to the property of stochastic independence...|$|R
40|$|Various {{semantics}} {{for studying}} the square of opposition and the hexagon of opposition have been proposed recently. We interpret sentences by imprecise (set-valued) probability assessments on a finite sequence of <b>conditional</b> <b>events.</b> We introduce the acceptability of a sentence within coherence-based probability theory. We analyze the relations of the square and of the hexagon in terms of acceptability. Then, we show how to construct probabilistic versions of the square and of the hexagon of opposition by forming suitable tripartitions of the set of all coherent assessments on a finite sequence of <b>conditional</b> <b>events.</b> Finally, as an application, we present new versions of the square and of the hexagon involving generalized quantifiers...|$|R

40|$|Conditionals {{are central}} to inference. Before people can draw inferences about a natural {{language}} conditional, they must interpret its meaning. We investigated interpretation of uncertain conditionals using a probabilistic truth table task, focussing on (i) <b>conditional</b> <b>event,</b> (ii) material conditional, and (iii) conjunction interpretations. The order of object (shape) and feature (color) in each conditional’s antecedent and consequent was varied between participants. The <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> was the dominant interpretation, followed by conjunction, and took longer to process than conjunction (mean difference 500 ms). Material conditional responses were rare. The proportion of <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> responses increased from around 40 % {{at the beginning of}} the task to nearly 80 % at the end, with 55 % of participants showing a qualitative shift of interpretation. Shifts to the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> occurred later in the feature-object order than in the object-feature order. We discuss the results in terms of insight and suggest implications for theories of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{revision}} strategy of revis-ing a conditional probabilistic logic program (PLP) when new infor-mation is received (which {{is in the form}} of probabilistic formulae), through the technique of variable forgetting. We first extend the tra-ditional forgetting method to forget a <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> in PLPs. We then propose two revision operators to revise a PLP based on our for-getting method. By revision through forgetting, the irrelevant knowl-edge in the original PLP is retained according to the minimal change principle. We prove that our revision operators satisfy most of the postulates for probabilistic belief revision. A main advantage of our revision operators is that a new PLP is explicitly obtained after re-vision, since our revision operator performs forgetting a <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> at the syntax level. ...|$|E
40|$|Ad hoc {{techniques}} and inference methods used in expert systems are often logically inconsistent. On the other hand, among properties and assertions concerning handling of uncertainty, those which {{turns out to}} be well founded can be in general easily deduced from probability laws. Relying on the general concept of event as a proposition and starting from a few <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> of initial interest, a gradual and coherent assignment of conditional probabilities is possible by resorting to de Finetti's theory of coherent extension of subjective probability. Moreover, even when numerical probabilities can be easily assessed, a more general approach is obtained introducing an ordering among <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> by means of a coherent qualitative probability...|$|R
40|$|Any dynamic {{decision}} {{model or}} procedure for acquisition of knowledge {{must deal with}} <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> and should refer to (not necessarily structured) domains containing only the elements and the information of interest. We consider conditional possibility theory as numerical reference model to handle uncertainty and to study binary relations, defined on an arbitrary set of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> expressing the idea of "no more possible than". We give the necessary conditions for the representability of a relation by a T-conditional possibility, for any triangular norm T, and we provide a complete characterization in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions for the representability by a conditional possibility (i. e. when T is the minimum) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} stable {{coherence}} has been recently introduced to characterize coherent assignments to <b>conditional</b> many-valued <b>events</b> {{by means of}} hyperreal-valued states. In a nutshell, an assignment, or book, β on a finite set of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> is stably coherent if there exists a coherent variant β of β such that β maps all antecedents of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> to a strictly positive hyperreal number, and such that β and β differ by an infinitesimal. In this paper, we provide a characterization of stable coherence in terms of layers of zero probability for books on Łukasiewicz logic events. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{how people}} interpret conditionals and how stable their interpretation is {{over a long}} series of trials. Participants were shown the colored patterns on each side of a six-sided die, and were asked how sure they were that a conditional holds of the side landing upwards when the die is randomly thrown. Participants were presented with 71 trials consisting of all combinations of binary dimensions of shape (e. g., circles and squares) and color (e. g., blue and red) painted onto the sides of each die. In two experiments (N 1 = 66, N 2 = 65), the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> was the dominant interpretation, followed by conjunction, and material conditional responses were negligible. In both experiments, the percentage of participants giving a <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> response increased from around 40 % {{at the beginning of the}} task to nearly 80 % at the end, with most participants shifting from a conjunction interpretation. The shift was moderated by the order of shape and color in each conditional’s antecedent and consequent: participants were more likely to shift if the antecedent referred to a color. In Experiment 2 we collected response times: <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> interpretations took longer to process than conjunction interpretations (mean difference 500 ms).

40|$|Dividend {{payments}} to shareholders can create conflicts between debt and equity investors as these payments can expropriate wealth from bondholders to shareholders. However, dividend payments can {{also serve as}} a signal regarding firms' future earnings. Utilizing both improved bond event study techniques as well as a <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> study model to control for self-selection and the presence of confounding earnings announcements, I find that, on net, dividend increases represent a transfer of wealth from debtholders to shareholders. Nevertheless, bondholders react more favorably to larger dividend changes consistent with the presence of a positive signaling effect. The <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> study approach also provides the ability to test whether managerial hesitancy in cutting dividends may represent an additional source of expropriation. My results indicate that while bondholders are clearly harmed by these implicit dividend increases, evidence in support of shareholders' gains is mixed...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} algebraic {{concepts of}} quantum mechanics, as expressed by many authors, are reviewed and translated into {{the framework of}} the relatively new non-distributive system of Boolean fractions (also called conditional events or conditional propositions). This system of ordered pairs (A|B) of events A, B, can express all of the non-Boolean aspects of quantum logic without having to resort to a more abstract formulation like Hilbert space. Such notions as orthogonality, superposition, simultaneous verifiability, compatibility, orthoalgebras, orthocomplementation, modularity, and the Sasaki projection mapping are translated into this <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> framework and their forms exhibited. These concepts turn out to be quite adequately expressed in this near-Boolean framework thereby allowing more natural, intuitive interpretations of quantum phenomena. Results include showing that two conditional propositions are simultaneously verifiable just in case the truth of one implies the applicability of the other. Another theorem shows that two conditional propositions (a|b) and (c|d) reside in a common Boolean sub-algebra of the non-distributive system of conditional propositions just in case b=d, that their conditions are equivalent. Some concepts equivalent in standard formulations of quantum logic are distinguishable in the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> algebra, indicating the greater richness of expression possible with Boolean fractions. Logical operations and deductions in the linear subspace logic of quantum mechanics are compared with their counterparts in the <b>conditional</b> <b>event</b> realm. Disjunctions and implications in the quantum realm seem to correspond in the domain of Boolean fractions to previously identified implications with respect to various naturally arising deductive relations.

40|$|Abstract Starting from {{a recent}} paper by S. Kaufmann, we {{introduce}} a notion of conjunction of two <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> and then we analyze it {{in the setting of}} coherence. We give a representation of the conjoined condi-tional and we show that this new object is a conditional random quantity, whose set of possible values normally contains the probabilities assessed for the two <b>conditional</b> <b>events.</b> We examine some cases of logical dependencies, where the conjunction is a conditional event; moreover, we give the lower and upper bounds on the conjunction. We also examine an apparent paradox concerning stochastic independence which can actually be explained in terms of uncorrelation. We briefly introduce the notions of disjunction and iterated conditioning and we show that the usual probabilistic properties still hold...|$|R
40|$|We make a {{probabilistic}} analysis {{related to}} some inference rules which {{play an important}} role in nonmonotonic reasoning. In a coherence-based setting, we study the extensions of a probability assessment defined on $n$ <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> to their quasi conjunction, and by exploiting duality, to their quasi disjunction. The lower and upper bounds coincide with some well known t-norms and t-conorms: minimum, product, Lukasiewicz, and Hamacher t-norms and their dual t-conorms. On this basis we obtain Quasi And and Quasi Or rules. These are rules for which any finite family of <b>conditional</b> <b>events</b> p-entails the associated quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction. We examine some cases of logical dependencies, and we study the relations among coherence, inclusion for <b>conditional</b> <b>events,</b> and p-entailment. We also consider the Or rule, where quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction of premises coincide with the conclusion. We analyze further aspects of quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction, by computing probabilistic bounds on premises from bounds on conclusions. Finally, we consider biconditional events, and we introduce the notion of an $n$-conditional event. Then we give a probabilistic interpretation for a generalized Loop rule. In an appendix we provide explicit expressions for the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm in the unitary hypercube...|$|R
