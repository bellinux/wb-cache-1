5000|$|Landscape {{connectivity}} {{in ecology}} is, broadly, [...] "the {{degree to which}} the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches". Alternatively, connectivity may be a <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> of the landscape and independent of patches and paths. Connectivity includes both structural connectivity (the physical arrangements of disturbance and/or patches) and functional connectivity (the movement of individuals across contours of disturbance and/or among patches). The degree to which a landscape is connected determines the amount of dispersal there is among patches, which influences gene flow, local adaptation, extinction risk, colonization probability, and the potential for organisms to move as they cope with climate change.|$|E

One is, that he makes the {{doctrine}} of the theory of selection and evolution account for the existence of distinctive types. In our opinion this is most erroneous; there is no such progress going on in nature; there has never been known to be such a process in nature as the one type of existence ever becoming merged into or becoming another type. There is no change going on in the lower orders that are said to resemble man by which it is possible that they become future men. The gorilla and the ape, though resembling man in appearance, fail to resemble in any distinctive qualities of expressed intelligence, and there has never been known {{in the history of the}} world a specific change from the lower to the higher degree of existence.

30|$|From Definition 1, {{the generic}} {{framework}} {{we are seeking}} requires an ontological representation that can achieve CG distribution over properties whose value spaces are continuous. In this pursuit, all continuous quantities in the domain should have multivariate Gaussian distributions, i.e. CG, of the type CondG. Thus, for each property with a continuous value space in ontology, we specify two types of distributions: discrete distribution over an equivalent property that has a discrete value space of the continuous domain; and a CG distribution over the continuous value space of the property. This fictitious (equivalent) discrete property serves as the sole parent of the <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> in the equivalent DAG of HyProb-Ontology. The fictitious discrete property hereby replaces the <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> in all dependencies in the ontology, and its representation follows those of the discrete setting.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerical {{judgments}} {{are involved in}} {{almost every aspect of}} our daily life. They are carried out so efficiently that they are often considered to be automatic and innate. However, numerosity of non-symbolic stimuli is highly correlated with its <b>continuous</b> <b>properties</b> (e. g., density, area), and so it is hard to determine whether numerosity and <b>continuous</b> <b>properties</b> rely on the same mechanism. Here we examined the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underlying such judgments. We scanned subjects' hemodynamic responses to a numerosity comparison task and to a surface area comparison task. In these tasks, numerical and continuous magnitudes could be either congruent or incongruent. Behaviorally, an interaction between the order of the tasks and the relevant dimension modulated the congruency effects. Continuous magnitudes always interfered with numerosity comparison. Numerosity, on the other hand, interfered with the surface area comparison only when participants began with the numerosity task. Hemodynamic activity showed that context (induced by task order) determined the neuronal pathways in which the dimensions were processed. Starting with the numerosity task led to enhanced activity in the right hemisphere, while starting with the continuous task led to enhanced left hemisphere activity. Continuous magnitudes processing relied on activation of the frontal eye field and the post-central gyrus. Processing of numerosities, on the other hand, relied on deactivation of these areas, suggesting active suppression of the continuous dimension. Accordingly, we suggest that numerosities, even in the subitizing range, are not always processed automatically; their processing depends on context and task demands...|$|R
