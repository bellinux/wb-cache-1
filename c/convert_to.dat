40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R

50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde is <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R
