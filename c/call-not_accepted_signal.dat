40|$|Abstract:- A novel {{representation}} of process variables as frequency signals {{is presented in}} this paper. Traditional analog computers and transfer function analyzers built using the binary rate multiplier principle did not explicitly consider negative numbers. It is proposed to introduce a two-pin {{system in which the}} sign of the variable is made available as 1 -bit data on one pin and a series of pulses, whose frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the variable on another pin. Using this concept, the binary rate multiplier had been redesigned to <b>accept</b> <b>signals</b> of both the polarities. Integrators can be constructed, feedback of a variable can be realized and summing operation could be performed easily using this new representation...|$|R

A real-time digital post-processing is also added {{to increase the}} ADC linearity and to minimize the spurious tones induced by the digital data interleaving.
