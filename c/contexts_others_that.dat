40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{hypothesis}} that in masculine cultures or in <b>other</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>that</b> emphasize competitive achievement, those with higher performance capabilities will feel empowered to have input in decisions and, hence, will desire opportunities to voice their opinions about decisions to be made. In contrast, in more feminine cultures or in <b>other</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>that</b> value the importance of nurturing people with lower capability, those with lower capabilities will feel valued as important group members, will feel worthy of receiving voice and, hence, will appreciate voice opportunities. We provide evidence for these predictions in 2 studies, 1 conducted in the United States (a more masculine culture) and 1 in the Netherlands (a more feminine culture). Evidence also comes from experimental conditions in both studies, in which we made salient to participants countercultural norms and values, that is, nurturing the less capable in the United States and competitive achievement in the Netherlands.

Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the purported three-factor structure of the DASS- 21 was supported in each location with structural invariance across locations.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that prior learning about a set of cues may determine how new cues are processed. If subjects are taught that two reliable predictors of an outcome do not summate when the cues are presented together (i. e., subadditive pretraining), the subjects will tend to show a less profound blocking effect when trained with different cues. Three experiments investigated the conditions necessary for subadditive pretraining to generalize to new cues. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subadditive pretraining is less effective in reducing blocking when it is experienced in a <b>context</b> <b>other</b> than <b>that</b> in which the blocking training is experienced. In Experiment 2, the effectiveness of subadditive pretraining waned with time.

This poses the following question: how do we recognize the theories of agency in systems? To investigate this, we propose a method for extracting the theory of agency from an existing system where we have tentatively assigned an underlying theory of agency to the system but want to definitively categorize it.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to test a model derived from a study of shop floor retail salespeople in the call centre environment. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire measuring the variables in the model was completed by 126 call centre representatives recruited from 11 call centres in Melbourne, Australia. Findings – Although the model was supported, the interactions among the variables differed. In particular, stressors played a bigger, albeit indirect, role in the intention to quit. Practical implications – Call centre managers need to consider carefully the aspects of the work environment that may be stressful. If appropriately addressed, turnover may be reduced, and productivity increased. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that the model of turnover derived from shop floor salespeople is generally robust in the call centre setting.
