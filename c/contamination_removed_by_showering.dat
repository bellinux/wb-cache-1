40|$|Originally, the VAS {{split window}} {{channels}} {{were designed to}} use the differential water vapor absorption between 11 and 12 microns to estimate sea surface temperature by correcting for the radiometric losses caused by atmospheric moisture. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to reverse the procedure in order to estimate the vertically integrated low level moisture content with the background surface (skin) temperature removed, even over the bright, complex background of the land. Because the lower troposphere's water vapor content is an important factor in convective instability, the derived fields are of considerable value to mesoscale meteorology. Moisture patterns are available as quantitative fields (centimeters of precipitable water) at full VAS resolution (as fine as 7 kilometers horizontal resolution every 15 minutes), and are readily converted to image format for false color movies. The technique, demonstrated with GOES- 5, uses a sequence of split window radiances taken once every 3 hours from dawn to dusk over the Eastern and Central United States. The algorithm is calibrated with the morning radiosonde sites embedded within the first VAS radiance field; then, entire moisture fields are calculated at all five observation times.

The device can also dry the wafer fragment after UPW/megasonic cleaning by continuing to spin the wafer in the cleaning chamber, which is purged with flowing ultrapure nitrogen gas at 65 psi (. 448 kPa). The cleaner also uses three types of vacuum chucks that can accommodate all Genesis-flown array fragments in any dimensional shape between 3 and 100 mm in diameter.

30|$|Geochemical {{data from}} {{rock-cutting}} samples can {{give rise to}} faulty interpretations due to contamination from drilling fluids used in modern deepwater petroleum exploration. In this study, oil-based drilling contaminants were <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> solvent extraction with dichloromethane and methanol (9 : 1) solution. Bulk and molecular organic geochemical characteristics were examined for both oil-based drilling mud and cleaned rock-cutting samples. Total organic carbon (TOC) values are notably high in heavy liquid oil-based drilling mud mixtures (TOC[*]=[*] 21.4 – 63.3 %, average[*]=[*] 34.6 % ± 8.6) compared to cleaned rock cuttings (TOC[*]=[*] 0.4 – 1.5 %, average[*]=[*] 0.8 % ± 0.3). In addition, drilling mud mixtures contain higher concentrations of unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) in the n-alkanes fraction. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish individual homologues in the n-alkanes fraction. The triterpanes also have relatively high UCM contents compared to steranes fractions. However, hydrocarbon homologues can be identified in both the triterpanes and steranes fractions of oil-based drilling mud mixtures. Gas chromatograms indicate that the n-alkanes fractions of rock cuttings initially cleaned with solvent still show considerable contamination from drilling fluids. This remaining <b>contamination</b> was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> an additional cleaning step using the soxhlet extraction technique. The triterpanes fraction in solvent-cleaned rock cuttings does not contain an overprint of heavy liquid oil-based drilling mud contamination. However, solvent-cleaned rock cuttings may still retain contamination signatures at the sterane C 28 - 20 R homologue due to coelution. The geochemical overprint of contaminants in the cleaned rock cuttings can be interpreted as infiltration of lower molecular weight compounds into micro-cracks of the cuttings. The distribution of these molecules varies in each hydrocarbon fraction. Therefore, close inspection of contamination effects is required before interpretation of traditional organic geochemical proxies such as source rock characteristics and maturity.|$|R

Two approaches to the selection of respirators are contrasted. One relates the performance required, in terms of concentration reduction in inhaled air, to the nominal protection factor for the respirator, which is based on maximum allowed inward leakage in standard tests. The other allocates filters of different efficiencies to categories of substance according to inherent potential danger. RESPIRATORY protection is required either for readiness in case of emergency or in circumstances where its use in place of containment or control of the gaseous or particulate material can be justified.

Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important information about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the growth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies.
