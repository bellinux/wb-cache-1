Throughout 1942, 105 Sdn., based next at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks. Apart from the Oslo and Berlin raids, the strikes were mainly on industrial and infrastructure targets in occupied Netherlands and Norway, France and northern and western Germany. The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, which they called snappers. Germany still controlled <b>continental</b> <b>airspace,</b> and the Fw 190s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude. Collisions within the formations also caused casualties. It was the Mosquito’s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated those evasions that were successful.|$|E
50|$|All CPDLC {{deployments}} must {{be supported}} by an approved safety case demonstrating that all safety objectives for the applicable airspace have been met.

50|$|Most of the {{airspace}} is not {{monitored by}} radar, so procedures {{differ from those}} in <b>continental</b> <b>airspaces.</b> GAATS is an oceanic air traffic management system that automatically processes flight data and provides air traffic controllers with a radar-like picture of traffic in oceanic airspace. GAATS also provides automatic waypoint reports, and use of Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) which is text-based messaging for such routine requests as altitude changes. GAATS brings significant safety and efficiency benefits to North Atlantic airspace.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{model is}} under development {{to assess the}} safety and efficiency of commercial aircraft operations under the Free Flight Program proposed for air traffic control for the US National Airspace System. The major objective of the Free Flight Program is to accommodate the dramatic growth anticipated in air traffic in the US. However, the potential impacts upon aircraft safety from implementing the Program have not been fully explored and evaluated. The model is directed at assessing aircraft operations at high altitude over the <b>continental</b> US <b>airspace</b> since this action is the initial step for Free Flight. Sequential steps with analysis, assessment, evaluation, and iteration {{will be required to}} satisfactorily accomplish the complete transition of US commercial aircraft traffic operations...|$|R
40|$|The L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) is the {{air-to-ground}} {{data link}} technology within the Future Communications Infrastructure (FCI). LDACS 1 {{is one of}} two candidate LDACS technologies that have been recommended for further study by ICAO. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of a Europe-wide deployment of the LDACS 1 system. For this purpose, we consider the estimated data traffic load for the year 2020 and perform cell planning to serve this traffic with LDACS 1 base stations. The requirement is that the proposed cell planning is able to fully serve the expected traffic and to provide full coverage of the <b>continental</b> European <b>airspace</b> above Flight Level 100. We propose a frequency assignment which takes into account the interference from Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) ground stations, which are also operating in the L-band. We {{come to the conclusion that}} a European deployment of LDACS 1 is easily achievable, coexists well with today’s operating DME stations, and still leaves significant room for future traffic growth...|$|R

This rule accommodates the use of FANS-1/A by long haul aircraft. All other airspace users must be ICAO compliant.|$|E
40|$|The {{modernization}} of the European air transportation system {{will increase the}} need for data communication. This creates the need for large-scale simulations to ascertain that new aeronautical communication systems fulfil the requirements of future air traffic management communication. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) created a framework for such simulations based on service-oriented software architecture. The Framework for Aeronautical Communications and Traffic Simulations 2 (FACTS 2) {{is based on the}} concept of service oriented simulation: Creating complex simulations from simple software building blocks called "services". In this paper we describe the extension of the FACTS 2 simulation framework by a communication load simulation suitable to feed aeronautical communication technology evaluations. We create a simulation toolchain from existing and new FACTS 2 simulation services and interconnect them using XML and the UNIX pipe interface. We demonstrate our method with the air traffic management communication demand analysis of the <b>continental</b> European <b>airspace.</b> Our results indicate that the expected air traffic management communication load for the ESRA 08 area is below 3, 000 kbps in the ground-to-air direction and less than 1, 000 kbps in the air-to ground direction until 2035...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{aircraft}} contrail model developed {{by researchers at}} NASA Ames Re-search Center assuming static atmospheric conditions is extended to simulate the dynamic evolution of contrails triggered by airborne flights.

The dynamic contrail model can simulate the full life cycle of young-age linear contrails in any day for the entire <b>continental</b> U.

5000|$|To {{mitigate}} the described problem, many recommend, as legally allowed in very limited authorized airspace, that planes fly {{one or two}} miles offset {{from the center of}} the airway (to the right side) thus eliminating the problem only in the head-on collision scenario. The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) [...] "Procedures for Air Navigation--Air Traffic Management Manual," [...] authorizes lateral offset only in oceanic and remote airspace worldwide. [...] However, this workaround for the particular case of a head-on collision threat on a common assigned airway fails to address the navigation paradox in general, and it fails to specifically address the inherent system safety fault intolerance inadvertently designed into international air traffic safety regulations.4 [...] To be specific, in the cases of intersecting flight paths where either aircraft is not on an airway (for example, flying under a [...] "direct" [...] clearance, or a temporary diversion clearance for weather threats), or where intersecting aircraft flights are on deliberately intersecting airways, these more general threats receive no protection from flying one or two miles to the right of the center of the airway. Intersecting flight paths must still intersect somewhere. As with the midair collision over Germany, an offset to the right of an airway would have simply changed the impact point by a mile or two away from where the intersection actually did occur. Of the 342 deaths since 1997 so far encouraged by the lack of a linear cruising altitude rule (like ACCAR) improvement to the fault intolerance of the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, only the head-on collision over the Amazon could have been prevented if either pilot had been flying an offset to the right of the airway centerline. In contrast, ACCAR systematically separates conflicting traffic in all airspace at all altitudes on any heading, whether over the middle of the ocean or over high-density multinational-interface <b>continental</b> <b>airspace.</b> Nothing about Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) system design addresses the inherent vulnerability of the air traffic system to expected faults in hardware and human performance, as experienced in the Namibian, German, Amazon and Japanese accidents.5 ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Air {{traffic control}} in non-radar oceanic {{airspace}} {{has always been}} relatively limited. Current American and European projects aim at transiting from ground-based systems to satellite-based systems. New technologies will allow to reduce significantly the present aircraft separation standards. As a consequence, the aircraft crossing the North Atlantic {{will be able to}} follow better routes, which will improve the air traffic situation by decreasing of flight durations and congestion in pre-oceanic <b>continental</b> <b>airspace.</b> In this paper an optimization model is introduced and a simple methodology to solve this problem is proposed that yields encouraging preliminary results...|$|E

Following the SESAR ATM Master Plan [6] airborne separation applications such as Airborne Spacing and Airborne Separation are the necessary steps from today’s ADS-B based Airborne Traffic Situational Awareness to a future Free Flight ATM system based on Self-Separation.

40|$|International audienceAircraft {{flying in}} <b>continental</b> <b>airspace</b> are {{controlled}} by the mean of radars {{with a range of}} about 300 Nautical Miles (1 NM= 1852 m). When they enter oceanic airspace they cannot be monitored by radars anymore and typical procedures have been established in order to ensure safe navigation. Such procedures are based on an Organized Track System (OTS) which is set up on a diurnal basis to facilitate a high throughput of traffic by ensuring separation for the entire oceanic crossing. The track networks are built according to the position of the West-East jet stream. The USA-Europe network is located on the jet stream and the Europe-USA network avoid it...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} an algorithm that minimises {{conflicts between}} aircraft at the strategic level {{taking into account}} uncertainties on aircraft position due to errors into wind forecast. The strategy relies on subliminal speed control. Owing {{to the complexity of}} this kind of optimisation problem, a simulated annealing metaheuristic approach is employed. A scenario with four hours of traffic overflying the Spanish (structured, <b>continental)</b> <b>airspace</b> has been selected. Traffic has been retrieved from NEST Eurocontrol database with the corresponding wind ensemble probabilistic forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Due to uncertainties and to the little range of speed changing allowed by a subliminal control, it becomes not possible to resolve all conflicts. However, their number can be significantly reduced by slightly modifying flight plan speeds while not touching the selected route by the airspace user...|$|E
40|$|This NASA Contractor Report {{summarizes}} {{and documents}} the work performed to develop concepts of use (ConUse) and high-level system requirements and architecture {{for the proposed}} L-band (960 to 1164 MHz) terrestrial en route communications system. This work was completed as a follow-on to the technology assessment conducted by NASA Glenn Research Center and ITT for the Future Communications Study (FCS). ITT assessed air-to-ground (A/G) communications concepts of use and operations presented in relevant NAS-level, international, and NAS-system-level documents to derive the appropriate ConUse relevant to potential A/G communications applications and services for domestic <b>continental</b> <b>airspace.</b> ITT also leveraged prior concepts of use developed during the earlier phases of the FCS.

40|$|International audienceNorth Atlantic oceanic {{airspace}} accommodates air traffic between North America and Europe. Radar-based surveillance is not applicable in this vast and highly congested airspace. For conflict-free flight progress, the organized track system is {{established in the}} North Atlantic and flights are prescribed to follow predefined oceanic tracks. Rerouting of aircraft from one track to another is very rarely applied because of large separation standards. As a result, aircraft often follow routes that are not optimal in view of their departure and destination points. This leads {{to an increase in}} aircraft cruising time and congestion level in <b>continental</b> <b>airspace</b> at input and output. Implementing new technologies and airborne-based control procedures will enable a significant decrease in the present separation standards and improvement of the traffic situation in the North Atlantic. The aim of the present study is to show the benefits that can be expected from such a reduction of separation standards. Optimal conflict-free trajectories are constructed for several flight sets based on the new proposed separation standards, with respect to the flight input data and oceanic winds. This paper introduces a mathematical model, proposes an optimization formulation of the problem, constructs two test problems based on real air-traffic data, and presents very encouraging results of simulations for these data...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the process, findings, and {{recommendations of the}} second of three phases of the Future Communications Study (FCS) technology investigation conducted by NASA Glenn Research Center and ITT Advanced Engineering & Sciences Division for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FCS is a collaborative research effort between the FAA and Eurocontrol to address frequency congestion and spectrum depletion for safety critical airground communications. The goal of the technology investigation is to identify technologies that can support the longterm aeronautical mobile communication operating concept. A derived set of evaluation criteria traceable to the operating concept document is presented. An adaptation of the analytical hierarchy process is described and recommended for selecting candidates for detailed evaluation.

40|$|Major {{improvements}} and new challenges will {{arise from the}} availability of new Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the next decades. In particular, Satellite Based Augmentation systems (SBAS) meet the high accuracy, integrity and continuity levels required for safe critical applications, such as civil aviation radionavigation. The European SBAS contribution is called EGNOS (Global Navigation Overlay Service) which after {{more than six years}} of system development is expected to be ready for the final certification phase by the end of 2005. Conventional air radionavigation in <b>continental</b> <b>airspace</b> uses ground based navigation aids. Consequently, the system is in exible regarding the en-route structure and airport departure or approach procedures. In addition, these facilities have a significant cost and an expensive maintenance program which small airports or aerodromes cannot afford. On the other hand, EGNOS will provide improved procedures at almost no cost for the airport authority in locations where instrumental navigation is poor or even not existing. This work contains a feasibility study of new EGNOS departure and approach procedures in small aerodromes where currently instrumental radionavigation is not possible. Particularly, the study focuses on the regional aerodrome network of Catalonia (Spain), whose characteristics are varied enough to make the benefits of the study representative. For instance, opportunities for new users such as fite extinguishing and rescue services as well as potential business development (like small regional passenger or cargo operators) are pointed out. In addition, this study remarks safety, environmental and operational advantages that satellite navigation will provide to civil aviation. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
