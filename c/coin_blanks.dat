50|$|In spring 2016 {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the Netherlands after an episode of the television program Keuringsdienst van Waarde showed that euro coins from the Netherlands and other countries are produced by the South Korean company Poongsan. This company is also a known producer of cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are banned internationally by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), because of their indiscriminate and long-term effects on civilians. The CCM prohibits the use, produce, retain or transfer cluster munitions as well as assistance with these acts. After parliamentary questions were posed, the Dutch government stated that the Royal Dutch Mint had ordered around 40 million 'coin blanks' between 2011 and 2016, and that Poongsan was {{on a list of}} vetted suppliers of the European Commission's Mint Directors Working Group. Since then, both the Royal Dutch Mint and the Norwegian Mint have excluded Poongsan as a <b>coin</b> <b>blank</b> supplier due to its involvement in cluster munitions. In the European Parliament, questions were also raised about Poongsan's presence on the vetted list of <b>coin</b> <b>blank</b> suppliers of the European Commission's Mint Directors Working Group.

5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the <b>coin</b> <b>blank.</b> Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|R
50|$|Today’s {{constituent}} {{community of}} Niederlößnitz (“Lower Lößnitz”) was originally a farming village downstream {{from where the}} Aubach empties into the Lößnitzbach. The first known naming of the community goes back to 1497, when it was known as Niderlesenitzs. About 100 years later, the community counted 6 landowners. One estate was exempted from combat duty and served as the lordly hunting lodge. A. Schuhmann mentioned in 1820 in his Lexikon two flour mills and a paper mill. However, the paper mill, which had supposedly once been a hammerworks and a <b>coin</b> <b>blank</b> works, burnt down in 1808 and was never rebuilt. Towards {{the end of the}} 19th century, the railway line between Zwönitz and Aue, on which the lower railway station was built somewhat later, came into service. After the station was built came residential areas and industrial development, leading eventually to Niederlößnitz’s amalgamation with the Town of Lößnitz in 1898.|$|R

5000|$|According to one interpretation, the purse-hoard in the Sutton Hoo ship burial (Suffolk, East Anglia), which {{contained}} {{a variety of}} Merovingian gold coins, unites the traditional Germanic voyage to the afterlife with [...] "an unusually splendid form of Charon's obol." [...] The burial yielded 37 gold tremisses dating from the late 6th and early 7th century, three unstruck <b>coin</b> <b>blanks,</b> and two small gold ingots. It has been conjectured that the coins were to pay the oarsmen who would row the ship into the next world, while the ingots were meant for the steersmen. Although Charon is usually a lone figure in depictions from both antiquity and the modern era, there is some slight evidence that his ship might be furnished with oarsmen. A fragment of 6th century BC pottery has been interpreted as Charon sitting in the stern as steersman of a boat fitted with ten pairs of oars and rowed by eidola (εἴδωλα), shades of the dead. A reference in Lucian seems also {{to imply that the}} shades might row the boat.|$|E

A recent publication on these coins attempts to identify symbols peculiar to Sri Lanka. Some of the more popular symbols are Sun, Moon, elephant, bull, nandipada, fish and peacock.

50|$|The coins {{were either}} 'struck' or 'cast'. Both methods {{required}} a substantial degree of knowledge. Striking a <b>blank</b> <b>coin</b> formed in a clay was one way.

Casting a coin required a different technique. They were produced by pouring molten alloy into a set of molds which were broken apart when the metal had cooled.|$|R
