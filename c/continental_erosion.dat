40|$|The flux of {{sediment}} and organic carbon from continents to the coastal ocean {{is an important}} factor governing organic burial in coastal sediments, and these systems preserve important records of environmental and biogeochemical conditions during past global change events. Burial of organic materials in coastal systems can be promoted by chemical resilience or through protection by association with mineral surfaces, but the role and influence of these processes on organic records from ancient sediments is poorly known. We studied sediment and organic matter burial as particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-bound organic matter (MOM) in near-shore marine sediments from the Wilson Lake core (New Jersey, USA) that span the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), a climatic perturbation 55. 9 Myr ago. Our results show that distinct POM and MOM fractions can be isolated from sediments. Both fractions appear to be dominated by terrestrial material, but POM consisted primarily of recently synthesized material whereas MOM included a significant fraction of pre-aged organic matter from soils or ancient sediments.

The environmental change seems to be closely associated with a negative carbon isotope excursion that was identified in a stratigraphic succession of the Dolomites (Italy) but the temporal relationship between these phenomena is still not well defined. Here we present organic-carbon isotope data from Carnian deep-water stratigraphic sections in Austria and Hungary, and carbonate petrography of samples from a marginal marine section in Italy. A negative 2 - 4 ‰ δ 13 C shift is recorded by bulk organic matter in the studied sections and is coincident with a similar feature highlighted in higher plant and marine algal biomarker carbon-isotope records from the Dolomites (Italy), thus testifying to a global change in the isotopic composition of the reservoirs of the exchangeable carbon. Our new observations verify that sedimentological changes related to the CPE coincide with the carbon cycle perturbation and therefore occurred synchronously within the western Tethys. Consistent with modern observations, our {{results show that the}} injection of 13 C-depleted CO 2 into the Carnian atmosphere-ocean system may have been directly responsible for the increase in rainfall by intensifying the Pangaean mega-monsoon activity.

40|$|At {{geological}} time scales, {{the role of}} <b>continental</b> <b>erosion</b> in the organic carbon (OC) cycle {{is determined by the}} balance between recent OC burial and petrogenic OC oxidation. Evaluating its net effect on the concentration of carbon dioxide and dioxygen in the atmosphere requires the fate of petrogenic OC to be assessed. Here, we report a multiscale (nanometer to micrometer) structural characterization of petrogenic OC in the Himalayan system. We show that graphitic carbon is preserved and buried in marine sediments, while the less graphitized forms are oxidized during fluvial transport. Radiocarbon dating indicates that 30 to 50 % of the carbon initially present in the Himalayan rocks is conserved during the erosion cycle. Graphitization during metamorphism thus stabilizes carbon in the crust over {{geological time}} scales. Theburial of organic carbon (OC) inmarinesediments represents the second largestsink of atmospheric CO 2 after silicate weathering and subsequent carbonate precipi-tation (1 – 4). Rivers {{play a crucial role in}} this process by exporting a large flux of OC from the continents to the oceans (5 – 7), hence gen-erating a long-termC sink. OC exported by rivers is, however, a mix of (i) “recent ” OC (OCrecent) derived from plant detritus, associated soil organic matter, and autotrophic carbon produc-tion by aquatic plants, and (ii) petrogenic OC (OCpetro) derived from erosion of carbonaceous rocks [e. g., (8 – 11) ]. Burial of the latter is a simple recycling of reduced C and has no effect on the long-term atmospheric CO 2 and O 2 levels. Con-versely, its oxidation consumes O 2 from and returns CO 2 to the atmosphere, thereby counter-acting the effect of OCrecent burial. Addressing the role of <b>continental</b> <b>erosion</b> on the global C cycle thus requires assessing the fate of OCpetro during erosion and fluvial transport. The Himalayan range undergoes an intense physical erosion producing an enormous flux of sediment (~ 2 billion tons per year) carried by the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) fluvial system to the Bengal Fan turbiditic system [e. g., (12) ].

The sediment cores considered in this study were recovered from the lower oxic-suboxic OMZ boundary. In addition, stratigraphic information from 31 sediment cores was compiled with a focus on the time intervals since the LGM. Erosional features together with gaps depict a prograding feature on the continental slope from south to north during the deglaciation. The recent oceanographic and sedimentological observations showed that tide-topography interactions result in non-linear internal waves which shape the <b>continental</b> slope by <b>erosion</b> and remobilization of the sediments. The compilation of downcore records and the northward expanding feature of the hiatus revealed that the tide-topography interactions have progressively evolved since the LGM.

It was later followed by application of a transfer function to the four sediment cores. Estimated bottom water oxygen concentrations were low compared to modern values however the trend of decreasing oxygen levels during the Termination I and slight increase in the Holocene was consistent across all cores. The overall change in the bottom water oxygen levels from the LGM and the Holocene was reckoned to be 25 μmol/kg.

40|$|International audienceTectonics {{and erosion}} are the driving {{forces in the}} {{evolution}} of mountain belts, but the identification of their relative contributions remains a fundamental scientific problem in relation to the understanding of both geodynamic processes and surface processes. The issue is further complicated through the roles of climate and climatic change. For more than a century it has been thought that the present high topography of western Scandinavia was created by some form of active tectonic uplift during the Cenozoic. This has been based mainly on the occurrence of surface remnants and accordant summits at high elevation believed to have been graded to sea level, the inference of increasing erosion rates toward the present-day based on the age of offshore erosion products and the erosion histories inferred from apatite fission track data, and on over-burial and seaward tilting of coast-proximal sediments. In contrast to this received wisdom, we demonstrate here that the evidence can be substantially explained by a model of protracted exhumation of topography since the Caledonide Orogeny. Exhumation occurred by gravitational collapse, <b>continental</b> rifting and <b>erosion.</b> Initially, tectonic exhumation dominated, although erosion rates were high. The subsequent demise of onshore tectonic activity allowed slow erosion to become the dominating exhumation agent. The elevation limiting and landscape shaping activities of wet-based alpine glaciers, cirques and periglacial processes gained importance with the greenhouse­icehouse climatic deterioration at the Eocene­Oligocene boundary and erosion rates increased. The flattish surfaces that these processes can produce suggest an alternative to the traditional tectonic interpretation of these landscape elements in western Scandinavia. The longevity of western Scandinavian topography is due to the failure of rifting processes in destroying the topography entirely, and to the buoyant upward feeding of replacement crustal material commensurate with exhumation unloading. We emphasize the importance of differentiating the morphological, sedimentological and structural signatures of recent active tectonics from the effects of long-term exhumation and isostatic rebound in understanding the evolution of similar elevated regions...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} into Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) development represents {{research from the}} stratigraphic record of three geographic areas: The James Ross Basin (northwestern Weddell Sea), the Pacific continental margin of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the Joinville Slope (northwestern Weddell Sea). The stratigraphic architecture of the James Ross Basin, NW Weddell Sea continental shelf, shows three major phases of deposition: pre-glacial, ice sheet growth, and ice sheet dominated. Each stratigraphic unit is characterized based upon seismic facies and stratigraphic architecture, and the ages are inferred from a seismic stratigraphic age model. A total of 34 grounding events of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) are recorded on the continental shelf. The seven oldest glacial unconformities are believed to pre-date all previously identified unconformities on the peninsula continental shelf. An expanded section of Late Pliocene/Pleistocene deposits show a minimum of 10 grounding events. Isopachs of sedimentary sequences on the Antarctic Peninsula Pacific continental margin show shifting depocenters through time. Chronostratigraphic and seismic depth-converted data from ODP 178 cores allow the calculation of sediment flux for shelf units S 3 -S 1 and rise units M 6 -M 1. Sediment flux to the margin increases from the Late Eocene until the Late Pliocene and then decreases slightly from Late Pliocene to present. Significant increases in sediment flux coincide with early development of the APIS and during the early Pliocene warming period (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Minimum glacial denudation rates for the Antarctic Peninsula {{are in the range}} of 0. 06 to 0. 13 mm yr - 1.

Previous studies mainly focused on the role of the river fluxes of inorganic carbon in this respect, but none of them examined possible variations in the fluxes of organic carbon, although the erosion of organic carbon actually represents the bulk of the atmospheric CO 2 consumption by <b>continental</b> <b>erosion.</b> We therefore applied a global carbon erosion model to a LGM scenario in order to determine the riverine fluxes of organic matter during that time. The climatic conditions during the LGM were reconstructed using a computer simulation with a general circulation model. It is found that during the LGM the riverine organic carbon input into the oceans was at least ∼ 10 % lower than today. Most of the reduction of the total organic matter fluxes is due to the reduction of the fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. The fluxes of particulate organic carbon remained almost unchanged. The oceanic response to the lower carbon input was estimated on the basis of a present-day steady state budget for organic river carbon in the oceans, and implies that the reduction of the river fluxes were more than counterbalanced by lower burial rates due to the smaller shelf area during the LGM. This suggests that both the lower river carbon input and the relatively greater share of this carbon being subjected to oceanic respiration, acted as a negative feedback to the low atmospheric CO 2 content during the LGM...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{trend of}} the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in oceanic waters {{displays}} two maxima during the Cambrian and present-day, and a minimum during the Jurassic, overprinted by shorter wavelengths oscillations (40 Myrs). Those variations are interpreted {{as a proxy for}} the flux of continental sediments to the oceans. High frequency variations are interpreted as alternations between periods of intense erosion during collisional phases, as exemplified by the Himalayan peak since 55 Myrs, and periods of <b>continental</b> <b>erosion</b> decrease with an isotopic composition dominated by the alteration of oceanic basalt. This explanation remains in many instances unsatisfying. Instead, we propose that not only the short-term, but also the long-term (Phanerozoic) evolution of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr curve evidences endoreic/exoreic cycles of the river drainage on continents. During endoreic phases, the erosional product (chemical - particles) is only partially, if any, redistributed into the global oceans. The sequestrated sediments, which can be considered as "ghost erosional products", produce widespread continental deposits (Devonian-Permian red sandstones for example). Conversely, during exoreic phases, the erosional flux is equal to the erosion of the relief (which product is directly exported into the ocean) and the release of the sediment load that was sequestrated during endoreic phases. Such cycles modulate the isotopic composition of the ocean waters accordingly. The dynamic deflection of the topography with widespread hinterland basins that is associated with orogenic cycles provides a good explanation for periods of short-term endoreism (20 - 40 Myrs). Such basins are capable of storing tremendous amounts of sediments, a process that is further reinforced by the sequestration of sediments in intra-mountainous basins (see for example the Variscan orogeny). The long wavelength of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr trend is that of the Wilson cycle. Supercontinental aggregation promotes the widespread development of basins in the center of Pangea which have no outlet to the ocean, and thus starve the ocean from 87 Sr rich sediments. Conversely, exoreism is expected to increase during continental breakup, as corroborated by the isotopic record since 150 Myrs. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio is thus a proxy for endoreism at various time scales, and as such shall not be regarded as a indicator of <b>continental</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|E

Three unconformity-bound megasequences of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary age are identified, which were strongly influenced by tectonic processes: 1. Late Maastrichtian-Mid Eocene; 2. Miocene; 3. Late Miocene (Messinian) -Late Pliocene. Megasequence 1 was initiated by a Late Maastrichtian-age marine transgression over Maastrichtian-emplaced ophiolitic rocks and melange (Baer Bassit Massif). Water depths increased in the Palaeocene, giving rise to outer-shelf-depth carbonate deposition, rich in planktic foraminifera. Marine high productivity is reflected in common diagenetic chert formation. Nummulite-rich carbonates accumulated on a shallower shelf during Early-Mid Eocene time. Shallowing of marine conditions, coupled with tectonic instability, culminated in emergence, followed by a Late Eocene-Oligocene hiatus. Megasequence 2 is spatially restricted to the Nahr El-Kabir Graben and begins with Early Miocene carbonate deposition of mainly pelagic facies. In the Middle Miocene, there was an increasing input of basin margin-derived high-density turbidites and debris flows. Minor ongoing tectonism was followed by regression during the Messinian salinity crisis. Megasequence 3 begins with the accumulation of mainly laminated gypsum, followed by gypsum debris flows and selenitic gypsum. Initial Pliocene transgression led to shallow-marine, open-shelf muddy sedimentation, shallowing up, prior to the Late Pliocene into marls and bioclastic carbonates. Late Pliocene-Quaternary time was marked by progressive uplift, marine and <b>continental</b> terracing and <b>erosion.</b> A Maastrichtian to Paleogene submerged shelf succession on the Arabian Platform culminated in a regional hiatus during the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Early Neogene rifting led to development of a transtensional basin (the Nahr El-Kabir Graben, a probable half graben). Strike-slip deformation (probably sinistral) and regional uplift followed during Late Neogene-Quaternary time. The Miocene Nahr El-Kabir Graben developed along an important, inferred, transform fault system. The resulting El-Kabir Lineament demarcates the northern {{margin of the}} African Plate (Arabian sub-plate). The El-Kabir Fault links southwestwards with the southern Cyprus active margin and northeastwards with the Dead Sea Transform Fault and, thus, represents an important, previously unrecognised, segment of the Africa-Eurasia plate boundary...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{debate on}} the {{beginning}} of the Anthropocene renews questions on both the calendar of human practices, their emergences and spreads, and their impacts on <b>continental</b> ecosystems (soil <b>erosion,</b> lake waters eutrophication, biodiversity alteration). There is consequently increasing needs for qualifying and quantifying these practices and impacts, integrating them into a spatio-temporal framework that could connect knowledges provided by archaeologists with the ones reconstructed by palaeoenvironmentalists. For example, archaeologists built a rather coherent (although still incomplete) picture of broomcorn millet diffusion across Eurasia, based on a large dataset of charred millet grain occurrences in archaeological sites (Marinval, 1992; Hunt et al., 2008). Then, palaeoenvironmentalists detected tiny traces (miliacin, a molecular biomarker) of millet in lake sediments. The first occurrence of miliacin in sediments of Lake Le Bourget, dated back to ca. 1700 BC, was consistent with the import of millet in the Alps at that time (Jacob et al., 2008). But surprisingly, no archaeological remain attested to human presence around the lake during this period. Extended to Lake Ledro and Lake Paladru, this geological approach allowed precising the timing of millet arrival in the Alps, with significant diachronism in the records (until 1000 yrs), that illustrates the progressive diffusion of millet (Simonneau et al., 2013), even when no archaeological structure was previously identified {{in the vicinity of the}} lakes studied. In both cases, archaeological and palaeoenvironmental approaches thus proved to be highly complementary. Precision in millet cultivation spread across Europe (and beyond) is expected from additional sedimentary records of miliacin first occurrence along the suspected diffusion routes. Into the sedimentary infills of these three lakes, the first miliacin occurrence was associated with drastic increases in others organic materials: a molecular biomarker (TTHC; Jacob et al., 2009) suspected to be formed in soil litters and organic particles known to derive from soil erosion. Additionally, enhanced detritic fluxes or thicker flood deposits were noted in some lakes. Hence, populations not only brought millet as a new cereal, but also developed new land management practices that significantly affected soil quality. Impacts of millet cultivation on vegetation cover were however more diverse. No major impact on the catchment vegetation was noted in Lake le Bourget whereas significant changes were recorded in Ledro (Joannin et al., 2013) and Paladru (Simonneau et al., 2013; Doyen et al., 2016). This heterogeneous response of vegetation underlines the importance of the context when discussing an ecosystem response to a given stimulus. It also questions the surface areas used for cultivation compared to those unused, i. e. hot spots of human activities efficient for being recorded in lake sediments. Considering the steep catchment of Lake Le Bourget, only few areas are available to cultivation compared to more flat areas around Lake Paladru. Identifying those hot spots, for example by studying the chemical legacy of former arable soils, constitutes an interdisciplinary challenge. In Ukrainian, detecting miliacin in paleosoils allowed confirming millet cultivation by nomad populations during the Iron Age (Motuzaite-Matuceviciute et al., 2013). A more precise picture of spatial strategies in land use will undoubtedly be obtained from studies integrating the analysis of both soil legacies within catchments, and sedimentary records. These different examples claim for a more detailed picture of spatio-temporal trajectories of agricultural practices coupled to a fine analysis of their impacts. It is thus necessary to get benefit from the multiplication of experiences (varying practices, varying impacts, various contexts) that allows the history of mankind. Future directions should not only focus on qualifying but also on quantifying the human-driven ecosystems evolution, and establish neat causal, spatial and temporal links between stimuli and impacts...|$|R
40|$|Surface erosion is {{the most}} {{significant}} process responsible for the recycling of continental crust into the upper mantle, and controls both exhumation in mountain belts and the long-term global climate via chemical weathering. Earlier studies have highlighted the importance of climate instability since the onset of Northern Hemispheric Glaciation (similar to 3 Ma) as being the primary influence causing high erosion rates since that time. Here I show that synchronous pulses of erosion and exhumation occurred across Eurasia, in North America and in Africa starting after 33 Ma, with a prominent peak around 16 Ma. Correlation of these erosional events with changes in global climate suggests that they are controlled by surface processes. Because these climate events involve both cooling and warming periods the importance of increased seasonality is emphasized as being the key factor in controlling global erosion and exhumation throughout the Cenozoic.
