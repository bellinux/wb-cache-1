5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes.

However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E

5|$|Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 181000km (2.54Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like m:n).|$|E
5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group.

These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing {{to follow a}} populist policy in order to cajole the public.

5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases his belief in the authenticity on the level of detail {{and the fact that the}} account lacks all knowledge of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors to creep in.|$|E
5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter {{at a distance of}} about 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii).

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E

5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists {{in the form of}} pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E

5|$|The {{properties}} of the rock underneath the Everglades <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 millionyears ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered {{on the eastern side}} of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock. Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 millionyears ago. When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, {{similar to that of}} Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E
5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so {{at a lower}} speed than c, {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E
