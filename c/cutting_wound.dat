40|$|Many modern {{computer}} games and medical computer simulations feature skin injuries such as <b>cutting</b> <b>wounds.</b> These fields often approach this topic in different ways, where medical simulations commonly have a minimal visualization, and most games {{rely heavily on}} artistic influence. As far as we know, no methods currently exist that combine mesh cutting simulation with skin visualization techniques in order to synthesize <b>cutting</b> <b>wounds</b> during runtime. Previous literature fails to describe a complete remeshing scheme that can handle arbitrary cuts while maintaining the topology and parameterization of an input surface mesh. Additionally, the appearance and synthesis of <b>cutting</b> <b>wounds</b> has not been sufficiently addressed. In this thesis, we explore the feasibility of constructing a damage model that simulates and visualizes natural-looking <b>cutting</b> <b>wounds</b> by generating new geometry and textures maps on the fly. We describe a cutting simulation approach which merges a cutting line into the mesh surface that is subsequently opened to reveal interior wound geometry generated at runtime. For visualizing the surface injury we generate a wound texture during runtime and propose an extension to subsurface scattering to locally discolor the skin surface around the cut. Our approach is lightweight: using a mid-range desktop computer, cuts can be created in about 45 milliseconds on average, and a typical frame is rendered in about 2. 5 milliseconds. We think that our approach can be attractive for increasing the realism of <b>cutting</b> <b>wounds</b> in real-time applications without having to rely on specific artistic input...|$|R

40|$|Background: This article {{aimed to}} examine and compare the {{frequency}} of occurrence of {{a broad range of}} non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviours in an international sample of women. Methods: Female participants with NSSI (n = 464) were recruited via a range of websites and completed a questionnaire examining 17 different types of NSSI types and their frequency, severity, and duration. Results: Prevalent acts were cutting, scratching, and word carving; cutting and scratching occurred frequently, whilst word carving most often occurred as a single episode. Analyses revealed significant differences between Australian and U. S. participants, with U. S. participants having significantly higher rates of <b>cutting,</b> <b>wound</b> interference, carving, scratching, and sharp object sticking. Participants also reported on other self-harm methods not assessed by the questionnaire. Conclusions: Word carving may be qualitatively different from other forms of NSSI. More severe NSSI methods (e. g., bone breaking) are less prevalent than less dangerous methods (e. g., scratching). Participants considered a range of indirectly harmful or suicidal behaviours as self-injury contrary to researcher or clinician understanding. Finally, there may be cultural differences in relation to NSSI between countries where such behaviours are common, although further research is required to determine this...|$|E

We report the case of 27 years old boy with a tipping and <b>cutting</b> <b>wound</b> on his left wrist, generating an ulnar artery pseudoaneurysm, that was late diagnosed, and therefore complicated by a compartment syndrome in the wrist. Immediately after the trauma the subject went {{to the emergency room}} where the severity of the injury was undestimated; in fact, it was sutured and medicated, without further investigation. When he went to the same hospital for the second time, symptoms (pulsatile mass, redness and irritation of the skin) were interpreted as an infectious process and treated in an incongruous way. Then, when he went to another hospital in which imaging studies (ultrasound) were performed, the pseudo- aneurysm of the ulnar artery was diagnosed and surgically treated. The delay in diagnosis led to a compartment syndrome that is still appreciable as a sensory-motor deficit of the hand, especially of the fourth and fifth finger.

40|$|In my brief remarks, I {{consider}} {{what it means}} to return and rebind—that is to say, the significance of the re for Kristeva’s thought.   Kristeva does not just talk about binding or birth, or unbinding or death, but rather rebinding and rebirth, suggesting that it is a retrospective return rather than an original moment that is crucial.   The most significant moment, then, is not the moment of imaginary plenitude, nor the moment of originary loss, but rather the moment of rebirth that comes through rebinding after the loss of plenitude.  Indeed, Kristeva’s insistence on re-turning suggests that there is no originary moment of plenitude nor of castration or loss, but rather a constant movement of compensation for a recurrent loss.   By emphasizing rebinding and rebirth, she underscores not the loss as <b>cutting</b> <b>wound</b> but rather the healing power of signification, always already inherent within loss.   The flip-side of separation is reattachment.   And rather than just focus on the separation or cut, Kristeva looks to that which allows us to rebind and reattach in order to create relations that sustain us.   Both unbinding and binding are necessary for rebinding.   Thus, by focusing on rebinding, Kristeva insists on the process of unbinding and binding, and the oscillation between them. </p...|$|E

40|$|Acacia holosericea stems with {{attached}} phyllodes {{have potential}} as a cut foliage line in vase displays. However, they have a short vase life. Wounding that occurs during harvest induces ethylene production and promotes the senescence of many plant tissues, but effects on A. holosericea foliage longevity are not known. Wound ethylene was measured from mechanically injured A. holosericea phyllodes and stems at various developmental stages. Modulation of ethylene production was investigated using chemical inhibitor and promoter treatments. The ethylene binding inhibitor silver thiosulfate increased wound ethylene evolution, but did not differentially affect vase life. Vase life was prolonged by nano silver particles and silver nitrate treatments due to the antibacterial effects of these two Ag compounds. Treatments with the ethylene synthesis inhibitors α-aminoisobutyric acid and aminoethoxyvinylglycine and with the ethylene binding inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene had no significant effect on either wound ethylene production or vase life. Treatments with jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonic acid, which can act either synergistically or antagonistically with ethylene, both reduced vase life. Application of exogenous ethylene gas to detached stems induced ethylene production, accelerated senescence, and reduced vase life. However, treatment with the ethylene releasing compound ethephon generally {{had no effect on}} vase life. Considered collectively, the results suggest that short longevity of A. holosericea is largely independent of ethylene synthesis at the <b>cutting</b> <b>wound...</b>|$|E

To achieve uniformity among the national medical device regulatory systems and increase the access to safe, effective, and clinically beneficial medical technologies, the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) was conceived in 1992 by five members: European Union, United States, Australia, Japan, and Canada. All regulated countries have clearly defined medical devices, as has the GHTF. Although GHTF has tried to achieve harmonization with respect to medical devices, some differences still exist in the national laws of the countries of GHTF.

40|$|An {{electron}} microscope study of 2 cases of epithelial downgrowth after penetrating keratoplasty is presented. Several differences were observed between the normal epithelium and downgrowth epithelium at the ultrastructure level. At the advancing {{edge of the}} downgrowth a flattened and fibroblastic endothelium was still present. An interaction area was observed between these 2 tissues. The epithelial downgrowth usually has 5 to 6 layers of cells and either replaces damaged endothelium or destroys it as it advances.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that both salicylic acid and fungal elicitors activate a 48 -kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase termed salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) in tobacco suspension cells. Here, we show that infiltration of these agents into tobacco leaves also activates SIPK. Of particular interest, infiltration of water alone activated a kinase of the same size, possibly because of wounding and/or osmotic stresses. The kinetics of kinase activation, however, differ for these different treatments. Various mechanical stresses, including <b>cutting</b> and <b>wounding</b> by abrasion, also activated a 48 -kDa kinase. By using an immune-complex kinase assay with antibodies specific for SIPK or wounding-induced protein kinase, we demonstrate that this wounding-activated 48 -kDa kinase is SIPK, rather than wounding-induced protein kinase, as reported [Seo, S., Okamoto, M., Seto, H., Ishizuka, K., Sano, H. & Ohashi, Y. (1995) Science 270, 1988 – 1992]. Activation of SIPK after wounding was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation but not with increases in SIPK mRNA or protein levels.
