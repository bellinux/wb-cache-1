40|$|A {{scientific}} Working Group on Gluten set {{up under}} the auspices of the Additives, Contaminants and Residues Sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland’s Scientific Committee, has advised the Authority on issues of relevance to the coeliac condition, including the gluten-free diet, its nutritional quality and the need for Irish standards for levels of gluten in food suitable for people who are intolerant to gluten. The Working Group on Gluten concluded that the coeliac condition is a potentially significant cause of poor health in the Irish population, with a prevalence of five to ten cases per 1, 000 of the adult population. Adverse health effects in affected persons can be controlled by strict adherence to a gluten-free 1 diet or one that is low in gluten due to use of cereal ingredients that have been rendered gluten-free. Nonetheless, unintended exposure may occur as a consequence of the presence of gluten in foods believed by the consumer to be gluten-free or low in gluten, due to cross contamination during production or manufacture. It is therefore essential to maintain an ongoing programme of surveillance of such foods. The Working Group reviewed currently available analytical techniques for gluten in food and noted that these appear to present improved alternatives to the method laid down in the out-dated 1983 <b>Codex</b> <b>Standard</b> for gluten-free food. There are limitations to the use of this standard in assessing compliance of a food product with food safety legislation, and a new <b>Codex</b> <b>Standard</b> has recently been agreed by the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU), at its 2007 meeting.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the changes in physicochemical and fatty acid composition of groundnut oil when stored in different packaging materials, exposed to light or stored in the dark. Physicochemical parameters such as specific gravity, refractive index, unsaponifiable matters, iodine values, peroxide values and free fatty acids of the oil were determined using standard procedures every 2 weeks for 14 weeks. The fatty acids (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) were analysed with the aid of an electronic acid profile analyzer. Statistical analysis showed that specific gravity, refractive index, unsaponifiable matter and iodine content of groundnut oil packaged with glass bottles and stored in an open space was significantly different from control (freshly bought) (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Aflatoxins are fungal toxins {{that have}} carcinogenic, {{cellular}} mutations and malformation effects. Aflatoxin M 1 resists pasteurization, autoclave {{and the other}} methods that make foodstuff healthy. This study aims to determine the contents of aflatoxin M 1 in raw milk of milk factories in Kermanshah province. Materials and Methods: This research is carried out through the descriptive-cross sectional method. Among the raw milk received by four pasteurized milk factories in Kermanshah, coded by (A, B, C, D) labels, six samples, totally 320 samples (80 samples from each factory), were taken within four seasons. The concentration of aflatoxin M 1 was examined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The mean difference was analyzed statistically through t-test using SPSS software. Results: The content of aflatoxin was higher than <b>Codex</b> <b>standard</b> (0. 5 µg/l) in 295 samples. The total mean was 1. 21, which exceeds two times the <b>Codex</b> <b>standard.</b> The highest and lowest contents of aflatoxin M 1 were observed in “Factory D” in spring and in “Factory A” in autumn, respectively. There {{was a significant difference}} between contamination of aflatoxin M 1 and different seasons (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: High content of aflatoxin M 1 in raw milk is worrying.
