The modelling process is briefly considered in the context of model classification, data adjustment and parameter estimation. The features of a good simulator are enumerated, and recent progress in simulator development and application is discussed. Models currently available are reviewed, with particular reference to those incorporated in the JKMRC Simulator, JKSimMet. and its derivatives. These include crushers, SAG mills, ball mills, screens, hydrocyclones and other classifiers.

50|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{an important}} <b>concentration</b> <b>process.</b> This process {{can be used to}} separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound {{to the surface of the}} bubbles. The driving force for this attachment is the change in the surface free energy when the attachment occurs. These bubbles rise through the slurry and are collected from the surface. To enable these particles to attach, careful consideration of the chemistry of the pulp needs to be made. These considerations include the pH, Eh and the presence of flotation reagents. The pH is important as it changes the charge of the particles surface and the Eh affects the chemisorption of collectors on the surface of the particles.|$|E
50|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{begins with}} beneficiation, consisting of initially {{breaking down the}} ore to required sizes depending on the <b>concentration</b> <b>process</b> to be followed, by crushing, grinding, sieving etc. Thereafter, the ore is physically separated from any unwanted impurity, depending on the form of occurrence and/or further process involved. Separation processes take advantage of physical properties of the materials. These physical properties can include density, particle size and shape, electrical and magnetic properties, and surface properties. Major physical and chemical methods include magnetic separation, froth flotation, leaching etc., whereby the impurities and unwanted materials are removed from the ore and the base ore of the metal is concentrated, meaning the percentage of metal in the ore is increased. This concentrate is then either processed to remove moisture or else used as is for extraction of the metal or made into shapes and forms that can undergo further processing, with ease of handling.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMilk {{concentration}} and spray drying are highly energy-intensive operations, for which energy consumption {{accounts for about}} 25 % of the French dairy processing industry. A major challenge consists then {{in the design and}} development of sustainable dairy <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> which integrate technical, economic and environmental criteria. For this purpose, systems oriented tools have already been developed in the chemical industry by using a systemic approach combining modelling, simulation, and optimisation. Despite the proximity of chemical with food and bioengineering sectors, the utilization of such an approach for the modelling of dairy processes suffers from a lack of process models, more particularly when the whole process is considered and when <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> are involved. In that context, this work constitutes a preliminary study towards the development of a methodological framework for modelling and optimizing dairy processes. The proposed strategy consists in the combination of a chemical process simulator (ASPEN PLUS 7. 3, AspenTech, Inc.) with an environmental model based on Life Cycle Assessment concepts. The simulated process concerns milk powder production, and more particularly milk concentration prior to drying, involving pre-heating, pasteurization, and evaporation steps. The process model performances are assessed through a sensitivity study on the number of effects in the evaporator, and the environmental impacts associated to the various steam requirements involved are quantified according to several scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} behaviours {{of mineral}} particles in mineral processing operations have been exploited {{in the past}} to model comminution and <b>concentration</b> <b>processes.</b> In this work this concept has been taken a step further, exploiting the mineralogical characteristics of particles to link comminution, concentration and smelting. This approach is demonstrated using a laboratory-based case study of a Ni-Cu sulphide ore. The case study focused on the effect of shifting energy between the comminution and smelting stages on the overall energy consumption for the metal production process. To model this effect the mineral composition of the particles was linked to the behaviour of the ore particles in the primary grinding, regrinding and flotation stages. This application of process mineralogy provides a methodology to minimise energy use across mineral <b>concentration</b> and smelting <b>processes,</b> an important aspect of sustainable processing. © 2011...|$|R
