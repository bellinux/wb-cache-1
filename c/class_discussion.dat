2500|$|In December 2013, the Canadian Association of University Teachers {{passed a}} {{resolution}} calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further. This action followed upon the Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec closing its Confucius Institute, the University of Manitoba voting against hosting a CI out of concerns over political censorship, and McMaster University cancelling its CI contract following an instructor's human rights complaint. CAUT executive director James Turk said Canadian universities that agree to host CIs are compromising their own integrity by allowing the Hanban {{to have a voice}} in academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of <b>class</b> <b>discussion,</b> describing such interference as a [...] "fundamental violation of academic freedom." [...] Turk described CIs as [...] "essentially political arms of the Chinese government", which restrict the free discussion of topics Chinese authorities deem controversial, and [...] "should have no place on our campuses." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did {{not impose}} his artistic style or {{techniques}} on his students; in fact, he kept {{much of his}} work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys' actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality {{and the need for}} students to take draughtsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys' pedagogy included open “ring discussions,” where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of Beuys' ideas espoused in <b>class</b> <b>discussion</b> and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that “everyone [...] an artist.” Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys' students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder, anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.|$|E

Students are encouraged to think about the benefits of friendship and consider the barriers to friendship the focus child encounters, and also empathize and share their own experiences with friendship. The focus child’s strengths and difficulties are discussed, and links between the focus child’s behavior and problems with peer relationships are made. Making these links is an important first step in problem solving solutions. At the close of the meeting, six to eight volunteers are sought {{to take part in the}} Circle of Friends.|$|E
30|$|Though {{these studies}} {{indicate}} {{a positive impact}} of random call on student outcomes, they do not address participants’ concerns that students will feel uncomfortable and anxious. Classes in which students feel comfortable participating in <b>class</b> <b>discussions</b> {{have higher levels of}} participation in these conversations, so student comfort cannot be overlooked (Dallimore et al. 2010). A study of multiple instructors teaching the same course examined the effect of different levels of random call, which they referred to as cold-calling. The random call was significantly associated with students voluntarily answering questions. Additionally, students in classes using higher levels of random call reported a greater increase in their comfort level with participating in <b>class</b> <b>discussions</b> (Dallimore et al. 2013). The authors hypothesize that the chance to practice sharing ideas in <b>class</b> <b>discussions,</b> which occurs when a student is randomly selected to share, actually increases student comfort with sharing their ideas and thus makes them more likely to volunteer to answer questions in the future. These empirical findings run contrary to the sentiment that random call should be avoided due to student discomfort.|$|R
