40|$|The {{literature}} on reading aloud indicates a positive result when children read aloud with others. Reading aloud {{is found to}} enhance a student's vocabulary, to familiarize students with language patterns and sentence structure, to help students develop listening skills and increased attention spans, and to build children's <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> <b>reading.</b> Children's creativity and competence were {{closely related to the}} quantity of parent-child reading in the home, which can enhance the child's early reading capabilities. Educators continue to recognize that children who come from homes in which children read with parents have an advantage over those students not involved in shared reading, and the difference in these circumstances may be considered a factor in the continual discrepancy of reading proficiencies in schools today.

40|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} philosophers of eighteenth-century Europe. In 1762 Rousseau published his treatise on education titled Emile. In Emile, Rousseau argues that people require an education that returns them to themselves. He demonstrates how he could take on an ordinary boy (Emile) as his pupil and experiment with the possibility of raising him into an autonomous adult, both morally and intellectually. In 1963, Julio Cortázar published Hopscotch in its original Spanish title Rayuela. Cortázar wrote Hopscotch in a way that allows the reader to decide what role, if any, the last ninety-eight chapter sections have <b>in</b> the <b>reading.</b> Many of these sections seem irrelevant to the underlying story. Both Rousseau and Cortázar emphasize the importance of autonomy and <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> what deals with one 2 ̆ 7 s education. In this research, I analyze ways that Rousseau creates an environment in which Emile feels he must rely on his own abilities, and how Emile depends on his autonomy and curiosity to solve problems. At the same time, I demonstrate how Cortázar puts in practice many of the same techniques to encourage his readers to acknowledge their autonomy and <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> their <b>reading</b> of Hopscotch. Although Rousseau and Cortázar raise important ideas about individual autonomy, they reveal the counterintuitive nature of well-regulated freedom...|$|R
