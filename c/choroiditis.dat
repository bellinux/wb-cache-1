50|$|Multifocal <b>choroiditis</b> and panuveitis (MCP) is an {{idiopathic}} inflammatory {{disorder of}} unknown etiology affecting the choroid, retina, and vitreous {{of the eye}} that presents asymmetrically, most often in young myopic women with photopsias, enlargement of the physiologic blind spot and decreased vision.|$|E
50|$|This {{condition}} {{has also}} {{been identified as a}} common initial symptom of Punctate inner <b>choroiditis</b> (PIC), a rare retinal autoimmune disease believed to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying the retina.

50|$|Chorioretinitis is an {{inflammation}} of the choroid (thin pigmented vascular coat of the eye) and retina of the eye. It {{is a form of}} posterior uveitis. If only the choroid is inflamed, not the retina, the condition is termed <b>choroiditis.</b> The ophthalmologist's goal in treating these potentially blinding conditions is to eliminate the inflammation and minimize the potential risk of therapy to the patient.|$|E
50|$|He {{developed}} an early interest in geology while at school in Ipswich through fossil collecting and visiting local museums. As a teen {{he founded the}} Ipswich and District Field Club, which led to his election to as {{a fellow of the}} Geological Society of London in 1907. However, possibly {{as a result of his}} explorations, he developed <b>choroiditis</b> in both his eyes at 18 and nearly went blind; he never fully regained sight in his right eye.|$|E
50|$|Multifocal <b>Choroiditis</b> (MPC) occurs {{mainly in}} myopic females. The fundus {{presents}} with yellow or gray lesions (white dots) {{at the level}} of the choroid and RPE. The size of the white dots are between 50 and 500 micrometres and localized in the macula. MPC is characterized by vitritis and anterior chamber inflammation. Decreased vision due to vitreous inflammation may occur. Unlike MEWDS, MPC is a chronic disorder and macular scarring contributes to severe visual loss. Theories regarding the cause include an exogenous pathogen sensitizing an individual to antigens within photoreceptors, RPE, or choroid.|$|E
50|$|In the US {{corticotropin}} is used {{to treat}} epileptic spasms in infants, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults; acute episodes of psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic dermatomyositis; for skin conditions like severe erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; for serum sickness; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as keratitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, diffuse posterior uveitis, <b>choroiditis,</b> optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, and anterior segment inflammation; sarcoidosis in the lungs; and to treat edema in certain nephrotic syndromes.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease was}} first {{characterized}} in 1971, in Japan. Akira Urayama {{and his colleagues}} had six patients whose cases showed signs of acute necrotizing retinitis, retinal arertitis, <b>choroiditis,</b> and late-onset retinal detachment. The combination of the conditions was given the name acute retinal necrosis. The first reports of ARN came about in 1971. It is unclear whether it was previously just reported as something else. Urayama and his colleagues reported the disease that they saw in six Japanese patients. Since then the disease has been seen in patient's with AIDS, children, {{and people who are}} immunocompromised. In 1978, Young and Bird named the disease when presented in both eyes, Bilateral Acute Retinal Necrosis, otherwise known as BARN.|$|E
50|$|Uveitis {{refers to}} {{a large group of}} {{disorders}} which cause inflammation within the eye. A similar condition, iritis, usually {{refers to a}}n inflammation involving the front structures of the eye associated with pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. In this discussion, uveitis could have these symptoms, but mainly consists of inflammation involving the back structures of the eye (the retina, choroid, and optic nerve). Inflammatory debris liberated into the vitreous leads to the visualization of floaters. If this liberation continues, the vision may become substantially hazy and blurred. There are numerous conditions leading to uveitis, and many have floaters and blurred vision as predominant symptoms: sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis, ocular histoplasmosis, multifocal <b>choroiditis,</b> pars planitis, endophalmitis, syphilis, candidiasis, viral uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and HIV related uveitis.|$|E
50|$|The white dots of {{the white}} dot syndromes are lesions that vary in their {{location}} in the fundus {{and in most cases}} tend to disappear. White dots appear early in the disease stages of PIC and MEWDS. In this case, the white dot is localized in the posterior pole, small (between 25 and 100 μm), and do not clump together. In contrast, white dots appear later in the disease stages of birdshot choroidopathy, serpiginous <b>choroiditis,</b> and APMPPE. The white dots in these diseases may be present throughout the entire fundus, larger (50 to 500 μm), and tend to clump together. Among all these syndromes, there exists some retinal vessel inflammation. The differences in the dots are usually in the size, position, and depth of the lesion within the choroid.|$|E
50|$|The Moreaus {{moved in}} March 1928 {{from the desert}} to the rainforests of the Usambara Mountains with their {{children}} David and Prinia. They often suffered from malaria and dysentery. Here, however he had access to a library and soon became librarian and also took up the editorial role of the East African Agricultural Journal. He did {{not have access to}} any books on the birds of the region until Admiral Hubert Lynes gave him a copy of Anton Reichenow's Vogel Afrikas. Still later Arthur Loveridge who employed a part-time native collector Salimu Asmani asked Moreau if Salimu could be employed. Salimu {{turned out to be a}} very good observer. The British Museum hardly had bird specimens from this region which was largely German controlled. Through C.B. Williams' efforts, some funds were diverted to help employ Salimu, Charles Abdallah and other African assistants. Through these assistants, Moreau obtained notes on incubation, feeding and collected a mass of data on bird nesting. In 1931 a species of bird that he collected was named after him by W.L. Sclater as Artisornis moreaui. In 1938 Moreau discovered another species of warbler which he named after his wife, initially as another species of Artisornis but later as Scepomycter winifredae. The Moreau's were also among the first Europeans to note the joking relationships or the utani system that connected tribes in East Africa. In 1934 the station was visited by David Lack and in 1939 by W. H. Thorpe and his wife. Thorpe had made the trip to find a giant coccid. In 1936 they moved the children to England for their education, they only saw them again during their next leave in 1939 and then did not see them again until they returned to England after the war. In June 1946 Moreau developed <b>choroiditis</b> which threatened his eyesight. This led to his leaving Africa and retiring to England. He published nearly 80 papers while at Amani but still had work to be done. David Lack offered him a part-time position at the Edward Grey Institute while Thorpe offered him a place in his Cambridge section of Animal Behaviour. He also was invited to the editorship of the ornithological journal, Ibis. He received an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Oxford on 15 December 1951. He retired from the editorship of Ibis in 1960 and from the Edward Grey Institute in July 1964. The British Ornithologists' Union awarded him the Godman-Salvin award at their Annual General Meeting on 3 April 1966.|$|E

30|$|Serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> is a progressive, chronic, {{recurrent}} {{inflammatory disease}} primarily affecting the inner choroid and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layer [1].

30|$|ICG hyperfluorescence is {{believed}} to result from two mechanisms [18] in inflammatory disorders of the fundus, and therefore, <b>choroiditis</b> has been divided into two broad categories, choriocapillaritis versus stromal <b>choroiditis</b> [20]. Inflammatory choriocapillaritis may lead to non-perfusion, identified early with dye-based angiography, and irregular areas of hypofluorescent staining. This ICG pattern is best displayed in placoid disorders including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) and serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> (SC).|$|E
30|$|Of {{the battery}} of tests {{performed}} in our patient, tuberculin skin test showed a 20 -mm induration and QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was positive. Active tuberculous posterior uveitis is a remote possibility in the present case. Posterior segment manifestations of tuberculosis mainly include vitritis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuritis, choroidal tubercles, serpiginous-like <b>choroiditis,</b> and choroidal tuberculoma. Serpiginous-like <b>choroiditis</b> also called multifocal serpiginoid <b>choroiditis</b> may simulate APMPPE. It usually presents as multifocal lesions showing a wave-like progression and/or a plaque-like <b>choroiditis</b> with amoeboid spread. It is usually associated with vitritis and is typically characterized by the coexistence in the same patient of active and healed chroidal lesions [14, 15]. None of the clinical features in our patient was consistent with serpiginous-like <b>choroiditis.</b> Ocular manisfestations {{were considered to be}} associated with but not related to latent tuberculosis, and the patient was given only prophylactic anti-tubercular treatment and not a full anti-tubercular regimen. The persistence of only mild residual retinal pigment epithelial changes and good visual outcome in this case further argue against serpiginous-like <b>choroiditis</b> [14, 15].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{study of}} real time Polymerase Chain Reaction for Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tuberculosis) DNA in 29 cases of active serpiginous <b>choroiditis.</b> Design: Case control study. Methods: DNA extraction from the aqueous humor {{was carried out}} using QIAMP DNA extraction kit. Real- time Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) for MTB was carried out using Genosen’s Mtb complex quantitative Real time PCR kit. All patients were also subjected to complete blood count, venereal disease research laboratory test, chest radiograph, QuantiFERON TB Gold test on the blood and polymerase chain reaction on a sample of aqueous humor. Results: Aqueous aspirate showed copies of mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in one out of twenty nine cases of serpiginous <b>choroiditis.</b> Direct smear and culture for mycobacteria was negative in all cases. Conclusion: RT-PCR identifies MTB DNA in suspected latent tuberculosis in serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> with high specificity. Serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> and multifocal <b>choroiditis</b> due to tuberculosis may resemble each other clinically but have distinct clinical features which can be confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction performed on the aqueous humor The association between serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> and tuberculosis would be a chance association or if present a rare association...|$|E

Detailed {{review of the literature}} on ICGA was performed. Retrospective review of medical records of patients with posterior uveitis and dual fundus and ICGA was done after institutional board approval. Eighteen patients (26 eyes) had serpiginous <b>choroiditis</b> out of which 12 patients had active <b>choroiditis</b> and six patients had healed <b>choroiditis,</b> six patients (12 eyes) had ampiginous <b>choroiditis,</b> six patients (12 eyes) had acute multifocal posterior placoid pigment epitheliopathy, eight patients (10 eyes) had multifocal <b>choroiditis,</b> four patients (eight eyes) had presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, four patients (eight eyes) had presumed tuberculous <b>choroiditis,</b> two patients (four eyes) had multiple evanescent white dot syndrome and two patients (four eyes) had Vogt Koyanagi Harada (VKH) syndrome. The most characteristic feature noted on ICGA was the presence of different patterns of hypofluorescent dark spots, which were present at different stages of the angiogram. ICGA provides the clinician with a powerful adjunctive tool in choroidal inflammatory disorders. It is not meant to replace already proven modalities such as the fluorescein angiography, but it can provide additional information that is useful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis in inflammatory chorioretinal diseases associated with multiple spots. It still needs to be determined if ICGA can prove to be a follow up parameter to evaluate disease progression...|$|E
