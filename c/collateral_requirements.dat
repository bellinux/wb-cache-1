40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{different}} organizational forms of REITs (internally-advised versus externally-advised) on loan contract terms and relationship lending. We find that externally advised REITs have lower loan rates and lower <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> in their loan transactions. In contrast, internally advised REITS have higher benefits from relationship lending in that they get a larger discount in terms of loan rate and <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> from their relationship banks when they take loans. Further, banks having relationships with externally advised REITs also have a lower likelihood of securing future business from them. Our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that external REITs have lower information opacity and consequently receive lower benefits from relationship lending. Our results support the notion that the benefits from relationship lending outweigh any hold-up costs. Further, our results also provide a partial resolution of the external advisor puzzle in the real estate literature...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive examination {{of differences between}} relationship bank behavior {{for a set of}} borrowers that either underwent distress or filed for bankruptcy relative to normal times. Prior to distress, banks offer preferential contract terms in the form of lower interest rates and less <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> to their relationship borrowers. After the onset of distress, banks offer identical loan contract terms to their relationship borrowers and outside borrowers. Further, loan availability from relationship lenders (relative to outside lenders) is significantly lower after the onset of distress. However, after filing for bankruptcy, banks again offer preferential terms to their relationship borrowers in terms of <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement.</b> Further, availability of loans from relationship lenders is comparable to that in normal times. Our findings contribute to both the literature on soft budget constraints as well as that on DIP financing. ∗We would like to thank Yakov Amihud, Miao Bin, Edmund Cheung, Allaudeen Hameed, Srinivasan Sankaraguruswamy and seminar participants at Korea University and Financial Management Association for their comments on earlier drafts.

40|$|We {{model the}} role of the {{informal}} credit sector in developing countries. The informational advantage of informal lenders is portrayed as the ability to monitor borrowers. Monitoring reduces the incentive problem and allows for contracts with lower collateral. This enables informal lenders to serve both individuals who cannot post the collateral required by the formal sector and those who are able but do not want to post collateral. The model is consistent with the conventional view of the informal sector as recipient of spillover demand from the formal sector. It also shows that the informal sector may provide partial insurance as the lower <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> implies greater consumption smoothing for borrowers.

50|$|Through {{feedback}} from nonprofit customers, Davis {{became aware that}} many nonprofits struggled to obtain credit from traditional lenders. Many lenders required personal guarantees or collateral, and many did not offer nonprofits small working capital loans. In order to better understand nonprofits' credit needs and the feasibility of offering small working capital loans, Davis created the NIAC Member Loan Fund, a pilot program that makes 1-year working capital loans of up to $50,000 to NIAC insurance customers. These loans have no personal guarantee or <b>collateral</b> <b>requirements</b> and take {{less than a month}} for review and approval. NIAC is using data from the loan fund to develop risk models specific to nonprofit borrowers. These models allow NIAC and other lenders to underwrite these loans more easily and offer them at a larger scale.|$|E
50|$|Collaborative finance is a {{category}} of financial transaction that occurs directly between individuals without the intermediation of a traditional financial institution. This new way to manage informal financial transactions has been enabled by advances in social media and peer-to-peer online platforms. The wide variety of collaborative finance resources may vary not only in their organizational and operational aspects, but also by geographical region, share of the financial market etc. It is precisely this heterogeneity that enables the informal savings and credit activity to profitably reach those income-groups not served by commercial banks and other financial institutions. It is their informality, adaptability and flexibility of operations - characteristics which reduce their transactions costs and confers upon them their comparative advantage and economic rationale. Collaborative Finance is characterized by highly personalized loan transactions entailing face-to-face dealings with borrowers and flexibility in respect of loan purpose, interest rates, <b>collateral</b> <b>requirements,</b> maturity periods and debt rescheduling.|$|E

The terms of credit contracts include both an interest rate and a <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement.</b> We show that in this richer model all types of borrowers may be rationed. Interest rates charged borrowers may move either pro or counter-cyclically. If pro-cyclical shocks have a greater effect on the success probabilities of risky techniques than on safe ones, then the interest rate offered depositors may also move counter-cyclically. Finally, we show {{that the impact of}} monetary policy on the macro-economic equilibrium is affected by whether or not the economy is in a regime in which credit is rationed. ...|$|R

50|$|Impatient borrowers {{drive the}} {{interest}} rate higher while nervous lenders demand more collateral, a borrower’s willingness to pay a higher interest to ease {{the concerns of the}} nervous lender may not necessarily satisfy the lender. Before the financial crisis of 2008 hit, lenders were less nervous. As a result, they were willing to make subprime mortgage loans. Consider an individual who took out a subprime mortgage loan paying a high interest relative to a prime mortgage loan and putting up only 5% collateral, a leverage of 20. During the crisis, lenders become more nervous. As a result, they demand 20% as collateral, even though there is sufficient liquidity in the system. The individual who took out a subprime loan is probably {{not in a position to}} buy a house now, regardless of how low {{the interest rate}}s are. Therefore, in addition to interest rates, <b>collateral</b> <b>requirements</b> should also be taken into consideration in determining the demand and supply of loans.|$|E
5000|$|Access {{to finance}} {{remains one of}} the key {{problems}} for enterprises operating in Syria particularly for small and medium enterprises (SME's). In spite of the reforms initiated by the government and the Central Bank of Syria, the legal and regulatory environment remained relatively underdeveloped and the ranges of banking and financial services for the enterprise sector were limited. Syria ranked 181st out of 183 economies worldwide in the ease of getting credit, putting the country in the bottom three. As of 2009, credit information services and credit guarantee schemes or credit bureau registry that could supported access to credit by reducing <b>collateral</b> <b>requirements</b> were not available in Syria. Few microfinance facilities exist and most of these operate as pilot projects.

50|$|The {{key market}} imperfection, the pecuniary externality, {{is defined as}} a {{particular}} form of externality that a private agent's optimal decision affects the welfare of another agent through prices. Other market distortions, such as the incomplete markets in which private agents cannot fully insure their idiosyncratic risks, the information asymmetry and limited commitment by which lenders do not know whether or not the borrowers will default and thus have <b>collateral</b> <b>requirements</b> on the borrowers, could aggravate the role of pecuniary externality. When applied to the open economy context with incomplete markets that involves external borrowing and collateral constraint, the pecuniary externality can be used to explain the stylized fact of an open economy’s excessive borrowing from outside the country as seen by overly large amount of capital inflow: small, rational and individual domestic private agents take as given the exchange rates and asset prices that determine the external borrowing limit, but they do not internalize the price effects of their individual actions that their joint behavior could determine the level of exchange rates and asset prices and hence the degree of financial fragility in the economy. In other words, private agents take too much risk. Then their aggregate borrowing exceeds the socially efficient level so that the risk of a financial systemic collapse is created and it could potentially lead to a financial crisis and economic downturn.|$|E
50|$|The Kiyotaki-Moore {{model of}} credit cycles is an {{economic}} model developed by Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John H. Moore that shows how small shocks to the economy might be amplified by credit restrictions, giving rise to large output fluctuations. The model assumes that borrowers cannot be forced to repay their debts. Therefore, in equilibrium, lending occurs {{only if it is}} collateralized. That is, borrowers must own a sufficient quantity of capital that can be confiscated in case they fail to repay. This <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> amplifies business cycle fluctuations because in a recession, the income from capital falls, causing the price of capital to fall, which makes capital less valuable as collateral, which limits firms' investment by forcing them to reduce their borrowing, and thereby worsens the recession.|$|R

On the other hand, it creates a good platform to share experiences of different business persons. Both reinforce the logic behind the positive and significant variable’s coefficient. On the contrary, membership in local cooperative has no impact on probability of being self-employed. It may emanate from a very limited human and financial capacities of majority of cooperatives operate in Ethiopia.|$|R

The informational advantage of informal lenders is portrayed as the ability to monitor borrowers. Monitoring reduces the incentive problem and allows for contracts with lower collateral. This enables informal lenders to serve two types of clients: 1) Those who cannot post the collateral required by the formal sector; and 2) Those who are able but do not want to post collateral. The model is thus consistent with the conventional view of the informal sector as recipient of spillover demand (quantity rationed) from the formal sector. It also demonstrates an additional role of the informal sector- namely as provider of insurance as the lower <b>collateral</b> <b>requirement</b> implies greater consumption smoothing across states of nature...|$|R
