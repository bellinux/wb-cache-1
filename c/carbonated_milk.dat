40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{processing}} {{parameters of}} and processing procedures for sweetened blueberry flavored <b>carbonated</b> <b>milk</b> beverages {{were developed in}} this study. Foam formation of the milk after carbonation was controlled by a precharging of the vessel headspace. A combination of heat treatment (85 °C, 30 minutes) and CMC addition was conducted to minimize the acid coagulation of casein with added fruit concentrate. Both carbonated and noncarbonated, sweetened blueberry flavored milk were evaluated by a trained panel. The effect of carbonation and sweetener source on taste properties in a blueberry flavored milk beverage system were discussed. Carbonation enhanced the sensory rating of overall intensity, sweetness and blueberry flavor. There was no significant carbonation effect on perceived viscosity. The sweetener source (sucrose, HFCS, pear concentrate and aspartame) caused {{a significant effect on}} the sensory rating of viscosity, but a nonsignificant effect on that of overall intensity, sweetness and blueberry flavor. Two consumer panels evaluated the carbonated, sweetened blueberry flavored milk beverages. The percentage of panelists who liked the products was approximately 50...|$|E

5000|$|Milkis (Korean: 밀키스) is a {{soft drink}} {{produced}} by Lotte Chilsung, a South Korean beverage company. It combines {{many of the}} common elements of traditional carbonated beverages such as corn syrup, sugar, and <b>carbonated</b> water with <b>milk</b> to create a creamy taste; its label proclaims [...] "New feeling of soda beverage". Milkis is available in orange, strawberry, mango, melon, banana, peach, apple and classic (regular) flavors. It is a popular beverage in South Korea, and it remains widely available worldwide.|$|R
40|$|A censored Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) and a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) were {{estimated}} in modeling non-alcoholic beverages. Five estimation techniques were used, including the conventional Iterated Seemingly Unrelated Regression (ITSUR), two-stage {{methods such as}} the Heien and Wessells (1990) and the Shonkwiler and Yen (1999) approaches, the generalized maximum entropy method and the Amemiya-Tobin framework of Dong, Gould and Kaiser (2004). Our results based on various specifications and estimation techniques are quantitatively similar and indicate that price elasticity estimates have a greater variability in more highly censored non-alcoholic beverage items such as tea, coffee and bottled water as opposed to less censored non-alcoholic beverage items such as <b>carbonated</b> softdrinks, <b>milk</b> and fruit juices.

40|$|Due to {{technical}} simplicity and strong inhibition against {{the growth of}} psychrotrophic bacteria in milk, CO treatment has emerged as an attractive processing aid to increase the storage time of raw milk before downstream processing. However, it {{is yet to be}} adopted by the industry. In order to further explore the suitability of CO treatment for raw milk processing, the bacterial populations of <b>carbonated</b> raw <b>milk</b> collected locally from five different sources in Australia were analysed with next-generation sequencing. Growth inhibition by CO was confirmed, with spoilage delayed by at least 7  days compared with non-carbonated controls. All non-carbonated controls were spoiled by Gammaproteobacteria, namely Pseudomonas fluorescens group bacteria, Serratia and Erwinia. Two out of the five carbonated samples shared the same spoilage bacteria as their corresponding controls. The rest of the three carbonated samples were spoiled by the lactic acid bacterium (LAB) Leuconostoc. This is consistent with higher tolerance of LAB towards CO and selection of LAB in meat products stored in CO-enriched modified atmosphere packaging. No harmful bacteria were found to be selected by CO. LAB are generally regarded as safe (GRAS), thus the selection for Leuconostoc by CO in some of the samples poses no safety concern. In addition, we have confirmed previous findings that 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons from the same sample yield highly similar results. This supports comparison of results obtained with the two different sequencing platforms, which may be necessary considering the imminent discontinuation of 454 pyrosequencing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} ACNielsen Homescan Panel (HSD) in three separate demand analyses of dairy products: (1) the effect of using cross-sectional data in a New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) study of ice cream firm mergers in San Antonio; (2) the estimation of hedonic price models for fluid milk by quart, halfgallon and gallon container sizes; (3) the estimation of a demand system including white <b>milk,</b> flavored <b>milk,</b> <b>carbonated</b> soft drinks, bottled water, and fruit juice by various container sizes. In the NEIO study a standard LA/AIDS demand system was used to estimate elasticities evaluating seven simulated mergers of ice cream manufactures in San Antonio in 1999. Unlike previously published NEIO work, {{it is the first}} to use crosssectional data to address the issue associated with inventory effects. Using the method developed by Capps, Church and Love, none of the simulated price effects associated with the mergers was statistically different from zero at the 5 % confidence level. In 1995 Nerlove proposed a quantity-dependent hedonic model as a viable alternative to the conventional price-dependent hedonic model as a means to ascertain consumer willingness to pay for the characteristics of a given good. We revisited Nerlove?s work validating his model using transactional data indigenous to the HSD. Hedonic models, both price-dependent and quantity-dependent, were estimated for the characteristics of fat content, container type, and brand designation for the container sizes of gallon, half- gallon, and quart. A rigorous explanation of the interpretation between the estimates derived from the two hedonic models was discussed. Using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), a matrix of own-price, crossprice, and expenditure elasticities was estimated involving various container sizes of white <b>milk,</b> flavored <b>milk,</b> <b>carbonated</b> soft drinks, bottled water, and fruit juices, using a cross-section of the 1999 HSD. We described price imputations and the handling of censored observations to develop the respective elasticities. These elasticities provided information about intra-product relationships (same product but different sizes), intrasize relationships (different products same container size), and inter-product relationships (different products and different sizes). This container size issue is unique in the extant literature associated with non-alcoholic beverage industry...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition, with a {{prevalence}} {{of up to}} 10 – 20 % in the general population. GERD may involve damage to the oral cavity, and dental erosion may occur with a higher frequency. Aim: To estimate the {{prevalence of}} dental erosion in GERD patients and to evaluate the association between dental erosion and possible risk factors. Materials and Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow among patients attending outpatient department between June and August 2014. The study group comprised 91 subjects with GERD and 114 subjects without GERD. Information regarding symptoms of GERD, medicines, any chronic disease, and dietary habits were recorded. Dental examination was done to assess {{the presence or absence of}} dental erosions and its severity was measured using O'Sullivan Index (2000). Statistical analysis was done using Mann–Whitney U-test and Kruskal–Wallis test. Results: Of 91 GERD patients, 87 (95. 6 %) patients had dental erosion. In both groups, association between frequent intake of fruit juice, <b>carbonated</b> drinks, <b>milk,</b> yoghurt, fruits, and tea/coffee with occurrence of dental erosion were statistically significant (P < 0. 05). In GERD patients, association between intake of milk and occurrence of dental erosion were statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Association of medication with dental erosion was found to be statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma were also found to be statistically significant with dental erosion (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: This study showed that GERD patients were at increased risk of developing dental erosion compared to controls...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{consumer demand}} and nutritional {{issues associated with}} nonalcoholic beverages purchased for at-home use by looking at demographic variables such as household size, household income, education level, and region. The beverages include <b>milk,</b> <b>carbonated</b> soft drinks, bottled water, fruit juices, fruit drinks, coffee, tea, and isotonics (sports drinks). The report's {{focus is on the}} impact of nutritional quality from beverage purchase choices that a household makes, looking at the household's availability of calories, calcium, vitamin C, and caffeine from these beverage choices. Using the Daily Values on the Nutrition Facts portion of the food label as a reference, we find that nonalcoholic beverages purchased for at-home consumption provided, on a per-person basis: 10 percent of daily value for calories; 20 percent of the daily value for calcium; 70 percent of daily value for vitamin C. Statistical analyses included the use of descriptive cross-tabulations and regression analyses, with profiles of households that were more or less likely to purchase the beverages, as well as key determinants associated with the probability of purchasing selected beverages. nonalcoholic beverages, nutrient intake, cross-tabulations, regression analyses, probit analyses, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the demand of non-alcoholic beverages in Japanese household using the linear approximation quadratic almost ideal demand system model (LA/QUAIDS). Eight expenditure shares and prices demand equations for non-alcoholic beverage group: green tea, black tea, tea beverage, coffee, coffee beverage, {{fruit and vegetable}} juice, <b>carbonated</b> beverage and <b>milk</b> are estimated for two or more households in forty-nine cities for the period January 2000 through March 2013. The expenditure elasticity results indicate that green tea (2. 320), black tea (1. 357), coffee (1. 090) and fruit and vegetable juice (1. 019) are luxury goods while tea beverage (0. 836), coffee beverage (0. 896), carbonated beverage (0. 844) and milk (0. 677) are necessities in the Japanese household. The demographic effects reveal that people {{under the age of}} 18 prefer milk (5. 928) than any other beverages whereas elderly people tend to drink more green tea (24. 427). Moreover, temperature effects shows it has mostly positive effect on demand for tea beverage, coffee beverage, fruit and vegetable juice, and carbonated beverage and negative effect on green tea, black tea, and coffee in most of the months...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the dietary patterns of a Mediterranean cohort and relate them to the observed patterns of beverage consumption. Design: Prospective cohort study. Dietary habits were assessed with a semiquantitative FFQ validated in Spain. A principal components factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns and to classify subjects according to their adherence to these patterns. The association between adherence to each dietary pattern and beverage consumption was assessed cross-sectionally. In a longitudinal analysis (2 -year follow-up), the relationship between adherence to the baseline dietary patterns and the likelihood of changing alcohol consumption was ascertained. Setting: The SUN (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra) study is conducted in Spain. Subjects: In total, 15 073 university graduates were included in the analyses. Results: Two major dietary patterns were identified. We labelled them as ‘Western dietary pattern’ (WDP) and ‘Mediterranean dietary pattern’ (MDP). Higher adherence to the WDP was associated with higher consumption of carbonated beverages and whole-fat milk (P for trend, 0 ? 001), while higher adherence to the MDP was associated with higher consumption of decaffeinated coffee, orange juice, other natural juices, diet <b>carbonated</b> drinks, low-fat <b>milk</b> and bottled water (P for trend, 0 ? 001). Participants with higher adherence to the WDP were less likely to decrease their alcohol consumption during follow-up (OR between extreme quintiles 50 ? 68; 95 % CI 0 ? 56, 0 ? 84). By contrast, participants with higher adherence to the MDP were less likely to increase their alcohol consumption (OR 50 ? 66, 95 % CI 0 ? 46, 0 ? 95). Conclusion: In this cohort of university graduates, a healthier dietary pattern was associated with a healthier pattern of beverage consumption...|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{viability}} of Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079, L acidophilus DSM 20456 were evaluated {{in this study}} in the <b>carbonated</b> fermented acidophilus <b>milk</b> during cold storage (4 ºC) for zero, 3, 6 and 9 days. Dried acidophilus milk was also made from the best cultures {{used in this study}} in term of growth and viability. The effect of CO 2 on pH varied according to the used mixed culture. However, change in pH was slight either with the addition of 1. 1 or 1. 5 ml CO 2 /ml milk. pH never reached below 5 and titratable acidity was in the range 0. 33 – 0. 39 %. Strains of L. acidophilus were more stable than bifidobacteria during the cold storage (9 days at 4 ºC) and L acidophilus DSM 20079 grew during storage periods in the treatment which had Bifid. Breve DSM 20213. Logarithm of the two strains of L. acidophilus was lower in treatment which had Bifid. Longum DSM 20219 compared to the other two species of bifidobacteria. Survival of Bifid. breve DSM 20213 and Bifid. bifidum DSM 20456 was better with L acidophilus DSM 20079 compared to the other strain. The highest survival was for Bifid. longum DSM 20219 and its logarithm remained higher than 6 until the end of storage period (9 days at 4 ºC) in 1. 1 ml/ml CO 2 treatment. However, the logarithm of Bifid. breve DSM 20213 decreased from day 3 with the addition of CO 2. Proteolytic hydrolysis was high for the all treatments, and it was higher in the treatment with Bifid. longum DSM 20219 compared to the treatments with the other bifidobacteria. Survival of Bifid. longum DSM 20219 and L acidophilus DSM 20079 decreased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) after freeze drying and were 81. 2 and 81. 04 % for these two bacteria, respectively...|$|R
