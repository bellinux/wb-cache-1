5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} primary avoidance/defense {{features}} on the Batman Forever version. First, it {{had the ability to}} lock all four wheels perpendicular to its centerline, to allow for quick sideways movement. Second, for more dire circumstances, the Batmobile could reroute the jet exhaust to under its front end and launch grappling cables at overhead anchors. With the nose up and the lines in place, the car <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> sheer vertical surfaces like building walls as if it were driving on flat ground.|$|E
25|$|At {{the left}} flank column, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol {{returned with the}} news that Hill 239 was occupied by Soviet T-34 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army. The high ground had to be bypassed. The direction of the German retreat had to veer off to the south toward the Gniloy Tikich river. When daylight arrived, the German breakout plan began to unravel. Very few armored vehicles and other heavy equipment <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> the slippery, thawing hillsides and the weapons had to be destroyed and abandoned.|$|E

25|$|During its 29-year working life, the Davis Mine pumped {{thousands}} of tax {{dollars into the}} town’s coffers, and became a local tourist attraction as well. Visitors <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> an observation tower above the main shaft for {{a panoramic view of}} the bustling operation, which featured on-site blacksmith and butcher shops, a steady traffic of horse-drawn ore and coal wagons and the town’s first electric lighting. The annual payroll amounted to $100,000, and local farmers made extra income supplying the mine with timber and firewood, while selling fruit, vegetables and dairy products to the workers.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{researchers}} {{announced that}} further {{preparation of the}} type fossil of M. zhaoianus revealed preserved probable gut contents. These consisted of mammalian bones, including possible skull, limb, and vertebral fragments and also a whole foot. The foot skeleton is {{similar to those of}} Eomaia and Sinodelphys. It corresponds to an animal with an estimated snout to vent length of 80mm and a mass of 20-25 grams. The unguals of the foot are less curved than in Eomaia or Sinodelphys, indicating that the mammal <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> but less effectively than in the two latter genera. Other than mammals, Microraptor ate lizards, like Xianglong.|$|E
25|$|It {{became evident}} that the new fighters could make long, steep dives and that the fixed, {{synchronised}} machine gun was aimed by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents. The Fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry, usually out of the sun, firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the Immelmann turn, a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical, to face the opposite way, after which he could turn to attack again.|$|E

25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|A {{staircase}} {{near the}} main chamber, {{at the level}} of the radio room and toilet facility, led up to the east observation post. It was decided that the aerial would be hidden by withdrawing it into a pipe after use, with the pipe extending down the stairs which led to the main room. While it had initially been planned that the observation apertures would both be slits, the final choice was for the eastern aperture over the Mediterranean to be larger, overlooking a narrow ledge, yet still completely concealed. The opening and ledge were sufficiently large that a man <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> out onto the platform for fresh air. Part way up the main set of stairs was another set which led to the west observation post. The western slit over the bay was concealed with a concrete wedge. The entirety of the main chamber had been plastered and its floor covered in cork tiles, both methods to reduce sound transmission. The entrance passage had loose soil, to facilitate burials if needed. It also had loose bricks to further brick up the tunnel access once the six men had been sealed inside the cave.|$|E
25|$|Captured French {{armoured}} tractors. The use {{of these}} tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence upon horses and probably would have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches. In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The Renault UE Chenillette (German name: Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)) was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans. They had a storage compartment that could carry 350kg, pull a trailer weighing 775kg {{for a total of}} about 1000kg, and <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> a 50% slope. The armour was 5–9mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the Lorraine 37L, which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised, with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.|$|E

The book was {{believed to be the first}} ever published on the subject. In 2014, he published Peak Pictures, a book of 137 selected colour pictures of unusual scenes photographed in the southern Pennines between 2012 and 2014.In 2015, Kent published Cheshire's 1,000-Foot Peaks, {{a guide to}} the 46 hills of the county reaching that height, which included nineteen circular walks through which all the peaks <b>could</b> be <b>climbed</b> from low ground.|$|R
25|$|The limes {{was never}} able to prevent whole Germanic tribes from {{entering}} the territory of the Roman Empire. This was not the intention of the builders. Near the watch towers, the limes was open to passage, especially by traders or persons coming to live or work within the Empire, the purpose of the limes was control of this traffic. To cross the limes it was necessary to pass the towers, and so come to the notice of the garrison, or try to climb or destroy the wall and the stakes. Only individuals or small groups <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> the obstacles without being noticed, and they could not drive much stolen livestock with them. Large groups would be noticed, they could destroy one or several towers, but this also would come {{to the attention of the}} Romans. This knowledge of all traffic crossing the border was crucial to the Roman military. For a territory as large as the Roman Empire, there were amazingly few soldiers, almost all of the legions were based close to the frontiers, any hostile band that managed to pass this outer area of defense could travel within the Empire without much resistance. The purpose of the limes was as an early warning system, deterrence of casual small-scale raiding, and the ability to counteract while the enemy was still near the border fortresses and garrisons. Other researchers believe the limes may have been a bulwark to prevent illegal immigration, comparing it to the fence system along the American-Mexican border.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the test}} pilots, the Heinkel He 50 had a better {{acceleration}} rate, and <b>could</b> <b>climb</b> away from the target area much more quickly, avoiding enemy ground and air defences. Richthofen stated that any maximum speed below [...] was unacceptable for those reasons. Pilots also complained that navigation and powerplant instruments were mixed together, and were not easy to read, especially in combat. Despite this, pilots praised the aircraft's handling qualities and strong airframe.|$|E

500|$|Doom, {{released}} as shareware in 1993, refined Wolfenstein 3D's template by adding improved textures, variations in height (e.g., stairs the player's character <b>could</b> <b>climb)</b> and effects such as flickering lights and patches of total darkness, {{creating a more}} believable 3D environment than Wolfenstein 3D's more monotonous and simplistic levels. Doom allowed competitive matches between multiple players, termed [...] "deathmatches," [...] and the game {{was responsible for the}} word's subsequent entry into the video gaming lexicon. According to creator John Romero, the game's deathmatch concept was inspired by the competitive multiplayer of fighting games. Doom became so popular that its multiplayer features began to cause problems for companies whose networks were used to play the game.|$|E
