5|$|A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) {{designation}} was <b>created</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Rapids area in 1945. This designation {{ran from}} the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp.

The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E
5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements had been <b>created</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first six months}} of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.|$|E
5|$|A major {{crisis for}} the {{plutonium}} program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium <b>created</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained {{high levels of}} plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty {{for more than a}} century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) <b>created</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1720s to circumvent the influence of the deliberative princes and ministers.

When elections were held in 1965, the Nigerian National Democratic Party came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.|$|E

It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally <b>created</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
