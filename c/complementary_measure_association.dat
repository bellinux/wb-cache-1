30|$|In {{assessing}} {{the extent of}} food localization in Hawai‘i, we adopted the SSR and its <b>complementary</b> <b>measure,</b> the IDR. Hawai‘i had an overall food SSR of 15.7 % and an overall food IDR of 102.5 % in 2010. Obviously, the two <b>complementary</b> <b>measures</b> do not sum up to 100 %. This result led us to conclude that SSR was a better measure of “potential” local production to satisfy local market consumption of food in Hawai‘i. Likewise, the IDR exceeding 100 % indicates the existence of food imports that are then turned around and re-exported to other markets.|$|R

40|$|Arrangements that replace {{independent}} national currencies (regional currency areas, currency boards, official or unofficial use of {{a foreign}} currency) have become increasingly popular. However, they raise at least three broad questions. First, do their benefits (notably lower transactions costs) exceed the costs (reduced policy flexibility) ? Second, which of these regimes is most suitable for a particular economy? Third, must institutions be developed to ensure economic convergence and other <b>complementary</b> <b>measures</b> that will guarantee {{the success of a}} common currency, or are convergence and <b>complementary</b> <b>measures</b> a likely consequence of adopting a common currency? Senior central bankers from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States discussed experiences and research on these questions at a two-day meeting held at the BIS in September 2002.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for mobile robot exploration in unknown indoor environments using {{only a single}} forward-facing camera. Rather than processing all the data, the method intermittently examines only small 32 × 24 downsampled grayscale images. We show that for the task of indoor exploration the visual information is highly redundant, allowing successful navigation even using {{only a small fraction}} of the available data. The method keeps the robot centered in the corridor by estimating two state parameters: the orientation within the corridor, and the distance to the end of the corridor. The orientation is determined by combining the results of five <b>complementary</b> <b>measures,</b> while the estimated distance to the end combines the results of three <b>complementary</b> <b>measures.</b> These measures, which are predominantly information-theoretic, are analyzed independently, and the combined system is tested in several unknown corridor buildings exhibiting a wide variety of appearances, showing the sufficiency of low-resolution visual information for mobile robot exploration. Because the algorithm discards such a large percentage of the pixels both spatially and temporally, processing occurs at an average of 1000 frames per second, thus freeing the processor for other concurrent tasks. ...|$|R
