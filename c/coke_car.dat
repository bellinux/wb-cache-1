5000|$|In 1930 {{the first}} {{standard}} gauge locomotive {{was built for}} Luton Power Station. This was a [...] design and was capable of hauling one hundred tons at 4 mi/h km/h on the level. This locomotive is preserved at the Armley Mills Industrial Museum, Leeds. A standard gauge passenger-carrying vehicle was constructed in 1933 {{for use by the}} Royal Navy at Gosport. This locomotive used two [...] motors and could run at 20 mi/h km/h up a 1 in 137 gradient. Other products for which they were well known was <b>coke</b> <b>car</b> locomotive for Gas Works and Coking Plants.|$|E
50|$|Atlas {{specialized}} {{in the building}} of small locomotives and purpose built rail borne equipment for industrial use. The equipment it manufactured seldom ran on the rails of Class I railroads, but were often used to shuttle freight cars around inside manufacturing plants. Atlas's products ranged from small 2-ton end cab switchers up to 65-ton center cab switchers. They also built a wide variety of equipment for the steel industry including blast furnace transfer <b>cars,</b> scale <b>cars,</b> <b>coke</b> quench <b>cars,</b> <b>coke</b> quench locomotives (to 75 tons), furnace cars and self-propelled flatcars. While most equipment was built for steel and coke plants within the United States, some equipment was shipped outside the country (for example 5 scale cars to Russia).|$|R

5000|$|Today main {{transportation}} is iron ore from North Bessemer interchange. Edgar Thomson gets it coke from the Clairton works {{that is also}} interchanged to Dexter yard, slabs from Edgar Thomson to Irvin works and finished steel products (coils) from Irvin works to the interchanges. Only the Port Perry Bridge remains open for rail traffic. For inner-mill service the Edgar Thomson plant uses US Steel own EMD-switchers to move the hot metal subs and for tressel unloading. Crews from the URR have their own motive power EMD's for general switching duties within the mill. Their duties include the movement of loaded ore and <b>coke</b> <b>cars</b> to the staging yard and tressel, spotting and pulling the caster and slab mills, along with bringing in scrap and flux cars into the BOP [...] "Basic Oxygen Process". After closing the Riverton bridge in 2008 there is no rail connection between the URR network and Mckeesport Tubular Operations [...] "Camp Hill". Using URR motive power to switch McKeesport Tubular {{is the duty of}} McKeesport Connection Railroad (MKC), another subsidiary of Transtar. The Duquesne Coal Docks are still in operations unloading scrap metal from barges to be used at Edgar Thomson and coal barges to interchange with Norfolk Southern in the Kenny Yard.Union Railroad continues to serve the Mon Valley and have since expanded its customer base to include Dura-Bond pipe coating in the former Duquesne Works site and General Electric in West Mifflin hauling special oversize generators.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern switchers are diesels, but countries with near-total electrification, like Switzerland, use electric switchers. Prior {{to the introduction of}} diesel-electric locomotives, electric shunting locomotives were used to an extent in Great Britain where heavy trains needed to be started on steep gradients. The steeply-graded Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne was electrified by the North Eastern Railway in 1905, and two steeplecab locomotives were built to handle all traffic on the line. One of these, No. 1, is now part of the National Collection and resides at Locomotion in Shildon. On {{the opposite side of the}} Tyne, the electrified lines owned by the Harton Coal Company in South Shields for the movement of coal and colliery waste to shipping facilities on the river was one of the more extensive industrial networks. A number of the early German locomotives built for use on these lines have been preserved. Electric locomotives were also extensively employed for moving the <b>coke</b> <b>cars</b> at cokeworks, obtaining power from a side wire, as third rail or overhead line electrification would have been impractical. These specialised locomotives were tall steeple-cab types not seen anywhere else, and operated on a short length of track between the ovens and the quenching tower. Despite their ubiquity, very few have survived into preservation as there is very little scope of operating them due to their unique means of obtaining power, slow speed and the fact they greatly exceed the loading gauge of most railway lines. One example built by Greenwood and Batley in Armley, Leeds is preserved at the Middleton Railway, not far from where it was built. Small industrial shunters are sometimes of the battery-electric type. An early battery-electric shunting locomotive is shown here. The Tyne and Wear Metro has three battery electric shunters built by Hunslet, which are used to haul engineering trains when the overhead supply is switched off. Flywheel energy storage was also used experimentally by Sentinel.|$|R
50|$|For the 1994 season, Gardner formed his own team, Wayne Gardner Racing (sponsored by Coca-Cola), {{where he}} raced for three seasons with team mate, Channel 7 {{commentator}} Neil Crompton. The team's low point {{came at the}} Bathurst round of the 1995 ATCC in March. Soon {{after the start of}} the first heat, Crompton was hit by the VP Commodore of Phil Ward. This pushed him straight into Gardner's car and both of the <b>Coke</b> sponsored <b>cars</b> ended their race in the wall before they got to Hell Corner on the first lap (Ward continued on with little to no damage). The team recovered though and Gardner sensationally won the start and led the opening laps of the 1995 Tooheys 1000, before he and Crompton went on to finish 3rd in the race, while their team mates Brad Jones and former Bathurst winner Win Percy finished 5th, only a few seconds behind.|$|R
50|$|On {{a remote}} petrol station in Mexico, Thomas, sipping a <b>Coke</b> inside his <b>car,</b> gets {{suspicious}} and distressed by two men, a European and a Mexican, who {{pull up in}} a pickup behind him. They get out and stand there seemingly checking out his car and watching him. Thomas watches them, worrying about Soviet agents sent to kill him, or CIA or British sent to kidnap him. Before Thomas can react, the situation becomes more relaxed, the two men sipping their beers and, eventually, driving off on their truck. Yvonne is getting back from the petrol station store. They smile to each other. They kiss happily and drive off too.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 {{the federal}} {{government}} condemned the low-clearance covered bridge in Bridgeport (now South Brownsville), and the Monongahela Railroad bought the bridge company and removed the bridge. In the same year they installed a 10-stall roundhouse in Bridgeport. This {{was to be the}} main yard for the railroad throughout its history. In 1911 the railroad served seven mines and fifty one coke works (with 34 coke works and 1 mine being on the Dunlap Creek Division) The daily rated output was 1,395 <b>cars</b> of <b>coke</b> and 280 <b>cars</b> of coal. In 1911-1912 the big push was the state line extension, to make a connection with the Buckhannon and Northern Railway (B&N). It involved a major river crossing and two large creek crossings.|$|R
