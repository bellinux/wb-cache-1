25|$|Recent {{evidence}} has emerged that journals learning of cases {{where there is}} strong evidence of possible misconduct, with issues potentially affecting {{a large portion of}} the findings, frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken. In one case the Journal of Clinical Oncology issued a Correction despite strong evidence that the original paper was invalid. In another case, Nature allowed a <b>Corrigendum</b> to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud. Subsequent Retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{incorrect}} quotation which wrongly attributes to John T. Houghton the words [...] "Unless we announce disasters, {{no one will}} listen". The publishers apologised for this misquotation, confirmed {{that it would not}} be repeated, and agreed to place a <b>corrigendum</b> in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in The Sunday Telegraph on 20 February 2010, Booker wrote [...] "we shall all in due course take steps to correct the record, as I shall do in the next edition of my book".|$|E
2500|$|Meek then {{reports that}} he has {{compared}} the document with the manuscript of David Calderwood’s History of the Kirk of Scotland (completed about 1650). Meek is amazed at the [...] "blanks" [...] and [...] "mistakes" [...] and proceeds to list his very extensive corrections in his characteristic small, clear handwriting. In fact it is an extensive <b>corrigendum</b> to this important manuscript, presumably why the University authorities were anxious that it was [...] "securely" [...] bound with the original document. Meek considered that, in general, the language of this manuscript was clearer than that of Calderwood and so, with his corrections, {{would be a better}} reference point for settling legal or historical matters. It shows once again Meek as a careful, painstaking scholar, for the work must have involved several months of careful collation.|$|E
