50|$|Document imaging is an {{information}} technology category for systems capable of replicating documents commonly used in business. Document imaging systems can take many forms including <b>microfilm,</b> on demand <b>printers,</b> facsimile machines, copiers, multifunction <b>printers,</b> document scanners, <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm</b> (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.|$|R
50|$|Later 1970 and 80s-era {{recording}} to B&W (and color, with 3 separate exposures for red, green, and blue)) 16mm {{film was}} done with an EBR (Electron Beam Recorder), the most prominent examples made by 3M), for both video and COM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm)</b> applications.|$|R
50|$|To create {{microform}} media, {{a planetary}} camera is mounted with the vertical axis above a copy that is stationary during exposure. High volume output is possible with a rotary camera which moves the copy smoothly through {{the camera to}} expose film which moves with the reduced image. Alternatively, it may be produced by computers, i.e. COM (<b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Social Security Administration to handle its large volume of microfilm data. In 1959, Stromberg-Carlson introduced the SC4020, a computer-controlled <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> and plotter, used chiefly for COM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm)</b> applications. The SC4020 utilized a Charactron cathode-ray-tube (CRT) with an internal mask (or stencil) through which the electron beam was deflected to choose an alphanumeric character, and the character-shaped beam was then deflected to a target position on the faceplate of the CRT. A 35 mm or 16 mm shutterless camera, in a lightproof enclosed cabinet along with the CRT, captured the imagery produced on the faceplate. The film was then developed chemically, separate from the SC4020, and could be later enlarged onto paper. The instructions to control the SC4020 were created by a mainframe computer and transferred to the SC4020 on magnetic tape. A “quick-look,” separate from the SC4020, was available using zinc oxide photosensitized paper.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Stromberg-Carlson also {{produced}} the SC4020, a computer-controlled film recorder used chiefly for COM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm)</b> applications. The SC4020 could output graphics and text either to 16mm microfilm or hardcopy (using chemically-developed light-sensitive paper) utilizing a Charactron CRT {{as the heart}} of the recorder (with the microfilm camera pointed directly at the face of the Charactron inside a light-proof column inside the 4020). Some 4020s were fitted with a 16mm motion picture camera instead of the stock microfilm camera, in order to create some of the first computer-generated animation.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} efforts involved {{taking two}} images of {{each side of}} the 78 rpm disc: one image was used to capture metadata from the disc label and the other image was used to capture the etched number (an alphanumeric string) that is found on 78 rpm discs. Information from these original images were then recorded and put on 16mm microfilm and/or microfiche in what is the current Rigler Deutsch Index. In total there were approximately 945 reels of 16mm film, representing 2.2 million disc images, that were put onto COM (<b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm).</b> Copies of this master set is held at the five repositories listed above.|$|R
50|$|Triple-I's commercially {{successful}} {{technology was}} centered around very high precision CRTs, capable of recording to film; which {{for a while}} were the publishing industry's gold standard for digital-to-film applications. The company also manufactured film scanners using special cameras fitted with photomultiplier tubes as the image sensor, for digitzing existing films and paper documents. One such successful product of theirs using their precision CRT technology was their FR-80 film recorder introduced in 1968. It was capable of recording black & white (and later color as an option) digital imagery to motion picture or still transparency film at a maximum resolution of 16384x16384, making it an ideal system for generating either <b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm</b> (COM), computer-to-film negatives for making printing plates, and other computer-generated graphics.|$|R

40|$|Health records {{should be}} readily {{accessed}} by authorised persons for diagnosis, treatment and legal security purposes during patient's lifetime and thereafter {{for research and}} training purposes. Technology makes difficult the preservation of digital material, because of rapid changes in information media, hardware and software evolution, {{and because of the}} multiplicity of its location as well as the complexity of its environment. A committee in a large teaching hospital in Belgium, recommends two complementary approaches: (1) After a patient departure, all his health information should be managed by a unique organisation that would update regularly accesses to all data bases concerned by this patient. Health archives should be formatted using XML (Extensible Mark up Language) software family, and set on supports such as DVD-ROM, to be upgraded or updated when needed.

40|$|In the Proceedings of the 1966 Clinic on Library Applications of Data Processing {{appeared}} the article "Computer Applications to Book Catalogs and Library Systems. " In that article, Donald Stromberg writes, "Advancements in technology will make [book catalog] service economical {{on a wide}} basis. " Today, I speak of the book catalog not {{as a tool of}} the future coming into being, but of its path to aphelion and its return to Coventry. Book catalogs were on the scene prior to the appearance of card catalogs, and we now see two major expressions of bibliographic information pushing the printed book catalog out of the important position it played in the 1960 s and early 1970 s. First, the book catalog-like medium, the microform catalog, is currently forcing the printed catalog out of libraries, and some observers are even predicting that the microform catalog, or, more precisely, the <b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm</b> (COM) catalog, will completely replace the printed catalog within the next few years. Second, the on-line catalog as a tool for the library user (as distinct from the library staff) will have a heavy impact on the continued use of book catalogs as the on-line terminal is moved out of the back room and into the public service areas. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|IT IS THE {{purpose of}} this article to review the {{importance}} of microforms as library media, to discuss the current status of the micropublishing industry as it relates to libraries, and to describe developments in micropublishing and micrographics which have strong implications for future library services. Emphasis ulill be on a discussion of the problem of selection of microform soft~vare and a delineation of the major sources. A cursory review of hardware problems will also be presented. DEFINITIONS AND DELIMITATIOKS As used in this article, microform is a generic word used to describe a large variety of photographically reduced printed sources which must be mechanically enlarged for satisfactory use. Included are microforms of various sizes and types- 16 mm and 35 mm roll film, microfiche (from the French word fiche meaning- card), and microopague (sometimes referred to as microprint). This article will deal primarily with the microforms commonly used in libraries today. Except for some mention under a discussion of trends and developments, it will therefore not deal with the still-limited use of <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm</b> (COM); nor will it deal with ultrafiche (where approximately 3200 pages at a reduction ratio of 150 :l are placed on one 4 " x 6 " fiche), since several major projects have not been widely accepted on the marketplace, and "it appears that ultrafiche will have no significant impact upon library microforms," at least in the immediate future. &apos...|$|R

The Copyflo was a large <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative. Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer.</b> At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars. A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.|$|R
