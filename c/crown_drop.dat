40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effects}} of chamfer {{dimension}} at the Lundberg’s profile needle roller end and the grinding undercut of raceway on the pressure distribution, which {{are used in the}} oscillatory applications, are discussed. The frame of numerical method for the <b>crown</b> <b>drop</b> evaluation considered these two effects is presented, which makes it possible to profile the needle rollers axially until the longitudinal pressure distribution is neither any “edge effects ” nor high-pressure concentration at the center part of contacts. And the <b>crown</b> <b>drop</b> designed by this method is larger than that by Lundberg’s theory. The comparison results of accelerated rolling contact fatigue experiment show that the width of grinding undercut and radius of the chamfer must be considered in determining the <b>crown</b> <b>drop</b> of the needle rollers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Double-row {{tapered roller}} bearing 353112 is used in trucks, and the {{external}} load and pressure distribution of the bearing are calculated combining with the specific operating conditions. Tapered roller bearings typically employ roller profile modification to equalize the load distribution, minimize the stress concentration at the roller ends. Doing FEA (finite element analysis) on the contact stress with the changing roller crowning between roller and races, the appropriate roller profile and the <b>crown</b> <b>drop</b> of roller can be achieved. Finally the best control equation of roller crowning is given out. It has important guiding significance {{for the improvement of}} roller crowning design of truck hub bearings...|$|E

The eventual trial of these three was declared by the presiding judge to be a mistrial due to a hung jury.

5000|$|John [...] "Sam" [...] Paskalis had {{a history}} of being a con artist, and one of his schemes {{involved}} people applying for a loan through a fake company and paying the insurance fees up front but never getting the loan. Paskalis also used stolen credit card numbers, some of them taken from unsuspecting customers at Woodbine, to order merchandise. He was supposed to get C$50,000, part ownership of a nightclub and a cut-rate condo {{for his role in the}} scheme. Paskalis had organized the theft of $1 million in store inventory before setting it on fire to cover his tracks. On the night of the fire, he was caught in the explosion and severely burned, spending several months in a coma. In March 2005, he admitted his involvement in the scheme, and in a plea bargain pleaded guilty to manslaughter and arson in exchange for the <b>Crown</b> <b>dropping</b> second-degree murder charges. He received a time served sentence of five years, spending more than two years in jail.|$|R
500|$|The {{arguments}} over {{the maintenance of}} the castle and blockhouses continued in early 1600s. The town of Hull argued that since the revenues of £50 granted in 1553 were insufficient to maintain these defences, they should be allowed to use royal customs duties to assist in the work, particularly in protecting the east bank of the river from erosion. As a result, another court case was brought by the Crown in 1601. A commission was established to examine the defences and concluded that the position of the castle meant that it was militarily useless, and as a consequence it had not been garrisoned or maintained for many years, resulting in it falling into total disrepair. The commission's report led to the town carrying repairs to the earthwork defences over the coming year. The <b>Crown</b> <b>dropped</b> its law case, but a third case was brought in 1634, only to see the Crown pull out of the proceedings once again. By now, the corporation argued it had spent £11,367 on the defences.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{controlling}} {{factors in the}} design of reinforced concrete flat plates is the punching shear criteria. Engineers, in many cases, will be reluctant to increase the plate thickness, use column <b>crown</b> or <b>drop</b> flat plate in order to satisfy the punching shear criteria. This study introduces an effective use of space swimmer bars as punching shear reinforcement in flat plates. Swimmer bars are short inclined steel reinforcement bars welded to both top and bottom ttom flexural reinforcement. In this study pyramid shape will be investigated since the punching shear {{takes the form of a}} truncated pyramid or a truncated cone. A counteract truncated pyramid or a truncated cone of reinforcement forming space three dimensional ional pyramid by swimmer bars will be employed to generate four inclined planes crossing the four inclined planes of the cracks. The number of truncated pyramid-crack interceptors may be increased for large applied punching shear forces. The experimental results showed substantial improvement in punching shear strength of reinforced concrete flat slabs that can be used effectively to eliminate the need for column <b>crown</b> or <b>drop</b> flat plate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aiming at {{the strip}} edge drop control, the three {{dimensional}} finite element roll system models were built. From {{the point of}} the burdened load and deformation of the roll system, the reason which caused the strip edge drop and its composing were analyzed, and the critical width was proposed to control the strip edge drop. Based on the FEM analysis and industrial experiment, the VCR (Varying contact backup rolls) matching the EDW (Edge drop control work rolls) was designed and proposed independently. The application of such rolls gives better mill crown control ability, a high performance of work roll bending force and the improved strip edge <b>drop,</b> <b>crown</b> and flatness quality...|$|R
