All the available methods have "pros" and "cons" and none can unequivocally be declared better than the alternatives in all cases. Thus, what matters is to have a method adapted to the problem under analysis, with well defined limits and, in international comparisons, one that deals identically with all countries. This is the approach adopted in the present paper where it is stated clearly that the objective is to produce an economics based, production function, method which can be used for operational EU policy surveillance purposes. growth rates, <b>cyclical</b> <b>developments,</b> production function, potential output, Denis, Grenouilleau, Mc Morrow, R�ger...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the role of}} the United States in the global economy and its evolution over time. The emergence of large economic players, like China, is likely to have weakened {{the role of the}} U. S. economy as a driver of global growth. Based on a Global VAR modelling approach, this paper shows first that the transmission of U. S. <b>cyclical</b> <b>developments</b> {{to the rest of the}} world tends to fluctuate over time but remains large overall. Second, although the size of the spill-overs might have decreased in the most recent periods, the effects of changes in U. S. economic activity seem to have become more persistent. Actually, the increasing economic integration at the world level is likely to have fostered second-round and third-market effects, making U. S. <b>cyclical</b> <b>developments</b> more global. Finally, the slightly decreasing role of the U. S. has been accompanied by an increasing importance of third players. Regional integration might have played a significant role by giving more weights to non-U. S. trade partners in the sensitivity of the various economies to their international environment.

50|$|The {{lifecycle}} of B. microti, {{which is}} typical of parasites in that genus, requires a biological stage in a rodent or deer host, and is transmitted by ticks of the family Ixodidae between these hosts. To begin, the ticks introduce the sporozoites into the host when taking a blood meal. Sporozoites enter erythrocytes in the blood and begin the <b>cyclical</b> <b>development</b> between trophozoites and merozoites. Rather than producing more trophozoites, some merozoites produce gametocytes. The tick definitive host takes up the gametocytes when attached for a blood meal. The gametes are fertilized in the gut of the tick and develop into sporozoites in the salivary glands. The sporozoites are introduced into a human upon inoculation at the bite of an infected tick. Even as an incidental host, the phase changes which occur in the parasite are the same within humans as in the biological hosts. Babesia can be diagnosed at the trophozoite stage, and can be transmitted from human to human either through the tick vector or through blood transfusions.|$|E

40|$|Over {{a period}} of 208 days a quinapyramine-resistant {{population}} was derived in vivo from a quinapyramine-susceptible clone of Trypanosoma congolense: IL 1180. While the dose of quinapyramine sulfate required to cure 50 % of mice infected with the parental clone was 0. 23 mg/kg of body weight, the 50 % curative dose for the resistant derivative, IL 1180 /Stabilate 12, was greater than 9. 6 mg/kg. This approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was shown {{to be associated with}} an 8 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium, a 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 5. 5 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene.

The different features of economic time series call for a time series specific design of the method.

On principle, the lead and the reliability of the signals decrease with the share of the irregular movement on the variance of the time series and increase with the smoothness of its <b>cyclical</b> <b>development.</b> Turning Point, business cycle analysis, time series analysis, turning point indicator...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the information}} content of M 1 for euro area real GDP {{since the beginning}} of the 1980 s. After a literature review on the empirical results in individual euro area countries we review some theoretical arguments why real narrow money growth might be an important determinant of <b>cyclical</b> <b>developments</b> in real GDP beyond effects already captured by short-term interest rates. In the empirical part we first present some preliminary evidence on the M 1 -GDP connection against the background of the situation in the US, based on an approach developed by Hamilton and Kim 2002. This test suggests that compared with the U. S., in the euro area, M 1 has better and more robust forecasting properties than the term spread. These properties are also maintained when looking at a broader set of non-monetary indicator variables. Narrow money therefore seems crucial for <b>cyclical</b> <b>developments.</b> We also evaluate the relative out-of-sample forecasting performance of different classes of VAR models comprising real M 1, GDP and further potential leading indicator variables against a univariate benchmark model. As a result, once the information from narrow money is taken into account, what matters more for the forecast performance, is the model class rather than the selection of additional indicators. While within the class of VARs in levels, Bayesian VARs are the best performing models, they are not capable of outperforming the benchmark. Specifically, only VARs in first differences are able to outperform the benchmark model. Money; business cycle; forecast comparison; VAR models...|$|R
