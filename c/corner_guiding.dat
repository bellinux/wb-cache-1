50|$|Corner Gas {{has spawned}} a {{merchandising}} business, with hundreds of retail items, sold-out live touring productions, and best-selling DVDs. A companion book to the show, called Tales from Dog River: The Complete <b>Corner</b> Gas <b>Guide,</b> was published on November 4, 2006. It was written by Toronto journalist Michele Sponagle and was produced in conjunction with CTV, Penguin Canada, and Prairie Pants Productions. The book debuted in the number two spot among new releases, behind only Vincent Lam's Giller Prize-winning book Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures. On December 12, 2006, it was the top-selling non-fiction paperback in Canada, according to BookMarket data. It includes cast interviews, an episode guide, insider jokes, bloopers, best lines, {{a look at the}} real Dog River (Rouleau, Saskatchewan), and a chronology on how the show was created from inception to debut episode. Author Michele Sponagle went on a book tour to cities across Canada, including Ottawa, Halifax, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver to promote the book, alongside various cast members.A follow-up to the book called Dog River Confidential: The Super, Even More Complete <b>Corner</b> Gas <b>Guide,</b> also by author Michele Sponagle, was released by Penguin Canada on November 10, 2009.|$|R

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{model was}} used to examine why the strong western boundary current (WBC) is observed in the South China Sea (SCS) but not in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and Japan/East Sea (JES). Results suggested that the stronger WBC in the SCS is mainly attributed to the direct contribution of the inflow and the strong monsoon. Although the Gulf Stream transports a large amount of water into the GOM, the passage in the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>guides</b> the inflow out of the gulf and inhibits the inflow from intensifying the WBC. Meanwhile, the wind stress in the GOM is weakest among the three marginal seas. The meridional ocean ridge and the particular layout of the continental slope of JES prevent the whole basin from participating in the westward intensification. Besides, the throughflow has adverse effects on the formulation of WBC in JES. The variation of Coriolis parameter with latitude leads to the westward intensification in marginal seas. However, a strong WBC cannot be observed in the absence of reasonable collocation of wind, inflow, and topography.

40|$|A spine {{x-ray image}} {{retrieval}} system has been developed for retrieving images based on the pathology information such as the osteophyte. Osteophyte shows only in particular regions on the vertebra. This means the contour information on the vertebra regions that are not of interest hinder the image retrieval relevance precision. Curve matching or partial shape matching (PSM) methods based on dynamic programming for matching shapes with variable number of points and with different data point distribution {{have been developed to}} detect the osteophyte with similar shapes. Based on the shape property of spines, <b>corner</b> <b>guided</b> dynamic programming (DP) is introduced as the new enhanced searching strategy which dramatically increases the processing efficiency of the traditional DP. Shape representation method using multiple open triangles is presented in this paper. Performance evaluation of corner-guided DP on this shape representation based on human relevance judgment is presented. This paper also presents the implementation and performance of the retrieval system. The retrieval system consists of a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) which has been developed for testing. All the shape matching methods that have been developed have been integrated into the system for the user to choose during a retrieval process. The retrieval results are ranked from the most similar to the least similar and can be all viewed by the user.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{cutting edge}} {{preparation}} {{is a widely}} applied tool improvement method, especially when concerns tool's life. However, {{the effects of the}} tool treatments on the generated hole surface are still an ongoing investigation. The machined hole is subject to severe contact with the tool, in particular the drill <b>corner</b> and <b>guide,</b> providing an increase of friction and thus, heat generation. Consequently, the surface integrity suffers several alterations. Therefore, this study aims to understand the effect of the cutting edge preparation on the surface integrity of holes. Experiments performed with carbide tools, coated with TiAlN and three configurations of tools (sharpened, polished with abrasive brushes and treated with drag finishing surface treatment) during dry drilling, showed that the tool condition has an important effect on the surface roughness, temperature and subsurface plastic deformation...|$|R

5000|$|The Cross: As usual, this {{challenge}} requires the drivers to use S-turns to gradually turn their vehicle 360 degrees in a cross {{made up of}} concrete Jersey barriers and blocks. For this year's incarnation of the challenge however, they will be using a much larger vehicle: a Wayne Lifeguard bus made up {{to look like a}} train. Jillian is the first to take the challenge, and immediately demands that Mitchell guide her throughout. He initially refuses, which leads to yet another argument between the couple, but eventually she gets through the first <b>corner,</b> <b>guided</b> {{every step of the way}} by him. Andrew quickly cottons onto this and drags Mitchell off the bus, after which Jillian's confidence (and thereby her run as a whole) quickly falls apart. While this is happening, both Andrew and Shyamala note that while Jillian is arguably the most technically competent driver ever to be a contestant on the show, her nerves are proving a seemingly insurmountable problem. Sholom starts his run by adjusting his mirrors, but not only does it incorrectly (meaning that he can't see his own vehicle), he fails to actually use them; his run predictably proves to be a complete disaster, with both Andrew and Cam expressing amazement that Sholom ever got a driving licence. Polly turns out not to even know how to properly steer in reverse, and her run doesn't go any better than Sholom's. During her run, Renee has Jacque stand outside the bus and tell her how close she is to the barriers, which Andrew considers to be acceptable since Renee is still making her own decisions. She subsequently gets through with only a few minor scrapes, posting by far the best performance in {{this challenge}}. After this, it's revealed firstly that Polly and Sholom are now also getting the same public driving lessons that Jillian and Renee have been getting, and also that Renee is now able to drive by herself on the highway.|$|R
50|$|The band's {{founding}} members were Liam Howe and Chris Corner, who then recruited Kelli Dayton (formerly of Lumieres, now recording {{under the name}} Kelli Ali) for vocal duties and long-time friend Ian Pickering to co-write the lyrics. After the first album, the band felt that demos for the second album (on which <b>Corner</b> provided the <b>guide</b> vocals) better suited his voice, especially {{in regard to the}} more raw, personal quality of the lyrics. Following the promotional tour for Becoming X, Kelli was dismissed from the group, and Corner became the singer.|$|R

50|$|The first {{stained glass}} window was {{installed}} {{soon after the}} church opened. It is installed in the east wall of the side chapel, and commemorates early parishioners James Skerman and his wife. The second stained glass window was installed just before the building's consecration to commemorate Henry Scott McKellar, {{one of the founders}} of the Anglican Church in New Zealand. The Great East Window was installed in 1924 as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I. The Scout and <b>Guide</b> <b>Corner</b> holds a memorial lamp to victims of the Tangiwai disaster on Christmas Eve of 1953.

There seemed at first to be nobody walking in the Alameda except a gentleman pacing {{to and from the}} handsome modern house at the first <b>corner,</b> which our <b>guide</b> said was this cavalier's house. He interested me beyond any reason I could give; {{he looked as if he}} might represent the highest society in Ronda, but did not find it an adequate occupation, and might well have interests and ambitions beyond it. I make him my excuses for intruding my print upon him, but I would give untold gold if I had it to know all about such a man in such a city, walking up and down under the embrowning trees and shrinking flowers of its Alameda, on a Sunday morning like that.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a change}} of die roll height {{according}} to the die chamfer shape and V-ring distance of a fine blanking tool was studied by experiments on a special part with various <b>corner</b> shapes. Three <b>guide</b> plate inserts with different V-ring positions and three die inserts with different die chamfers were machined, and then a fine blanking tool was manufactured for the fine blanking experiments. Nine experiments were conducted on a 650 -ton fine blanking press. Each die roll height was measured and analyzed. It would be noticed that the die roll heights on the corner shapes of the fine blanked parts increased with increasing V-ring distance and die chamfer angle, but it decreased with increasing corner radius and angle. The results in this study {{can be used to}} minimize the die roll height of fine blanked parts with corner shapes when designing the V-ring and die chamfer of a fine blanking tool...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the general torsion problem of the regular prismatic bar was introduced, based on extensive and meticulous experimental evidence, indicating that the twisted prismatic bars, except the cylindrical ones, present, a longitudinal warping, following a sinusoidal type of curves for the warping displacements with their extrema displaced towards the <b>corners.</b> As a <b>guide</b> {{for the establishment of}} the method the solutions of the elliptical and the equiangular triangular bars were used. It was found that the regions inside the inscribed circles tangent to the sides of their undeformed cross-sections constituted regions whose warped surfaces constitute undulated forms following sinusoidal surfaces. This property was proved exact for the exact solutions for the elliptic and triangular cross-sections and it is assumed by induction valid for any regular cross-section. Comparing the warping displacements along the inscribed circle to a square or regular polygon cross section with the classical Timoshenko solution for the square bar it was found an exact coincidence in these displacements. It was further shown that these circles and all concentric full circles constitute the initial curves of the caustics formed from reflections of the warped cross-sections of the twisted bars. The differences between the stresses and displacements between the existing approximate solutions and the {{new approach}} appear in the partly curved triangles lying outside the inscribed circles. For the square cross-section it was shown that the w-displacements between Timoshenko's solution and the present one were less than 5 percent. Experimental evidence with the MoirÃ© method and comparison with the exact solution for the equiangular triangular cross section proved that the present approach is closer to reality and therefore presents higher accuracy than any approximate method. Furthermore, it presents the advantage that the full circles inscribed inside the cross-section constitute the initial curves forming caustics in space when a parallel light beam is reflected on the warped cross-section of the twisted bars. interesting properties of caustics, proved in this paper, help down-rightly for a thorough study of the form and properties of the twisted bars.
