5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong.

The Brancacci Chapel, though {{structurally}} undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of <b>covering</b> <b>up</b> the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka and burn them came directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, who was very concerned about <b>covering</b> <b>up</b> Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E

She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian {{retained}} her WIBF and WBA belts with {{a unanimous}} decision win over Elena Reid from the United States on March 20, 2009. Reid, who {{was well known}} in Germany after two controversial bouts with Halmich in 2004 and 2005, remained largely passive from the opening bell and Kentikian controlled her through {{the majority of the}} fight. Reid did not win a single round on the official scorecards. On July 4, 2009, Kentikian fought the Interim WBA Super Flyweight Champion Carolina Gutierrez Gaite of Argentina. Kentikian used her speed and combinations to dominate her opponent through the ten rounds, winning every round on the judges' scores. Kentikian ended 2009 by fighting the undefeated Turkish-German Julia Sahin (20–0) on 10 October for the vacant WBO Female Flyweight title. Kentikian overwhelmed Sahin with her higher work rate early on. Sahin spent most of the fight <b>covering</b> <b>up</b> from Kentikian's many flurries. Kentikian gave Sahin a ten-round beating and won a unanimous decision to become the new WBO Female Flyweight Champion.|$|E
