5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and <b>capital</b> <b>requirements,</b> and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

40|$|The Basel Committee has {{suggested}} some formulas for calculating <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> using the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach.

Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> estimated by the Basel formula is less than by our formula when the asset distribution has a heavy tail, and more than by our formula when the distribution has a short tail.

40|$|Longevity risk is {{the risk}} arising from {{uncertainty}} in the prediction of future mortality. This risk must be faced by pension funds.

The stochastic model used is recently published and is calibrated on the most recent data. Finally, the <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> is calculated using both methods.

Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries.

40|$|Using dynamic panel data models, {{we examine}} the effect of <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> on banks {{behavior}} in Indonesia. We find inconclusive results. Some banks tend to comply with <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> : They increase their capital ratio when their CAR is lower than, or falling towards, the eight percent regulatory minimum. However, most of our results are statistically significant at 20 - 30 % level of significance only. Moreover, our results are mostly driven by private domestic banks and heavily-undercapitalized banks that were closely monitored by regulator {{in the aftermath of the}} 1998 crisis. Whether, in normal circumstances, banks in developing countries like Indonesia comply with <b>capital</b> <b>requirement,</b> therefore, remains questionable. This implies that, if regulators in developing countries continue relying on capital regulation, they would also need to improve their supervision capacity, increase the transparency of financial reporting, and strengthen market monitoring of banks. banking crisis, <b>capital</b> <b>requirement,</b> bank regulation, dynamic panel data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examined}} the relationship between bank liquidity ratio, asset quality, bank distress and bank minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> in Nigeria for the period 1990 - 2006. The study used secondary data obtained from banks financial records, CBN statistical bulletin, NDIC report and International Financial Statistics 2010. The E-view 7 statistical software was used to analyse the data and test the hypotheses. The study found out that (i) there is a positive relationship between minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> and liquidity ratio which is not statistically significant (ii) A positive relationship exist between minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> and asset quality, though statistically insignificant (iii) A negative relationship exist between minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> and number of distressed banks which is also not statistically significant. The study recommends that apart from increasing minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement,</b> a closer and regular examination of liquidity ratio and asset quality of banks is required. In addition, other components of banks regulatory reform such as enforcement of code of corporate governance, closer collaboration with anti graft agency (EFCC), zero tolerance on misreporting, adoption of risk-based supervision and host of others should be considered. A holistic reform of this nature is capable of stemming proactively the tide of banks failure/distress as well as improving liquidity ratio and asset quality...|$|R
