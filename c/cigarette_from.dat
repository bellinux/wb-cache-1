5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered <b>cigarette</b> <b>from</b> a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} {{changes to}} 1962. The Smoking Man is an Army captain stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. He talks {{to a friend}} and fellow soldier, Bill Mulder, who shows him a photo of his infant son, Fox. The Smoking Man is summoned to attend a meeting with a general and several strange men in suits. They assign him to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. In 1963, posing as a [...] "Mr. Hunt," [...] the Smoking Man shoots Kennedy and frames Lee Harvey Oswald. Afterwards, he smokes his first <b>cigarette</b> <b>from</b> a pack previously {{given to him by}} Oswald.|$|E
500|$|Stalin's exact {{actions on}} the day of the robbery are unknown and disputed. One source, P. A. Pavlenko, claimed that Stalin {{attacked}} the carriage itself and had been wounded by a bomb fragment. Kamo later stated that Stalin took no active part in the robbery and had watched it from a distance. Another source stated in a police report that Stalin [...] "observed the ruthless bloodshed, smoking a <b>cigarette,</b> <b>from</b> the courtyard of a mansion." [...] Another source claims that Stalin was actually at the railway station during the robbery and not at the square. Stalin's sister-in-law stated that Stalin came home the night of the robbery and told his family about its success.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} whether smokers who purchased low-taxed <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> American Indian reservations {{had lower}} quit attempt and cessation rates than did smokers who purchased <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> full-price outlets. Smokers who bought <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> American Indian reservations were half {{as likely to}} make a quit attempt and had a nonsignificant trend toward lower cessation rates (20 % vs 10 %) compared with those who bought full-priced cigarettes. Interventions that reduce price differentials are suggested to maximize the public health benefit of cigarette excise taxes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} was to examine characteristics associated with cigarette access behaviours among underage current youth smokers. Methods: This cross-sectional study used self-reported data collected from 29, 296 students in Grades 9 to 12 {{who participated in the}} 2008 - 09 Youth Smoking Survey (YSS), and data from the 2008 - 09 DMTI-EPOI (Enhanced Points of Interest) data file. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to jointly examine whether student characteristics and the number of tobacco retailers surrounding schools were associated with the odds of a current youth smoker accessing cigarettes from: (a) a retailer source, (b) a family member, and (c) a friend or someone else. Results: Among underage current smokers, the majority reported usually buying their own <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a retailer (44. 1 %), and getting <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a friend or someone else (42. 2 %). Significant between-school random variation was identified for youth <b>cigarette</b> access <b>from</b> a retailer source, and from a friend or stranger. Males were more likely to buy their own <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a retailer (OR 2. 08, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 2. 48), whereas females were more likely to access <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a family member (OR 0. 68, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 88), or a friend or someone else (OR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 44 - 0. 61). Binge smoking was associated with buying <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a retailer (OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 86). Youth with a smoking parent or guardian (OR 2. 95, 95 % CI 2. 02 - 4. 31) were more likely to get <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a family member. Youth who reported that they sometimes (OR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 94 - 4. 04), or usually or always (OR 3. 15, 95 % CI 2. 17 - 4. 58) share cigarettes with others was associated with accessing <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a friend or someone else. Each additional tobacco retailer surrounding a school was associated with an increased likelihood of youth purchasing their own <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> a retailer (OR 1. 04, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 07). Conclusion: Tobacco point-of-sale restrictions are inadequate as youth can still procure <b>cigarettes</b> <b>from</b> both retailers and social sources. Future studies should explore beyond individual-level factors and examine what influences cigarette access behaviours in the broader school context. Such insight will inform the development of new school-level tobacco control initiatives that can more effectively prevent youth <b>from</b> acquiring <b>cigarettes...</b>|$|R

Later, Matchee came by to borrow a <b>cigarette</b> <b>from</b> MacDonald and mentioned that [...] "now the Black man would fear the Indian as he did the white man", and MacDonald went outside to check on Arone's status.

Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely think he should have been kicked out, but obviously he was definitely entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd's {{career was}} not all laughs, however. [...] In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still {{photographs}} in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot. It exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. [...] The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was {{in the act of}} lighting a <b>cigarette</b> <b>from</b> the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. [...] Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, [...] "I thought I would surely be so disabled that I {{would never be able to}} work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so." ...|$|E

It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William pulled me out of the crowd and pulled me out of the gutter, in a way. Because I don't know where my enthusiasm was going to take me, because it was pretty raw to say the least." ...|$|E
