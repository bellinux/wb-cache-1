5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the <b>controlled</b> <b>flooding</b> of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

25|$|Juarez Street {{is one of}} the few through streets on the surface. It {{is filled}} with stores and {{restaurants}} and has a constant flow of people and traffic. The other through streets of town are either partially or fully underground, following the old drainage ditches and tunnels dug during colonial times. Originally they were used for flood control, but modern dams have <b>controlled</b> <b>flooding</b> and left them dry, so they have been turned into thoroughfares in a city with little surface area. The most important of these roads is Miguel Hidalgo or Belaunzarán, which carried the runoff from the river that used to divide the city in two. Guanajuato’s version of the La Llorona story has the woman wandering its tunnels, some of which had rivers or streams running through them.|$|E

Marysville sits in the watershed of two major creeks, Quilceda Creek and Allen Creek, and approximately 70 minor streams that flow into Ebey Slough and Snohomish River.

500|$|Around 1610 or 1625 {{according}} to various estimations, Andrianjaka commanded a garrison of 1,000 soldiers {{to seize the}} hill of Analamanga ("Blue Forest")—at [...] above sea level, then the highest and most strategically important in the region—from its Vazimba inhabitants. He constructed a royal fortified compound (rova) on the hilltop as the capitol of a new town at the site which he named Antananarivo ("the city of the thousand") {{in honor of the}} thousand soldiers who aided in capturing and protecting the hill. He reportedly succeeded with minimal bloodshed: {{according to}} oral history, the encampment of his army at the foot of Analamanga was sufficient to secure the submission of the Vazimba. Andrianjaka made Antananarivo the capital of his realm. From his position atop Analamanga, he was well-placed to exert control over the vast plains of Betsimitatatra below. Under his command the plains were gradually transformed into vast, surplus-producing rice paddies. This feat was accomplished by mobilizing large numbers of his able-bodied subjects to construct dikes that enabled the redirection of rainwater for <b>controlled</b> <b>flooding</b> of planted areas.|$|E

By 1950, {{it was already}} {{apparent}} that the Australian Darings would not be completed on time, as the Australian dockyards were experiencing difficulty in {{keeping up with the}} construction schedule. The destroyer was launched on 3 May 1954 by the widow of Hector Waller, who commanded the Scrap Iron Flotilla (including the original [...] ) during World War II. On 18 July 1958, on the first occasion Vendetta engaged her engines during builder's trials, the destroyer accidentally rammed the Alfred Dock caisson. The collision was caused when the sailor manning the engine telegraph incorrectly relayed an order of [...] "half astern" [...] as [...] "half ahead", then repeated the mistake when the order was repeated to compensate for the first error. Vendettas bow breached the caisson, and threatened to flood the dock with [...] inside. A <b>controlled</b> <b>flooding</b> kept the caisson from failing and prevented damage to Quickmatch or further damage to Vendetta, but the repairs to the destroyer's bow set completion back by three months.|$|E
