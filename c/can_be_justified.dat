5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified.</b> A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

25|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{and in particular}} ordinary least squares specifies that a dependent variable depends according to some function upon one or more independent variables, with an additive error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> by assuming that the error term is actually the sum {{of a large number}} of independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.|$|E

There a number of methods {{that can be used to}} justify, informally or rigorously, approximating the occurrence of random events or phenomena with suitable Poisson point processes. The more rigorous methods involve deriving upper bounds on the probability metrics between the Poisson and non-Poisson point processes, while other methods <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> by less formal heuristics.|$|E

25|$|There are {{different}} {{schools of thought}} in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories {{are the result of}} generalizations from such observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> in many cases, because {{the cost of}} {{preparing}} now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E
25|$|Quinolones are {{contraindicated}} if {{a patient}} has epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or the patient has suffered a stroke. They are best avoided in the athlete population. Safety concerns exist for fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy, so they are contraindicated unless no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Their use in children is not absolutely contraindicated, however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified.</b> Quinolones should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents {{a number of}} significant differences {{from the rest of the}} language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian. In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> because there is a common elaboration (Ausbau) process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan. The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement. And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and Occitan. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents the same view.|$|E
25|$|Age-related {{bone loss}} is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species. Because {{of the more}} porous bones of humans, {{frequency}} of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It {{has been suggested that}} porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Funds {{available}} to the development and maintenance of affordable housing are scarce and, {{in order to maximize}} the supply of housing, low construction costs are often favored in choosing projects. However, one of the main arguments for green affordable housing is that a higher upfront cost for construction/renovation can be motivated by a lower operating cost over the life-time of the building, i.e. a lower life-cycle cost. If the initial investment leads to lower operating costs and/or higher durability the higher upfront capital cost needed for construction or renovation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified.</b> This is especially true considering that public funding and tax breaks (like the low-income housing tax credit) for housing often require a longer term perspective from its builders. However, the need to preserve affordability of housing sometimes restricts value enhancement over time and may thus be a barrier to investing in green features.|$|E

25|$|The total {{estimated}} price tag, more than $22 million, dampened {{the enthusiasm of}} many supporters, who were expecting more like $4 million to $5 million. At a convention in December 1826, they attempted to discredit the engineers' report, and offered lower estimates: Georgetown to Cumberland, $5,273,283; Georgetown to Pittsburgh, $13,768,152. Geddes and Roberts were hired to make another report, which they gave in 1828: $4,479,346.93 for Georgetown to Cumberland. With those numbers to encourage them, the stockholders formally organized the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in June 1828. In the end, the final construction cost to Cumberland in 1850 was $11,071,075.21. Compared to the original cost given by the engineers in 1826 of about $8 million, removing things not in the estimate such as land purchases, engineering expenses, incidental damages, salaries, and fencing provision, the cost overrun was about 19%, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> by the inflation rate of the period. The cost overrun of the other proposal (Geddes and Roberts) was about 51% thus showing that the original engineer's estimate was good.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} some debate among Bible translators about the correct reading of Luke 2:2. Instead of {{translating}} the registration as taking place [...] "when" [...] Quirinius was governor of Syria, some versions translate it as [...] "before" [...] or use [...] "before" [...] as an alternative, which Harold Hoehner, F.F. Bruce, Ben Witherington and others have suggested may be the correct translation. While not in agreement, Emil Schürer also acknowledged that such a translation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> grammatically. According to Josephus, the tax census conducted by the Roman senator Quirinius particularly irritated the Jews, {{and was one of}} the causes of the Zealot movement of armed resistance to Rome. From this perspective, Luke may have been trying to differentiate the census at the time of Jesus’ birth from the tax census mentioned in Acts 5:37 that took place under Quirinius at a later time. One ancient writer identified the census at Jesus’ birth, not with taxes, but with a universal pledge of allegiance to the emperor.|$|E
500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>justified</b> only on the grounds of what is politically opportune." [...] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say [...] "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E
