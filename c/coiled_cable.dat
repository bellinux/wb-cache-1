50|$|An {{electrical}} connection is {{made between the}} tractor and the trailer through a cable {{often referred to as}} a pigtail. This cable is a bundle of wires in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a <b>coiled</b> <b>cable</b> is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail.|$|E
50|$|Straight coiling, or the {{practice}} of <b>coiling</b> a <b>cable</b> {{in the same direction}} coil after coil, has the similar result to <b>coiling</b> <b>cable</b> on a spool. If the cable comes off the spool the same way it goes on, the internal 'lay' is preserved, and the cable isn't damaged or twisted internally. If a <b>cable</b> is straight <b>coiled</b> and then pulled from the coil, it has the effect as <b>coiling</b> <b>cable</b> on a spool and then pulling the cable {{off the top of the}} spool, imparting a twist in the <b>cable</b> with every <b>coil</b> that is removed. To make it lie flat, the twist will need to be removed. The advantages of straight <b>coiling</b> <b>cable</b> are that it will not produce knots when uncoiling and is easily taught and therefore can be accomplished easily by assistance.|$|R

It {{is connected to}} ground through a coiled retractable cable and 1 megohm resistor, which allows high-voltage charges to leak through but prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Where higher voltages are present, extra resistance (0.75 megohm per 250 V) is added in the path to ground to protect the wearer from excessive currents; this typically {{takes the form of}} a 4 megohm resistor in the <b>coiled</b> <b>cable</b> (or, more commonly, a 2 megohm resistor at each end).|$|E

50|$|An {{extension}} reel {{can only}} carry full rated current when completely extended. This {{is because the}} portion of cord on the reel is not exposed to air causing the loss power, (the result of its series resistance), not to dissipate. An extension cord that is in use while coiled up or coiled in a reel can be a serious shock and fire hazard. The heat produced from the resistance cannot dissipate and is instead trapped between the tightly <b>coiled</b> <b>cable,</b> leading to the a fire or shock. Additionally, the ESFI recommends to never use an extension cord that is covered by a rug or blanket, or that is run through a ceiling or wall, since the heat {{may not be able}} to dissipate appropriately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} demonstration of a <b>coiled</b> coaxial <b>cable</b> resonator capable {{of meeting the}} critical coupling condition using a reduced number of coils relative to previously reported coiled resonators. By introducing a second slot {{along the length of}} the device, a two-slot <b>coiled</b> coaxial <b>cable</b> resonator was fabricated and critical coupling observed at 22 turns. An additional device with one-slot, but otherwise identically constructed, was also fabricated. After 44 turns, the one-slot device had yet to reach critical coupling. An ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio (greater than 70 dB) was observed at critical coupling of the two-slot device. This reduction in number of slots necessary to reach critical coupling, and the corresponding reduction of physical length of the device, makes this demonstration of the control of critical coupling a potentially important step towards the successful application of <b>coiled</b> coaxial <b>cable</b> resonators to microwave communication and robust sensing applications...|$|R

40|$|The main {{consideration}} of any reeling {{system is the}} effect it has on cable tensions and hence cable life. This paper explains the relationship of reel torque to cable tensions and the reasons why this relationship is so important. Such system is characterized by variable parameters, primarily a variable moment of inertia and a variable diameter of the <b>coiled</b> <b>cable.</b> For these reasons, {{in order to ensure}} proper dimensioning of the drive, it is necessary to know the motor torques that need to be developed {{as a function of the}} <b>coiled</b> <b>cable.</b> The motor should be able to develop the required torques in a very wide speed range. It is shown that for properly sizing the motor it is necessary take into account the dynamics of the cable reel drive.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the bending behaviour of helically wound steel cables of various types (i. e. normal spiral strands, sheathed spiral strands and locked <b>coil</b> <b>cables)</b> in the presence of friction and to propose more efficient computational models for their analysis under combined tension and bending. The proposed model fully takes into account interwire contact forces both in the radial direction (point contact between wires in different layers) and hoop direction (line contact within the wires in the same layer). Extensive theoretical parametric studies have been undertaken on a variety of cable constructions covering a wide range of geometrical and material parameters. Explicit formulations have been developed for the smooth transition of the bending stiffness from no-slip to full slip regimes, as a function of cable curvature. Based on these formulations, it is now possible to calculate the relative displacements of the wires, as well as the tensile, bending and hoop stresses in the individual wires of the cable. Furthermore, bending stiffness of the cable is shown to decrease by a factor of 2 to 16, depending upon the friction coefficient between wires and the type of cable construction. Wherever possible, the theoretical results have been compared with experimental results from the available literature and are found in very good agreement with them. A simple method for the determination of the bending stiffness of large diameter multi-layered cable has been developed. The simplified method is further shown to provide estimates of the bending stiffness which are very close to those calculated by the original theory, allowing hand calculations for an easier use in industry. The proposed formulations have been extended to cater for the effects of external hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands in deep water applications. These forces are shown to have a great influence on the pattern of interwire contact forces and hence the interlayer slippage between the wires in the strand. Numerical results have been obtained and analysed for three different 127 mm diameter strands with lay angles of 12 °, 18 ° and 24 ° respectively, experiencing a wide range of external hydrostatic pressures of 0 to 2, 000 metres. The significant increase in normal contact Page | iv force between wires is shown to suppress the slippage of wires in the cable. However, the no-slip and full slip values of the effective bending stiffness of the cable is shown to be independent of the level of hydrostatic pressure. A theoretical model is also proposed for estimating wire kinematics, pattern of interwire slippage, contact forces as well as the flexural rigidity of locked <b>coil</b> <b>cables</b> with outer layers made of shaped wires. In order to validate this model, numerical results are reported for two different locked <b>coil</b> <b>cables.</b> It is shown that the shaped wires in the outer layers of locked <b>coil</b> <b>cables</b> {{play an important role in}} the distribution of contact forces, slip initiation and cable unwinding...|$|R

40|$|The {{bacterial}} cell wall is a mesh polymer of peptidoglycan – linear glycan strands cross-linked by flexible peptides – that determines cell shape and provides physical protection. While the glycan strands in thin ‘Gram-negative’ peptidoglycan are known to run circumferentially around the cell, {{the architecture of the}} thicker ‘Gram-positive’ form remains unclear. Using electron cryotomography, here we show that Bacillus subtilis peptidoglycan is a uniformly dense layer with a textured surface. We further show it rips circumferentially, curls and thickens at free edges, and extends longitudinally when denatured. Molecular dynamics simulations show that only atomic models based on the circumferential topology recapitulate the observed curling and thickening, in support of an ‘inside-to-outside’ assembly process. We conclude that instead of being perpendicular to the cell surface or wrapped in <b>coiled</b> <b>cables</b> (two alternative models), the glycan strands in Gram-positive cell walls run circumferentially around the cell just as they do in Gram-negative cells.
