5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed <b>chimeric</b> and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly <b>chimeric</b> and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse <b>chimeric</b> antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. Broken down into ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a <b>chimeric</b> monoclonal antibody used on the cardiovascular system. This {{and the following two}} names would look the same if the new convention were applied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no <b>chimeric</b> or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, <b>chimeric,</b> consonant r dropped).|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into <b>chimeric</b> contigs.|$|E
5|$|The EEHVs {{are members}} of the Proboscivirus genus, a novel clade most closely related to the {{mammalian}} betaherpesviruses that have been responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide, especially in young calves. There are currently six known species/types of the probosciviruses, and the most commonly encountered and most pathogenic form EEHV1 also has two <b>chimeric</b> subtypes, 1A and 1B., as well as numerous distinct strains.|$|E
5|$|Easter Island has {{the richest}} {{assortment}} of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been carved, including {{the stone walls}} of some houses {{and a few of}} the famous mo‘ai statues and their fallen topknots. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of <b>chimeric</b> bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the tangata manu ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred komari (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with komari. Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.|$|E
5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially <b>chimeric</b> taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E
25|$|A {{more radical}} option {{has been to}} exploit a {{property}} that {{plays an important role}} in meganucleases’ naturally high degree of diversification: the possibility of associating or fusing protein domains from different enzymes. This option makes it possible to develop <b>chimeric</b> meganucleases with a new recognition site composed of a half-site of meganuclease A and a half-site of protein B. By fusing the protein domains of I-DmoI and I-CreI, two <b>chimeric</b> meganucleases have been created using this method: E-Drel and DmoCre.|$|E
25|$|To reduce murine {{antibody}} immunogenicity (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), murine molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase immunologic efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of <b>chimeric</b> (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). <b>Chimeric</b> antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
25|$|The winged serpent-A <b>chimeric</b> {{creature}} {{with the body}} of a rattlesnake, feathered wings, a mammalian head and deer antlers. A local representation of the Horned Serpent.|$|E
25|$|Four major {{antibody}} {{types that}} have been developed are murine, <b>chimeric,</b> humanised and human. Antibodies of each type are distinguished by suffixes on their name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chimeric</b> mice: hESCs {{naturally}} reside {{within the}} {{inner cell mass}} (embryoblast) of blastocysts, and in the embryoblast, differentiate into the embryo while the blastocyst’s shell (trophoblast) differentiates into extraembryonic tissues. The hollow trophoblast is unable to form a living embryo, and thus {{it is necessary for}} the embryonic stem cells within the embryoblast to differentiate and form the embryo. iPSCs were injected by micropipette into a trophoblast, and the blastocyst was transferred to recipient females. <b>Chimeric</b> living mouse pups were created: mice with iPSC derivatives incorporated all across their bodies with 10%–90% chimerism.|$|E
25|$|The {{off-label use}} of rituximab, a <b>chimeric</b> {{monoclonal}} antibody against the B cell surface antigen CD20, may sometimes {{be an effective}} alternative to splenectomy. However, significant side-effects can occur, and randomized controlled trials are inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, {{scientists}} released news of {{the discovery}} of type H, the first new botulism neurotoxin found in forty years. However, further studies showed type H to be a <b>chimeric</b> toxin composed of parts of types F and A (FA).|$|E
25|$|Etanercept was {{developed}} by researchers at Immunex, and was released for commercial use in late 1998, soon {{after the release of}} infliximab (Remicade), which was the first <b>chimeric</b> monoclonal antibody against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees, other primates, {{and humans}} produce {{asymmetrical}} facial expressions with greater expression {{on the left}} side of the face (right hemisphere of the brain). Researchers also subjectively reported that the left side of the face was expressing more emotion using images of left-left <b>chimeric</b> faces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chimeric</b> mice are {{important}} animals in biological research, as they allow {{the investigation of}} a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab is a purified, {{recombinant}} DNA-derived <b>chimeric</b> human-mouse IgG {{monoclonal antibody}} {{that consists of}} mouse heavy and light chain variable regions combined with human heavy and light chain constant regions. It has a serum half-life of 9.5 days and can be detected in serum 8 weeks after infusion treatment.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab (trade name Remicade, among others) is a mouse-human <b>chimeric</b> {{antibody}} that targets tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a cytokine in the inflammatory response. It is a {{monoclonal antibody}} that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. It is administered intravenously and dosed per weight starting at 5mg/kg and increasing according to character of disease.|$|E
25|$|Signalling by LIFR {{intracellular}} domain homodimerisation {{has been}} demonstrated in hepatoma and neuroblastoma cells, embryonic stem cells and COS-1 cells by utilizing <b>chimeric</b> receptors that homodimerise upon stimulation with their cognate cytokines (i.e. GCSF, neurotrophin-3, EGF). However a GCSFR/LIFR chimera was not capable of signaling in M1 or Baf cells.|$|E
25|$|Simulation of HGT {{events can}} also be {{performed}} by manipulating the biological sequences themselves. Artificial <b>chimeric</b> genomes {{can be obtained by}} inserting known foreign genes into random positions of a host genome. The donor sequences are inserted into the host unchanged or can be further evolved by simulation, e.g., using the tools described above.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{therapeutic}} antibodies were murine analogues (suffix -omab). These antibodies have: a short half-life in vivo (due to {{immune complex}} formation), limited penetration into tumour sites and inadequately recruit host effector functions. <b>Chimeric</b> and humanized antibodies have generally replaced them in therapeutic antibody applications. Understanding of proteomics has proven essential in identifying novel tumour targets.|$|E
25|$|ZMapp is a {{combination}} of three <b>chimeric</b> antibodies effective in Ebola-infected monkeys. The limited supply of the drug was used to treat a small number of individuals infected with the Ebola virus early on in the 2014-5 West Africa outbreak; although some individuals recovered, the outcome is not considered statistically significant. A Phase 1/2 trial started in Liberia and the United States on 27 February 2015.|$|E
25|$|The dengue viruses produce many {{millions}} of infections annually due to transmission by a successful global mosquito vector. As mosquito control has failed, several dengue vaccines are in varying stages of development. CYD-TDV, sold under the trade name Dengvaxia, is a tetravalent <b>chimeric</b> vaccine that splices structural genes of the four dengue viruses onto a 17D yellow fever backbone. Dengvaxia is approved in five countries.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, three {{separate}} research groups, {{including that of}} Yamanaka's, a Harvard/University of California, Los Angeles collaboration, and a group at MIT, published studies that substantially improved on the reprogramming approach, giving rise to iPSCs that were indistinguishable from ESCs. Unlike {{the first generation of}} iPSCs, these second generation iPSCs produced viable <b>chimeric</b> mice and contributed to the mouse germline, thereby achieving the 'gold standard' for pluripotent stem cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of hemoglobins varies across species. Hemoglobin occurs in all kingdoms of organisms, {{but not in}} all organisms. Primitive species such as bacteria, protozoa, algae, and plants often have single-globin hemoglobins. Many nematode worms, molluscs, and crustaceans contain very large multisubunit molecules, much larger than those in vertebrates. In particular, <b>chimeric</b> hemoglobins found in fungi and giant annelids may contain both globin {{and other types of}} proteins.|$|E
25|$|Studies using <b>chimeric</b> mice {{have shown}} that antigen is {{presented}} by bone-marrow derived cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages and specialised B-cells called professional antigen presenting cells (APC). After gene gun inoculation to the skin, transfected Langerhans cells migrate to the draining lymph node to present antigens. After IM and ID injections, dendritic cells present antigen in the draining lymph node and transfected macrophages {{have been found in}} the peripheral blood.|$|E
25|$|Early primate trials {{had mixed}} results. One study {{examined}} the sperm-specific isozyme of human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4) combined with a T-cell epitope to create a synthetic peptide that acted as a more potent <b>chimeric</b> antigen. Vaccination of female baboons with this synthetic peptide resulted in a reduced fertility in the trial. However, a second study that examined vaccination of female macaque monkeys with the same synthetic peptide did not find reduced fertility.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{can be combined}} to increase the possibility of creating new enzymes, while maintaining {{a high degree of}} efficacy and specificity. The scientists from Cellectis have been working on gene editing since 1999 and have developed a collection of over 20,000 protein domains from the homodimeric meganuclease I-CreI as well as from other meganucleases scaffolds. They can be combined to form functional <b>chimeric</b> tailor-made heterodimers for research laboratories and for industrial purposes.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab (trade names Remicade among others) is a <b>chimeric</b> {{monoclonal}} antibody biologic drug that works against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) {{and is used}} to treat autoimmune diseases. Infliximab {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is used off-label outside its FDA approval for Behçet's disease and other conditions. Infliximab is administered by intravenous infusion, typically at six- to eight-week intervals. It cannot be given by mouth because the digestive system would destroy the drug.|$|E
25|$|As {{for plants}} and animals, fungal hybrids and polyploids display {{structural}} and functional modifications {{compared to their}} progenitors and diploid counterparts. In particular, the structural and functional outcomes of polyploid Saccharomyces genomes strikingly reflect the evolutionary fate of plant polyploid ones. Large chromosomal rearrangements leading to <b>chimeric</b> chromosomes have been described, {{as well as more}} punctual genetic modifications such as gene loss. The homoealleles of the allotetraploid yeast S. pastorianus show unequal contribution to the transcriptome. Phenotypic diversification is also observed following polyploidization and/or hybridization in fungi, producing the fuel for natural selection and subsequent adaptation and speciation.|$|E
25|$|Rituximab is a <b>chimeric</b> {{monoclonal}} IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma and leukaemias such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Class I RNR can be {{inhibited}} by peptides {{similar to}} the C-terminus of RNR2. These peptides can compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1, {{and as a result}} RNR1 does not form an enzymatically active complex with RNR2. Although the C-terminus of RNR2 proteins is different across species, RNR2 can interact with RNR1 across species. When the mouse RNR2 C-terminus was replaced with the E. coli RNR2 C-terminal (7 or 33) amino acid residues, the <b>chimeric</b> RNR2 subunit still binds to mouse RNR1 subunits. However, they lack enzymatic activity due probably to the elimination of residues involved in the transfer of the free radical electron from the RNR2 to the RNR1 subunit.|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} system includes blood proteins {{that can cause}} cell death after an antibody binds to the cell surface (the classical complement pathway, among the ways of complement activation). Generally the system deals with foreign pathogens, but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is <b>chimeric,</b> humanized or human; {{as long as it}} contains the IgG1 Fc region. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the membrane attack complex, known as complement-dependent cytotoxicity; enhancement of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently protein pores are formed in the cancer cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Fasciolosis {{is caused}} by two digenetic trematodes F. hepatica and F. gigantica. Adult flukes of both species are {{localized}} in the bile ducts of the liver or gallbladder. F. hepatica measures 2 to 3cm and has a cosmopolitan distribution. F. gigantica measures 4 to 10cm in length {{and the distribution of}} the species is limited to the tropics and has been recorded in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and south and eastern Asia. In domestic livestock in Japan, diploid (2n = 20), triploid (3n = 30) and <b>chimeric</b> flukes (2n/3n) have been described, many of which reproduce parthenogenetically. As a result of this unclear classification, flukes in Japan are normally referred to as Fasciola spp. Recent reports based on mitochondrial genes analysis has shown that Japanese Fasciola spp. is more closely related to F. gigantica than to F. hepatica. In India, a species called F. jacksoni was described in elephants.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{naming of}} Microraptor was controversial, {{because of the}} unusual {{circumstances}} of its first description. The first specimen to be described {{was part of a}} <b>chimeric</b> specimen — a patchwork of different feathered dinosaur species (Microraptor itself, Yanornis and an as-of-yet undescribed third species) assembled from multiple specimens in China and smuggled to the USA for sale. After the forgery was revealed by Xu Xing of Beijing's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Storrs L. Olson, curator of birds in the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, published a description of the tail in an obscure journal, giving it the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis in an attempt to remove the name from the paleornithological record by assigning it to the part least likely to be a bird. However, Xu had discovered the remainder of the specimen from which the tail had been taken and published a description of it later that year, giving it the name Microraptor zhaoianus.|$|E
