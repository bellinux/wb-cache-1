5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects <b>cancer</b> <b>cells,</b> it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in <b>cancer</b> <b>cells,</b> antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to study and compare the cytotoxic effect of the extracts of two plants, henna (Lawsonia inermis) and kejibeling (Strobilanthes crispus) on several kinds of <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines. The mechanism of the effect was also studied through the expression of cancer-caused gene, c-myc. This {{research was}} done in vitro using several kinds of <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines such as human colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (Caco- 2), liver <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (HepG 2), hormone-dependent breast <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (MCF- 7) and hormone-independent breast <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (MDA-MB- 231) and Chang Liver cell lines. The cytotoxic effect was measured through MTT assay and the potential cytotoxic value was calculated by determining the toxic concentration which may kill up to 50 % of the total cell used (IC 50). Meanwhile, the cytotoxic mechanism was studied by determining {{the effect of adding}} both extracts to the c-myc gene expression. The methods for determination were RT-PCR and sequencing process. The results showed that chloroform extract from henna can be used against human colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (Caco- 2) and liver <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (HepG 2) with an IC 50 -value of 25. 1 and 28 μg mLG 1, respectively. Kejibeling was also found to be cytotoxic against human liver <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (HepG 2) and hormone-dependent breast <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (MCF- 7) with an IC 50 -value of 0. 3 and 24. 8 μg mLG 1, respectively. However, the extract was not cytotoxic against human colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (Caco- 2). The smallest value of IC 50 was seen when the kejibeling extract was compared with henna. The cytotoxic effect of both plant extracts may be mediated by the down-regulation of c-myc expression...|$|R
40|$|Seven dihydrochalcone {{compounds}} {{were isolated}} from the leaves of Malus crabapples, cv. “Radiant”, and their chemical structures were elucidated by UV, IR, ESI-MS, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR analyses. These compounds, which include trilobatin (A 1), phloretin (A 2), 3 -hydroxyphloretin (A 3), phloretin rutinoside (A 4), phlorizin (A 5), 6 ′′-O-coumaroyl- 4 ′-O-glucopyranosylphloretin (A 6), and 3 ′′′-methoxy- 6 ′′-O-feruloy- 4 ′-O-glucopyranosyl-phloretin (A 7), all belong to the phloretin class and its derivatives. Compounds A 6 and A 7 are two new rare dihydrochalcone compounds. The results of a MTT <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> growth inhibition assay demonstrated that phloretin and these derivatives showed significant positive anticancer activities against several human <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines, including the A 549 human lung <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> line, Bel 7402 liver <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> line, HepG 2 human ileocecal <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> line, and HT- 29 human colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> line.

5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> or secretion of procoagulant substances.

5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing <b>cancer</b> <b>cells</b> rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of <b>cancer</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine {{with many}} physiological functions. The {{present study was}} designed to determine the expression of IL- 6 and its receptor (IL- 6 R) in human gastric and colorectal cancers.

The IL- 6 gene was expressed in two gastric <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines and one colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> line; however, most of the <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines studied expressed the IL- 6 R gene. The level of IL- 6 secretion in the gastric <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines correlated with the level of soluble IL- 6 R secretion, and was significantly higher (< ~ 100 pg/ml) than the level of IL- 6 secretion in the colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines (< ~ 50 pg/ml).

40|$|Gastrin-releasing peptide {{receptor}} (GRPR) is ectopically {{expressed in}} over 60 % of colon cancers. GRPR expression has been correlatedwith increased colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> migration. However, the signaling pathway by which GRPR activation leads to increased <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> migration {{is not well}} understood. We set out to mo-lecularly dissect the GRPR signaling pathways that control colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> migration through regulation of small GTPase RhoA. Our results show that GRP stimulation activates RhoA predomi-nantly through G 13 heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. We also demonstrate that postsynaptic density 95 /disk-large/ZO- 1 (PDZ) -RhoGEF (PRG), a member of regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) -homology domain (RH) containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RH-RhoGEFs), is the predominant activator of RhoA down-streamofGRPR. We found that PRG is required for GRP-stimulated colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> migration, through activation of RhoA–Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling axis. In addition, PRG-RhoA-ROCK pathway also contributes to cyclo-oxygenase isoform 2 (Cox- 2) expression. Increased Cox- 2 expression is correlated with increased production of prostaglandin-E 2 (PGE 2), and Cox- 2 -PGE 2 signaling contributes to total GRPR-mediated <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> migration. Our analysis reveals that PRG is overexpressed in colon <b>cancer</b> <b>cell</b> lines.
