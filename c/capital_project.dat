5|$|Netham Lock is {{the point}} at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the River Avon, gain access to Bristol's Floating Harbour. Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut, where it is joined by the River Malago, and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system {{designed}} and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. Access to the harbour is only possible during {{the day when the}} lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is above or below the level of the harbour. Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in December 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the £11 million City Docks <b>Capital</b> <b>Project.</b>|$|E
5|$|The MTA is also {{seeking to}} {{implement}} CBTC on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. CBTC {{is to be}} installed on this line in five phases, with phase one (50th Street/8th Avenue and 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike) being included in the 2010–2014 capital budget. The $205.8 million contract for the installment of phase one was awarded in 2015 to Siemens and Thales. Planning for phase one started in 2015, with major engineering work to follow in 2017. The total cost for the entire Queens Boulevard Line is estimated at over $900 million. The Queens Boulevard CBTC project {{is expected to be}} completed in 2021. Funding for CBTC on the IND Eighth Avenue Line is also provided in the 2015–2019 <b>capital</b> <b>project.</b> The MTA projects that 355 miles of track will receive CBTC signals by 2029, including most of the IND, as well as the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. The MTA also is planning to install CBTC equipment on the IND Crosstown Line, the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line before 2025. As part of the installation of CBTC, the whole fleet of subway cars needs to be remodeled or replaced.|$|E

25|$|Applying the {{internal}} {{rate of return}} method to maximize the value of the firm, any investment would be accepted, if its profitability, as measured by {{the internal}} rate of return, is greater than a minimum acceptable rate of return. The appropriate minimum rate to maximize the value added to the firm is the cost of capital, i.e. the {{internal rate of return}} of a new <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> needs to be higher than the company's cost of capital. This is because an investment with an internal rate of return which exceeds the cost of capital has a positive net present value.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the {{university}} received state approval to spend $12 million on design and site preparation; however, the General Assembly in 1994 {{did not approve}} the <b>capital</b> <b>project.</b> In order to start the project, Wethington established an unusual funding method: the city of Lexington would sell $41 million in bonds, and the proceeds {{would go to the}} University of Kentucky Alumni Association and Athletic Association, a semi-independent organization that would become the owner and builder of the library. The annual debt service on the library bonds is currently being paid from $3.2 million it receives annually from the Athletics Association.|$|E

25|$|Renovations {{continued}} through the early 2000s. In 2000 the Conservatory Water opened after a six-month restoration effort, with a $4 million project beginning on the 59th Street Pond, one of the park's most visible and heavily used landscapes. A new Reservoir fence was installed in 2003 under a $2 million <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> that replaced the old chain-link fence with {{a replica of the}} 8,000-foot long steel and cast-iron one that had enclosed the Reservoir in 1926. The new fence, along with removal of invasive trees and shrubs, restored the panoramic views of the park and Manhattan skyline.|$|E
25|$|Realm of the Red Ape is a £3.5 million {{extension}} {{to the existing}} orangutan house, home to Bornean orangutans, and was the most expensive <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> in the zoo's history before the construction of Islands. The exhibit {{opened to the public}} on 26 May 2007 after a two-year construction period. It comprises a new two-story building linked to the existing orangutan house with three indoor and two outdoor enclosures, providing accommodation for a larger number of apes. The outdoor areas can be viewed from a first floor public gallery and feature mesh roofs supported by tree-like structures which act as climbing frames for the apes. A further enclosure houses a group of lar gibbons.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{commenced}} {{operations in}} 1971 with $40million in direct federal aid, $100million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution. Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25billion. During the Reagan administration, appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601million, {{almost none of}} which were capital appropriations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak {{was on the brink}} of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2billion for Amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the Acela <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.|$|E

500|$|The City of Lewisville {{operates}} public recreation facilities, including parks, two recreation centers, {{and approximately}} [...] of trails. The $20 million Railroad Park {{was built in}} 2009 using the revenue from a quarter-cent sales tax increase; {{it was the largest}} <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> in the city's history at the time. It was renamed Toyota of Lewisville Railroad Park in 2010 in a deal worth $1.5 million. The park has a baseball/softball complex, a football complex, eight lighted soccer fields, two concession buildings, a perimeter walking/jogging trail, three man-made lakes, a dog park and the Scion Skate Park. Since 2010, the skate park has hosted the Scion Regional Amateur Tour, part an annual series of six skateboarding competitions held across the country.

500|$|Alberta's public {{telephone}} system was financed by debt, which was {{unusual for a}} government like Rutherford's that was generally committed {{to the principle of}} [...] "pay as you go". Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> shouldn't be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating deficits, acceptable. Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be a financially astute one: by focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication. These problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however; in the short-term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the 1909 election, in which the Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly expanded legislature.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, the council voted to proceed with its plans, and in September 2009, they formally approached Baroness Scotland of Asthal, then Attorney General for England and Wales to approve the sale. Criticism came from further afield when the Museums Association stated that the proposed sale would be in breach of the association's code of ethics as Southampton City Council had not fully explored alternate sources of funding. [...] The Munnings forms part of the Chipperfield bequest to the city, over which the Tate held an advisory responsibility. [...] They joined in the criticism, stating that [...] "the sale of works acquired through the Chipperfield bequest to raise funds towards a <b>capital</b> <b>project</b> is not advisable and, indeed, not {{in the spirit of}} the bequest." [...] The Art Fund, which had previously provided funding towards the acquisition of Bridget Riley's Red Movement (2005) by the city, expressed concern at the proposed sale, wary that it would [...] "set an uncomfortable precedent, stretching the sector's guidelines and effectively sanctioning the disposal of works of art from owned collections to support other areas of public sector cultural provision".|$|E
