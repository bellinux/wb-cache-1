5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him.

Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that could also be a good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> recent episodes.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

25|$|Gurney {{was educated}} at Macquarie Street State School, where his prowess {{with a pencil}} soon became evident, regaling his classmates with caricatures of their faces perched atop incongruous bodies.

This entailed taking night classes at Hobart Technical College, {{but it was not}} long before his attention was drawn to art classes conducted at the same institution by Lucien Dechaineux (1869–1957).|$|E
25|$|As is {{customary}} at German universities, {{students are}} generally required {{to arrange for}} their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however {{a large majority of}} students share private flats with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> students (German: Wohngemeinschaft, abbreviated WG), or live in single apartments. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.|$|E

Frey, who insisted that he bought DeLay Airfield—yet he had no proof—had {{a couple of his}} thugs plant posts in DeLay's airport so that planes could not take off. After DeLay had his crew remove the posts, C. E. Frey's gang dug trenches so that the planes could not take off. C. E. Frey ended up in jail with B.H. DeLay, C. Y. DeLay (B.H.'s father), G. F. Stephenson, Howard Patterson, along with others such as stunt performers, Frank Clarke and pilots Wallace Timm and Glen Boyd. DeLay had purchased the airport from the Crawford Airplane Company in September 1919.|$|E

25|$|Digger Crown {{made his}} first attempt to win major Italian event Gran Premio della Lotteria in May 2004, but was disqualified in the elimination. He won the {{following}} consolation race. Four weeks later, during the Elitloppet meet at Solvalla, he won the semi-big sprint race Sweden Cup. Even though Digger Crown had failed to reach {{the final of the}} Lotteria, he and his connections were to be successful in Italy during 2004. First, in June, they won Premio Duomo in Florence. In November, they were victorious in Gran Premio delle Nazioni at San Siro. Between those two events, the stallion participated in a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> major Italian races.

As a reigning champion, the stallion finished second and fifth in the two heats of Campionato Europeo. Earlier, in July, Digger Crown {{made his first}} and last start in Germany when he finished second in Elite-Rennen at Gelsenkirchen.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Mistyfoot rushes into ThunderClan {{camp and}} says that Mudclaw and Hawkfrost have been meeting at night.

Firestar assembles a patrol to accompany him to fight, and sure enough, a battle starts on WindClan territory. Leafpool is left behind with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> ThunderClan warriors in the camp. Two ShadowClan warriors invade and almost kill Leafpool when Crowfeather comes to her rescue. Crowfeather confesses he loves her, and she realizes she loves him too. During the battle, Brambleclaw fights Mudclaw. Although Mudclaw has the advantage over Brambleclaw, Hawkfrost saves Brambleclaw. Mudclaw claims that he and Hawkfrost had an agreement: Mudclaw would take over and make Hawkfrost the deputy, {{despite the fact that}} Hawkfrost is from RiverClan. Hawkfrost denies this when lightning suddenly strikes a tree, crushing Mudclaw and making a bridge to an island, making it the new Gathering place.|$|E
25|$|AMS Performance, {{based in}} West Chicago, Illinois, has set record power levels and {{performance}} {{numbers for the}} GT-R. Their Alpha Omega GT-R puts down between 1700–1750 whp and boasts 0–60 times of 1.7 seconds according to their staff on their official Facebook page. In June 2013, Omega set multiple world records at the WannaGoFast 1/2 Mile Shootout at Built Field Airport in Monee, Illinois which included: 214.04mph in a standing 1/2 mile; 60–130mph in 3 seconds; 0–100mph in 4.4 seconds; 0–200mph in 11.87 seconds. In July 2013, AMS regained their world record (previously held by John Shepherd's AMS/Switzer GT-R for a brief time) when Omega ran 8.259 at 185.18mph. A few days later, OMEGA broke into the 7s when it ran a 7.98 at 186.14mph, currently making it the quickest and fastest GT-R in the world, {{as well as the}} first GT-R to reach the 9's, 8's, and 7's. During the evening of the 7 second pass Omega broke a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> records. Omega bested its previous 60–130mph time with a staggering 2.67 seconds. Omega also broke the 100–150mph record which was previously held by an Underground Racing TT Gallardo (2.58 seconds) with an astounding 2.45 seconds. The AMS Performance Alpha Omega package functions more as a shop/research and development vehicle which is the reason why it is not available to the general public. However, anybody can purchase the Alpha 6, Alpha 9, Alpha 10, Alpha 12, Alpha 14 and Alpha 16 packages; each respectively with approximately 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1,400 and 1,600 wheel horsepower when installed and tuned.|$|E
