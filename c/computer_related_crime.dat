5000|$|Cyber crime, or <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> <b>crime,</b> is {{crime that}} {{involves}} {{a computer and}} a network. The computer {{may have been used}} in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target. Cybercrimes can be defined as: [...] "Offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet (networks including but not limited to Chat rooms, emails, notice boards and groups) and mobile phones (Bluetooth/SMS/MMS)". Cybercrime may threaten a person or a nation's security and financial health. Issues surrounding these types of crimes have become high-profile, particularly those surrounding hacking, copyright infringement, unwarranted mass-surveillance, child pornography, and child grooming. There are also problems of privacy when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, lawfully or otherwise. Debarati Halder and K. Jaishankar further define cybercrime from the perspective of gender and defined 'cybercrime against women' as [...] "Crimes targeted against women with a motive to intentionally harm the victim psychologically and physically, using modern telecommunication networks such as internet and mobile phones".Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Activity crossing international borders and involving the interests of at least one nation state is sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare.|$|E

40|$|Willie Sutton, {{a notorious}} American bank robber {{of a half}} century ago, was once asked why he persisted in robbing banks. “Because that’s where the money is, ” {{he is said to}} have replied. 1 The theory that crime follows {{opportunity}} has become established wisdom in criminology; opportunity reduction {{has become one of the}} fundamental principles of crime prevention. But there is more to crime than opportunity. Crime requires a pool of motivated offenders, and a lack of what criminologists would refer to as “capable guardianship”; someone to mind the store, so to speak. These basic principles of criminology apply to <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> no less than they do to bank robbery or to shop lifting.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computer internetworking and continued increases in Internet usage have {{been accompanied by}} a continued increase {{in the incidence of}} <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> <b>crime.</b> At the same time, the number of sources of potential evidence in any particular computer forensic investigation has grown considerably, as evidence of the occurrence of relevant events can potentially be drawn not only from multiple computers, networks, and electronic systems but also from disparate personal, organizational, and governmental contexts. Potentially, this leads to significant improvements in forensic outcomes but is accompanied by an increase in both the complexity and scale of event information. In order for forensic investigators to effectively investigate this mass of data, semantically strong representational models and automated methods of correlating such event data is becoming a necessity. The contribution of the work described in this paper is the automated detection of a computer forensic scenario, based upon facts automatically derived from digital event logs. We present an expert systems based approach that has the ability to manage the scalability and semantic issues arising in such inter-domain forensics, using an extensible, semantic domain model specified using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We have developed a prototype system, Forensics of Rich Events (FORE), which supports investigation of heterogeneous event data using a novel form of manipulation of hypothetical knowledge, while supporting the application of standard rule and signature based event correlation techniques. We demonstrate proof of concept of our approach by applying the prototype we have developed to a test case scenario that demonstrates the flexibility of the approach in a single domain context.

Cyber-crime is often traditional crime (e. g. fraud, identify theft, child pornography) albeit executed swiftly and to vast numbers of potential victims, as well as unauthorised access, damage and interference to computer systems.

40|$|The {{increase}} in <b>computer</b> <b>related</b> <b>crimes,</b> with particular reference to internet crimes, {{has led to}} an increasing demand for state-of-the-art digital forensics. Reconstruction of the past events in chronological order is crucial for digital forensic investigations to pinpoint the execution of relevant application programs and the files manipulated by those applications. The event reconstruction process can be made more objective and rigorous by employing mathematical techniques due to their sound theoretical foundations. The focus of this research is to explore the effectiveness of employing machine learning methodologies for computer forensic analysis by tracing past file system activities and preparing a timeline to facilitate the identification of incriminating evidence. A general criterion for measuring the efficacy of an analysis tool is to corroborate how well the analysis responds to the unforeseen evidence. The generation of a comprehensive timeline of the past events becomes more complicated if some information is missing or certain sources of evidence are contaminated or scrubbed. This thesis provides a genuine contribution to digital forensics research by focusing on the identification of the execution of application programs - a vital area which is not usually directly accessible from the available data. In addition to the neural network techniques; a Bayesian approach for data classification has been explored, this addresses the issue of missing/incomplete data. Bayesian methodology is an improvement over the existing ad hoc digital forensic analysis approaches carried out in bits and pieces.

40|$|Full textCyberbullying and {{harassment}} is a developing phenomenon {{brought about by}} the development of the internet. Kenya is ranked 4 th highest internet connected country in Africa with internet penetration levels of up to 28. 6 %. The development of the internet has led to positive outcomes such as improved communication but has also seen the rise of cybercrime. Cyberbullying is only a part of cybercrime with its nature being using information and communication technologies such as social media, email, blogs and websites to cause harm to others. In Kenya, this is on the rise and there is need to develop a working framework regulating against it. The freedom of expression theory may be used as an argument against these laws however, it is established that there are limitations to this freedom under the same Constitution that provides for it. The current legislation consists of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Kenya Information and Communications Act and the Cybercrime and <b>Computer</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Crimes</b> Bill of 2014.

Fast movers are making fortunes whereas rebels can act with impunity and move on before the legal process can catch up. The fast expansion of cyber crimes {{in the world has}} been the motivation to perform this research on its impact on the business community in Mauritius after the devastating effects in developing countries. Organisations that are not keeping pace with these realities are becoming vulnerable to cyber criminals or hackers. An analysis of the situation in the world from the literature review has provided {{a better understanding of the}} most common crimes that are causing trouble to the businesses and obstacles to the advancement of e-commerce. Compared to earlier technological changes, the internet has shown a rapid proliferation. Organisations have to be ready to face this challenge or they may face the dangers of being attacked or even prosecuted for not having secured their system properly. While securing the internet remains a major challenge for every country, businesses have to cope with limited protection until an international law become in force to control this wild territory.
