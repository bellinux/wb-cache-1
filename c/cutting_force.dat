Traditionally, <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> are calculated by equation which includes empirically measured specific <b>cutting</b> <b>forces.</b> In the article modelling of <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> with genetic programming is proposed, which imitates principles of living beings. Measurements have been made for two materials (aluminium alloy AlMgSi 1 and steel 1. 2343) and {{two different types of}} milling (conventional milling and STEP milling). For each material and type of milling parameters, tensile strength and hardness of workpiece, tool diameter, cutting depth, spindle speed, feeding and type of milling were monitored, and for each combination of milling parameters <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> were measured.

40|$|The aim in {{this thesis}} is the {{investigation}} of the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> during a dry milling machining process. An experimental design was developed and the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> were measured based on the cutting input parameters. The <b>cutting</b> <b>forces?</b> signatures are in good agreement with the metal cutting mechanics where effects of the tool run out and vibrations are observed. A parametric study has been conducted and the results show that the magnitude of the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> at a constant depth of cut increases with a high feed rate and a low spindle speed. These results suggest that the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> depend on the chip load at a constant depth of cut. Also, the increase of the depth of cut generates higher force magnitude due to the volume of material removed. A three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted using commercial FEA software ABAQUS to predict the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> in a dry milling cutting process. Different cutting input parameters were chosen to predict the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces.</b> The findings show that the predicted <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> depend also on the chip load. Later, a close fit has been found from the comparison of the measured and predicted <b>cutting</b> <b>forces.</b> Thus, the FEA model is valid and accurate. The surface roughness (Ra) was also studied based on different cutting input parameters and CNC machine quality. The results from the investigation show that the surface roughness depends on the chip load and the machine condition. This leads to conclude that the surface roughness can be predicted based on the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces?</b> signatures...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} work, the authors use displacement sensors in the spindle structure to monitor <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> for intelligent machining. However, the monitoring {{quality in the}} long term is a problem because sensor signals involve offset drift, which is mainly attributable to the thermal displacement of the spindle.

40|$|Laser-assisted {{mechanical}} micromachining {{offers the}} ability to machine difficult-to-cut materials, like superalloys and ceramics, more efficiently and economically by laser-induced localized thermal softening prior to cutting. Laser-assisted mechanical micromachining is a micromachining process with localized laser heating which could affect the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> and the machined surface integrity. The residual stresses obtained in the laser-assisted mechanical micromachining process depend on both mechanical loading and the laser heating. This article focuses on the experimental process characterization and prediction of the <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> and the residual stresses in a laser-assisted mechanical micromachining-based orthogonal machining of Inconel 625. The {{results show that the}} laser assistance reduces the mean <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> by approximate to 25 % and enhances the normal compressive residual stress at the surface by approximate to 50 %. Since microscale residual stress measurement is very time-intensive, a coupled-field thermo-mechanical finite element model of laser-assisted mechanical micromachining has been developed to predict the temperature, <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> and the residual stresses. The <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> and residual stresses' predictions are in good agreement with the measured values during machining. In addition, parametric simulations have been carried out for laser power, cutting speed, cutting edge radius, rake angle, laser location and laser beam diameter to study their effect on <b>cutting</b> <b>forces</b> and surface residual stresses...|$|R
50|$|A pivot saw has {{the highest}} degree of stiffness, because the forces are {{arranged}} in a closed loop (fig.1). If {{we assume that the}} base of such a saw is very rigid, the force will flow from the pivot of the gearbox to the ball screw feed system in a closed loop, whereby the <b>cutting</b> <b>force</b> engages in the middle, approximately, between rotation point and ball screw. This arrangement substantially reduces the lost motion and compliance in the feed system. Furthermore, the ball screw drive which forces the blade into the cut is bolted to the fixture frame which again is clamped to the billet and gives this arrangement additional rigidity.|$|E

50|$|CNC {{plunge milling}} {{is often called}} z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and <b>cutting</b> <b>force</b> coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model.

While Dagg and Silica stay behind to fight off their pursuers, Orin enters his original cavern home and begins to denounce Zygon, but is interrupted by Zygon himself.

50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply <b>cutting</b> <b>force</b> from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|E
