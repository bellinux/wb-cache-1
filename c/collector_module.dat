This testing was funded {{as part of}} the US DOE Sun-Lab USA-Trough program. The receiver tested was a new Schott receiver, known as Heat Collector Elements (HCEs). Schott is a new manufacturer of trough HCEs. The Schott HCEs are 4 m long; therefore, two were joined and mounted on the LS- 2 <b>collector</b> <b>module</b> for the test. The Schott HCE design consists of a 70 mm diameter high solar absorptance coated stainless steel (SS) tube encapsulated within a 125 mm diameter Pyrex{reg_sign} glass tube with vacuum in the annulus formed between the SS and glass tube to minimize convection heat losses. The Schott HCE design is unique in two regards. First, the bellows used to compensate for the difference in thermal expansion between the metal and glass tube are inside the glass envelope rather than outside. Second, the composition of materials at the glass-to-metal seal has very similar thermal expansion coefficients making the joint less prone to breakage from thermal shock. Sandia National Laboratories provided both the azimuth and elevation <b>collector</b> <b>module</b> tracking systems used during the tests.

However, {{it has not been}} possible yet to measure the geometrical accuracy of larger fractions of the solar field, resolving the relevant single characteristics like local mirror slope deviations, panel alignment and gravitational deformation. This paper describes the development and assessment of a measurement technique for the qualification of parabolic trough <b>collector</b> <b>modules</b> based on the distant observer method called TARMES (Trough Absorber Reflection Measurement System). Instead of a stationary camera at ground level taking pictures of a turning collector, the new approach called QFly makes use of an airborne camera vehicle which allows a completely automated and fast measurement of large numbers of collectors under relevant operating conditions. The new approach was validated against a stationary TARMES and photogrammetric measurement, supplemented by an extended uncertainty analysis. This analysis includes an assessment of the uncertainties of input parameters and their influence on measured local slope deviations. By applying a Monte Carlo approach, the effects on the RMS values of the local slope deviations of mirror panels and <b>collector</b> <b>modules</b> were investigated.

In order to reduce costs, most of the UNISAT satellites components are based on commercial off the shelf technology which Is supposed to be durable In space environment, such as solar cells. In this perspective the attention of our group Is now turned to terrestrial concentrator systems In order to evaluate their reliability for low-cost microsatellites EPS (Electrical Power Subystem). The paper deals with terrestrial grade, high efficiency, triple-junction solar cells considering a simple concentrator system that makes use of inexpensive materials such as plastic lenses to concentrate solar energy shining on a fairly large area and focus that energy on a smaller area, where a small solar cell is placed. The development of a <b>collector</b> <b>module</b> requires a lens with large aperture and short focal length avoiding the weight and volume used in conventional lens design: Fresnel lens. In order to compare different cost per watt and to find the better solution for our application, we tested three different kind of solar cells: silicon solar cells, space rated triple junction solar cells and terrestrial grade high efficiency triple junction solar cells. Laboratory tests did not give good results using commercial Fresnel lenses due to their opacity thus alternative solutions, at reasonable costs, are highlighted. In order to keep low UNISAT program cost carrying out new technological challenges, we would exploit this new technology, photovoltaic concentrator systems, with the aim to increase efficiency of low cost microsatellite power system.

40|$|During its {{expedition}} from 1872 to 1876, the HMS Challenger (see right) first {{proved the}} abundance of polymetallic nodules in the Pacific-, Indian- and Atlantic Oceans, giving rise to new interest in economic development of this resource. A century later, in 1976, the first successful pilot mining test for polymetallic nodule recovery was carried out. By now, 40 years later, hundreds of patents have been filed, and even more papers have been published related to deep sea nodule mining, yet progress remains slow. There is still no economically viable solution to mine nodules from the deep sea, and the few organizations involved in full scale testing rely heavily on government funding. In addition to funding issues, current designs struggle with reliability and cause severe turbidity in the deep sea environment. The subject of this work is {{the design of the}} collector subsystem, which is open to innovation. The collector is interfacing the natural environment containing the nodule resource on the one hand, {{and on the other hand}} the rest of the mining system. Therefore, its design is fundamental to the compromise between environmental impact and economic return which is central to the design as a whole. Innovating the design of the collector unit could steer away from the problems associated with current deep sea nodule mining designs, and perhaps make the development of this resource more viable, both in economics and environmental footprint. This could help make accessible a wealth of resources including manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth minerals, which are vital for, among others, the green energy and defence sectors. Therefore a new design alternative is explored, along which the following hypothesis: There is a viable design solution to be considered for the <b>collector</b> <b>module</b> of deep sea nodule harvesting equipment which will improve on efficiency and reduce the environmental impact as compared to current state of art. Exploring this hypothesis without any bias towards a certain design requires the adoption of a meticulous design methodology which is followed throughout the work.
