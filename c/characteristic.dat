They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties <b>characteristic</b> of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the <b>characteristic</b> chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their <b>characteristic</b> physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E

Participants (N= 133) completed an initial JDS for own job <b>characteristics.</b> Non-incumbents (n = 104) then completed a secondary JDS in order to rate incumbents' job <b>characteristics.</b> Non-incumbents' personality dimensions, own job <b>characteristics,</b> job satisfaction level, and incumbent satisfaction level were hypothesized as predictors of ratings of job <b>characteristics</b> of incumbents. Results indicate that two <b>characteristics,</b> job autonomy and dealing with others, were influenced by non-incumbents standing on these <b>characteristics,</b> and demonstrated evidence of the false consensus effect. Limitations and implications for interpreting job information are discussed...|$|R

This study defines interaction process <b>characteristics</b> between the supplier and the buyer as structural <b>characteristics,</b> functional <b>characteristics</b> and climate <b>characteristics.</b> Structural <b>characteristics</b> consist of centralisation and formalisation, functional <b>characteristics</b> consist of joint action and information exchange, and climate <b>characteristics</b> consist of trust and commitment. It addresses the following research questions: (1) How are interaction process <b>characteristics</b> defined? (2) Do environment <b>characteristics</b> of the firm affect the interaction process <b>characteristics</b> of the firm and its partner? (3) Does competitive strategy of the firm affect the interaction process <b>characteristics</b> of the firm and its partner? (4) Is relationship value defined as the sum of sub-dimensions of value in the relationships between firms? (5) Do interaction process <b>characteristics</b> affect relationship value? (6) Does relationship value affect the overall performance of the firm? This research was designed and conducted on the basis of quantitative methods. Data have been collected with the drop-and-collect survey method by means of a questionnaire based on a survey of the buyer or the supplier in the factory automation system, the IT and the automotive manufacturing industries in South Korea.

40|$|This {{study used}} {{quantitative}} analyses {{to determine whether}} organizational factors affected information technology satisfaction and use. The {{participants in this study}} were limited to undergraduate faculty who taught at baccalaureate-only institutions. The sample consisted of 2, 443 faculty from public and private institutions throughout the United States. The source of the data was the National Center for Educational Statistics. The major constructs included institutional <b>characteristics,</b> employment <b>characteristics,</b> disciplinary <b>characteristics,</b> demographic <b>characteristics,</b> research and teaching <b>characteristics,</b> and organizational satisfaction <b>characteristics.</b> The relationships between these constructs and faculty satisfaction with information technology and faculty use of information technology were examined by using bivariate analyses, multiple linear regression analyses and multiple binary logistic regression analyses. The results showed that elements of institutional <b>characteristics,</b> employment <b>characteristics,</b> demographic <b>characteristics,</b> research and teaching <b>characteristics,</b> organizational satisfaction <b>characteristics</b> affected faculty satisfaction with information technology and faculty use of information technology. In the final models, after controlling for the other variables used in this study, disciplinary <b>characteristics</b> did not exhibit any consistent patterns. The results suggest that time constraints significantly affected information technology satisfaction and use. Satisfaction with information technology was positively associated with information technology use for newer technologies, but not for technologies that were already widely used...|$|R
