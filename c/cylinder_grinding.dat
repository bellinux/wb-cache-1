5000|$|Beyond the arm, {{the west}} bank {{contained}} Canal Street Dye Works and a dockyard with a dry dock in 1851. The end of the basin was quite large, and the Manchester Flint Glass Works was located beyond it. The {{eastern side of the}} basin is marked as a brick field, where clay would have been extracted. By 1891, the brick field had become a Bedstead and Safe Works, with an electric engineering works and St Jude's Church occupying {{the east side of the}} plot. The glass works had expanded to cover the former docks, and the basin had been reduced to a narrow finger. By 1951, the site to the north of the side arm was occupied by a shirt factory, the Corporation Cleansing Department's garage and an engineering works, where <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> and welding were carried out by 1953. The whole area north of Mill Street bridge had been redeveloped by the time the 1972/1981 map was published.|$|E

40|$|During the {{production}} process development for the manufacture of an experimental supersonic aircraft, an unusual and difficult grinding problem was encountered. Arising from the experimental work carried out to solve this problem, a method of numerically evaluating the efficiency of grinding wheels and coolants, was developed. This evaluation {{is based on the}} fact that under constant and limited grit load conditions which can be set up in a surface grinding operation, the edge of the grinding wheel which makes initial contact with the workpiece breaks down and forms an approach angle as shown in Fig. 1. Once this angle is established, its dimensions remain almost constant, and with continued use of the wheel the angle recedes across the face of the wheel. It is the recognition of the variables which control the dimensions of this approach angle (alpha) together with the rate at which it recedes across the wheel face, and the amount of work done at each increment of recession, on which the numerical evaluation of the efficiency of the grinding wheel and the causes of the limitations are based. A description of the methods used for determining the characteristics of grinding wheels and coolants are included together with the calculations which are necessary when the data obtained from tests carried out on the surface grinding machine are to be interpreted and applied to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> internal grinding or form grinding processes...|$|E

The motion {{equation}} of the <b>grinding</b> <b>cylinder</b> is deduced, {{which is based}} on the dynamic analysis of the <b>grinding</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the ball mill coupled with vertical vibration. Numerical model of vertical vibration ball mill is built and used to study the motion of grinding cavity media and grinding efficiency. The simulation results show that the distribution status of the grinding media in each region is changed, the grinding fragmentation of the grinding media to the material is enhanced, and the efficiency of fine grinding is improved with the coupled vertical vibration in a ball mill...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The electro {{discharge}} machining (EDM) process is widely applied to produces surfaces of difficult-to-machine materials that require some form of grinding or finishing operation. This is conducted so as to improve the surface texture and appearance of the component’s surface. However, it is also desirable to remove the white uppermost recast layer or damaged surface layer (produced by the EDM process) {{in order to improve}} the functional performance of the surface. The finishing of the surface by traditional manual methods, especially in the operation of small and long internal cylinder surface, is both tedious and time-consuming. A novel electrically conductive diamond mounted point electrochemical grinding (DMP-ECG) process is being developed for hard passive alloys unclosed internal <b>cylinder</b> surface <b>grinding.</b> The process mechanism of DMP-ECG is introduced; the influence parameters of the surface roughness, machining accuracy, and diamond tool wear are investigated experimentally for nickel-based super alloys materials. An application of the DMP-ECG to aircraft engine component is verified in term of the optimized process parameters...|$|R
40|$|Microstructural {{examination}} of reaction bonded silicon nitride (RBSN) {{has shown that}} {{there is often a}} region adjacent to the as-nitrided surfaces that is even more porous than the interior of this already quite porous material. Because this layer of large porosity is considered detrimental to both the strength and oxidation resistance of RBSN, a study was undertaken to determine if its formation could be prevented during processing. All test bars studied were made from a single batch of Si powder which was milled for 4 hours in heptane in a vibratory mill using high density alumina <b>cylinders</b> as the <b>grinding</b> media. After air drying the powder, bars were compacted in a single acting die and hydropressed...|$|R
40|$|Milling is used widely as an {{efficient}} machining {{process in a}} variety of industrial applications, such as the complex surface machining and removing large amounts of material. Flutes make up {{the main part of the}} solid end-mill, which can significantly affect the tool’s life and machining quality in milling processes. The traditional method for end-mill flutes design is using try-errors based on cutting experiments with various flute parameters which is time- and resources-consuming. Hence, modeling the flutes of end-mill and simulating the cutting processes are crucial to improve the efficiency of end-mill design. Generally, in industry, the flutes are ground by CNC grinding machines via setting the position and orientation of grinding wheel to guarantee the designed flute parameters including rake angle, relief angle, flute angle and core radius. However, in previous researches, the designed flute profile was ground via building a specific grinding wheel with a free-form profile in in the grinding processes. And the free-form grinding wheel will greatly increase the manufacturing cost, which is too complicated to implement in practice. In this research, the flute-grinding processes were developed with standard grinding wheel via 2 -axis or 5 -axis CNC grinding operations. For the 2 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was modelled via calculating the contact line between the grinding wheel and cutters. The flute parameters in terms of the dimension and configuration of grinding wheel were expressed explicitly, which can be used to planning the CNC programming. For the 5 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was obtained with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel via setting the wheel’s position and orientation rather than dressing the dimension of grinding wheel. In this processes, optimization method was used to determine the wheel’s position and orientation and evaluating the machined flute parameters. Beside, based on the proposed flute model, various conditions for grinding wheel’s setting were discussed to avoid interference of flute profile. A free-form flute profile is consequently generated in its grinding processes. However, in the end-mill design, the flute profile is simplified with some arcs and lines to approximate the CAD model of end-mills, which would introduce errors in the simulation of cutting processes. Based on the proposed flute-grinding methods, a solid flute CAD model was built and a CAD/CAM/CAE integration approach for the end-mill was carried out to predict the cutting forces and tool deflection. And also, the prediction results with various methods are verified to demonstrate the advantage of proposed approach. This work lays a foundation of integration of CAD/CAM/CAE for the end-mill design and would benefit the industry efficiently. ...|$|E
