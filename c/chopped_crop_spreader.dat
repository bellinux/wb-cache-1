Allelopathic potential of the crops sorghum, sunflower, brassica applied as sole or in combination for horse purslane (Trianthema portulacastrum) suppression was evaluated in a pot investigation. <b>Chopped</b> <b>crop</b> residues alone and in combination were incorporated at 6 g kg- 1 soil (12 t ha- 1), and a weedy check was maintained. Germination traits time to start germination; time to 50 % emergence, mean emergence time, emergence index and final germination percentage were negatively influenced by residue incorporation. Crop residues also exerted a pronounced negative influence on the shoot and root length of horse purslane. Significant suppression in leaf and root score and leaf area per plant was also observed. A combination of sorghum and sunflower residues accounted for maximum (71 %) seedling mortality.

40|$|Yield {{performance}} in wheat (Triticum aestivum) was compared under crop residue, tillage system and nitrogen rate treatments in cereal based cropping system. The experiments were conducted at Agronomy Research Farm, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, in 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011. <b>Chopped</b> <b>crop</b> residue on dry matter basis (5 t ha- 1) of legume (Vigna unguicuata, var. Ebney) and cereal (Zea mays, var. Azam) was applied in main plots with no residue treatments and plowed with Mould Board (MB) and Cultivator as deep and shallow treatments, respectively. A {{month after the}} crop residue and tillage system treatments, field was uniformly plowed with cultivator and wheat was sown with drill in rows 25 cm apart {{in the month of}} November on both years. Both P 2 O 5 and K 2 O (80 and 40 kg ha- 1, respectively) were applied uniformly to all fields before sowing. Nitrogen as subplot treatment (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha- 1) was applied in two splits, half at 15 and the other half at 45 days after sowing with uniform cultural practices for crop growth and development. Compared to year 1, crop of year 2 showed better phenology with extended life cycle (LC). On two years average across tillage and N treatments, biological yield did not change (p< 0. 05) under the residue but did report lower at no-residue treatment. Nonetheless, grain yield showed a significant (p< 0. 05) change with the highest in legume followed by cereal and the lowest in no-residue treatments. A non-significant tiller number and significant variations in grain weight and spike m- 2 were observed that influenced the grain and biological yield differently. Deep than shallow tillage resulted in better traits, which returned better biomass and grain yield. Nitrogen application from control to every increment showed a significant (p< 0. 05) improvement in all observations contributing in yield. The study confirms the significance of legume vs. cereal over no-crop residue incorporated through deep tillage system with optimum N (120 kg ha- 1) in cereal-based cropping system for sustainable performance to sustain soil C:N for future production...|$|R

40|$|When straw {{is used as}} a fuel, {{the choice}} of {{logistics}} system from field to heating plant plays an important role for both costs and fuel quality. More than 80 % of the total fuel costs can often be assigned to different logistics operations, including harvest, loading, transport, unloading, storage, etc. The fuel quality, expressed in terms of moisture content, heating value, ash content, ash softening temperature, etc., is also, to a certain degree, dependent on the logistics, i. e. the choice of machinery, storage methods, etc. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify important factors that influence the choice of logistics system for fuel straw, and to further develop an existing simulation model for straw handling. This model was then applied to a system for delivery of fuel straw to a fictitious small-scale heating plant in the municipality of Sölvesborg in south Sweden. There are a number of factors that determine the outline of the logistics systems for fuel straw. Some examples are not controllable, such as the weather (e. g. amount of rain, temperature, relative humidity), geography (e. g. road network, size, shape and concentration of fields), soil properties (e. g. soil type and drainage characteristics), and crop-related characteristics (e. g. yield, harvest time and drying properties). By means of data from SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute), Lantmäteriet (the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority) and Jordbruksverket (Swedish Board of Agriculture), the impact of these factors can be modelled. Thereby the conditions for straw harvest in specific regions in Sweden can be investigated. Discrete event simulation is a very useful tool to model the whole machine system from field to heating plant (or storage). Different sets of machinery, storage strategies, types of organisation, etc. can be simulated and analysed by means of different quantitative and qualitative measures. The simulation programme used in this study (Arena) has a great flexibility and can also be used for simulation of handling of other biofuels with similar harvest and handling difficulties (short harvest periods, dependence on the weather, extensive transport work, etc.). The results from the application of the model to a small-scale plant showed that the costs varied from 140 SEK/MWh to 170 SEK/MWh. The operations with the largest potential to further reduce costs were considered to be transport and storage. Further studies are also required regarding machine capacities, storage losses, etc. in order to get more reliable data for the simulations and cost calculations. Costs for handling of chopped straw were considerably higher compared to baled straw. However, it was concluded that there is a potential to reduce costs by including <b>chopped</b> <b>crops</b> with other harvest times (e. g. energy grass, maize, hemp) in the handling system, and also by including other possible areas of use (production of briquettes, biogas, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is {{a serious}} pest of bananas. However, its ecology is not well elucidated {{especially}} in East Africa where plantations are up to 50 years old and are under various management and cropping systems. No single satisfactory control strategy has been found. Detailed information on C. sordidus biology and ecology is needed to explain the population dynamics of this pest {{in order to develop}} a comprehensive package for the small-scale farmer to alleviate the pest problem. Cultural control forms the first line of defence in pest control. For instance, removal of crop residues after harvest by chopping is a widely recommended cultural strategy for C. sordidus control. However, the actual effect of these practices on the insect's population dynamics is not clear. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of crop sanitation on population dynamics of C. sordidus and its associated damage. Laboratory and field studies on the biology and ecology of this pest on crop residues were conducted in Uganda. We found that corms are most attractive to the weevils than any other type of crop residues. Oviposition occurred on residues up to 120 days after harvest, but mainly on freshly harvested residues up to 30 days, implying that residues should be left up to a month before destroying them. In the study on survivorship of C. sordidus in crop residues, our results revealed that the pest successfully completes its life cycle within crop residues and emerging adults from different aged residues are equally fit. As crop residues can be a source of C. sordidus infestation to the standing crop, they need to be destroyed. There is a general belief that covering banana stumps after harvest helps reduce weevils in banana farms. However, there was no data available to prove that this practice is useful. Moreover, the real effect of covering stumps remained unknown. Our studies reveal that covering banana stumps after harvest reduces oviposition on them in the wet season, but encourages oviposition in the dry season. Therefore, farmers may cover the stumps in the wet but not in the dry season. Also, our studies suggest that covering all stumps in the wet season may encourage C. sordidus to oviposit on the crop. Therefore, some residues should be left in the inter-mat alleys to attract weevils away from the crop. The residues can then be destroyed after three to four weeks. Removal and <b>chopping</b> <b>crop</b> residues in farmers' fields helped to keep C. sordidus populations and damage lower than when the residues were left to accumulate. In comparison, removal of all residues in young closed banana plots reduced C. sordidus populations but increased damage on growing plants and reduced the levels of natural enemies. The implications of these results on the role of crop sanitation in the integrated management of C. sordidus are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for <b>chopping</b> non-cereal <b>crops.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the evolution of organic acids content during ensiling process of whole plant maize in three different conditions: inoculation of Lactobacillus buchneri, control and disinfection with sodium hypochlorite. <b>Chopped</b> whole <b>crop</b> maize was ensiled in vacuum polyethylene bags (0. 9 - 1. 0 kg per bag) with inoculation of L. buchneri, without it and disinfected with sodium hypochlorite. Three silos per treatment were frozen until analysis at - 20 °C after 0, 12, 24, 48 hour and after 4, 8, 16 and 30 days (72 samples). Immediately after defrosting simultaneous determination of lactic, acetic, propionic, butyric aconitic, malic, citric and fumaric acids was performed. Data were analyzed by using the GLM procedure of SPSS. Plant organic acids (aconitic, malic, citric and fumaric) lowered their concentration during ensiling process but malic, starting from 8 days after ensiling, kept on increasing until 30 days. Major organic acid found {{at the end of}} the process was lactic acid but its faster accumulation rate was recorded on first 48 hours in inoculated and control thesis when pH dropped under value 4. In disinfected samples pH lowered more slowly and its decrease was clear only after 24 hours when also lactic acid began to increase. After 8 days, in inoculated samples, lactic acid concentration decreased while acetic acid increased. We concluded that major cause of lactic acid production was not bacterial fermentations but enzymatic glycolysis by plant cell enzymes. Treating whole-plant corn with L. buchneri resulted in increased concentrations of acetic acid and decreased concentration of lactic acid when compared with untreated corn silage. Sodium hypochlorite did not blocked only fermentations but retard also enzymatic glycolysis. Interesting is the rise of malic acid content which was ascribed to a new production during ensiling process despite preservation of initial cell plant content. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Artemisia annua ? a plant {{cure for}} malaria Cue: The {{development}} of pharmaceutical drugs {{from the plant}} Artemisia annua {{has been one of}} the most exciting recent developments in plant-based medicine. Originating from China, artemisia is now being grown in East Africa, often by farmers who have left behind other cash crops such as tobacco. Having a plant-based malaria cure is of course nothing new. Quinine drugs, still used in some areas, are derived from the bark of a tree, the cinchona, which is a native of South America. But there are hopes that widespread cultivation of artemisia, combined with simpler methods for producing medicines, could offer great benefits in the treatment of malaria in Africa, at substantially lower costs. In Tanzania, farmers are growing the plant on behalf of a private company, African Artemisia. The leaves are then taken to Nairobi, where the medicinal ingredient, called artemisinin, is extracted. This is then exported to Europe for manufacture into drugs. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Peter Masawe about how small-scale farmers in Tanzania are involved in artemisia production. IN:		?We are planting this crop ? OUT:		? And also it is a malaria cure. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Peter Masawe of African Artemisia. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Masawe	We are planting this crop for curing malaria, and in Tanzania we have many places where we are growing artemisia. Laiser	You said artemisia is used to cure malaria. Is it that a person just takes direct the leaves or how is it? Masawe	No, no. After cropping it we transport our leaves to our factory, and there we undergo the crystalisation. And then we export those crystals to Europe. After that, the medicine can come back to cure malaria. Laiser	How did these farmers get involved in it? Masawe	In some areas we have the contact farmers who are helping the farmers how to grow artemisia. And these contact farmers are under an agricultural advisor, and the agricultural advisors are under an area manager. And the area manager is under the country director. All these are the services of helping farmers how to grow artemisia. Laiser	Now let us think of the quality, and also safety in cultivation. How is this controlled? Masawe 	Artemisia, as we said, is curing malaria, so we do not allow anyone to apply any chemical on this plant. You are not allowed. Laiser		So what else can be used to protect the crop? Masawe 	Yes, actually with this crop we are getting a problem at the earliest stage of the crop. When we transplant it you can find the cut-worms, maybe for a short time, about one month. So what we tell the farmer to apply is pyrethrum powder, and this pyrethrum powder you can dry it, and then you grind it and then you use that powder just around the stem, just a little bit. And then you will finish the problem of cut-worms. And management of getting the good quality is starting from the point of harvesting. We have two ways of harvesting. First we have plucking, but now we are not encouraging the plucking because it gives us the lowest artemisinin content. Now we are going with <b>chopping</b> the <b>crop</b> completely from the field, and then the crop will become dry. We start sieving it after hitting the leaves, and then we remove the stalks, and then the farmer is supposed to put the artemisia in the bags from ?African Artemisia?. Because maybe the bags which they can use have been contaminated with other things. So we provide the bags to the farmer. Mind you, before we were just harvesting this crop after 10 months. But now we are telling the farmer that we have to harvest this crop after 5 to 6 months and not more. Because from 8, 9 to 10 months this crop tends to lose artemisinin content, and this makes even the farmer not to get the profit which he is supposed to get. So this is what we are doing now. Laiser	How about the rain? How much rain is needed? Masawe	Artemisia needs enough water during the transplanting, about 2 - 3 months mainly, and then after that there is no problem. But other farmers also who are having irrigation can grow this crop for 2 seasons per year, so you see the benefit the farmer is getting. Planting this crop in the area where the altitude is low, this plant will pre-flower earlier, so high altitude is better for this crop. Laiser	Which other parts of the region, for example in Africa, are growing artemisia? Masawe	I know China are dealing with this crop, and it is the place where it started. But here, I know Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Laiser	What else can you say about artemisia generally, to the listeners who are listening to us now? Masawe	I can say, let us mobilize farmers to get into artemisia growing in those areas which are conducive of growing artemisia, by looking at the altitude, even the soil type. This will make people to get enough money, it is a cash crop. And also it is a malaria cure. End of track.
