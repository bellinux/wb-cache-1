5000|$|Lighter {{or nonexistent}} felt recoil force. lower {{force on the}} projectile, {{insufficient}} to <b>clear</b> the <b>barrel,</b> translates to a lower recoil force, which may be completely absorbed by the firearm's recoil mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|... 1) Muzzle - Keep your muzzle {{under control}} {{on and off}} the range even if it's not loaded or armed. Keep your muzzle free of {{obstructions}} and dirt. 2) Action - Check to see if the bolt is pulled back into the unarmed position, make sure there is no ammunition inside, check for a CBI (see also <b>clear</b> <b>barrel</b> indicator C.B.I.). Make sure that the bolt area is clean of debris and that there is no ammunition in it. 3) Trigger - KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU'RE AT THE FIRING POSITION AND READY TO FIRE even with safety. Remember safety is no accident. Remember to report all problems and safety issues to you range master. Also remember that YOU are a safety officer! only you can prevent accidents if you see an unsafe action yell [...] "CEASE FIRE!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Kyle Kobe is {{the first}} to <b>clear</b> the Double <b>Barrel.</b> He also took about a minute to remove a Jedi costume made for him by his mother.|$|R

5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to <b>clear</b> the <b>barrels</b> from their path.|$|R
2500|$|Squeegee/swab - From time to time, a paintball {{will break}} inside the player's marker. When this happens it coats the inner {{surfaces}} of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally {{have no time to}} clear this obstruction and instead simply [...] "shoot through it", woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool to allow them to <b>clear</b> the <b>barrel</b> following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space.|$|R
50|$|As the USP was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the SOCOM MK23, the pistol underwent much of the same rigorous testing. The barrel is cold-forged from chromium steel for increased life. USP barrels post-1994 use a polygonal profile, whereas 1994 and earlier models utilize traditional 'land and grooves' rifling. During testing, a bullet was deliberately lodged in a USP barrel. Another cartridge was then fired into the obstructing bullet. The second bullet <b>cleared</b> the <b>barrel,</b> resulting in a barely noticeable bulge. The pistol was then fired for accuracy and the resulting group measured less than 4 inches at 25 meters.|$|R

5000|$|Atypically {{for modern}} {{pneumatic}} air pistols (which are mostly {{charged with a}} single action of a lever-action pump), the 1377 can be pumped to various levels; Crosman recommends at least three pumps {{to ensure that the}} pellet <b>clears</b> the <b>barrel,</b> but as many as ten pumps are advised by the manual. Crosman claims a pellet velocity of up to 600 ft/s from a gun pumped ten times, which is higher than that achieved by most pellet pistols of any kind. Many 1377 owners report success with only a few pumps, and the lower velocity is accompanied by lower noise, often an advantage for those shooting indoors.|$|R
5000|$|Some blank firing {{adapters}} (BFAs) act as recoil boosters, harnessing {{the gases}} {{produced by the}} blank cartridge {{to compensate for the}} lack of back pressure that would normally occur as the bullet traps the expanding propellant gases until the bullet <b>clears</b> the <b>barrel.</b> This is important on gas-operated firearms, as they rely on tapping some of the pressure built up behind an accelerating bullet moving up the barrel. Without a bullet to act as a [...] "plug", the gases simply rush out the muzzle without generating enough pressure to cycle the weapon properly, since such devices are often fine-tuned to work only within a certain limited range of gas pressures.|$|R
50|$|The {{launch vehicle}} {{does not need}} to be {{revealed}} in order to use the munition, as the munition is equipped with its own navigation and targeting systems and gives it fire-and-forget capability. The vehicle can be completely hidden behind obstacles and still be able to launch the munitions as long as there is enough <b>clearing</b> for the <b>barrel</b> to elevate.|$|R
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case <b>clears</b> the <b>barrel</b> extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Holwick is {{the third}} to <b>clear</b> the Double <b>Barrel</b> (Kyle Kobe and Edgar Lai were the first and second) [...] Mark Holwick is the fifth to clear Iron Maizen on his first attempt (Jocelyn Peck, Chaz Hume, Patrick McIntyre, and Jay Isbell were the first, second, third, and fourth), and the third to clear the Axl of Evil on his first attempt (Christian Cannon and Tony Lee were the first and second).|$|R
5000|$|Sabots are {{a common}} type of slug round. While some slugs are exactly that—a 12-gauge metal {{projectile}} in a cartridge—a sabot is a smaller but more aerodynamic projectile surrounded by a [...] "shoe" [...] of some other material. This [...] "sabot" [...] jacket seals the barrel, increasing pressure and acceleration, while also inducing spin on the projectile in a rifled barrel. Once the projectile <b>clears</b> the <b>barrel,</b> the sabot material falls away, leaving an unmarked, aerodynamic bullet to continue toward the target. The advantages over a traditional slug are increased shot power, increased bullet velocity due to the lighter-mass bullet, and increased accuracy due to the velocity and the reduction in deformation of the slug itself. Disadvantages versus a traditional slug include lower muzzle momentum due to reduced mass, reduced damage due to smaller bullet diameter, and significantly higher per-unit cost.|$|R
50|$|The Deer gun {{was made}} of cast aluminium, with the {{receiver}} formed into a cylinder {{at the top of}} the weapon. The striker protruded from the rear of the receiver and was cocked in order to fire, and a plastic clip was placed there to prevent an accidental discharge, as the Deer gun had no mechanical safety. The grip had raised checkering, was hollow, and had space for three 9 mm rounds and a rod for <b>clearing</b> the <b>barrel</b> of spent cases. The Deer gun lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user, in order to prevent tracing of the weapons, and all were delivered in unmarked polystyrene boxes with three 9 mm rounds and a series of pictures depicting the operation of the gun. A groove ran down a ramp on top for sighting. The barrel unscrewed for loading and removing the empty casing. A cocking knob was pulled until cocked. The aluminium trigger had no trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|The G41's {{engineering}} origins {{lay in the}} 7.92×33mm Kurz StG 45(M) Assault rifle, {{and later}} the 7.62×51mm NATO G3 battle rifle. It is a selective fire automatic weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback system of operation. The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical rollers and a wedge-shaped locking piece, attached to a heavy bolt carrier. When fired, the build-up of gas pressure generated by the ignited powder charge exerts rearward pressure on the bolt, which is then transferred onto the rollers. The rollers are cammed inward against appropriately shaped walls in the barrel extension, displacing the locking piece. The geometry of the camming ramps on the wedge-like locking piece ensure a rearward velocity that is {{greater than that of}} the bolt. This ensures that the bullet has left the barrel, allowing bore pressures to drop to a safe level before the rollers are fully retracted, <b>clearing</b> the <b>barrel</b> extension notches and releasing the bolt, which is then engaged by the bolt carrier and withdraws together with the entire moving assembly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the modern KE penetrator combines two aspects of artillery design: high muzzle velocity and concentrated force. High muzzle velocity is achieved by using a projectile with a low mass and large base area in the gun barrel. Firing a small-diameter projectile wrapped in a lightweight outer shell, called a sabot, raises the muzzle velocity. Once the shell <b>clears</b> the <b>barrel,</b> the sabot is no longer needed and falls off in pieces. This leaves the projectile traveling at high velocity with a smaller cross-sectional area and reduced aerodynamic drag during the flight to the target (see external ballistics and terminal ballistics). Germany developed modern sabots under the name [...] "treibspiegel" [...] ("thrust mirror") to give extra altitude to its anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War. Before this, primitive wooden sabots had been used for centuries {{in the form of}} a wooden plug attached to or breech loaded before cannonballs in the barrel, placed between the propellant charge and the projectile. The name [...] "sabot" [...] (pronounced [...] in English usage) is the French word for clog (a wooden shoe traditionally worn in some European countries).|$|R
50|$|Avdi-Pasha, the Lord of Babuna, had an infamous chiflik intendant in his service, Ali-Aga, who was {{a notorious}} persecutor (zulum) of Christians. Ali-Aga had {{cancelled}} weddings, as {{the first day of}} his arrival was to be in his honour only. When Ali-Aga gathered the tax, he took an amount that suited him, and never followed any law. Ali-Aga beat villagers whose gibanica (pastry) was not fat enough. He ordered villages to slay sheep just in order to <b>clear</b> his rifle <b>barrel</b> with the tallow. The villagers had none at their side, so five villages (Stepanci, Prisad, Smilovci, Nikodin, Krstec) secretly conspired to murder Ali-Aga, but no one dared to fulfill the task. Then, Gligor Sokolović, aged 25, from a sixth village, accepted it.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{substantial}} progress in studying the structural and functional properties of GABAergic interneurons and their roles in the neuronal networks of barrel cortex. Although GABAergic interneurons represent only about 12 % {{of the total number}} of neocortical neurons, they are extremely diverse with respect to their structural and functional properties. It has become <b>clear</b> that <b>barrel</b> cortex interneurons not only serve the maintenance of an appropriate excitation/inhibition balance but also are directly involved in sensory processing. In this review we present different interneuron types and their axonal projection pattern framework in the context of the laminar and columnar organization of the barrel cortex. The main focus is here on the most prominent interneuron types, i. e. basket cells, chandelier cells, Martinotti cells, bipolar/bitufted cells and neurogliaform cells, but interneurons with more unusual axonal domains will also be mentioned. We describe their developmental origin, their classification with respect to molecular, morphological and intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties. Most importantly, we will highlight the most prominent circuit motifs these interneurons are involved in and in which way they serve feed-forward inhibition, feedback inhibition and disinhibition. Finally, this will be put into context to their functional roles in sensory signal perception and processing in the whisker system and beyond...|$|R
50|$|During {{the nearly}} 25-hour {{bombardment}} of Fort McHenry, commencing before dawn on September 13 until {{the morning of}} September 14, 1814, Armistead alone knew the fort’s magazine was not bombproof. When a shell crashed through {{the roof of the}} magazine but failed to explode, Armistead ordered the powder <b>barrels</b> <b>cleared</b> out and placed under the rear walls of the fort. Remarkably, only four men were killed, when two shells smashed into the fort's southwest bastion, despite a deadly rain of some 2,000 mortar shells that the British bombardment fleet fired at the fort. Because the Royal Navy proved unable to capture or reduce the fort in order to enter Baltimore harbor to bombard the main American defense line east of the city, British commander-in-chief Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane wrote to British Army commander Colonel Arthur Brooke that it was up to him whether to decide to attack or withdraw. Brooke, who had taken over from Major-General Robert Ross, who was mortally wounded just before the Battle of North Point on September 12, decided to withdraw.|$|R
5000|$|Double rifles {{can come}} in two barrel configurations, over and under designs (usually {{abbreviated}} as O/U) where the two barrels are mounted vertically {{one on top of}} the other, or side by side (usually abbreviated as SxS) where the two barrels are mounted horizontally next to each other. For dangerous game hunting, side by side rifles are usually preferred. This is for a number of reasons but predominantly because the barrels of an over and under gun must be pivoted much farther down to <b>clear</b> the lower <b>barrel</b> for reloading. During manufacture the barrels of double rifles require [...] "regulation" [...] to ensure the bullet paths from both barrels are aimed at a common point of aim. This can be done to ensure either the bullets 1) parallel each other closely at all practical ranges, or 2) converge at a given range, beyond which they begin to diverge. Because of the need to regulate a rifle to a specific loading of its chambered cartridge, once regulated a double rifle cannot satisfactorily shoot bullets of different weights or velocities, as it usually affects the accuracy. The process of regulating a double rifle’s barrels is complex and can be time consuming, significantly adding to the cost of the rifle.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first night}} {{that they went}} to bed {{together}} Snati asked Ring {{to allow him to}} lie at their feet, and this Ring allowed him to do. During the night he heard a howling and outcry beside them, struck a light in a hurry and saw an ugly dog's skin lying near him, and a beautiful Prince in the bed. Ring instantly took the skin and burned it, and then shook the Prince, who was lying unconscious, until he woke up. The bridegroom then asked his name; he replied that he was called Ring, and was a King's son. In his youth he had lost his mother, and in her place his father had married a witch, who had laid a spell on him that he should turn into a dog, and never be released from the spell unless a Prince of the same name as himself allowed him to sleep at his feet the first night after his marriage. He added further, 'As soon as she knew that you were my namesake she tried to get you destroyed, so that you might not free me from the spell. She was the hind that you and your companions chased; she was the woman that you found in the <b>clearing</b> with the <b>barrel,</b> and the old hag that we just now killed in the cave.' ...|$|R
50|$|The tragedy {{was soon}} {{forgotten}} {{and a new}} ‘pressing mill’ was constructed on the site. The hydraulic equipment for working the machinery was situated under the floor and, as an added safety precaution the floor itself was covered in leather. Shortly before noon on 23 October 1861, the building was <b>cleared</b> and eight <b>barrels</b> of powder and eight barrels of dust were brought in for processing. Twenty minutes later an explosion was heard and when workers arrived at the scene little of the building or its contents remained. Five men who were working in the mill died in the explosion; they were; Owen Begley, the foreman, Thomas Long, George Davidson, Thomas Hailey and Timothy Merrick. A verdict of death by accident was also returned in this case. But {{a couple of days}} later it emerged that one of the men who was retiring because of ill health had decided to treat his companions. He had crossed the river and purchased drink which he brought to the mill. The Cork Examiner noted: ‘It is a fearful warning as to the consequences of yielding to a momentary temptation, while on the other hand it is in a certain degree satisfactory for the sake of those engaged in similar operations, to know that the catastrophe arose from causes which are avoidable and that it would probably never occurred had the unhappy victims but adhered to the rules of the establishment'.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the visualization {{of the barrel}} cortex of the primary somatosensory area (S 1) of ex vivo adult mouse brain with short-tracks track density imaging (stTDI). stTDI produced much higher definition of barrel structures than conventional fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally-encoded color FA maps, spin-echo and T 2 -weighted imaging and gradient echo Ti/T 2 *-weighted imaging. 3 D high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data were acquired at 48 micron isotropic resolution for a (3 mm) 3 block of cortex containing the barrel field and reconstructed using stTDI at 10 micron isotropic resolution. HARDI data were also acquired at 100 micron isotropic resolution to image the whole brain and reconstructed using stTDI at 20 micron isotropic resolution. The 10 micron resolution stTDI maps showed exceptionally <b>clear</b> delineation of <b>barrel</b> structures. Individual barrels could also be distinguished in the 20 micron stTDI maps but the septa separating the individual barrels appeared thicker compared to the 10 micron maps, indicating that the ability of stTDI to produce high quality structural delineation is dependent upon acquisition resolution. Close homology was observed between the barrel structure delineated using stTDI and reconstructed histological data from the same samples. stTDI also detects barrel deletions in the posterior medial barrel sub-field in mice with infraorbital nerve cuts. The results demonstrate that stTDI is a novel imaging technique that enables three-dimensional characterization of complex structures such as the barrels in S 1 and provides an important complementary non-invasive imaging tool for studying synaptic connectivity, development and plasticity of the sensory system.
