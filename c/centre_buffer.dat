40|$|A {{methodology}} for evaluating and understanding how healthcare agencies are distributed within a city is provided. The study undertaken analysed {{the disparity in}} the spatial distribution of clinics within the metropolitan city of Daejeon, South Korea. Address and specialty of clinics in use were collected from five public health <b>centres</b> in 2010. <b>Buffer</b> analysis, hot-spot analysis, and generalized linear models were applied to the data collected. Multivariate analysis was also conducted on data collected in 2008 from the annual records of five ward offices (mid-level city administration units) taking the lowest administrative level of the city (the dong) into account. Buffer analysis showed that numerous clinics were located near major roads, while the hot-spot analysis identified three areas with concentrations of clinics and one area with hardly any clinics. The results of the generalized linear models showed variations depending on the specialty of the clinics suggesting that their distribution differed depending on specialty. There are no current regulations in force governing clinic location. Policy makers should consider improving the clinic distribution taking their speciality into account...|$|R

This study was conducted from August to December 2006 in the Station of Orangutan Reintroduction <b>Centre</b> located in <b>Buffer</b> Zone of Bukit Tiga Puluh National Park. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the effects of determining factors to the success of orangutans reintroduction to their natural habitat and to identify other factors that give impact to the reintroduction success. Data were collected through direct observation of activities and daily behavior of orangutans using scan sampling and continuous recording methods as well as through interviews with officials. Data analysis was performed descriptively and quantitatively using statistical tests (chi–square) with 95 % confidence interval. The results showed that there is a match between percentage of success of the reintroduction of the six criteria of reintroduction success. The results of chi–square indicates that determinant factors, such as age class, orangutan life history, treatment and duration of reintroduction stage, are correlated to the success of reintroduction activities...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the type}} code in the {{classification}} code a letter may denote the type of coupler, nowadays optional, as all new freight cars are fitted with <b>centre</b> <b>buffer</b> couplers (CBC). An 'N' suffix is for 'pneumatic', or air-braked wagons. Most newer stock that is air-braked also has CBC couplers, so the 'C' is usually dropped. E.g., BOXN for air-braked BOX wagons, not BOXCN. Almost all the older stock is vacuum-braked.|$|E
50|$|On some narrow-gauge {{lines in}} Europe {{and on the}} Paris Metro a {{simplified}} version is used, consisting of a single central buffer with a chain underneath. Sometimes there are two chains, {{one on each side}} of the coupler. The chain usually contains a screw-adjustable link to allow close coupling. These variants are also used elsewhere. On sharp curves, a single <b>centre</b> <b>buffer</b> is less likely to be subject to buffer-locking.|$|E

One feature was the Janney automatic <b>centre</b> <b>buffer</b> coupling. After its transfer to the Harzquerbahn, 99 222 was converted to the normal compensating coupling with central buffer. This conversion can be clearly recognised by the cutouts in the buffer beam.|$|E
40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{strategy to}} perform buffer exchange of particle and cell suspensions {{in a continuous}} flow format on, chip is presented. Ultrasonic standing wave technology is utilized to confine particulate matter to the <b>centre</b> of a <b>buffer</b> exchange channel while particle free buffer is sequentially aspirated via capillaries that branch off from the buffer exchange channel. At each such branch, clean buffer is supplied at an equal flow-rate from a capillary at the opposing channel wall, generating a sideways translation of the original buffer, laminated with a wash buffer stream. Each such junction increases the buffer exchange ratio accordingly. The reported buffer exchange system provides means to adjust buffer exchange conditions on-line by tuning {{the ratio of the}} cross-flow wash buffer relative the sample suspension flow, rate. The system performance was evaluated using 5 mu m polystyrene microbeads and a dye as the model contaminant. Wash efficiencies up to 96. 4 % were accomplished with a 0. 2 % solid content bead suspension, using eight cross-flow junctions, effectively exchanging the carrier buffer twice. The corresponding data for erythrocyte washing was recorded to be 98. 3 % at a haematocrit of 2 %...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: This study investigates {{associations}} between the combined physical activity environment and obesity and explores any sub-group effects by individual-level socioeconomic status. METHODS: In a large cross-sectional cohort (n = 22, 889) from the Yorkshire Health Study, {{body mass index}} was calculated using self-reported height and weight and obesity {{was defined as a}} body mass index ≥ 30. The physical activity environment was split into 'unfavourable physical activity', 'moderately favourable physical activity' and 'favourable physical activity' environments. This was based on the count of parks and physical activity facilities within a 2 km radial <b>buffer</b> <b>centred</b> on home addresses. A favourable physical activity environment was defined as having ≥ 1 physical activity facility and ≥ 1 park, unfavourable as having no physical activity facility and park and any other combinations defined as moderately favourable. Logistic regression (odds ratios) identified associations with obesity. RESULTS: Relative to 'unfavourable physical activity environments', individuals within favourable physical activity environments {{were less likely to be}} obese (odds ratio = 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 82 - 0. 97), and there was no effect for moderately favourable environment. Furthermore, once stratified by education level, this relationship was only present for those of higher education. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide novel UK evidence and is one of the first papers internationally that highlights the importance of considering the interplay of individual-level socioeconomic factors when investigating {{associations between}} the physical activity environment and obesity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) {{has been}} linked to "neighbourhood" {{socioeconomic}} status (nSES), often operationalized as a composite index of aggregate income, occupation and education within predefined administrative boundaries. The role of specific, non-composite socioeconomic markers has not been clearly explained. It is also unclear whether the relationship between nSES and CVD varies according to sex. We sought to determine whether area-level unemployment (ALU) was associated with CVD risk, and whether this association differed by sex. Methods: 342 individuals from the Montreal Neighbourhood Survey of Lifestyle and Health provided self-reported behavioural and socioeconomic information. A nurse collected biochemical and anthropometric data. ALU, a weighted average of the proportion of persons 15 -years and older available for but without work, was measured using a Geographic Information System for a 250 m <b>buffer</b> <b>centred</b> on individual residence. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate the associations between ALU, body mass index (BMI) and a cumulative score for total cardiometabolic risk (TCR). Results: After confounder adjustments, the mean 4 th minus 1 st quartile difference in BMI was 3. 19 kg/m 2 (95 % CI: 2. 39, 3. 99), while the prevalence ratio for the 4 th relative to 1 st quartile for TCR was 2. 20 (95 % CI: 1. 53, 3. 17). Sex interacted with ALU; women relative to men had greater mean 3. 97 kg/m 2 (95 % CI: 2. 08, 5. 85) BMI and greater mean TCR 1. 51 (95 % CI: 0. 78, 2. 90), contrasted at mean ALU. Conclusions: Area-level unemployment is associated with greater CVD risk, and this association is stronger for women...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a serial, three echelon, {{push-pull}} supply chain is investigated. The supply chain {{consists of a}} provider, a distribution <b>centre</b> (<b>buffer)</b> and a retailer. The material flow between upstream stages is push type, while between downstream stages it is driven by continuous review, reorder point/order quantity inventory control policy. Exponentially distributed lead times between stages are assumed. External demand occurs according to pure Poisson, while the demand that cannot be met is lost. The system is modelled using matrix analytic methods as a Markov birth-and-death process. An algorithm is developed to generate the transition matrix for different parameters of the system. Then, the corresponding system of stationary linear equations is generated and {{the solution of the}} stationary probabilities is provided. Key performance metrics such as average inventories and customer service levels at each echelon of the system can be computed. The algorithm is programmed in Matlab© and its validity is tested using simulation, with the two approaches giving practically identical results. The contribution of our work is an exact algorithm for a lost sales push-pull supply network. This algorithm can be used to evaluate different scenarios for supply chain design, to explore the dynamics of a push-pull system, or as an optimization tool...|$|E
30|$|Maritime {{or water}} borders are a {{geographical}} commonality for Australia and Southern Europe contributing to similar {{challenges in the}} fluidity of power-shifting mechanisms, due to both increased visibility and invisibility. The high seas become sites for maritime drama or ‘loud panic’ (Welch, 2012, p. 325) even as they are spaces that cannot be fully scrutinised. The maritime zones are the spaces in which the militarised responses to asylum play out, contributing to conditions that allow information to be monopolised and cultivated politically. Water borders also allow for expanding ‘othering strategies’ (Jamieson & McEvoy, 2005), which function to displace international human rights protocols by constructing asylum seekers as undeserving of protection. By entering into immediately enforceable bilateral agreements with non-signatory neighbouring nations, Italy and Australia are actively engaged in shrinking the space for human rights protections available for asylum seekers. The privatisation process of ‘migration containment’ on offshore detention <b>centres</b> creates a <b>buffer</b> {{between the state and}} international law norms. Removing or diluting responsibility of the state by the formation of contractual relations allows the state to produce a ‘truth’ of events without compromising its positioning in the global human rights agenda. Underwriting all of these trends is the geopolitical reality that water borders either in Australia or Southern Europe delineate the very space of socio-economic and political divisions. Pugliese argues {{that in the case of}} Italy, the prison island of Lampedusa represents ‘the fault line between Europe and Africa’ whereas ‘Christmas Island marks the fault line between Australia and Asia’ (Pugliese, 2010, p. 117). While it is arguable whether Christmas Island and Lampedusa form part of Australia and Italy, these zones are significant to migration questions precisely because they act as internal/external zones. The ‘symbolic’ and the ‘legal’ perspectives of those two islands are contradictory and pull their narrative in opposite directions. The symbolic narrative used in migration discourse has been for non-inclusion of asylum seekers into the national order and so has functioned as the pre-cursor to the broader attempts to externalise asylum even when legally tracked in those islands. We argue that the effect of the symbolic narrative in both zones is to keep the economic, social and racial divisions intact between the first and third worlds while also silencing alternative ‘truths’.|$|R
