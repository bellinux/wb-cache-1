In previous studies, different anode cokes were characterized with respect to anode overpotential and the gas evolution during polarization. Present work focuses on investigation of the interfacial contact between the anode and the molten salt electrolyte. The interfacial contact is important for the electrochemically active area of the porous electrodes, which is different from the geometric area. The focus is on the assessment of electroactive area by measurements of the double layer capacitance, which may be performed during electrolysis.

40|$|Rotary Kilns {{has been}} widely used for {{processing}} minerals, producing cement, <b>calcining</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes,</b> or drying biomass and wastes. Most of rotary kilns consume energy intensively. Therefore it is desired to assess the thermal losses from the kiln surface {{and find a way}} to reduce the energy losses. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of energy savings by painting the kiln outer surface with a low-emissivity paint. However, it must be careful to evaluate the insulation effect of the paint because good insulation will increase the metal shell temperature. Too much temperature increase could result in structural problems induced by differential thermal expansion between the shell metal and the refractory bricks. A detailed heat transfer analysis is conducted to help make a decision concerning paint selection and the potential consequence of painting the kiln surface. The results show that the thermal losses depend largely on the surface temperature. Every 25 ?C increase in the surface temperature will increase the thermal loss by approximately 17 % with the same surface emissivity at 0. 9. The paint emissivity has a significant effect on the kiln surface heat transfer. Lower emissivity paint decreases thermal losses but increases the kiln surface temperature. A commercial available paint with the emissivity of 0. 65 is selected to achieve the optimum result of an energy saving of 133 kW (0. 46 MMBtu/hr) without imposing detrimental destruction to the refractory brick's integrity inside the kiln...|$|R

The existing literature reveals {{that most of these}} research efforts are essentially focused on the image analysis of coke structure, optical texture (Das et al. 2009), porosity determination methods, model prediction to develop correlation etc. as aforesaid. It has been shown that total porosity and pore structure are significant factors affecting coke strength (Donskoi et al. 2013; Grant and Chaklader 1991; Johnson et al. 2013; Karacan and Badger 2003; Xing et al. 2013). It was observed that coke strength is mainly determined by pores and cracks that cause fracturing of coke (Kubota et al. 2011). Moreover, connected pores can cause coke fractures and that coke strength {{is directly related to the}} concentration of low roundness pores. It was concluded that the amount of low roundness pores is one of the factors determining coke strength. The coke pore and pore wall micro structure was quantified using image analysis (Andriopoulos et al. 2003; Radlinski et al. 2004). The micro structural features of a good coke included a relatively thick coke wall and a pore size distribution. The reason for cracks in anodes was investigated, as it was important for the quality of the baked anode (Bhattacharyay et al. 2013). In this article, an image analysis technique was described and analyzed as well as quantified the area percentage of pores/cracks and weight percentages of pitch and coke.

The final product, calcined coke, is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of raw coke, or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke.

40|$|Abstract This project {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of raw materials properties and heat-treatment temperature on the reactivity of carbon anodes. The properties of the raw materials such as structure, porosity, and chemical purity have strong effects on the final properties of the carbon anode composites. These properties {{interact with each other}} during the heat-treatment processes of the anode fabrication process, and may further interact during the reaction of carbon anodes under different gaseous atmospheres. Understanding the effects of these factors on reactivity is important in order to develop high oxidation resistance carbon anodes. There are great potential economic benefits from using high oxidation resistance carbon anodes in the aluminium smelting process, as well as reducing green house gas emission. A high-sulfur <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> (~ 3. 2 wt % S) and a low-sulfur <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> (~ 1. 7 wt % S) with various metal microconstituents in different quantities are used to study the effect of chemical purity. These cokes were calcined at multiple heat-treatment temperatures. A suite of 24 simulated carbon anodes was produced from these <b>calcined</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> at multiple baking heat-treatment temperatures. The effect of heat-treatment temperature {{on the development of the}} structure and porosity of these samples were studied using various techniques including gas adsorption, XRD, SEM, and TEM. The TGA method was used to measure the reactivity of the coke and simulated carbon anode samples. Sulfur was found to act as both a catalyst and an inhibitor to the gasification reactions. In air gasification, cokes and simulated anodes with high-sulfur content are four times more reactive than cokes and simulated anodes with low-sulfur content. On the basis of chemical structure analysis, the excess sulfur lowers the activation energy of the carbon-oxygen reaction by destabilizing the bonds of the adjacent carbons in the aromatic ring structure, allowing more active sites to form. In CO 2 gasification, cokes and anodes with high-sulfur content are less reactive than cokes and anodes with low-sulfur content. Sulfur is believed to inhibit the catalytic activity of metals such as sodium by forming non-mobile stable metal sulphide complexes. In addition, it was found that excess heat treatment enhanced the catalytic activity of low sulfur based carbons. Some metal complexes such as nickel nitrides destabilized during high temperature heat treatment and become active toward the carbon-CO 2 reaction. The calcination level of <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> was found to have strong influence on the structural development of simulated carbon anodes. Simulated anode composites made from lower temperature calcined cokes contained a better developed structure than simulated anode composites made from higher temperature calcined cokes. This was mainly due to the underdeveloped structure of lower temperature calcined cokes. On the basis that the under-calcined cokes have similar chemical structure to the binder pitch, the cokes formed stronger bonds with the binder pitch matrix as the composite structure developed during the heat treatment baking process. These under-calcined coke-based simulated anode composites were found to have better oxidation resistance than the simulated anode composites made from higher temperature calcined cokes. The evolution of pore structure and crystalline structure during gasification is investigated. The results showed that gasification in air produced slightly different structural development than gasification in CO 2. Because oxygen is more reactive than CO 2, it prefers to attack the most reactive parts of the carbon structure such as disorganized carbon and smaller crystallites while CO 2 attacks the carbon structure more uniformly. As a result, oxygen creates more porosity during gasification than CO 2. This observation was demonstrated with the simulated anode composites made from high temperature calcined cokes. Due to the mismatch properties between different components in these simulated anode composites, more porosity development occurred in air gasification than in CO 2 gasification. Another important finding is that the pitch component is completely removed from the anode structure by about 50 % solid conversion in both gasification processes. The findings in this project suggested that new processing conditions may be applied to produce anodes with high oxidation resistance. Unlike the current practice of optimizing the properties of one key component in the anode composites, it is better to minimize the differences in properties between different components in the anode composites. This includes the use of low temperature calcined cokes and a careful consideration of the chemical impurity of the raw materials...|$|R

With a continuous {{increase of the}} worldwide supply of heavy crude oil and the installation of more petroleum deep conversion processes, the output of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> is steadily increasing (Ding 2004; Zhang and Gong 2004; Zhan et al. 2010). Therefore, it has arisen as an urgent issue to dispose <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> on a large scale, especially for those with high sulfur content.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} firstly used in {{the cement}} and lime industry. Nowadays, they are utilized in numerous other material processing operations such as <b>calcining</b> of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke,</b> uranium dioxide production, reduction of ore in extractive metallurgy or pyrolysis of solid waste, for example. The device consists generally of an inclined cylinder, equipped or not with lifters, rotated axially and which can be {{either directly or indirectly}} heated. In the above-mentioned unit operation, hydrodynamic, thermal and chemical processes are strongly linked. Among the most important parameters influencing transfers (and reactions) occurring within the kiln is the residence time of solids. Hence, it is worth to characterize the influence of operational conditions on this key parameter. The best method to achieve this goal remains on the residence time distribution (RTD) measurement using the tracer technique. Several studies have been reporting on rotary kilns or drums of different size, but only few of them have been conducted on the solids behavior by the mean of RTD measurement. Nevertheless few authors reported the effect of operating parameters on the mean residence time (MRT) of solids and hold up. Others proposed correlations to predict the RTD curves or the MRT. Scarcer are investigations on the RTD in flighted rotary kilns. Finally, in these studies, the range of variation of the operating parameters is narrow in most cases. The aim of this experimental work is to understand and qualify the flow of solid materials in a rotary kiln using the tracer impulse-response technique. The solid material used was homogeneous sand with a particle size distribution of 0. 4 to 0. 8 mm. To characterize the material flow, sodium chloride of similar size distribution than the bulk flow was injected at the feed inlet. At the discharge end, samples were continuously collected. The samples were dissolved in distillated water and the conductivity was measured. Thus, RTD curves could be established. The effect of operating parameters, namely, rotational speed and slope of the kiln, dam height and feed rate of solids is investigated through the RTD curve, as well as the MRT of solids. Moreover, the effect of the presence of lifters and the shape of these lifters on the RTD is studied and discussed...|$|R
30|$|Abundant {{reports are}} {{available}} on the influence of blending methods on the co-combustion and co-gasification characteristics of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> and lignite. As lignite has a low calorific value and <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> has low reactivity due to its low number of pores and alkali species, blending the two may potentially overcome their individual drawbacks by combining their advantages (Wang et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2009; Zhan et al. 2011). Extensive studies have been carried out to determine the factors that affect their rheological properties, such as additive types, temperature, and particle-size distribution (PSD), in order to obtain slurries with high-solid concentration, good fluidity, and sufficient stability against sedimentation of the solid particles (Goudoulas et al. 2010; Zhan et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2010, 2012). Some significant studies involving co-slurrying of low-rank coal and <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> have been carried out. Vitolo et al. (1996) reported that the addition of fine pulverized <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> to coal water slurry improved its rheological properties at room temperature. Recently, Yang et al. (2008) and Xu et al. (2008) have qualitatively evaluated the co-slurrying ability of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> and low-rank coal. Most efforts in the past were directed toward enhancing the slurryability of coal by mixing it with <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke.</b> However, on further examination, {{it seems likely that the}} effect of mass ratio of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> to lignite on slurrying properties has not been adequately investigated. For the sake of convenience, the mass ratio of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> to the total blend of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> and lignite samples has been defined as the petroleum coke-mixing proportion (α). In the present study, the effect of variable values of α on co-slurrying of <b>petroleum</b> <b>coke</b> and lignite was studied with respect to slurrying ability, rheological behavior, slurry stability, and the effects of increased temperature. This study aims to obtain an optimal range of α that is suitable for industrial application, that is, to simultaneously attain the highest solid concentration and stability at a given viscosity. The findings of this study are of great importance for the promotion of industrial applications of PCLS.|$|R
