5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{receives}} a card from Carvel that entitles her to free ice cream cakes for life. She gets a free cake with the card {{but it has}} a mistake in the decoration so NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns it to the restaurant. When he gets a refund for the free cake, Jenna decides to scam the restaurant. With Kenneth's help, she orders several more <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> gets refunds for them. Eventually Jenna is banned from Carvel. The two then enlist actor Kelsey Grammer to assist them in a bigger scam. Jenna and Kenneth submit a sketch to TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) in Liz's name that requires dozens of cakes. Grammer orders the <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> later gets refunds for all of them. The gang has now collected money from both TGS and Carvel for 21 free cakes, a windfall of nearly 800 dollars. Kenneth runs into one of the Carvel employees (Jen Ponton) and learns that she was fired because of the scam. Realizing the negative effect of their actions, Kenneth decides not {{to take part in the}} scams anymore.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from the years when {{there were very few}} bakeries to meet demand.

There is now a local style with a wide selection of <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.|$|E
5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> drinks.|$|E
