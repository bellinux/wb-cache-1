30|$|Coming to {{the last}} group of variables, those related to product origin, {{we find that the}} {{macro-region}} has a high impact on price with more than 50 % PP for EVOOs from Northern regions and 24 % PP from Central regions, compared to those from Italian Southern areas. On the contrary, the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> has no significant effects in terms of price. This result is in line with those of the other works made in traditionally producing countries: Cabrera et al. (2015) for the Spanish market; Aprile et al. (2012), van der Lans et al. (2001), and Scarpa and Del Giudice (2004) for Italy; and Fotopoulos and Krystallis (2001) for Greece. Such values confirm that so far in the olive oil traditional markets, the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> plays a minor role compared to the wine sector where the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is a relevant quality clue, even if its impact is diverse in different market segments (Cacchiarelli et al. 2016).

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Almost every {{geographical}} wine producing {{area has}} a generic marketing organisation {{in the form}} of a wine route organisation or similar organisation that aspires to create a favourable perception of their area in the minds of wine consumers. In their efforts to try and escape the growing commoditising of wines, wine producers recently intensified their efforts to differentiate themselves from other offers by increasingly certifying more wine as wine from a specific geographical area, launching competitions that embrace terroir as the defining factor for quality and increasing the number of demarcated areas. It was the purpose of this study to examine whether the South African consumer assigns a high degree of relevance to the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as an influencing factor when purchasing wine. As a starting point, a literature study was conducted to establish the current state of knowledge regarding the relevance of <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of wine in wine marketing. The literature review also provided the framework for designing a survey conducted among South African wine consumers. The data gathered via an online questionnaire was analysed by employing both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The analysis showed that <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of wine plays a secondary role in influencing consumers when faced with a purchasing decision on its own. However, as part of the regional composite variable, which consists of variety, region and wine style, it plays a major role in influencing consumers (McCutcheon, Bruwer & Li, 2009 : 229). In accordance with other studies conducted among South African wine consumers (Von Arnim, 2008 : 58), the specific wine variety emerged as the most important factor influencing consumers. It was also found that consumers with a high involvement and interest in wine assign a higher degree of relevance to <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of wine than consumers with a low involvement. The findings of this research report are based on respondents who mainly reside within the Western Cape and the demographic profile of respondents shows that mostly male respondents completed the online questionnaire. The findings are therefore tentative due to the geographical and demographical limitations. This research report is of value to academic researchers, wine marketing professionals and generic marketing organisations such as wine route organisations...|$|E

The analysis was conducted {{with reference to the}} supply chain of the San Marzano tomato (SMZ), a typical local food. The product is endowed with an origin certification label (PDO), meeting demand within high-value market niches. The SMZ is a flagship product in the Italian region of Campania and has benefited from several regionally funded interventions, such as genetic research and support for the application for EU <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin).</b> Two key findings emerged from the research.

Second, the consistency between the adoption of quality strategy (brand of origin) and sustainable development of the sector was evaluated. Despite its intrinsic characteristics and its organized, well-defined structure, the SMZ food supply chain is unable to address sustainable objectives without considerable public intervention and support. In terms of sustainability, to be able to show desirable food chain characteristics, the existence of a fully collaborative relationship between the actors has to be ascertained.

One of many industrial sectors susceptible to that particular crime is the wooden furniture businesses. In many cases, it is apparent that natural products and raw materials of Indonesia are being exported without listing the country as the place of origin. The most common Indonesian material falls within this illegal practice are timber products. In the province of Central Java, Jepara has been a prominent center of timber industry producing high quality timber products and wooden raw materials. From a unique standpoint, the timber industry in Jepara is deeply rooted to the culture and identity of the natives, making the attempt to separate the discussion between timber industry and the people of Jepara not only  imprudent but virtually impossible. By looking at the statistic in which Jepara’s public education level is assessed to be still below the national standard, and as well bearing to the general fact that the timber actors in Jepara are more focused on product sales rather than important technical aspects such as <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> it should be projected that crimes such as fraud of origin could be easily committed in Jepara.

30|$|Consumer {{preferences}} about {{locally grown}} foods {{have been studied}} principally as they concern meals consumed in the home, while knowledge about consumptions outside the home is still fragmented. Studying the relationship between local foods {{and out of the}} home consumptions instead proves particularly interesting, considering the growth of eating out habits. In this scenario, our paper intends to verify whether using products of local origin in restaurants can represent an element capable of influencing consumer preferences positively. The analysis was developed by means of a choice experiment between alternatives that differ in <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> process certification, price and the main characteristics of the restaurant. The survey was conducted on a representative sample of Italian (500) and German (500) consumers. Applying Latent Class Modelling has enabled us to segment the market and profile the segments. Profiling was performed considering the socio-demographic characteristics, the choice motivations not expressly inserted in the choice experiment and the Schwartz value system. The results show not only a marked heterogeneity of preferences but also a consistent consumer segment willing to pay a relevant premium price for meals made from a prevalence of products certified as being of local origin. This segment, labelled ‘locavores’, appears across both countries, despite differing gastronomic traditions. Locavores are mainly young people who prioritise self-enhancement, stimulation and conservation in the sense of respect for traditions and being members of their communities. The ‘Discussions and conclusions’ section handles the principal implications from the viewpoint of the decisions of restaurant owners, as well as from that of farmers.|$|E
5000|$|Organic {{clothing}} is clothing made from materials raised in on in or grown {{in compliance with}} organic agricultural standards. Organic clothing may be composed of cotton, jute, silk, ramie, or wool. Retailers charge more for organic clothing because {{the source of the}} clothing's fiber are free from herbicides, pesticides, or genetically modified seeds. Textiles {{do not need to be}} 100% organic to use the organic label. A more general term is organic textiles, which includes both apparel and home textiles.

30|$|The {{results of}} our {{meta-analysis}} indicate that known brand, organic certification, olive origin certification (including European PDO, PGI and private <b>certifications</b> <b>of</b> country <b>of</b> <b>origin)</b> and neutral taste have {{a positive influence on}} consumers’ WTP. The opposite consideration can be made for articles published in peer-reviewed journals, and those referring to Italian consumers. Thus Italian consumers show overall less importance to quality attributes compared to consumers from other countriesc, while articles not published in peer-reviewed journals seem to overestimate the real WTP for the attributes. A possible explanation could be related to the difficulty being published in a peer review journal since higher WTP estimates are considered less reliable. Finally, traceability does not seem to influence WTP. This result is related to the greater influence that information on the area <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> has on consumer choices. Information on the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the olives seems {{the most important aspect of}} traceability for EVO consumers. Coefficients measure the relative variation of the final price of EVO in terms of WTP, and therefore can be interpreted also as measure of importance for the consumers of the attributes. This means that brand, organic certification and origin certification can be considered the product attributes showing the greatest influence on consumer willingness to pay. Finally, the neutral taste attribute shows the lowest WTP.|$|R
30|$|Analysis of the {{literature}} on EVO consumer preferences and the meta-analysis implemented on the information attained allow some interesting considerations to be made. The first concerns the importance of the research strand which continues to interest not only traditional producer and consumer countries but also new geographical areas, such as China and Japan, which have only recently discovered the product’s nutritional and gustatory value. The second concerns the evolution of factors/characteristics which have, over the years, been the subject of {{the literature}}. Constant value across the period in question is to be attributed to origin certification, in all its various specifications (PDO, PGI, and private <b>certifications</b> <b>of</b> country <b>of</b> <b>origin)</b> and, to a lesser extent, to the known brand. Such attributes represented the cardinal points of our analysis. In all the studies, as also shown by meta-analysis, origin and brand decidedly affect consumer preferences. In particular, all the studies carried out have shown unequivocally the strategic role played by knowledge, {{on the part of the}} end purchaser, <b>of</b> the oil’s <b>origin.</b> This situation appeared so evident that the European Union issued EC Regulation 182 / 09 in 2009 with the aim of making information on product origin clear and mandatory on the label. This new regulatory scenario combined with what was already written on the known <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the extra-virgin olive oil excludes this characteristic from the possible focuses of further innovative research. Investigating how product origin may affect purchases of extra-virgin oil becomes a question of valid research especially if the study is carried out in countries such as China, India or other economies considered potential wealthy markets for the product in question.|$|R
