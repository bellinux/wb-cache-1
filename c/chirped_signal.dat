40|$|We report {{experimental}} studies of the spectral linewidth and chirp characteristics of the mm-wave rf radiation of the Israeli Electrostatic-Accelerator free electron laser (EA-FEL), along with theory and numerical simulations. The simulations, matching the experimental data, were carried out using a space-frequency-domain model. EA-FELs {{have the capacity to}} generate long pulses of tens microseconds and more, that in principle can be elongated indefinitely (cw operation). Since a cold beam FEL is by nature a “homogeneously broadened laser,” EA-FEL can operate, unlike other kinds of FELs, at a single longitudinal mode (single frequency). This allows the generation of very coherent radiation. The current status of the Israeli Tandem Electrostatic-Accelerator FEL, which is based on an electrostatic Van de Graaff accelerator, allows the generation of pulses of tens microseconds duration. It has been operated recently past saturation, and produced single-mode coherent radiation of record narrow inherent relative linewidth ∼Δf/f= 10 ^{- 6 } at frequencies near 100  GHz. A frequency chirp was observed during the pulses of tens of microseconds (0. 3 – 0. 5 [*][*]MHz/ms). This is essentially a drifting “frequency-pulling effect,” associated with the accelerator voltage drop during the pulse.

Thereby the linearity of the ramp is important for distance resolution and to differ between multiple targets. Hence, it is a key parameter in designing FMCW-radars. If the ramp is not ideal, phase errors occur in the intermediate frequency. On the one hand, this may cover targets and on the other hand, clutter (virtual targets) could arise. In this thesis, a new method to characterize the linearity of frequency chirped signals will be presented. To analyze the impacts on the ramp linearity of a PLL-stabilized VCO-design, a frequency synthesizer has been realized, which is able to generate frequency ramps at about 8 GHz and 16 GHz. Nowadays, measuring the linearity of chirped signals with conventional measurement equipment is not possible. Therefore, a measurement setup has been designed, performing time-domain analysis of the intermediate frequency signal.
