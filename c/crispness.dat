These are prized by collectors for the <b>crispness</b> of their decoration. The motifs on kilims woven in this way are constrained to be somewhat angular and geometric.|$|E

25|$|Biscotti – {{generally}} anise flavored, often nut studded, hard cookie {{that may}} alternatively contain dried fruit or chocolate are common as well; often dipped in coffee rather than sweet dessert wines as in Italy.

25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and <b>crispness.</b> Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E
25|$|Over all of Mercury, the <b>crispness</b> of crater rims and the {{morphology}} {{of their}} walls, central peaks, ejecta deposits, and secondary-crater fields have undergone systematic changes with time. The youngest craters or basins {{in a local}} stratigraphic sequence have the sharpest, crispest appearance. The oldest craters consist only of shallow depressions with slightly raised, rounded rims, some incomplete. On this basis, five age categories of craters and basins have been mapped. In addition, secondary crater fields are preserved around proportionally far more craters and basins on Mercury than on the Moon or Mars, and are particularly useful in determining overlap relations and degree of modification.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. Baking soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance <b>crispness</b> and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish {{deteriorate}} rapidly at {{room temperature}} so processing starts soon after they are caught. The bell is separated from the dangling oral arms and both are washed in seawater before being scraped to remove the gonads and mucus. Dehydration is traditionally undertaken by sprinkling the jellyfish with table salt and alum, draining off the brine and repeating the process. Finally the jellyfish are heaped to drain, turned several times and left to dry. The whole process takes three to six weeks and results in a product with about 65% moisture and 20% salt. The alum reduces the pH and serves to firm the texture while the salt removes water and prevents microbial deterioration. In Malaysia and Thailand, a little sodium bicarbonate is added during processing which facilitates dehydration and increases <b>crispness.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the Allen and Unwin sheets {{appear to}} have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not phototypeset new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had {{accumulated}} up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the way it would with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its <b>crispness,</b> it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Hence, comparisons of type degradation to sort out the 15th, 16th, and 17th impressions would seem fruitless. Indeed, the 23rd impression's type block seems just as effectively identical.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, <b>crispness,</b> or crystalline structure.|$|E
500|$|From {{his early}} concerts, Bache was noted for showing thoughtfulness in his interpretations and an {{excellent}} pianistic technique. He was especially noted for the evenness and <b>crispness</b> of his scales and the [...] "great delicacy and refinement of feeling" [...] in his playing. Like Hans von Bülow, he was considered an [...] "intellectual" [...] pianist who gave performances that were well executed. He was also considered to have improved with time, becoming a less mercurial and [...] "fidgety" [...] player and that despite occasional exaggerations in his interpretations, his artistry was beyond question.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{oversaw the}} designs of sets and costumes, and he {{directed}} the performers on stage. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity. Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new <b>crispness</b> and polish in the English musical theatre. As Jessie Bond wrote later: ...|$|E
500|$|Gyroporus cyanescens is edible, and {{considered}} [...] "choice" [...] by several sources. The fruit bodies, even if mature, are typically free of insect larvae. Specimens collected in sandy soil, however, {{are difficult to}} clean, but cleaning may be facilitated by washing the fruit bodies {{in a bowl of}} water so that the sand sinks to the bottom. The blue color largely disappears after two minutes of sautéing. Cooked mushrooms have a meaty texture, and mild nutty flavor that is enhanced if fried to <b>crispness.</b> Drying the mushrooms strengthens the taste.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} were of {{the highest}} quality for the Nintendo 64 at the time. Smith praised general aspects of the game's graphics such as their <b>crispness,</b> detail, smoothness, and lack of polygon dropout. Reviewers praised the game's camera use, the game's [...] "very solid" [...] physics model, the impression of racers' speed, and the game's snow effects (sun reflected in the snow as appropriate, and fluffy snow and packed snow appeared and behaved differently). Graphical faults included occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and lag when racers passed through on-track trees; these problems were generally identified as minor.|$|E
500|$|The {{pages are}} unnumbered; {{the stories are}} instead broken into parts and chapters. [...] The {{overlapping}} of stories encourages readers to revisit earlier portions as the characters appear in each other's stories. [...] Ward did away with borders in the compositions, allowing artwork to bleed {{to the edges of}} the woodblocks. [...] He manipulates the reader's focus with the variously-sized images, as in the small images that close in on the faces of the businessmen who surround the Elderly Gentleman. [...] The images are more realistic and finely detailed than in Ward's previous wordless novels, and display a greater sense of balance of contrast and whitespace, and <b>crispness</b> of line.|$|E
500|$|In 1981 for the River tour, Jackson {{arrived at}} a [...] "checkerboard" [...] {{configuration}} of loudspeakers which were supplied with nominal left and right stereo signals, the signals connected throughout the sound system in an alternating pattern of vertical lines of eight loudspeakers each, giving the audience a semblance of stereo imaging otherwise impractical on such a large scale. [...] He continued its use on the Born in the U.S.A. tour in 1985. A reporter from Popular Mechanics described the 160 main and 40 auxiliary loudspeakers typically used at a large arena or stadium. Jackson set the main loudspeakers [...] high on scaffolding, each enclosure holding two 18-inch low-frequency cone drivers, four 10-inch mid-frequency cone drivers, two high-mid compression drivers and two high-frequency compression drivers. The auxiliary zones covered audience areas which wrapped around {{to the sides of}} the stage. The 200 loudspeakers were driven by 96 amplifier channels capable of putting out a total of 380,000 watts. The tour was said to have drawn [...] "unusual critical acclaim for <b>crispness</b> and distortion-free performances." [...] Jackson was nominated for a TEC Award as 1985's best sound reinforcement engineer but Gene Clair received the honour.|$|E
500|$|After more {{appearances}} on the first-team bench, and a sending-off for a [...] "reckless challenge" [...] in a reserve-team local derby against West Bromwich Albion, Davis signed for League Two Shrewsbury Town on 31 January 2011 on loan for a month, later {{extended to the}} end of the campaign. He went straight into the starting eleven and [...] "combined a <b>crispness</b> in the tackle with an impressive range of passing" [...] in what the Shropshire Star called [...] "a highly intelligent display" [...] as Shrewsbury beat Burton Albion 3–0. He [...] "rifled home a first time shot from just inside the box" [...] for his first senior goal to equalise away to Northampton Town on 5 March; Shrewsbury won 3–2. In all, Davis made 19 league appearances, all as a member of the starting eleven, and scored twice. His second goal, on the final day of the regular season contributed to a 3–0 defeat of Oxford United, but Wycombe Wanderers' win meant Shrewsbury missed out on automatic promotion and went into the play-offs instead. Davis played in both legs of the semi-final, in which his team lost on aggregate to Torquay United.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain <b>crispness</b> in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{simplicity}} of his style is deceptive. Bloom writes {{that it is}} the effective use of parataxis that elevates Hemingway's prose. Drawing on the Bible, Walt Whitman and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Hemingway wrote in deliberate understatement and he heavily incorporated parataxis, which in some cases almost becomes cinematic. His skeletal sentences were crafted in response to Henry James's observation that World WarI had [...] "used up words," [...] explains Hemingway scholar Zoe Trodd, who writes that his style is similar to a [...] "multi-focal" [...] photographic reality. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic [...] "snapshot" [...] style creates a collage of images. Hemingway omits internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) in favor of short declarative sentences, which are meant to build, as events build, {{to create a sense of}} the whole. He also uses techniques analogous to cinema, such as cutting quickly from one scene to the next, or splicing one scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose. Biographer James Mellow writes that the bullfighting scenes are presented with a <b>crispness</b> and clarity that evoke the sense of a newsreel.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Sargent {{became one}} of the best-known English conductors. For the British National Opera Company, he {{conducted}} The Mastersingers on tour in 1925, and for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, he conducted London seasons at the Prince's Theatre in 1926 and the newly rebuilt Savoy Theatre in 1929–30. He was criticised in The Times's review of 20 September 1926 for adding [...] "gags" [...] to the Gilbert and Sullivan scores, although the writer praised the <b>crispness</b> of the ensemble, the [...] "musicalness" [...] of the performance and the beauty of the overture. Rupert D'Oyly Carte wrote to the paper stating that, in fact, Sargent had worked from Arthur Sullivan's manuscript scores and had merely brought out the [...] "details of the orchestration" [...] exactly as Sullivan had written them. Some of the principal cast members and the stage director, J. M. Gordon, objected to Sargent's fast tempi, at least at first. The D'Oyly Carte seasons brought Sargent's name to a wider public with an early BBC radio relay of The Mikado in 1926 heard by up to eight million people. The Evening Standard noted that this was [...] "probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one {{time in the history of}} the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The body of {{the church}} is {{constructed}} in yellow sandstone ashlar, and the tower in millstone grit, an unusual material for churches in Cheshire. The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor draws attention to the <b>crispness</b> of the details of the stonework in the tower 500years after it was carved, compared to the sandstone, which is prone to weathering. The roof is metal. The church incorporates elements of Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular architecture. The overall plan is that of a trapezium; the west end is [...] wider than the east. The {{body of the}} church consists of a seven-bay nave and chancel with no structural division, and north and south aisles. The aisles are rectangular, thus the narrowing takes place entirely within the nave and chancel. The west end of the nave, between the piers (columns) of the arcades, is [...] wide. This is exceptionally wide for a parish church, and slightly wider than the nave of Chester Cathedral. The aisles extend along the sides of the chancel, forming north and south chapels. The tower stands {{to the north of the}} west bay of the body of the church, and is joined to it by a short passage with a porch on its east side. There are also porches on the west and south sides of the church.|$|E
500|$|The Marie Antoinette Suite is {{accessed}} {{from the}} main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and <b>crispness</b> of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E

[...] Schickel wrote that director Mangold [...] "never loses his <b>crispness</b> or his narrative efficiency." [...] Schickel said the comparisons to Unforgiven [...] "are not entirely apt", saying that [...] "Mangold's offering lacks the blackness and absurdity" [...] of that film. [...] He wrote, [...] "It is more in the vein of Anthony Mann's westerns of the 1950s — trim, efficiently paced, full of briskly stated conflicts that edge up to the dark side, but never fully embrace it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{production of}} Oklahoma! was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical [...] "a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting {{to the eye}} as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything". In the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote, [...] "Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended.... The Richard Rodgers score {{is one of his}} best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship." [...] Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that [...] "Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less <b>crispness</b> and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in Oklahoma! call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones." ...|$|E

Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but {{it sounds as if}} she's trying hard to maintain the <b>crispness,</b> straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't the way to do that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E

Writing for The Word that year, Paul Du Noyer referred to the album as [...] "the lost treasure" [...] among Harrison's Dark Horse Years reissues, and in a concurrent review for Blender, he highlighted [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] and [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] as the standout tracks. In another 2004 appraisal, for PopMatters, Jason Korenkiewicz wrote that the remaster [...] "allows the guitars to ring, and the percussion has a <b>crispness</b> that was hidden in past releases". Korenkiewicz included [...] "the magnificent 'Dear One'" [...] among the album's [...] "countless classic tracks" [...] and considered that Thirty Three & ⅓ [...] "features more consistent high points than any Harrison album since All Things Must Pass". Conversely, Kit Aiken of Uncut described it as an [...] "oddly ordinary album" [...] that reflected the [...] "blow to his confidence and inspiration" [...] {{as a result of}} the court's ruling on [...] "My Sweet Lord". Writing for the same magazine in July 2012, David Quantick included Thirty Three & ⅓ among Harrison's best solo releases, along with All Things Must Pass and Cloud Nine.|$|E
2500|$|The statue {{has been}} dated on stylistic grounds {{to have been}} {{produced}} between 1375 and 1400. [...] The status of the foundation at Norton was raised {{from that of a}} priory to a mitred abbey in 1391, and it has been suggested by J. Patrick Greene, the director of the excavations in the 1970s and 1980s, that the statue may have been commissioned as a result of this. [...] The priory was dedicated to StMary, and when its status was raised to that of an abbey, StChristopher was adopted as a subsidiary patron saint. [...] The sandstone was probably obtained from a quarry [...] from the priory at Windmill Hill. [...] It is likely that the statue was carved at the priory, but the identity of the sculptor is not known. [...] The original position of the statue in the priory is uncertain. Greene suggested that it stood in the outer courtyard of the priory, where it is shown in a print dated 1727. [...] However Marrow argued that it was probably originally placed at the west end of the abbey church. [...] He supports this by the fact that statues of StChristopher were sited at the west end of Notre Dame in Paris and the church in Terrington St Clement, Norfolk. [...] He also says that the <b>crispness</b> of the carving is consistent with the statue having been indoors for part of its existence.|$|E
