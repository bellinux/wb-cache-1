25|$|About 70% of {{domestic}} cats are especially attracted to, and {{affected by the}} plant Nepeta cataria, otherwise known as catnip. Wild cats, including tigers, are also affected, but with unknown percentage. The first reaction of cats is to sniff. Then, they lick and sometimes chew the plant and after that rub against it, with their cheeks and the whole body by rolling over. If cats consume <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> of the plant, they quickly show signs of over-excitement such as violent twitching, profuse salivation and sexual arousal. The reaction {{is caused by the}} volatile terpenoids called nepetalactones present in the plant. Although they are mildly toxic and repel insects from the plant, their concentration is too low to poison cats.|$|E

However, he was only able to isolate a monobenzoyl derivative of epinephrine.

Takamine, who had visited his lab, was able to successfully isolate the neutral base of epinephrine by adding ammonium to highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract,</b> a method Abel himself tried but failed due to the use of low concentration of extract.

5000|$|The U.S. DEA first {{encountered}} THC-O-acetate as an apparent controlled substance analogue of THC in 1978. It was apparently made in an analogous manner to how heroin {{is made from}} morphine. The incident was described by Donald A.

However, ten years ago (1978) an attempt to produce CsA's from cannabis extracts was encountered in the Jacksonville, Florida area. In this case a <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> of cannabis had been obtained by a soxhlet extraction. The extract had been acetylated with acetic anhydride, and in the final step, the excess acetic anhydride removed by distillation (reference is unretrievable due to its appearance in an underground periodical). The product contained neither quantities of nonderivatized cannabinoid nor any identifiable plant fragments. Since this single instance, no acetalaced cannabinoid samples have been reported by a DEA laboratory. Therefore, this instance is assumed to represent an isolated occurrence and as such, will serve to terminate our discussion of cannabinoid CsA's." ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes induced on the vagina of ovariectomized rats after treatment with soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> or conjugated equine estrogens and the association of both drugs. Methods: We conducted an experimental study with 50 ovariectomized rats that were randomly divided into five equal groups of 10 animals: GI received vehicle, GII received soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 46 mg/kg per day, GIII received soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 120 mg/kg per day, GIV received conjugated equine estrogens 50 mu g/kg per day, and GV received conjugated equine estrogens 50 mu g/kg and soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 46 mg/kg per day. the substances were administered by gavage during 21 consecutive days. After that, the animals were killed under anesthesia and the vagina was removed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Data were initially submitted to analysis of variance. Whenever a significant difference was detected, the study was complemented with the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. Results: GII did not show any differences on the vaginal epithelium or collagen compared with GI. GIII presented an increase in vaginal epithelium and collagen amount. GIV had the highest amount of collagen and the signals of vaginal proliferation. GV did not show any additional effect compared with GIV. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a high dose of isoflavone-rich soy extract may have positive effects on the vaginal structures of ovariectomized rats, but this action is less than that of estrogen treatment on vaginal thickness. in addition, soy extract may not block the estrogen effect on vaginal tissue.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe Lupinus genus had {{its origin}} in the Mediterranean basin and in North Africa, with {{existing}} records of its cultivation in Egypt about 4000 years ago. The four main species of the Lupinus genus {{in the world are}} L. albus, L. angustifolius, L. luteus and L. mutabilis, being Australia the world biggest producer. The main reasons for its cultivation are human consumption, green manure, animal feed and its use as a protein supplement. The discovery of a polypeptide extracted from cells of the germinated cotyledons with antifungal properties and biostimulant ability created an innovative application for lupine: the production of a biofungicide. Damage of the cotyledonary tissue led to a decrease in protein content available for extraction. Germination of a sweet variety in the presence of bitter seeds suggested that there was an increase in the amount of protein available for extraction from sweet seeds. It was possible to obtain a <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> by clarifying the extract using a thermal fractionation method. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> was combined successfully with a number of surfactant agents, from which the most appropriate were chosen according to wetting and spreadability properties and to the concept of a non-synthetic biofungicide. The formulated extract showed a strong buffering capacity and a high resistance to stress factors such as temperature and agitation during an eight week period. Evaporation proved to be an adequate method of concentration at pilot scale as an alternative to laboratory-scale freeze-drying. The production of a <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> with 20 % (w/w) protein was possible through the extract concentration with tree single step evaporations. The first two were separated by a thermal fractionation.
