Combustion conditions are representative of pulverized coal in the temperature range 1250 to 1750 K. The model is a generalized mechanistic model with nitric oxide or HCN being released directly from the <b>char</b> <b>N.</b> Homogenous gas-phase reactions of NO occur within the particle, as well as heterogenous NO reduction on the char 2 ̆ 7 s surface. Intrinsic rate kinetics are used to model the char combustion, while the NO reduction kinetics are chosen from the literature. The model was tested against experimental results for coal chars found in the literature and our own work with petroleum coke. Modeling suggests that two mechanisms are possible for the conversion of <b>char</b> <b>N</b> to NO at high temperatures: <b>char</b> <b>N</b> goes completely to NO and is subsequently reduced on the char 2 ̆ 7 s surface; or <b>char</b> <b>N</b> goes completely to HCN and is oxidized and reduced in the atmosphere external to the particle. Both approaches produce realistic results when applied to a laminar flow computational fluid flow/heat transfer model of a drop tube furnace. Our model describes NO formation at high temperatures and does not consider NO reactions which are important at fluidized bed temperatures...|$|R

[...] Celebrado del 12 - 16 de noviembre 2006, en Indianápolis, USA. Charcoal, {{produced}} during vegetation fires is well {{recognized as an}} important C sink. Whereas severe fire can lead to complete destruction of the organic layer, moderate wildfire result in minor alterations of soil organic matter (SOM) and sometimes even result in an increase of organic C and N due to input of partly charred material. Moderate heating of vegetation residues leads to little changes of the C/N ratios. It can be as wide as 440 to 630 for burnt woody material but also as narrow as 6. 0 to 6. 9 as it was found for char from for young grass material. These C/N ratios clearly show that during <b>charring,</b> <b>N</b> is incorporated into structures which are fairly resistant to heating. As demonstrated by 15 N NMR those structures are mostly pyrrole/indole-type N with minor contribution of pyridine <b>N.</b> In non-woody <b>chars,</b> such N-heteroaromatics can consume up to 17 % and sometimes even 60 % of their organic C, which indicates that char models assuming a graphite-like structure may be oversimplified. However, compared to most proteinaceous compounds in litter, heteroaromatic N is less accessible for microorganisms. Thus, incorporation of char into SOM increases the stable soil organic carbon content, but also the amount of inert refractory organic nitrogen. The low biological availability of this nitrogen {{has an impact on}} biomass production but also on SOM turnover. As demonstrated by its presence in a forest soil 24 years after the last fire, this pyrogenic N seems to be relatively stable and thus is expected to have a long term impact on soil biochemistry. The collected data clearly show that “Black Nitrogen” (BN) certainly needs more attention if a better understanding of SOM stabilization is wanted. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|After {{vegetation}} fires considerable {{amounts of}} charred necromass {{are incorporated into}} soils and sediments. To elucidate its role in geobiochemical cycles {{a good understanding of}} its chemistry is crucial. Although several models describing char on a molecular level are reported in the literature (Schmidt & Noack, 2000), a commonly accepted view of the chemistry involved in Black Carbon (BC) production during vegetation fires is still missing. Therefore, the intention of the present work was to obtain some insights into structural properties of char produced during biomass burning by comparing results obtained from controlled charring experiments, the analysis of naturally charred soil organic matter with the pyrolysis literature. Our studies indicate that the aromatic skeleton of char accumulating after a vegetation fire must contain remains of the lignin backbone and considerable contributions of furans and anhydrosugars from thermally altered cellulose.

40|$|Pyrolysis is {{an energy}} {{conversion}} technology which by heating organic {{materials in the}} absence of oxygen, produces liquid, gaseous, and solid fuel products. Biochar, the solid product, can also be used as a soil amendment and, simultaneously, enables us to sequester carbon in the soil. By controlling the pyrolysis process, it is possible to engineer biochar suitable for the remediation of specific soil management problems. This research uses a characterization method more suited to producing biochar for soil amendment purposes than the existing biochar fuel characterization standards. This is the first research to use wastewater irrigated willow as a pyrolysis feedstock. The extensive characterization of biochar produced over a range of temperatures (410 - 810 °C) yielded data on key properties relevant to soil under management: low surface area (1. 4 to 5. 4 m 2 /g), low bulk density (0. 15 - 0. 18 g/cm 3), high pH values (7. 8 - 9. 4) and high water-holding capacity (1. 8 to 4. 3 cm 3 /g). Extraction experiments demonstrated low bioavailability of <b>char</b> nutrients (<b>N,</b> P, K, Ca, and Mg).

40|$|Vegetation fires play a {{major role}} in global C cycling through the {{addition}} of inert carbon (char) to the environment. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast the chemical composition of 53 natural chars collected from the soil surface 6 – 32 years after a natural fire. In order to achieve this, we applied a recently developed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique that gauges the degree of condensation of aromatic structures within chars. Our results show that the degree of condensation varied considerably among <b>char</b> samples (<b>n</b> = 4 – 5), collected from burnt-out tree stumps at each of the 11 fire sites. This demonstrates that there is a great degree of variability in the composition of the char produced in natural fires, which is likely to be reflected in widely varying rates of char decomposition. This highlights a major difficulty in quantifying the effects of vegetation fires on global C cycling. Importantly, no differences could be discerned between chars of different ages, indicating that ageing of this type of char in this environment is slow on the decadal timescale. Finally, this study demonstrates that although char samples appear to preserve a record of fire conditions, great care must be taken when interpreting this record to account for the high degree of heterogeneity in char composition. Bulking of char samples would alleviate this problem to some extent; however, bulking would mask the inter-particle heterogeneity clearly evident in this study...|$|R

However, the reactivity of the two chars towards H 2 O, CO 2 and O 2 was almost the same.

Taken together, these results tend to confirm that CO 2 is impacting the biomass fast pyrolysis process.

40|$|Fluidized-bed {{combustion}} {{has been}} recognized as a clean coal combustion technology. However, it has been discovered that the nitrous oxide (N 2 O emission from fluidized-bed coal combustion {{is much higher than}} that from pulverized coal combustion. N 2 O emission from circulating fluidized-bed coal combustion is even higher. Heterogeneous reactions of char {{play an important role in}} N 2 O formation and reduction in circulating fluidized-bed coal combustion but there exist many unknowns. In this work the effects of heterogeneous reactions of <b>char</b> on <b>N</b> 2 O formation and reduction were examined in a bench-scale circulating fluidized bed. The experiments revealed that during circulating fluidized-bed coal combustion, N 2 O formation from oxidization of char-N has the same order as N 2 O formation from NO reduction by char, and neither of them is negligible (inlet O- 2 concentration: 21 %, temperature: 1135 - 1225 K). Absorption of oxygen on the surface of char is not an indispensable condition for N 2 O formation from NO reduction, i. e., NO can also be reduced into N 2 O on the surface of char in absence of O- 2. N 2 O formation from NO reduction in the presence of O- 2 contributes about 70 % and is the main path of N 2 O formation from NO reduction. N 2 O formation from NO reduction in the; absence of O- 2 contributes about 30 %, and the relative importance of these two mechanisms of N 2 O formation does not change significantly with NO concentration. Reduction of N 2 O by char is a first-order reaction with an Arrhenius dependence on temperature. The kinetics of N 2 O reduction by various chars were obtained (974 - 1223 K). Different chars have different effects on N 2 O reduction, suggesting that N 2 O reduction ability of char has a dependence on the property of the char itself. These results may partially account for the diversities in N 2 O emissions during combustion of different coals. On the basis of the results of this work, char-related reaction paths of N 2 O formation and reduction were proposed...|$|R
40|$|Summary of Chapter I: 1. We use Samuel's {{theory of}} {{multiplicity}} {{to describe the}} structure of (f) /T [cal Af {{in terms of the}} multiplicity e((f) /T cal Af) and the dimension of the instability locus (this dimension is also the Krull dimension of (f) /T cal Af). 2. We extend the theory of trivial unfoldings of map-germs to the theory of k-trivial unfoldings of k-jets. 3. We develop a method for obtaining normal forms for the (k+ 1) -jets having a given k-jet f by inspection of certain submodules of T cal Af. We give a test for sufficiency of a normal form and a method for constructing a (k+ 1) -trivial unfolding of the normal form. 4. We show that if f is weighted homogeneous and the Krull dimension and multiplicity of (f) /T cal Af are both 1 then f is a weak stem and we can find an integer k and a complete list of normal forms for finitely determined map-germs whose k-jet is f. The list has many similarities with the series found by Arnold and Mond. Summary of Chapter II: We extend Mond's classification of map-germs f:(cal C^ 2,O) (cal C^ 3 ?O) under cal A-equivalence. This chapter also demonstrates the use of the classification theory developed in I. 2 and provides a large number of examples for use {{in the rest of the}} thesis. Summary of Chapter III: 1. We prove that f is a geometric stem if and only if is irreducible and the localised module ((f) /T cal Af) has length char 61 1 (localise with respect to the prime ideal defining). 2. We also prove that if has transversal type A_ 2 n or A_ 2 n+ 1 for some <b>n</b> 1 then <b>char</b> 61 <b>n.</b> This makes it easier to determine n if has transversal type of A_ 2 n or A_ 2 n+ 1 since we shall calculate anyway. 3. If f is a stem we show that is irreducible and give a list of transversal types that may have (although having one of these transversal types does not necessarily indicate that f is a stem). 4. We look at how the numbers C, T and (D_ 2 (f) /cal Z_ 2) behave for the families of map-germs associated with some weak stems. We observe that for a given family (f+p_s) the integer C(f+p_s) +T(f+p_s) +(D 2 (f+ps) /cal Z 2) -cod(cal A,f+ps) appears to be a constant. Appendices A and B contain supplementary calculations.

40|$|The thermal {{reactivity}} and kinetics of four coal chars (HVN, UM, SAB and BA) in an {{oxy-fuel combustion}} atmosphere (30 %O 2 – 70 %CO 2) were studied using a thermobalance. The coal chars {{were obtained by}} devolatilization in an entrained flow reactor (EFR) at 1000 °C for 2. 5 s under 100 % N 2 and CO 2 atmospheres. The reactivity tests were carried out by isothermal thermogravimetric analysis at different temperatures in a kinetically controlled regime. Three nth-order representative gas–solid models – the volumetric model (VM), the grain model (GM) and the random pore model (RPM) – were employed in order to describe the reactive behaviour of the chars during oxy-fuel combustion. From these models, the kinetic parameters were determined. The RPM model {{was found to be}} the best for describing the reactivity of the HVN, UM and BA chars, while VM was the model that best described the reactivity of the SAB char. The reactivities of the <b>chars</b> obtained in <b>N</b> 2 and CO 2 in an oxy-fuel combustion atmosphere with 30 % of oxygen were compared using the kinetic parameters, but no differences were observed between the two devolatilization atmospheres. The apparent volatile yield after the coal devolatilization under CO 2 in the EFR was greater than under N 2 for all the coals studied. According to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the chars, those obtained in the CO 2 atmosphere experienced a greater degree of swelling, some particles showing partially reacted surfaces indicative of reaction between the char and CO 2.

In addition, the stable isotope ratios  15 N and  13 C have been analysed to reveal variations in trophic position and carbon source, both within and between fish species. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were far below the consumption limits in Norway, i. e. 0, 2 μg Cd/L; 1 μg Pb/L). Only 5, 6 % of the analyzed individuals had Pb-concentrations > the detection limit for Pb (0, 1 mg Pb/kg ww), while none of the individuals exceeded the detection limits for Cd (0, 005 mg Cd/kg ww). The Hg levels varied within and between the fish species. Totally 9 fish had Hg-concentrations above the consumption limit of 0, 5 μg Hg/L, 5 pikes, 2 Arctic char, 1 brown trout and 1 European smelt. The highest concentration, 1, 44 mg Hg/kg ww, was both measured in a brown trout and a northern pike. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values varied from 7, 2 ‰ to 13, 6 ‰ and - 20, 2 ‰ to - 33, 5 ‰ respectively. The results on δ 15 N indicate a food web consisting of 4 consumer levels. The δ 13 C signatures indicate that Arctic char, European smelt and sub-populations of whitefish primarily feed in the pelagic zone ( 13 C between - 28 and - 34), while the  13 C in perch, brown trout and the other sub-population of whitefish had heavier  13 C signatures, indicating fish feeding in the littoral zone of the lake. All fish species (except Atlantic salmon) exhibit significant correlations (p < 0, 05) between Hg and age, weight and length. Only adult individuals of Atlantic salmon, returned from the sea to River Skienselva for spawning, were incorporated in the study.

The high 15 N signature in the dwarf population of Arctic char is likely a consequence of low condition factor, as transamination and deamination normally occur during starvation. These processes imply isotope fractionation of nitrogen and consequently a heavier  15 N signature...|$|R
