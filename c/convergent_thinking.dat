25|$|<b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> is a {{fundamental}} tool in a child's education. Today, most educational opportunities are tied to one's performance on standardized tests that are often multiple choice in nature. When a student contemplates the possible answers available, they use <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> to weigh alternatives within a construct. This allows one to find a single best solution that is measurable.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{subjects}} in the high <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> group illustrated higher grade averages for the previous school year, less difficulty with homework and also indicated that their parents pressed them towards post-secondary education. These were the only significant relationships regarding the <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> measures. This suggests that these cognitive dimensions are independent of one another. Future investigations into this topic should focus more upon the developmental, cognitive and perpetual aspects of personality among divergent and convergent thinkers, rather than their attitude structures.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has argued forcefully and persuasively that to understand creative thinking {{it is necessary}} to investigate both <b>convergent</b> and divergent <b>thinking</b> processes. In the context of group decision making in emergency response, the link between these processes is particularly relevant, since stakes are high and, by definition, thinking must conclude with decision. This study investigates <b>convergent</b> and divergent <b>thinking</b> processes in the context of group decision making during the response to two simulated emergency events. The results suggest that level of event severity had little appreciable effect on these processes in one group’s response to two non-routine simulated emergencies...|$|R
25|$|<b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> {{is often}} used in {{conjunction}} with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many creative ideas are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> to decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative thinking {{at the beginning of the}} problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> is also {{linked to}} {{knowledge}} as it involves manipulating existing knowledge {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. <b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> is used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
25|$|For {{the remote}} {{associates}} tasks, the convergent thinkers correctly solved {{more of the}} five remote associates problems then did those using divergent thinking. This was demonstrated to be significantly different by a one-way ANOVA. In addition, when responding to insight problems, participants using <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> solved more insight problems than did the control group, however, {{there was no significant}} difference between subjects using convergent or divergent thinking.|$|E

30|$|The revised TGfU and the {{original}} version of TGfU seem to promote tactical intelligence and players’ levels of creativity using questioning strategies. Empirical research of game intelligence is being developed via <b>convergent</b> tactical <b>thinking</b> skills, and tactical creativity through divergent tactical thinking skills, especially {{during the early stages}} of youth sports development in team sports like soccer, basketball, hockey, and handball (Memmert et al. 2010; Wein 2004). With this notion in mind perhaps badminton playing countries in Asia, including for example Malaysia and Indonesia that favour the skill-led or the linear pedagogy, need to re examine their pedagogical methodology in order to avoid taking a backseat in future international rankings as no badminton players from Malaysia and Indonesia holds top five ranking in the world except Lee Chong Wei (Badminton World Federation 2016).|$|R

25|$|J. P. Guilford drew a {{distinction}} between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). <b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.|$|E
25|$|Creative ability was {{measured}} in a study using convergent tasks, which require a single correct answer, and divergent tasks, which requires producing many different answers of varying correctness. Two types of convergent tasks used were, the first being a remote associates tasks, which gave the subject three words and asked what word the previous three words are related to. The second type of <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> task were insight problems, which gave the subjects some contextual facts and then asked them a question requiring interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Convergent</b> <b>{{thinking}}</b> is {{the type}} of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem. [...] It is oriented toward deriving the single best, or most often correct answer to a question. <b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> emphasizes speed, accuracy, and logic and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapplying techniques, and accumulating stored information. [...] It is most effective in situations where an answer readily exists and simply needs to be either recalled or worked out through decision making strategies. [...] A critical aspect of <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> is that it leads to a single best answer, leaving no room for ambiguity. In this view, answers are either right or wrong. The solution that is derived {{at the end of the}} <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> process is the best possible answer the majority of the time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} {{standard}} intelligence tests {{were used to}} measure both the <b>convergent</b> and divergent <b>thinking</b> abilities of adolescents. Results indicate that subjects who classified as high on divergent thinking had significantly higher word fluency and reading scores than subjects who classified as low on divergent thinking. [...] Furthermore, those who were high in divergent thinking also demonstrated higher anxiety and penetration scores.

2500|$|The results {{demonstrate}} that {{carrying out a}} task requiring creative thinking does {{have an effect on}} one's mood. This provides considerable support for the idea that mood and cognition are not only related, but also that this relation is reciprocal. [...] Additionally, divergent and <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> impact mood in opposite ways. Divergent thinking led to a more positive mood, whereas <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> had the opposite effect, leading to a more negative mood.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> {{has been}} critiqued by {{researchers}} {{who claim that}} not all problems have solutions that can be effectively ranked. <b>Convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> assigns a position to one solution over another. The problem is that when one is dealing with more complex problems, the individual {{may not be able}} to appropriately rank the solutions available to them. [...] In these instances, researchers indicate that when dealing with complex problems, other variables such as one’s gut feeling or instinctive problem solving abilities also have a role in determining a solution to a given problem.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> {{has also}} been said to devalue {{minority}} arguments. [...] In a study where experimental manipulations were used to motivate subjects to engage in convergent or divergent thinking when presented with either majority or minority support for persuasive arguments, a pattern emerged under the <b>convergent</b> <b>thinking</b> condition where majority support produced more positive attitudes on the focal issue. Conversely, minority support for the argument {{had no effect on}} the subjects. The convergent thinkers are too focused with selecting the best answer that they fail to appropriately evaluate minority opinion and could end up dismissing accurate solutions.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOrganizations crucially {{need the}} {{creative}} talent of millennials but {{are reluctant to}} hire them because of their supposed lack of diligence. Recent {{studies have shown that}} hiring diligent millennials requires selecting those who score high on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and thus rely on effortful thinking rather than intuition. A central question is to assess whether the push for recruiting diligent millennials using criteria such as cognitive reflection can ultimately hamper the recruitment of creative workers. To answer this question, we study the relationship between millennials' creativity and their performance on fluid intelligence (Raven) and cognitive reflection (CRT) tests. The good news for recruiters is that we report, in line with previous research, evidence of a positive relationship of fluid intelligence, {{and to a lesser extent}} cognitive reflection, with <b>convergent</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> In addition, we observe a positive effect of fluid intelligence on originality and elaboration measures of divergent creative thinking. The bad news for recruiters is the inverted U-shape relationship between cognitive reflection and fluency and flexibility measures of divergent creative thinking. This suggests that thinking too much may hinder important dimensions of creative thinking. Diligent and creative workers may thus be a rare find...|$|R
