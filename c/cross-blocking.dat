50|$|The new gates allow a {{more direct}} path down a slalom course {{through the process of}} <b>cross-blocking</b> or shinning the gates. <b>Cross-blocking</b> is a {{technique}} in which the legs go around the gate with the upper body inclined toward, or even across, the gate; in this case the racer's outside pole and shinguards hit the gate, knocking it down and out of the way. <b>Cross-blocking</b> is done by pushing the gate down with the arms, hands, or shins.|$|E
50|$|Because the offsets are {{relatively}} small in slalom, ski racers take a fairly direct line and often knock the poles {{out of the way}} as they pass, which is known as blocking. (The main blocking technique in modern slalom is <b>cross-blocking,</b> in which the skier takes such a tight line and angulates so strongly that he or she is able to block the gate with the outside hand.) In modern slalom, a variety of protective equipment is used such as shin pads, hand guards, helmets and face guards.|$|E

Mechanical <b>cross-blocking</b> thinners were used starting in 1941, precision seed planting equipment was used starting in 1944, and more efficient mechanized harvesters were used starting in 1943, based on a [...] "variable-cut topping mechanism" [...] developed by J. B. Powers at the California Experiment Station of University of California, Davis, which was shared with manufacturers in a public domain manner. In 1946, 12% of the crop was harvested mechanically; by 1950, approximately 66% was mechanically harvested. This mechanization helped U-I stay productive compared to imported sugar.

[...] On defense, the Dolphins' goal was to neutralize Chuck Foreman by using cat-quick Manny Fernandez at nose tackle and to make passing difficult for Tarkenton by knocking down his receivers and double-teaming John Gilliam.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 32 - 34) Currently {{there are}} no successful bioinformatics methods to predict antibody:antigen binding sites. This is at least partially {{due to the fact}} that there is a limited amount of large scale mapping of antibody binding sites available. Antibody <b>cross-blocking</b> is a method in which two antibodies compete against each other for binding to the same antigen, which has been used for decades to identify antibodies binding to the same region and thereby provides a mapping of antibody binding sites at low resolution. With high-throughput antibody production becoming mainstream it becomes possible to scale up <b>cross-blocking</b> experiments and enumerate all binding sites for an antigen. The analysis of antibody <b>cross-blocking</b> has typically been done manually leading to inconsistencies in defining binding sites. To apply <b>cross-blocking</b> analysis to larger datasets, a robust computational approach is needed to standardize the analysis. Here we show a method incorporating non-negative matrix factorization, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering to analyze <b>cross-blocking</b> data and extract both (1) antibody groups that show identical binding patterns and (2) the number of distinct antigenic sites occupied by the antibodies. We apply our approach to previously published experimental data, and compare our identified number of binding sites and antibody groups to the published analyses that often do not make this distinction...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-A set of sera and Ruorescein-conjugated {{immunoglobulins}} {{derived from}} them were compared for anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and EBV-associated membrane-antigen reactivity by <b>cross-blocking</b> tests in direct immunoRuorescence on Axed and viable cells, respectively. Whereas several sera showed complete cross reactivity by blocking, {{a number of}} asymmetries were found in both the membrane and anti-EBV tests, with blocking obtained in only one direction, not reciprocally. Since no ex-perimental supportwas obtained to indicate that this was caused by quanti-tative or avidity differences, {{it was assumed that}} both the intracellular and the membrane-antigen systems consist of more than one antigenic component. Thus some EBV-positive sera would contain antibodies against a larger number of components than others. For some serum combinations, the <b>cross-blocking</b> patterns obtained in the anti-EBV test correlated well with the corresponding blocking patterns in the membrane test, whereas other serum combinations gave discordant results in the two tests.

40|$|Attachment of an {{adenovirus}} (Ad) to a cell {{is mediated}} by the capsid fiber protein. To date, only the cellular fiber receptor for subgroup C serotypes 2 and 5, the so-called coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) protein, has been identified and cloned. Previous data suggested that the fiber of the subgroup D serotype Ad 9 also recognizes CAR, since Ad 9 and Ad 2 fiber knobs <b>cross-blocked</b> each other’s cellular binding. Recombinant fiber knobs and 3 H-labeled Ad virions from serotypes representing all six subgroups (A to F) {{were used to determine}} whether the knobs <b>cross-blocked</b> the binding of virions from different subgroups. With the exception of subgroup B, all subgroup representatives cross-competed, suggesting that they use CAR as a cellular fiber receptor as well. This result was confirmed by showing that CAR, produced in a soluble recombinant form (sCAR), bound to nitrocellulose-immobilized virions from the different subgroups except subgroup B. Similar results were found for blotted fiber knob proteins. The subgroup F virus Ad 41 has both short and long fibers, but only the long fiber bound sCAR. The sCAR protein blocked the attachment of all virus serotypes that bound CAR. Moreover, CHO cells expressing human CAR, in contrast to untransformed CHO cells, all specifically bound the sCAR-binding serotypes. We conclude therefore that Ad serotypes from subgroups A, C, D, E, and F all use CAR as a cellular fiber receptor...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAntibody epitope mapping {{is crucial}} for {{understanding}} B cell-mediated immunity and required for characterizing therapeutic antibodies. In contrast to T cell epitope mapping, no computational tools are in widespread use for prediction of B cell epitopes. Here, we show that, utilizing the sequence of an antibody, {{it is possible to}} identify discontinuous epitopes on its cognate antigen. The predictions are based on residue-pairing preferences and other interface characteristics. We combined these antibody-specific predictions with results of <b>cross-blocking</b> experiments that identify groups of antibodies with overlapping epitopes to improve the predictions. We validate the high performance of this approach by mapping the epitopes of a set of antibodies against the previously uncharacterized D 8 antigen, using complementary techniques to reduce method-specific biases (X-ray crystallography, peptide ELISA, deuterium exchange, and site-directed mutagenesis). These results suggest that antibody-specific computational predictions and simple <b>cross-blocking</b> experiments allow for accurate prediction of residues in conformational B cell epitopes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of deep neural architectures, recent studies have {{demonstrated}} the benefits of grouping subnetworks into a larger network. For examples, the Inception architecture integrates multi-scale subnetworks and the residual network can be regarded that a residual unit combines a residual subnetwork with an identity shortcut. In this work, we embrace this observation and propose the Competitive Pathway Network (CoPaNet). The CoPaNet comprises a stack of competitive pathway units and each unit contains multiple parallel residual-type subnetworks followed by a max operation for feature competition. This mechanism enhances the model capability by learning a variety of features in subnetworks. The proposed strategy explicitly shows that the features propagate through pathways in various routing patterns, which {{is referred to as}} pathway encoding of category information. Moreover, the <b>cross-block</b> shortcut can be added to the CoPaNet to encourage feature reuse.

40|$|Antibodies to CD 44 {{have been}} used to inhibit a variety of {{processes}} which include lymphohemopoiesis, lymphocyte migration, and tumor metastasis. Some, but not all, CD 44 -mediated functions derive from its ability to serve as a receptor for hyaluronan (HA). However, sites on CD 44 that interact with either ligands or antibodies are poorly understood. Interspecies rat/mouse CD 44 chimeras were used to analyze the specificity of 25 mAbs and to determine that they recognize at least seven epitopes. Amino acid substitutions that resulted in loss of antibody recognition were all located in the region of homology to other cartilage link family proteins. While at least five epitopes were eliminated by single amino acid replacements, multiple residues had to be changed to destroy binding by other antibodies. One antibody was sensitive to changes in any of three separate parts of the molecule and some antibodies to distinct epitopes <b>cross-blocked</b> each other. Certain antibodies had the ability to increase HA binding by lymphocytes but this did not correlate absolutely with antibody specificity and was only partially attributable to CD 44 cross-linking. Antibodies that consistently blocked HA recognition were all sensitive to amino acid changes within a short stretch of CD 44. Such blocking antibodies interacted with CD 44 more strongly than ligand in competition experiments. One large group of antibodies blocked ligand binding, but only with a particular cell line. This detailed analysis adds to our understanding of functional domains within CD 44 and requirements for antibodies to influence recognition of one ligand...|$|R

We attempted to condition preferences for a low-quality forage through nutrient loading. Sheep were fed licorice or orange-flavored straw pellets then were gavaged with glucose or propionate (. 381 Mcal, which amounted to approximately 13 % of the daily maintenance energy requirement) or water. Four groups of ewes (n = 4) were arranged in a <b>cross-blocked</b> design such that each group received a unique energy/flavor combination: 1) propionate+licorice, 2) propionate+orange, 3) glucose+licorice, or 4) glucose+orange. On alternate days, each group received the other flavor plus water to create an internal control. At the end of 8 d of conditioning, preference for the two flavors was measured by two-choice preference tests. A second trial was conducted for 4 d in which the energy level was doubled to. 762 Mcal. Low energy levels of either glucose or propionate did not create significant preferences. Propionate at the low-level caused satiety but at the high level conditioned an aversion to both flavors. This high level of propionate apparently caused malaise that was then associated with {{the taste of the}} flavors. The high level of glucose conditioned a preference. The high glucose treatment increased rumen microbial mass, the nutrients of which would have been absorbed in the lower gastrointestinal tract, and may have indirectly provided the positive nutrient feedback required to form a preference.

40|$|The only {{reported}} mimotope able {{to target}} CD 20 antigen {{in the context}} of an active immunotherapy is a 40 -mer polypeptide, corresponding to the exposed domain of the molecule (from amino acid 142 to 182). Due to its length, however, it fails to efficiently induce a CD 20 -specific response. Therefore, we have bio-panned a 12 -mer phage display peptide library with the anti-CD 20 mAb Rituximab and isolated 14 phage clones specifically reacting with Rituximab in ELISA and Western blot. Peptides expressed by 3 positive clones, were synthesized and purified (> than 70 %) for immunological assay. Peptides R-p 1 L, R-p 5 L and R-p 10 L (R-p) bound Rituximab. Their binding was dose-dependent and specific, since they did not react with the isotype-matched mAb Infliximab. R-p 1 L, R-p 5 L and R-p 10 L recognize the same idiotope on Rituximab, since they <b>cross-block</b> to each other in their binding to the mAb. It is likely that the idiotope recognized by these peptides on Rituximab is within its antigen-combining site, since all of them, though to a different extent, specifically and dose-dependently inhibited the binding of the mAb to CD 20 + human lymphoid Raji cells. Of interest, the motif amino acids resulting from the alignment of the peptide sequences had no homology with any portion of the exposed CD 20 domain. Because CD 20 is considered a target for passive immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases, these peptides may be useful reagents to induce an anti-CD 20 response and eventually be utilized in the active immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases...|$|R

However, these antibody specificities are rare, are not induced by Env immunization or HIV- 1 infection, and are polyspecific and also react with lipids such as cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine. To probe MPER anti-gp 41 antibodies that are produced in HIV- 1 infection, we have made two novel murine MAbs, 5 A 9 and 13 H 11, against HIV- 1 gp 41 envelope that partially <b>cross-blocked</b> 2 F 5 MAb binding to Env but did not neutralize HIV- 1 primary isolates or bind host lipids. Competitive inhibition assays using labeled 13 H 11 MAb and HIV- 1 -positive patient plasma samples demonstrated that cluster II 13 H 11 -blocking plasma antibodies were made in 83 % of chronically HIV- 1 infected patients and were acquired between 5 to 10 weeks after acute HIV- 1 infection. Both the mouse 13 H 11 MAb and the three prototypic cluster II human MAbs (98 - 6, 126 - 6, and 167 -D) blocked 2 F 5 binding to gp 41 epitopes to variable degrees; the combination of 98 - 6 and 13 H 11 completely blocked 2 F 5 binding.

The antibody UCHL 1 reacts with a 180 -kDa determinant of the leukocyte common Ag and exhibits a reciprocal T subset distribution pattern to the CD 45 R group. Peripheral blood T cells were 40 % positive for UCHL 1 and 58 to 65 % {{positive for the}} CD 45 R antibodies; less than 1 % of cells stained for both. On activation of CD 45 R+,UCHL 1 - T cells by PHA, up to 40 % of cells became positive for both CD 45 R and UCHL 1 by day 3. By day 7, CD 45 R+,UCHL 1 - cells fell from 90 to less than 21 % whereas UCHL 1 +,CD 45 R- cells rose from 2 to 93 %. Conversely, PHA-stimulated UCHL 1 +,CD 45 R- cells remained UCHL 1 +,CD 45 R- during the 7 days in culture showing that phenotypic change was unidirectional from CD 45 R+ to UCHL 1 +. In primary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions, activated CD 45 R+ T cells also showed a change to UCHL 1 +. When these cells were rechallenged by the original alloantigen, the UCHL 1 + cells showed 7 - to 20 -fold greater proliferation than the CD 45 R+ cells on day 3 after rechallenge.

40|$|Here, we {{demonstrate}} how array-based label-free biosensors {{can be applied}} to the multiplexed interaction analysis of large panels of analyte/ligand pairs, such as the epitope binning of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this application, the larger the number of mAbs that are analyzed for <b>cross-blocking</b> in a pairwise and combinatorial manner against their specific antigen, the higher the probability of discriminating their epitopes. Since <b>cross-blocking</b> of two mAbs is necessary but not sufficient for them to bind an identical epitope, high-resolution epitope binning analysis determined by high-throughput experiments can enable the identification of mAbs with similar but unique epitopes. We demonstrate that a mAb's epitope and functional activity are correlated, thereby strengthening the relevance of epitope binning data to the discovery of therapeutic mAbs. We evaluated two state-of-the-art label-free biosensors that enable the parallel analysis of 96 unique analyte/ligand interactions and nearly ten thousand total interactions per unattended run. The IBIS-MX 96 is a microarray-based surface plasmon resonance imager (SPRi) integrated with continuous flow microspotting technology whereas the Octet-HTX is equipped with disposable fiber optic sensors that use biolayer interferometry (BLI) detection. We compared their throughput, versatility, ease of sample preparation, and sample consumption in the context of epitope binning assays. We conclude that the main advantages of the SPRi technology are its exceptionally low sample consumption, facile sample preparation, and unparalleled unattended throughput. In contrast, the BLI technology is highly flexible because it allows for the simultaneous interaction analysis of 96 independent analyte/ligand pairs, ad hoc sensor replacement and on-line reloading of an analyte- or ligand-array.

40|$|CD 32 A, {{the major}} {{phagocytic}} Fc?R in humans, exhibits a polymorphism in the ligand binding domain. Individuals homozygous for the R allelic form of CD 32 A (CD 32 AR allele) {{are more susceptible}} to bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases as compared with H allelic CD 32 A (CD 32 AH) homozygous and CD 32 AR/H heterozygous individuals. To understand the mechanisms behind this differential susceptibility, we have investigated the dynamics of the interaction of these allelic forms of CD 32 A when they are simultaneously exposed to immune complexes (IC). Binding studies using Ig fusion proteins of CD 32 A alleles showed that the R allele has significantly lower binding not only to human IgG 2, but also to IgG 1 and IgG 3 subtypes. Competition assays using purified molecules demonstrated that CD 32 AH-Ig outcompetes CD 32 AR-Ig for IC binding when both alleles simultaneously compete for the same ligand. CD 32 AH-Ig blocked the IC binding mediated by both the allelic forms of cell surface CD 32 A, whereas CD 32 AR-Ig blocked only CD 32 AR and was unable to <b>cross-block</b> IC binding mediated by CD 32 AH. Two-dimensional affinity measurements also demonstrated that CD 32 AR has significantly lower affinity toward all three subtypes as compared with CD 32 AH. Our data suggest that the lower binding of CD 32 AR not only to IgG 2 but also to IgG 1 and IgG 3 might be responsible for the lack of clearance of IC leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases. Our data further suggests that in humans, inflammatory cells from CD 32 AR/H heterozygous individuals may predominantly use the H allele to mediate Ab-coated target cell binding during phagocytosis and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, resulting in a phenotype similar to CD 32 AH homozygous individuals...|$|R
40|$|Two {{neutralizing}} human mAbs, 2 F 5 and 4 E 10, that {{react with}} the HIV- 1 envelope gp 41 membrane proximal region are also polyspecific autoantibodies that bind to anionic phospholipids. To determine the autoantibody {{nature of these}} Abs, we have compared their reactivities with human anti-cardiolipin mAbs derived from a primary antiphospholipid syndrome patient. To define the role of lipid polyreactivity in binding of 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 mAbs to HIV- 1 envelope membrane proximal epitopes, we determined the kinetics of binding of mAbs 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 to their nominal gp 41 epitopes vs liposome-gp 41 peptide conjugates. Both anti-HIV- 1 mAbs 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 bound to cardiolipin with K d values {{similar to those of}} autoimmune anti-cardiolipin Abs, IS 4 and IS 6. Binding kinetics studies revealed that mAb 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 binding to their respective gp 41 peptide-lipid conjugates could best be defined by a two-step (encounter-docking) conformational change model. In contrast, binding of 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 mAbs to linear peptide epitopes followed a simple Langmuir model. A mouse mAb, 13 H 11, that <b>cross-blocks</b> mAb 2 F 5 binding to the gp 41 epitope did not cross-react with lipids nor did it neutralize HIV- 1 viruses. Taken together, these data demonstrate the similarity of 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 mAbs to known anti-cardiolipin Abs and support the model that mAb 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 binding to HIV- 1 involves both viral lipid membrane and gp 41 membrane proximal epitopes.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{macrophage}} colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on rat alveolar macrophage (AM) differentiation in vitro were investigated in this study. Both M-CSF and GM-CSF triggered AM differentiation and {{multinucleated giant cell}} (MGC) formation. Morphological analysis further demonstrated {{that there were two}} distinct variants of MGC. Type 1 MGC normally contained 3 to 8 nuclei and appeared as a large round cell and type 2 MGC contained a higher number of nuclei (up to 30) and displayed irregular, elongated shapes. We also observed that a greater proportion of type 2 MGC expressed β 3 integrin, thus bringing additional evidence for differences between type 1 and type 2 MGC. Assessment of the relative proportion of type 1 and type 2 MGC indicated that M-CSF induced the formation of both types of MGC to a similar extent and GM-CSF induced predominantly the formation of type 2 MGC. Experiments with anti-M-CSF or anti-GM-CSF antibody to neutralize and <b>cross-block</b> the effects of M-CSF and GM-CSF further confirmed that M-CSF is associated with type 1 MGC formation whereas GM-CSF is responsible for type 2 MGC formation. Type 2 MGC seen in M-CSF treated groups may result from endogenous production of GM-CSF induced by M-CSF. This is supported by RT-PCR experiments in which M-CSF was shown to stimulate GM-CSF mRNA expression. Molecular phenotyping of a set of cytokines known to participate in inflammation and AM regulation was performed using RT-PCR at various times (up to 5 days) of AM differentiation. AM freshly obtained by BAL (0 time) did not show mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL- 1 α and IL- 6, indicating these proinflammatory cytokines are not constitutively expressed by rat AM. Compared to the controls, both M-CSF and GM-CSF increased mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL- 1 α, suggesting these 2 cytokines are involved in M-CSF or GM-CSF induced AM differentiation. A significant increase of IL- 6 mRNA expression was observed only in GM-CSF treated groups and the expression appeared early and persistently at all time points studied. Experiments with exogenous IL- 6 and antibody to IL- 6 receptor further indicated that IL- 6 is involved in type 2 MGC formation. TGF-β mRNA was constitutively expressed by rat AM and further enhanced by M-CSF and GM-CSF. Results from exogenous TGF-β suggested that this cytokine favors formation of type 1 MGC over type 2 MGC. Cytoplasmic expression of TNF-α, PDGF and TGF-β was investigated using immunocytochemical procedures. MGC were found to be able to express these cytokines, suggesting that MGC are a functional population rather than merely dead-end cells. Interestingly, type 1 MGC always showed higher levels of these cytokines than type 2 MGC, suggesting that type 1 MGC may be functionally more active than type 2 MGC...|$|R
40|$|A mouse {{monoclonal}} (Mab. 198, IgG 1) {{was generated}} that recognizes an epitope expressed on rabbit peripheral phagocytes and tissue macrophages. The membrane antigen recognized by Mab. 198 {{consisted of two}} polypeptide chains of 165, 000 and 95, 000 molecular weight (MW). This Mab efficiently inhibited complement receptor-mediated granulocyte functions such as phagocytosis of complement-opsonized particulate antigens and zymosan-induced chemiluminescent responses. Fc receptor-mediated phagocyte functions were, on the contrary, barely affected by Mab. 198. The cellular distribution, molecular structure and functional characteristics of the membrane antigen defined by Mab. 198 suggested that this antibody recognizes the complement type 3 receptor (CR 3). We found that Mab. M 1 / 70, specific for mouse CR 3 (i. e. CD 11 or Mac- 1 antigen), also binds on rabbit phagocytes. However, this Mab recognizes a different CR 3 epitope than Mab. 198 as shown by <b>cross-blocking</b> experiments. This anti-rabbit CR 3 Mab will be useful in the characterization of rabbit complement receptors and their involvement in immune reactions...|$|E
40|$|Two novel class I-like {{molecules}} expressed on tumor 1591, a C 3 H UV-induced fibrosarcoma, are biochemically characterized using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a <b>cross-blocking</b> RIA, and tryptic peptide mapping. One novel molecule that {{reacts with}} CP 28, a syngeneic tumor-specific monoclonal antibody, appears mosaic because it possesses characteristics of both Kk and Dk class I molecules. The second molecule {{is closely related}} but not identical to the bona fide Ld molecule expressed on BALB/c spleen. Thus 1591 expresses at least two novel class I molecules and is vigorously rejected by normal C 3 H mice, while a variant tumor derived from 1591, termed AS 7, does not express these two class I molecules although it still expresses Kk and Dk. The significance of these observations to the immunobiology and genetics of the UV-induced fibrosarcoma system is discussed. Speculations on {{the role that the}} major histocompatibility complex may play in the immunosurveillance of neoplasms are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{monoclonal}} antibody 3 F 8 {{has been described}} as binding to the ganglioside GD 2. This antibody, of the IgG 3 isotype, has been used in immunotherapy, radioimmunolocalisation and targeted radiation therapy. 3 F 8 was originally observed to have a binding profile similar to two monoclonal antibodies, UJ 13 A and 5. 1. H 11, characterised as binding to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This observation has also been confirmed using a hetero-antiserum prepared against purified NCAM. The cross-reactivity of 3 F 8 with NCAM has been confirmed by <b>cross-blocking</b> studies with an anti-NCAM antiserum, and by direct immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. In addition, we show that 3 F 8 binds to human NCAM from 3 T 3 fibroblasts transfected with NCAM cDNA constructs. It is possible that the common epitope shared by GD 2 ganglioside and NCAM involves sialic acid residues common to both the ganglioside and the glycoprotein...|$|E
40|$|Receptors for {{immunoglobulins}} {{on animal}} cells invariably show specificity for Fc {{regions of the}} protein and are hence called Fc receptors. The present study shows that immunoglobulin D receptors present an exception to this rule. Binding of IgD-coated erythrocytes to murine IgD-receptor-bearing T-helper cells is competitively inhibited by IgD, by its Fab delta fragments, and by deletion mutants of IgD lacking (i) the first constant domain of the delta heavy chain (KWD 1), (ii) that region plus the delta heavy-chain-hinge region (KWD 6), or (iii) the third constant domain of the delta heavy chain (Gen. 24). KWD 1, Gen. 24, or KWD 6 mutants bind to T-helper cells bearing receptors for IgD independently of each other. Furthermore, Gen. 24 and KWD 6 mutants also competitively inhibit binding {{of each other in}} <b>cross-blocking</b> experiments. These results show that the IgD receptors binds to the Fd delta and the Fc delta and cannot readily be explained by sequence homology between the two parts of the IgD molecule...|$|E
40|$|We {{produced}} three murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) {{directed against}} the human T-cell differentiation antigen CD 2 (formerly T 11) and analysed their epitope specificity by E-rosette inhibition, <b>cross-blocking</b> and proliferation-induction experiments. When added together, two mAb (both IgG 1 kappa) were able to induce proliferation in peripheral blood T cells. This proliferation {{was found to be}} strictly dependent on the presence of monocytes. The polymorphism of Fc receptors (FcR) expressed on human monocytes for murine IgG 1 antibodies, which is readily demonstrable in anti-CD 3 -induced T-cell activation, was not found in the anti-CD 2 -driven system. Moreover, mAb {{directed against the}} 40, 000 MW FcRII were unable to inhibit proliferation induced by the mitogenic anti-CD 2 combination. Still, F(ab') 2 fragments of the mitogenic anti-CD 2 antibody combination could not initiate T-cell mitogenesis, despite their ability to induce a rise in the free intracellular [Ca 2 +]. The contributions of monocytes and of antibody Fc moieties to T-cell proliferation, induced by combinations of anti-CD 2 mAb, will be discusse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{challenging}} {{application of}} artificial intelligence systems involves the scheduling of traffic signals in multi-intersection vehicular networks. This paper introduces a novel {{use of a}} multi-agent system and reinforcement learning (RL) framework to obtain an efficient traffic signal control policy. The latter is aimed at minimising the average delay, congestion and likelihood of intersection <b>cross-blocking.</b> A five-intersection traffic network has been studied in which each intersection is governed by an autonomous intelligent agent. Two types of agents, a central agent and an outbound agent, were employed. The outbound agents schedule traffic signals by following the longest-queue-first (LQF) algorithm, which has been proved to guarantee stability and fairness, and collaborate with the central agent by providing it local traffic statistics. The central agent learns a value function driven by its local and neighbours ’ traffic conditions. The novel methodology proposed here utilises the Q-Learning algorithm with a feedforward neural network for value function approximation. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of multi-agent RL-based control over LQF governed isolated single-intersection control, thus {{paving the way for}} efficient distributed traffic signal control in complex settings. ...|$|E
