40|$|This paper {{presents}} stylized {{facts about}} the effect of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> household disposable income and its components (the 'income package') in nine OECD countries, employing data from the Luxembourg Income Study database. We find that cross-national differences in the impact of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> household disposable income are substantial and systematic. Speaking generally, we find that cross-national differences in the impact of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> disposable income are determined largely by the differences in the impact of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> household earnings, particularly women's earnings. We also find that countries with a generous fiscal treatment of households with children are also countries in which the effect of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> earnings is most negative...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{research}} indicates that typically developing children pass through predictable stages of fear development throughout their childhood. Evidence suggests that in general, children with disabilities experience more fears than typically developing children. Children with disabilities share similar stages of fear development compared to typically developing children, but at a delayed rate, with a more protracted course. <b>Children</b> <b>on</b> the autism spectrum experience higher levels of anxiety, compared to other children. Limited fear research in <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the autism spectrum suggests that they exhibit a unique fear profile compared to their peers, however, {{little is known about}} why this may be. Chapter 1 reviews published literature on fear development for typically developing children, children with physical and intellectual disabilities, and <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the autism spectrum. Chapter 2 presents an empirical study that investigates the relationship between sensory processing and fear profiles in <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the autism spectrum. The results support the notion that sensory experiences may account for a proportion of the unique fear pattern experienced by <b>children</b> <b>on</b> the autism spectrum.

Introduction. What happens to a household’s disposable income when a first child, or an additional child, is added? The most obvious impact is on the earnings of parents. An initial parental leave may or may not affect earnings, depending on the worker’s benefit package and the length of the leave. After that, some parents may substitute childcare for earnings b...|$|R

In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate.

At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ <b>Child</b> <b>on</b> her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E

The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as EastEnders: The Inside Story, and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, Swings and Roundabouts, which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.|$|E
