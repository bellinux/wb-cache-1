By 1990, Norma Kamali had incorporated underwire bras into both one- and two-piece (bikini) swimsuits. Scott Lucretia was granted a patent for a <b>camisole</b> with an integrated underwire bra in 1989.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company {{split the}} union suit into upper and lower sections, {{effectively}} inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the <b>camisole</b> and tap pants.|$|E
25|$|In the past, a woman's corset {{was usually}} worn over a chemise, a {{sleeveless}} low-necked gown made of washable material (usually cotton or linen). It absorbed perspiration {{and kept the}} corset and the gown clean. In modern times, a tee shirt, <b>camisole</b> or corset liner may be worn.|$|E
25|$|By the Edwardian era, {{with some}} {{increase}} in women's physical activities, the corset started to retreat southward again, becoming {{more like a}} girdle and accompanied {{by the appearance of}} a separate upper garment, the Bust Bodice, or BB. For those who instead wore a one-piece undershift (unionsuit), this separated into the <b>camisole</b> and drawers. These were not designed for support but merely coverage.|$|E
5000|$|A bra (...) or {{brassiere}} (...) is a form-fitting undergarment {{designed to}} support a woman's breasts. Swimsuits, <b>camisoles</b> and backless dresses may be made with built-in support.|$|R

In front of the bar, a man is smoking a cigarette. The melody of Aguilera's song [...] "I Got Trouble", is played in the background, as if over a radio with {{transmission}} noise. Aguilera steps out of the car in high heels, wearing a classic outfit with a hat. After the car door is closed, the song begins. In the club, Aguilera starts dancing with her male and female dancers while singing the song. On the first chorus, Aguilera is in a dressing room, wearing a <b>camisole</b> and fur-trimmed silk dressing-gown, making up {{with the help of her}} dancers, and receiving flowers from a stranger.|$|E

In just one major fashion show in 1985, there [...] were two-piece suits with cropped tank tops instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that are bikinis in front and one-piece behind, suspender straps, ruffles, and daring, navel-baring cutouts. To meet the fast changing tastes, some of the manufacturers have made a business out of making made-to-order bikinis in around seven minutes. The world's most expensive bikini, made up of over [...] of flawless diamonds and worth a massive £20 million, was designed in February 2006 by Susan Rosen.|$|E

500|$|Just as Lee explores Jem's {{development}} {{in coming to}} grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. [...] Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. [...] Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. [...] Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. [...] The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. [...] For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and <b>camisole,</b> and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. [...] By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, [...] "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child." ...|$|E

25|$|In cold climates, {{underwear}} may {{constitute an}} additional layer of clothing helping {{to keep the}} wearer warm. Underwear may {{also be used to}} preserve the wearer's modesty – for instance, some women wear <b>camisoles</b> and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are sheer. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as edible underwear, crotchless panties and thongs.|$|R
2500|$|A usual type of {{undergarment}} {{was called}} combinations, a <b>camisole</b> with attached knee- or calf-length drawers, worn under the corset, bustle, and petticoat. [...] Woolen combinations were recommended for health, especially when engaging in fashionable sports.|$|E

She was nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored blouses which exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned <b>camisoles.</b>|$|R

6000|$|You {{will think}} I have {{depicted}} a remarkable slattern, reader. Not at all. Hortense Moore (she was Mr. Moore's sister) {{was a very}} orderly, economical person. The petticoat, <b>camisole,</b> and curl-papers were her morning costume, in which, of forenoons, {{she had always been}} accustomed to [...] "go her household ways" [...] in her own country.

5000|$|Regular bras are not {{recommended}} for nursing mothers because they may not offer adequate support or may {{put pressure on the}} breasts. It is also more difficult to lift a regular brassiere over the breast when preparing to breastfeed, putting undue pressure on breast tissue, which could increase the risk of clogged milk ducts and infection. Some women are more comfortable wearing <b>camisoles,</b> sleeveless T-shirts, or tank tops over a shelf bra, [...] which leaves the nipple exposed.|$|R

The show featured a designer range of Confitex underwear “the Hi-Life Collection” which included bras, <b>camisoles,</b> and G-strings designed for light incontinence.
