5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E
25|$|A sales assistant's role {{typically}} includes greeting customers, providing {{product and}} service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service {{necessary to ensure}} customer satisfaction. For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and <b>credit</b> <b>transactions,</b> handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships {{with the potential to}} turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing reputation and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons. Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. Customer service training entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as Customer relationship management.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the FACT Act (Fair and Accurate <b>Credit</b> <b>Transactions</b> Act), each legal U.S. {{resident}} is entitled to a free copy of his or her credit report from each credit reporting agency once every twelve months.

The three credit bureaus run Annualcreditreport.com, where users can get their free credit reports. Non-FICO credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee.

2500|$|On {{a federal}} level, Congress has never {{attempted}} to federally regulate {{interest rates on}} purely private transactions, but {{on the basis of}} past U.S. Supreme Court decisions, arguably the U.S. Congress might have the power to do so under the interstate commerce clause of Article I of the Constitution. Congress opted to put a federal criminal limit on interest rates by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Statute) definitions of [...] "unlawful debt", which make it a federal felony to lend money at an interest rate more than twice the local state usury rate and then try to collect that [...] "unlawful debt". It is a federal offense to use violence or threats to collect usurious interest (or any other sort) (Extortionate <b>Credit</b> <b>Transactions</b> statute, chapter 42, title 18, U.S. Code). Such activity is referred to as loan sharking, but that term is also applied to non-coercive usurious lending or even to the practice of making consumer loans without a license in jurisdictions that require licenses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, Kalaw Katigbak ran for Senate {{under the}} Liberal Party ticket. She {{landed on the}} 7th spot garnering 2,546,147 votes. She then became the second female senator of the Philippines, after Geronima Pecson in 1947, and the lone woman in the Fifth Congress. As a senator, Kalaw Katigbak championed the Senate Bill No. 652 {{restoring}} the old school calendar to June and excluding the hot summer months which promote sleepiness and thus, may not be conducive for learning, which was changed earlier by Education Secretary Alejandro Roces. She was {{also the author of}} the Senate Bill No. 84, now known as Republic Act No. 3765 or the [...] "Truth in Lending Act of 1963", which extends protection to consumer buying goods on an installment plan and enabling <b>credit</b> <b>transactions.</b> She also authored the Senate Bill No. 30 which aimed to amend Republic Act No. 621, or [...] "An Act Creating the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization National Commission of the Philippines".

50|$|Leases of movable goods—that is, not land or housing—would include, for example, a telefax {{machine or}} a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, {{together}} with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, {{it will not}} be a <b>credit</b> <b>transaction</b> in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a <b>credit</b> <b>transaction</b> in terms of the Act.|$|R
2500|$|The {{system of}} land tenureship in India {{as a whole}} and Bengal in {{particular}} was very complex, and the <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> between landholders and tenants were equally complicated. Very broadly speaking, land rights and the resulting power and welfare gains within Bengal were divided very unequally among three diverse economic and social groups; moreover, this division of power evolved over time and expressed itself differently within the different geographic regions of the province. The three economic groups were: traditional absentee large landowners or zamindars, the upper-tier [...] "wealthy peasant" [...] jotedars; and at the lower socioeconomic levels, the ryot (peasant) smallholders and dwarfholders, bargadars (sharecroppers), and agricultural labourers. Zamindar and jotedar landowners were protected by legal and customary status and rights. At the bottom were the ones actually cultivating the soil, with small or no landholdings. These had very nearly no rights, and the few they had were vague, contradictory and commonly ignored. Typically this problem was compounded by a lack of written records. They laboured within a power structure decisively stacked against them and suffered persistent and increasing losses of land rights and welfare over time.|$|E
60|$|There {{is a form}} of <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> (4) by {{checks on}} bankers, and {{transfers}} in a banker’s books, which is exactly parallel in every respect to bank-notes, giving equal facilities to an extension of credit, and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully. A bank, instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer, might open an account with him, and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance, on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by drawing checks against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments. These checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like bank-notes; more commonly, however, the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker, and when he wanted the money would draw a fresh check against it; and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment, when it must be paid either in notes or in coin, notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation. It is not so, however. The person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker, and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn.|$|E
