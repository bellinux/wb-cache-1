50|$|In June 2006 the FDA {{announced}} {{that more than}} 120 branded pharmacy products containing <b>carbinoxamine</b> were being illegally marketed and demanded they {{be removed from the}} marketplace. This action was precipitated by twenty-one reported deaths in {{children under the age of}} two who had been administered carbinoxamine-containing products. Despite the fact that the drug had not been studied in this age group, a multitude of OTC preparations containing <b>carbinoxamine</b> were being marketed for infants and toddlers. At present, all carbinoxamine-containing formulations are approved only for adults or children ages 3 or older.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbinoxamine</b> (Clistin, Palgic, Rondec, Rhinopront) is a {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic agent. It {{was first}} {{launched in the}} United States by the McNeil Corporation under the brand name Clistin. It is now available under the brand name Palgic as 4 mg tablets or 4 mg/5 mL liquid. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (specifically at the 4 mg dose/strength) for hay fever (a.k.a. allergic rhinitis, SAR and PAR); vasomotor rhinitis; mild urticaria; angioedema, dermatographism and allergic conjunctivitis. <b>Carbinoxamine</b> is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H1-antagonist. The maleic acid salt of the levorotatory isomer is sold as the prescription drug rotoxamine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{authors of}} the American College of Chest Physicians Updates on Cough Guidelines (2006) {{recommend}} that, for cough associated with the common cold, first-generation antihistamine-decongestants are more effective than newer, non-sedating antihistamines. First-generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), <b>carbinoxamine</b> (Clistin), clemastine (Tavist), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), andbrompheniramine (Dimetane). However, a 1955 study of [...] "antihistaminic drugs for colds," [...] {{carried out by the}} U.S. Army Medical Corps, reported that [...] "there {{was no significant difference in}} the proportion of cures reported by patients receiving oral antihistaminic drugs and those receiving oral placebos.

The mean {{extraction}} recoveries were 103.8 [*]±[*] 1.5 and 94.5 [*]±[*] 1.8  % for (d) and (l) enantiomers of <b>carbinoxamine</b> enantiomers and 96.35  % for IS {{from human}} plasma. The mean relative error (RE %) of accuracy {{and the mean}} relative standard deviation (RSD %) of intra-day and inter-day precision for both enantiomers were < 10  %.|$|E
30|$|Plasma {{samples were}} {{extracted}} by liquid-liquid extraction. The separation of <b>carbinoxamine</b> enantiomers and internal standard (IS, pargeverine hydrochloride) was achieved on an amylose tris(5 -chloro- 2 -methylphenylcarbamate) column with a mobile phase of n-Hexane/isopropanol/ethanol/diethyl amine (850 : 75 : 75 : 0.1, v/v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8  mL/min.

30|$|The finest chiral {{stationary}} phases (CSP) for {{the separation}} of aromatic compounds with functional groups such as carbonyl, alcohol, and amine (like <b>carbinoxamine)</b> are amylose-based polysaccharide stationary phases (LCGC 2008). Immobilized polysaccharide columns are compatible {{with a wide range}} of solvents; hence, they can be operated in both reverse phase and normal phase which increased the range of applications (Othman et al. 2012). Hence, the coated amylose-based polysaccharide column was selected for screening.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of <b>carbinoxamine</b> enantiomers and IS extraction from human plasma {{was determined by}} comparing {{the responses of the}} analyte extracted from six reproduce QC samples with the response of analyte from neat standards at equivalent concentrations by a liquid-liquid extraction process. Recoveries of CA were determined at the LLOQ, QC low, QC medium, and QC high concentrations that is, 20, 300, 1200, and 5000  ng/mL. Whereas the recovery of the IS was determined at a single concentration of 2000  ng/mL.|$|E
30|$|The {{developed}} {{method was}} found to be sensitive, specific, and robust for quantification of both the (d) and (l) enantiomers of <b>carbinoxamine</b> in human plasma. The method involved sample preparation with adequate recovery by liquid-liquid extraction. Method parameters like % alcoholic modifier, % basic additive, and flow rate were successfully adjusted. The method ensured as a robust one from the responses obtained. Even for injection volume 25  μL the method is quite sensitive. The method is user-friendly because of using green solvents n-Hexane and ethanol. It is concluded that the method is suitable for the routine quantification of (d) and (l) enantiomers of CA in human plasma.|$|E

40|$|Two silica {{capillaries}} modified layer-by-layer with 6, 10 -ionene and N-(3 -sulfo- 3 -carboxy) -propionylchitosan (SCPC) {{and with}} 6, 10 -ionene and dextran sulfate (DS) were prepared and investigated. Dynamic coating of the capillary efficiently reduces the adsorption {{of the background}} electrolyte, sample matrix components, and analytes on its inner wall. Such coatings effect good reproducibility and sensitivity of determination. We demonstrate that separation of betablockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, H 1 -blockers, and diuretics was the most efficient and rapid separation with a capillary modified with dextran sulfate. Tetrahydrozoline, <b>carbinoxamine,</b> and furacilin, which are commonly employed as treatments for allergic rhinitis, were identified in human urea. Their concentrations, independently verified by HPLC, {{were found to be}} 5. 3 ± 0. 8, 6. 6 ± 0. 5, and 0. 9 ± 0. 2 [*]μg[*]mL− 1, with LOD= 0. 07, 0. 03, 0. 10 [*]μg mL− 1, and LOQ= 1. 0, 0. 8, 0. 6 [*]μg[*]mL− 1, respectively...|$|E
40|$|With {{the effort}} to {{discover}} new chemotypes blocking L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), ligand-based virtual screening was applied with a specific interest toward the diltiazem binding site. Roughly 50000 commercially available compounds served as a database for screening. The filtering through predicted pharmacokinetic properties and structural requirements reduced the initial database to a few compounds for which the similarity was calculated toward two template molecules, diltiazem and 4 -chloro-Ncyclopropyl- N-(4 -piperidinyl) benzene-sulfonamide, the most interesting hit of a previous screening experiment. For 18 compounds, inotropic and chronotropic activity {{as well as the}} vasorelaxant effect on guinea pig were studied "in vitro", and for the most promising, binding studies to the diltiazem site were carried out. The procedure yielded several hits, confirming in silico techniques to be useful for finding new chemotypes. In particular, N-[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl]- 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthamide, N,Ndimethyl- N'-(2 -pyridin- 3 -ylquinolin- 4 -yl) ethane- 1, 2 -diamine, 2 -[(4 -chlorophenyl) (pyridin- 2 -yl) methoxy]- N,N-dimethylethanamine (<b>carbinoxamine),</b> and 7 -[2 -(diethylamino) ethoxy]- 2 H-chromen- 2 -one revealed interesting activity and binding to the benzothiazepine site...|$|E

To investigate the pro-arrhythmic potential of antihistamines by combining safety reports of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) with drug utilization data from 13 European Countries. We identified signals of antihistamine arrhythmogenic potential by analyzing FAERS database for all cases of Torsades de Pointes (TdP), QT abnormalities (QTabn), ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death/cardiac arrest (SCD/CA). Number of cases ≥ 3 and disproportionality were used to define alert signals: TdP and QTabn identified stronger signals, whereas SCD/CA identified weaker signals. Drug utilization data from 2005 to 2010 were collected from administrative databases through health authorities and insurance. Antihistamines were reported in 109 cases of TdP/QT prolongation, 278 VA and 610 SCD/CA. Five agents resulted in stronger signals (cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine) and 6 in weaker signals (alimemazine, <b>carbinoxamine,</b> cyclizine, cyproeptadine, dexchlorpheniramine and doxylamine). Exposure to antihistamines with stronger signal was markedly different across European countries and was at least 40 % in each Country. Cetirizine was > 29 Defined Daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) in Norway, desloratadine > 11 DID in France and loratadine > 9 DID in Sweden and Croatia. Drugs with weaker signals accounted {{for no more than}} 10 % (in Sweden) and in most European countries their use was negligible. Some second-generation antihistamines are associated with signal of torsadogenicity and largely used in most European countries. Although confirmation by analytical studies is required, regulators and clinicians should consider risk-minimisation activities. Also antihistamines without signal but with peculiar use in a few Countries (e. g., levocetirizine) or with increasing consumption (e. g., rupatadine) deserve careful surveillance...|$|E
