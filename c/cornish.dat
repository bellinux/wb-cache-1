5|$|In 1451 {{during the}} Wars of the Roses Taunton {{was the scene}} of a {{skirmish}} between Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon, and Baron Bonville. Queen Margaret and her troops passed through in 1471 to defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury. In the Second <b>Cornish</b> Uprising of 1497 most of the <b>Cornish</b> gentry supported Perkin Warbeck's cause and on 17 September a <b>Cornish</b> army some 6,000 strong entered Exeter before advancing on Taunton. Henry VII sent his chief general, Giles, Lord Daubeney, to attack the <b>Cornish</b> and when Warbeck heard that the King's scouts were at Glastonbury he panicked and deserted his army. Henry VII reached Taunton on 4 October 1497 where he received the surrender of the remaining <b>Cornish</b> army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined a total of £13,000.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ball, a Cornish-born {{businessman}} who is {{chief executive of}} WMC Retail Partners, Oxfordshire, is planning to establish a <b>Cornish</b> pasty museum at <b>Cornish</b> Market World near St Austell. He hopes to collect pasty-making artifacts and memorabilia for the museum.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the <b>Cornish</b> coat of arms. According to <b>Cornish</b> legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last <b>Cornish</b> chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E
5|$|A US$15 million performing-arts {{program at}} the fair ranged from a boxing {{championship}} to an international twirling competition but with no shortage of nationally and internationally famous performers, especially at the new Opera House and Playhouse. After the fair, the Playhouse became the Seattle Repertory Theatre; in the mid-1980s it became the Intiman Playhouse. When the Intiman Theatre closed, <b>Cornish</b> College of the Arts took over the lease {{from the city of}} Seattle, and now operates it as the <b>Cornish</b> Playhouse at Seattle Center.|$|E
5|$|As well as English, England has {{two other}} {{indigenous}} languages, <b>Cornish</b> and Welsh. <b>Cornish</b> died {{out as a}} community language in the 18th century but is being revived, and is now protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is spoken by 0.1% of people in Cornwall, and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools.|$|E
5|$|Development of Ant-Man {{began in}} April 2006, with {{the hiring of}} Wright to direct and co-write with <b>Cornish.</b> By April 2011, Wright and <b>Cornish</b> had {{completed}} three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project, citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with <b>Cornish,</b> {{as well as an}} executive producer credit. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and Metro Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|England {{contains}} one indigenous national minority, the <b>Cornish</b> people, recognised by the UK {{government under}} the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2014.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s <b>Cornish</b> mines faced {{competition}} from cheap metal imports, and legislation {{introduced in the}} 1870s limited the use of child labour. The <b>Cornish</b> mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas and {{to other parts of}} the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women recruited for ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in <b>Cornish</b> mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, <b>Cornish</b> metals mining came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to <b>Cornish</b> {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. It was common for <b>Cornish</b> people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better life as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E
5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from the lucrative <b>Cornish</b> tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may {{have been designed to}} impress the <b>Cornish</b> nobility, with whom Richard had a difficult relationship.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, the <b>Cornish</b> chough was {{the emblem}} of the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS Hood.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican {{state of}} Hidalgo, and the twin silver mining cities of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte), have notable <b>Cornish</b> {{influences}} from the <b>Cornish</b> miners who settled there, with pasties being considered typical local cuisine. In Mexican Spanish, they {{are referred to}} as pastes. The town of Real del Monte in Mexico is the site of a museum of pasties. The annual International Pasty Festival is held in Real del Monte for three days each October.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} photographer Joe <b>Cornish</b> has a gallery {{in the town}} which displays his and other photographers work and runs workshops on landscape photography.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>Cornish</b> pasty, which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) {{status in}} Europe, {{is filled with}} beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It {{is regarded as the}} national dish and accounts for 6% of the <b>Cornish</b> food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit <b>Cornish</b> women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 <b>Cornish</b> women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit <b>Cornish</b> women.|$|E
5|$|In 1839 he {{followed}} Samuel <b>Cornish</b> {{as editor of}} The Colored American, a New York weekly newspaper owned by Philip Alexander Bell. Among his notable writings was a debate with the racist, anti-abolitionist Roman Catholic Archbishop John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|In around 1720, two key {{innovations}} revolutionised the <b>Cornish</b> mining industry. The whim, a horse-powered {{mechanism for}} lifting ore to the surface, made mining in deep shafts practical, and the horse-powered pump allowed mining beneath the water table.|$|E
5|$|Launceston Castle {{played a}} role in <b>Cornish</b> {{politics}} {{during the middle of the}} 16th century. In 1548, Sir William Body, a royal commissioner sent by Edward IV to destroy the Catholic shrines at Helston, was killed by two local <b>Cornish</b> men. In retaliation, 28 local men were arrested and executed at the castle. Anger grew, and in 1549 a wider uprising called the Prayer Book Rebellion took place. It was headed by Sir Humphrey Arundell, who marched up through the county and took Launcester Castle that summer, probably without a struggle. The castle was then used to imprison the royalist leader, Sir Richard Grenville, who died during his detention there. John Russell, the Earl of Bedford, subsequently defeated the rebels and retook Launceston, capturing Arundel who was seized in the street fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the pasty are unclear, though there are many {{references}} to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide due {{to the spread of}} <b>Cornish</b> miners, and variations can be found in Australia, the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Ulster and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Cornish</b> {{folklore}} legend relates that a mermaid {{created the}} bar as a dying curse on the harbour {{after she was}} shot by a local man. The Doom Bar {{has been used in}} poetry to symbolise feelings of melancholy, and has given its name to the flagship ale from the local Sharp's Brewery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} mainly {{mountain}} species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed chough has a coastal {{population in the}} far west of its range, and has cultural connections particularly with Cornwall, where it appears on the <b>Cornish</b> Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but {{was transformed into a}} red-billed chough, and hence killing this bird was unlucky.|$|E
5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the <b>Cornish</b> Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
5|$|As the {{national}} dish of Cornwall, several oversized {{versions of the}} pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the <b>Cornish</b> Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is passed over the goal posts.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, <b>Cornish</b> engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it {{stands in the middle}} of the garden, covered with <b>Cornish</b> slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.|$|E
5|$|British dishes include {{fish and}} chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several {{national}} and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, {{each of which has}} developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, <b>Cornish</b> pasty and Welsh cakes.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the <b>Cornish</b> tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are <b>Cornish</b> Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Great Western trains {{included}} long-distance {{express services}} such as the Flying Dutchman, the <b>Cornish</b> Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express. It also operated many suburban and rural services, some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains. The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It operated a network of road motor (bus) routes, {{was a part of}} the Railway Air Services, and owned ships, docks and hotels.|$|E
5|$|In March 1998, {{after the}} closure of Europe's last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and {{subsequently}} closed), the <b>Cornish</b> Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 toll in pennies. The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the list}} of United Kingdom food and drink {{products}} with protected status (PDO) under European Union law has increased rapidly, with 59 items including <b>Cornish</b> sardines, Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese and Yorkshire forced rhubarb, Fenland celery, West Country lamb and beef and traditional Cumberland sausage listed as registered in 2015, and a further 13 including Birmingham Balti listed as applied for. By 2016 there were 12 cheeses from England with PDO status.|$|E
5|$|Members of the CPA {{made about}} 87 million pasties in 2008, amounting to sales of £60 million (about 6% {{of the food}} economy of Cornwall). In 2011, over 1,800 {{permanent}} staff were employed {{by members of the}} CPA and some 13,000 other jobs benefited from the trade. Surveys by the South West tourism board have shown that one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall is the food and that the <b>Cornish</b> pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Morshead {{was born}} on 18 September 1889 in Ballarat, Victoria, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William Morshead, a gold miner who had emigrated from Cornwall via Canada, and his wife Mary Eliza Morshead, formerly Rennison, the Australian-born daughter of a fellow <b>Cornish</b> immigrant. William died when Morshead was six years old. He was educated at Mount Pleasant High School, where he was appointed a junior teacher in 1906.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Michelle Trachtenberg would reprise her role as troublemaker Georgina Sparks. Other cast members included Sparks' husband Philip (Nick <b>Cornish),</b> Blair's father Harold (John Shea), Blair's mother (Margaret Colin), Cyrus Rose (Wallace Shawn), Princess Sophie (Joanne Whalley), and Father Cavalia (Marc Menard). Blair's minions, Penelope Shafai (Amanda Setton), Kati Farkas (Nan Zhang) and Jessica (Alice Callahan) were also present as bridesmaids.|$|E
