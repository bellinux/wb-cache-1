40|$|The Cretaceous Apulia Platform, {{exposed in}} the Murge area (southern Italy), {{suffered}} intense (palaeo) karstification. This study {{focuses on the}} controlling factors of karstification with emphasis on fracturing. Mechanical stratigraphy was {{used to calculate the}} fracture density within different sedimentary sequences. Several mechanical units were defined and a characteristic relationship was found between unit thicknesses and fracture density, that is, fracture density increases if layer thickness decreases. In some of the quarries studied, sedimentary cycles are <b>clearly</b> <b>present</b> <b>that</b> are also reflected in the fracture density logs. The degree of karstification within a mechanical unit is proportional to the mean fracture spacing. Based on fracture orientation data extracted from LIDAR scans, different orientation clusters were observed between fractures that are karstified and fractures that are not karstified, post-dating karstification. The clusters of karstified fractures are related to the compression of the southern Apennines. The fractures became dissolution enlarged during the Pleistocene uplift caused by bulging of the Apulia Platform. This main karstification phase occurred prior to Late-Pleistocene deposition and before the formation of orthogonal fracture sets. status: publishe...|$|E

This paper presents a cost-based theory of tying in competitive markets and applies this theory to bundling and tying in pain relievers and cold medicines, foreign electrical plug adapters, and mid-sized automobile sedans. We show that product specific scale economies are needed to understand tying, yet these scale economies might be hard to detect. We draw two principal conclusions for tying law. First, the theoretical and empirical evidence of tying efficiencies supports abandoning per se treatment of tying.

More particularly, this provides an overview of {{the current state of the}} programs and students feedback on their learning, expectations, and any discrepancies in academic grading through marking scale comparing to public and private university grading system. Also to be singled out, level of expertise of instructors has also appeared to evaluate their acceptability and efficiency in this field along with the cost effectiveness of the programs. However, to conduct this research, researcher has followed mixed-method approach where both qualitative and quantitative data are collected from enrolled or passed out MA in ELT, TESOL students and their instructors from 2 public universities and 3 private universities. Hence, two separate questionnaires for instructors and students are used as tools for data collection following Stufflebeam’s CIPP model of program Evaluation. Finally, this study has illustrated a number of striking findings where it is <b>clearly</b> <b>presented</b> <b>that</b> the current Professional Post-graduate ELT/TESOL programs are moderately fulfilling students’ expectations and job market’s demand. It is also evident that these programs are moderately cost effective in our country. Moreover, most of the instructors involved in teaching do not possess any relevant degree to teach at these programs. Majority are joining from different background like literature. However, there is also a large discrepancy found in the grading scale and curriculum of public and private universities who offer MA in ELT/TESOL program. In fine, the study ends with some important recommendation and suggestions how to develop and sort out any debatable issues form the findings. Md. Abdul KaderM. in TESO...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the {{measurement}} model of rationales for homelessness and the structural model of pathways to homelessness. In the absence of specific method for combining individual and structural accounts with respect to how individuals become homeless, the study created the homeless individuals' self-perceived rationales for homelessness covering ten indicators from both individual and structural accounts. The study also developed structural model overarching from adverse childhood experiences to pathways to chronic homelessness. In addition, the multilevel model was created and tested in order to test the impact of two aggregated variables of rent rate and unemployment rate in macro-level on the measurement model of rationales for homelessness in micro-level. It was hypothesized that the measurement model created the second-order latent variable of homelessness, significant associations among experiences in childhood and adulthood with pathways to become homeless, and a significant influence of macro-level factors to rationales for homelessness.; This study was a cross-sectional, quantitative survey of 3, 226 homeless individuals across the County of Los Angeles. To address the study's hypotheses, bivariate analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling with binary indicators were performed.; The measurement model fitted well to the data and configural invariance was found across gender, ethnicity, and the type of homelessness. Moreover, the structural model fitted well to the data. Gender differences were found in pathways both to become homeless, and to become chronic homeless. Adverse childhood experiences significantly explained to become homeless directly and indirectly. Additionally, the results from the multilevel model showed that the rate of rent was found to be significant and explained the majority of variances in the between-level model. The findings from three model tests <b>clearly</b> <b>presented</b> <b>that</b> the combination of individual and structural accounts explained both rationales for homelessness and pathways to homelessness...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{basis of}} this essay are taken from Goffmans (1959) theory about {{impression}} management. The theory is used to investigate the connection and the collision between separate roles. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine when collision between the bosses professional role and their private role occur and to examine how they handle these collisions. The extent of this study is focused mainly on bosses who are living and working in small districts. The choice of definition is to make sure that the informants have actually experienced some degree of collision between their separate roles. The objective is to find out if bosses who are living and working in small districts can secure their anonymity and stay anonymous in public. A qualitative method is used for this study. And so called go-along interviews and focus Group interviews has been applied. The result of this study shows that bosses who are living and working in small districts are having trouble maintaining their anonymity. And therefore the most common choice made is to take up residence outside the work district. This is of great importance to be able to separate the professional role from the private and to maintain these two. The result <b>clearly</b> <b>presents</b> <b>that</b> collisions between the professional role and the private role are taking place and are quite common.  Henceforth strategies are used by bosses in this study to facilitate and avoid collisions. Bosses is using dramaturgical caution, to avoid execution of actions that can´t be adjusted quickly. Bosses in the conducted study are experiencing that collisions themselves aren't problematic which leads to the conclusion that they have a high level of dramaturgical discipline. In conclusion the main objective of this study has been obtained and the questions has been answered from Goffmans perspective regarding impression management. ...|$|R

Depending on the strategy, the CT {{part of the study}} may yield only crude anatomical information and attenuation correction for the PET part, or it may offer full radiological diagnostic features. Regarding the radiotracers for gastrointectinal oncology, FDG remains the mainstay but alternative compounds aimed at more specific biological targets are actively tested. In particular Ga- 68 -labelled DOTA derivatives image somatostatine receptors with exquisite sensitivity and specificity. In clinical practice, several indications are well recognized for FDG PET-CT. These include the initial staging of esophageal, pancreatic and rectal cancers with a clinical impact in a significal proportion of patients.

Tufte then placed the proposed launch of Challenger on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch.
