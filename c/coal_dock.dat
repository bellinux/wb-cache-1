25|$|Part of Yates' {{contribution}} to the BR's ability to haul coal was {{the extension of the}} line north from Lincoln Park through Rochester up to the <b>coal</b> <b>dock</b> it built {{at the mouth of the}} Genesee River in 1896. With an initial capacity of 4,000 tons a day, it was expanded in 1909 and 1913. To get coal to Canada, the BR arranged a cross-lake ferry service with the Grand Trunk Railway. This service was highly successful, carrying passengers and coal cars to Cobourg and other lake destinations. By 1913, over a million tons of coal a year passed through the Rochester <b>coal</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|E

25|$|As the {{national}} economy grew, more and more coal mines were developed along the BR routes. In fact, the new Indiana Branch soon yielded the greatest traffic volume as mines opened in the area south of Punxsutawney. By the 1920s, coal trains averaged 3,750 tons, requiring considerably better motive power than the archaic Consolidations of the earlier era. However, long coal drags {{with one or two}} Mallets at the head did not last forever. In {{the first quarter of the}} new century, the market share held by the comparatively costly union-made coal of Pennsylvania was driven down by the cheaper coal from the non-union mines of Kentucky and West Virginia. The companies of the Pittsburgh Coal District sought federal regulation of coal industry wages but lost. In a series of moves to protect themselves, the coal companies transferred to the BR not only the short-line railroads they'd built themselves but also the Genesee <b>Coal</b> <b>Dock</b> facility. This had the effect of improving the coal companies' fiscal performance, but it effectively hung an anchor on the railroad's neck as it swam in deeper and deeper waters.|$|E
500|$|In August 1979 Warrior {{began her}} [...] journey to her {{temporary}} {{home in the}} <b>Coal</b> <b>Dock</b> at Hartlepool for restoration as a museum ship. She arrived on 2 September 1979 and began the £9 million restoration project, largely funded by the Manifold Trust. The Maritime Trust decided to restore Warrior to her 1862 condition with the aim that no further major work would be necessary for the next 20 years. The {{first two years of}} the restoration were generally devoted to safely removing material added after her first commission, like the poop deck and the [...] of concrete decking. Intensive research was done to find detailed descriptions of the ship and her equipment as of 1862 to make the restoration as accurate as economically feasible. Sources included surviving official records, and the papers of those who had served on the ship during her active service. Bolt-holes and ridges in the paint gave clues to the location of some fittings and fixtures, and the sketch plans of Midshipman Henry Murray, found in Captain Cochrane's Letter Book, showed the locations of the armament, moveable fittings and stores.|$|E

Within minutes of {{the start of the}} Japanese attack, her crew had the enemy under fire with [...]50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns. Rescue and salvage work soon commenced, but shortly after noon was {{interrupted}} for sweeping operations in the North Channel. On the 8th she resumed salvage operations, and continued them until the 21st. From that day to 19 January 1942, she underwent engine repairs; then, three days later, she stood out of Pearl Harbor as an escort for a ship bound for Johnston Island.|$|E
50|$|The {{train station}} in Blairstown {{was located in}} what is now Footbridge Park. The parking lot for the park was {{originally}} a small railyard, complete with passing sidings, a turntable and engine house, and a <b>coaling</b> <b>dock</b> that is still extant (for a while in later years, a skate park was located under the old <b>coaling</b> <b>dock).</b> The footbridge across the Paulinskill River was the second one at the site. The present footbridge was dedicated by Blair himself shortly before his death, and provided direct access between the town of Blairstown and the train station, and later to Footbridge Park.|$|R

5000|$|The {{industrial}} Port Johnson area {{is located}} in the southwestern portion of Constable Hook. In 1864, after building a railroad bridge over Newark Bay, the Central Railroad of New Jersey laid railroad tracks through Bayonne into Constable Hook. After the American Civil War, they built the Port Johnston <b>Coal</b> <b>Docks,</b> at the time the largest coal port in the world. Many Irish immigrants took jobs with the railroad living in Constable Hook. So many Irish had moved there that the residents of Bayonne referred to the area as [...] "Irishtown." [...] On July 26, 1877, the first full scale strike occurred in Bayonne at the Port Johnston <b>Coal</b> <b>Docks</b> when workers walked off the job. Port Johnston was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp for Italian soldiers during WW2.|$|R
50|$|On July 26, 1877, {{the first}} full scale strike {{occurred}} in Bayonne at the Port Johnston <b>Coal</b> <b>Docks</b> when workers walked off the job. The Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, who had bought the <b>coal</b> <b>docks</b> from the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1876, had cut the wages of the workers {{in an effort to}} save money. The Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company promptly fired all of the workers and brought in German immigrants from New York City to work. A threat of a riot was averted with the intervention of Bayonne Mayor Henry Meigs, Jr. and Father Thomas Killeen of St. Mary's Church. After working a day at the lower wages, the German immigrants decided it was not worthwhile and quit. By early August, Meigs had worked out a solution with the company that ended the strike peacefully.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{commenced}} in 1872 as {{soon the}} Easton and Amboy was formed; <b>coal</b> <b>docks</b> at Perth Amboy were soon constructed, {{and most of}} the line from Easton to Perth Amboy was graded and rails laid. However, the route required a 4893 ft tunnel through/under Musconetcong Mountain near Pattenburg, New Jersey (about twelve miles east of Phillipsburg), and that proved troublesome, delaying the opening of the line until May 1875, when a coal train first passed over the line. To support the expected increase in traffic, the wooden bridge over the Delaware River at Easton was also replaced by a double-tracked, 1191 ft iron bridge.|$|R
