O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> miles east of the Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Florence {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} which developed in late October along a stationary front located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The low gradually detached from the front and began developing convective banding features. The system was not fully tropical as the strongest winds were recorded a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> miles from the center, leading to the system being classified a subtropical cyclone on the morning of November 2. Minor intensification followed shortly after and the subtropical depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm. This was based on ship reports of 40mph (65km/h) sustained winds associated with the system. By November 3, the storm became slightly disorganized and was downgraded to a subtropical depression. By the afternoon, the subtropical system began to undergo a transition from a subtropical system to tropical system. Later that day, the storm was classified Tropical Depression Eleven while located 875mi (1,400km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression was moving towards the northwest at 8mph (13km/h) and the same general motion was expected as a large upper-level low situated over the system was forecast to move towards the northeast, leading to Eleven moving around the periphery of the low.|$|E

5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop serving Pontiac and Auburn Hills. It uses portions of former Business M-24 (Bus. M-24) through town. The highway starts as an eight-lane freeway at an interchange on I-75 in Bloomfield Township. The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road, dropping to six lanes. BL I-75 continues to M-1 at Woodward Avenue. Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus. US24, BL I-75 turns northwesterly along the eight-lane divided Woodward Avenue, running concurrently with Bus. US24 into downtown Pontiac. At {{the south side of}} downtown, Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four-lane loop. The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac, and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M-59 running on Huron Street. One block north, the westbound direction of M-59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I-75/Bus. US24 (Woodward Avenue Loop). The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north, and BL I-75 turns northeasterly onto the two-way Perry Street. BL I-75 passes through residential areas and a minor business area along the four-lane Perry Street. Outside of the downtown area, Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane. North of Walton Boulevard in Auburn Hills, the street name changes to Lapeer Road. BL I-75 intersects Opdyke Road a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> feet west of I-75 before crossing the freeway. Lapeer Road continues as a six-lane, divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange, where the BL I-75 designation ends. The roadway however, continues as M-24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills. On average each day in 2013, 9,829vehicles use the business loop between the two M-59 junctions, and 73,795vehicles do so on the freeway stub east of Opdyke Road, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E

25|$|Past {{theories}} {{of how the}} first people came into the New World stated that they arrived via the Bering Bridge that connected Asia and North America. The theory stated these nomads descended from hunting families and had acquired the skills to track down and kill large mammals. By this time, humans had developed preliminary weapons used for hunting. These weapons included the Clovis points, which were narrow, carved stone projectiles used specifically for big game. A <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> years later, humans had established the atlatl, an invention {{that allowed them to}} throw spears at their prey. These inventions allowed hunters to put distance between them and their prey, potentially making it less dangerous to approach these ground sloths.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, most {{typically}} {{in the city}} of Bamenda, marches by groups of older women have been referred to as Takembeng. These protests involve groups of 30 to a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> older women marching or protesting through the city, often taking part with other political protests affiliated with the main opposition party in Cameroon, the SDF. While the other protesters are quite loud and active at these protests, the Takembeng women remain largely silent while marching (which distinguishes the current manifestations from the earlier versions). Similarly, unlike the earlier practices, these recent movements include women from a variety of different ethnic groups. Although rural women provide a core part of the movement, it also includes urban women who live in Bamenda.|$|E
25|$|Directly east {{of these}} areas, the weather becomes much harsher: {{precipitation}} drops to between 150 and 300mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme.

500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract.

500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought that was how it was done in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's also a little sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes. We're coming up on 500 episodes, but really, {{this is the kind of}} episode a show would only do if hadn't already had a <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> episodes."
