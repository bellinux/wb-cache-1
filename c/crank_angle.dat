25|$|An alpha Stirling {{contains}} two power pistons in separate cylinders, one hot and one cold. The hot cylinder is situated inside the high temperature heat exchanger {{and the cold}} cylinder is situated inside the low temperature heat exchanger. This type of engine has a high power-to-volume ratio but has technical problems because of the usually high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seals. In practice, this piston usually carries a large insulating head to move the seals away from the hot zone {{at the expense of}} some additional dead space. The <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> has a major effect on efficiency and the best angle frequently has to be found experimentally. An angle of 90° frequently locks.|$|E

2500|$|The Camry {{was given}} a {{facelift}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year. Minor exterior changes included a revised front fascia with different front turn signals and reshaped headlamps. Additionally, the rear fascia was updated, now with body-coloured plastic between the tail lamps where the model name [...] "Camry" [...] was printed. This was instead of the red plastic on higher trim levels and black plastic on lower trim levels of the 1992 to 1994 models. The tail lamps themselves were also slightly different. Another change, this time mechanical came in 1996; the 2.2-liter engine was detuned slightly to [...] to meet stricter emissions standards. Additionally, in 1996 the cam angle sensor in the distributor was also replaced with a <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> sensor to achieve a smoother idle.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{are currently}} available on various cars. In some models, {{rather than one}} central coil, there are individual coils on each spark plug, sometimes known as direct ignition or coil on plug (COP). This allows the coil a longer time to accumulate a charge between sparks, and therefore a higher energy spark. A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3. Other systems do away with the distributor as a timing apparatus and use a magnetic <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> sensor mounted on the crankshaft to trigger the ignition at the proper time.|$|E
50|$|With an offset {{slider-crank}} mechanism, an {{offset distance}} is introduced. This offset distance {{is referred to}} as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank arm pivot point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> of the forward and reverse strokes are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower working stroke is desired.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of Transparent Combustion Chamber (TCC 3) engine Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) result {{was carried out}} to investigate Cycle-to-Cycle Variation (CCV) correlation between in-cylinder swirl ratio and flow in the valve seat region of the intake port to address a challenging question on “What causes CCV of in-cylinder flow”. Polar Velocity (PV) profile, mean velocities normal to a ring-shaped cutting surface in the valve seat region, is calculated to depict intake port flow. A Net Polar Velocity (NPV) can be defined by performing the vector sum of the polar velocity around the intake valve. A standard deviation of PV is also calculated from azimuthal distribution of PV magnitudes relative to its mean value. The {{analysis of}} 18 LES cycles of TCC 3 engine with a two-valve, pancake-shaped combustion chamber shows that similar CCV of in-cylinder swirl ratio patterns are observed at different <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> from Intake Valve Opening (IVO) to Exhaust Valve Opening (EVO). Further analysis shows clear correlations of CCV between in-cylinder swirl ratio and NPV magnitude and the standard deviation of PV at selected <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> from IVO to EVO. The correlations get significantly better with the ring-shaped cutting surface moves from up-stream to downstream of the valve-seat region. This study reveals that the CCV of in-cylinder swirl ratio is built up gradually from upstream to downstream in the intake port and valve-seat region. Further evaluation of the analysis method is planned for a four-valve engine as an evaluation metric for better engine intake port design and combustion chamber optimization...|$|R
50|$|Locomotives with Gresley {{valve gear}} {{must have the}} three pistons {{operating}} at precisely 120 degree intervals. (Different spacings could be accommodated by different lever proportions, {{if there were any}} advantage to a spacing other than 120-120-120.) In order for the inside crank to clear the leading coupled axle, the inside cylinder of a locomotive with Gresley valve gear is typically positioned higher than the outside cylinders and angled downward. To maintain a smooth flow of torque, the <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> are offset from equal 120 degree spacing to compensate for the angle of the inside cylinder (e.g. 120/113/127 degrees). The resultant timing of the blast from steam exiting the cylinders still gives these three-cylinder locomotives a regular exhaust beat.|$|R

Velocity field measurements are made in the wake of a full-size pedalling (100 RPM) man-nequin in a time-trial position sitting on a bicycle.

40|$|Abstract. The {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} an HCCI engine fueled with n-butanol were investigated on a modified two-cylinder, four stoke diesel engine. The experiments {{were conducted on}} the HCCI engine with λ of 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0, and the intake air temperature and engine speed were kept at 140 ℃ and 1000 rpm, respectively. Effects of λ on combustion characteristics including in-cylinder pressure rise rate, heat release rate, CA 05 and combustion duration of HCCI combustion engine are discussed in details based on the recorded in-cylinder pressure. The results indicate that in-cylinder pressure {{and the rate of}} pressure rise both decrease with the increase of λ, the maximum heat release rate also decreases with the increase of λ but occurs at late <b>crank</b> <b>angles.</b> In addition, as λ increases, the combustion phasing retards and combustion duration becomes longer...|$|R
30|$|To {{apply this}} model, two extra points (<b>crank</b> <b>angles)</b> {{at each end}} of the pumping cycle are required; these are {{estimated}} by straight-line extrapolations of the input data. This solution ensures that the derivative function does not have unusual peaks at the two ends of the cycle; calculation accuracy is provided by the small time increment. As shown in Fig.  4, the numerical differentiation results in a smooth curve for the crank angular velocity. Being a periodic function in time, it can be curve-fitted by a truncated Fourier series which is easy to differentiate to get the angular acceleration of the crankshaft, d 2 θ/dt 2. Complete results of the calculation model developed in this paper for the example case are shown in Fig.  4 that depicts the variations of the crank’s angular velocity and acceleration with time to be used in subsequent calculations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{unbalanced}} inertias in a locomotive are briefly shown by describing measurements of locomotive motions {{as well as}} deflections in steel bridges.
