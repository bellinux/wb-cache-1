U radu se definira pojam društvene mreže te obrađuje povijest društvenih mreža, od samih početaka do globalnog fenomena koji iz dana u dan broji sve veći broj korisnika. Uvodi se u svijet web razvoja u okviru (eng. framework) Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> te se predočavaju njegove mogućnosti. Velika zajednica Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> programera te mnogo predočenih riješenih problema na internetu uvelike olakšavaju rješavanje bilo kakvih problema pri razvoju aplikacije. Korištenje baze podataka The Movie DB putem API-ja je uvelike olakšano objašnjenjima pronađenima na Git repozitoriju samog gem paketa. Učinkovitost samog okvira Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> predočena je praktičnim radom. Zbog lakše instalacije Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> okvira te prvobitne naklonosti Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> okvira Unix-baziranim operacijskim sustavima, za potrebe samog razvoja aplikacije za operacijski sustav korištena je distribucija Linux operacijskog sustava Ubuntu 17. 04. This bachelor's thesis {{details the}} {{development}} of a social network designed for writing film reviews. The term "social network" will be clearly defined including the history of social networks from their very beginnings, to the global phenomenon of today which is used by a constantly increasing number of users. The thesis also contains an introduction to the environment of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> web application framework with an explanation of its capabilities. The large programming community gathered around Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> has already dealt with numerous development issues, which greatly eases correcting any errors while developing the application. Using The Movie DB's database through their API is smooth and straightforward due to the examples found in the Git repository of The Movie DB’s gem package. The effectiveness of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework is illustrated by its utilization in this thesis. Due to the easier installation of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework, and the framework's initial predisposition towards Unix-based operating systems, this application has been developed using Ubuntu 17. 04., distribution of the Linux operating system...|$|R
