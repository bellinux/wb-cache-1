50|$|While {{in earlier}} {{personal}} computers {{it was possible}} to cool most components using natural convection (passive cooling), many modern components require more effective active cooling. To cool these components, fans are used to move heated air away from the components and draw cooler air over them. Fans attached to components are usually used in combination with a heatsink to increase the area of heated surface in contact with the air, thereby improving the efficiency of <b>cooling.</b> <b>Fan</b> <b>control</b> is not always an automatic process. A computer's BIOS (basic input/output system) can control the speed of the built in fan system for the computer. A user can even supplement this function with additional cooling components or connect a manual fan controller with knobs that different set fans to different speeds.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> can be {{improved}} by using road topography information. Two such controllers are presented, one that uses information available in vehicles produced today, and one that combines GPS-information with digital topographic maps to use information about the road ahead of the vehicle. Simulations show that significant energy savings can be obtained, especially during warm conditions and hilly roads. Compared to conventional fan controllers, energy consumption can be cut by up to three quarters. Moreover, this is possible without any hardware redesign...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} for reliable simulation models, {{able to support}} the fuel cell systems development activity, has increased continuously during the last years. The present work proposes a model which integrates the finite element method in a dynamic simulation, {{in order to achieve}} higher accuracy and the possibility to investigate the influence of various parameters on the fuel cell dynamics. The model is implemented using Matlab/Simulink and consists of two interacting main subsystems that calculates the fuel cell power response and the stack thermal behavior. The first simulates the mass transport and electrochemical phenomena using a model implemented in Femlab, and considers as input parameters the stack geometry, reactants pressure, flow rate and composition and the stack average temperature. The last parameter is also evaluated by the second model, implemented also in Femlab, which considers the stack geometry, cooling air flow rate and ambient temperature. Both models were validated using the experimental data acquired on a Ballard Nexa 1. 5 kWe PEM system. The results prove that integrated model simulates with accuracy the dynamics of the PEMFC system and the interaction between the stack and the auxiliaries. The proposed model was used as a predictive tool for two situations. In the first simulation, with a relative fast dynamic, the model demonstrates that the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> strategy is essential for transient conditions characterized by a significant load decreasing. In the second, the model estimates the variation of the PEMFC main parameters on a 24 hour cycle, confirming its reliability...|$|E

50|$|Cooling {{towers and}} pumps {{are used to}} supply cool {{condenser}} water to the chillers. Because the condenser water supply to the chillers has to be constant, variable speed drives are commonly used on the <b>cooling</b> tower <b>fans</b> to <b>control</b> temperature. Proper cooling tower temperature assures the proper refrigerant head pressure in the chiller. The cooling tower set point used depends upon the refrigerant being used. Analog temperature sensors measure the condenser water supply and return lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand of}} cooling system in equator region is {{significantly}} high {{due to the}} hot ambient temperature.

40|$|Abstract * TEAPC is an IBM/Intel-standard PC {{realization}} of a CPU temperature-adaptive feedback-control system. The control system adjusts the CPU frequency and/or voltage {{to maintain a}} constant set-point temperature. TEAPC dynamically adapts to changing CPU computation loads, {{as well as any}} other system phenomenon that affects the CPU temperature. For example, with the specific TEAPC hardware, should the CPU <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> fail, the <b>control</b> system detects the increase in CPU temperature and automatically reduces the CPU frequency and voltage to keep the CPU from overheating. In such a circumstance the system continues to operate. All of the adaptation is done dynamically, at runtime, on an unmodified standard operating system (Windows 2000) with a purely software-implemented feedback-control system. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that (i) {{a short period}} of high maximum temperature disrupts gas exchange and arrests berry growth and sugar accumulation in irrigated Shiraz vines (Vitis vinifera L.), and (ii) the magnitude of these effects depend on the phenological window when stress occur. Using a system combining passive heating (greenhouse effect) and active <b>cooling</b> (<b>fans)</b> to <b>control</b> daytime temperature, we compared vines heated to a nominal maximum of 40 °C for three consecutive days and untreated controls. Maximum air temperature in heated treatments was 7. 3 °C (2006 – 07) and 6. 5 °C (2007 – 08) above ambient. Heat episodes were aligned with the beginning of a weekly irrigation cycle and applied in one of four phenological windows, namely post-fruit set, pre-veraison, veraison and pre-harvest. Heating systems did not affect relative humidity, hence vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was increased in the heated treatments and tracked the daily cycle of temperature. Heat did not affect the dynamics of berry growth and sugar accumulation, except for a 16 % reduction in berry size and sugar content in vines heated shortly after fruit set in 2006 – 07. Vines upregulated stomatal conductance and gas exchange in response to heat. Stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration at a common VPD were consistently higher in heated vines than in controls. We suggest that stomatal behaviour previously described as part of Shiraz anisohydric syndrome may be adaptive in terms of heat tolerance at the expense of short-term transpiration efficiency.

40|$|Article history: Because {{of their}} longer {{operating}} times and larger size relative to conventional <b>fans,</b> the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted in buses consume larger amounts of energy. Most of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted {{in a bus}} {{are connected to the}} engine by a viscous clutch. A viscous cooling fan’s speed is determined by its fluid temperature, which is affected by the air flow through the radiator. The fan does not react immediately to the coolant temperature and in doing so causes unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, the fuel economy of buses using viscous fans can be improved by changing to an electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> design, which can be actively controlled. In addition, electric power consumption is increased by using electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> Thus, when electric fans are applied in conjunction with the alternator management system (AMS), the fuel economy is further enhanced. In this study, simulations were performed to predict coolant temperature and <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> speeds. Simulations were performed for both viscous and electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> and power consumption was calculated. Additionally, fuel economy was calculated applying both the alternator management system and the electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{evaluations}} of energy efficiency, plume potential {{as well as}} plume control of a huge chiller plant using water-evaporative cooling towers for heat rejection for a super high-rising commercial office building in a subtropical region of Hong Kong. The evaluations were carried out in a dynamic Transient Simulation Program (TRNSYS) -based simulation platform using alternative control strategies including set-point control logics of the supply cooling water temperature and <b>cooling</b> tower <b>fan</b> modulation <b>control</b> methods as well as different number control means of cooling towers. The results show that different control strategies have significant effects on the energy efficiency of the chiller plant. The quantification of the energy efficiency demonstrates significant energy-saving potential by using advanced technologies for implementing optimal control strategies in this cooling system. The results also reveal that the plume may occur frequently in spring and summer seasons and occasionally in other months due to the odd subtropical weather conditions. Control strategies also have significant effects on {{the frequency of the}} plume occurrence. The effective energy efficiency control and effective plume control using wet-dry (i. e., hybrid) cooling towers are also discussed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
