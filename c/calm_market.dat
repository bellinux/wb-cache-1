40|$|This paper {{compares the}} equity market in Croatia in bad (bear or turbulent) and good (bull, <b>calm)</b> <b>market</b> conditions. The two market regimes are {{formally}} identifi ed under the Markov Regime Switching (MRS) framework. The analysis conducted suggests that correlations between equity prices {{are more than}} twice as high during bear than in bull markets. This result holds both for the shares included in the CROBEX and for the relationship among various European equity indices. In the context of international diversifi cation the result suggests only a limited benefi t that foreign investors can count on when diversifying their portfolios by expanding to developing European markets. In addition, by evaluating a portfolio optimization model that takes asymmetric correlations into account in an out-of-sample exercise, this paper also illustrates the losses that may occur if the asymmetry is ignored in practice...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{market risk}} calculation for an equity-based trading portfolio. Instead {{of relying on}} the purely stochastic internal model method, which banks currently apply {{in line with the}} Basel regulatory requirements, we propose to include also alternative price mechanisms from the financial literature into the regulatory framework. For this purpose {{a modified version of the}} model by Lux and Marchesi (2000) is developed, capturing the realistic feature that parts of the investors do not follow the assumption of no arbitrage, but are motivated by rules of thumb and market psychology instead. Although both the standard stochastic as well as the behavioral model are restricted to 250 trading days, the latter is able to capitalize possible turbulences on financial markets and likewise the well-known phenomenon of excess volatility - even if the last 250 days reflect a <b>calm</b> <b>market</b> for which the efficient-market hypothesis could hold. Thus it is argued that a value-at-risk-based maximum approach in the regulatory framework would create better capital requirements with respect to their level and counter-cyclicality. This in turn could reduce the extent to which (irrational) bubbles arise since market participants would have to anticipate comprehensively the costs of such bubbles bursting. Furthermore a key ratio is deduced from the agent-based construction to lower the influence of speculative derivatives...|$|E
40|$|In {{financial}} risk management {{it is essential to}} be able to model dependence in markets and portfolios in an accurate and efficient way. A high positive dependence between assets in a portfolio can be devastating, especially in times of crises, since losses will most likely occur {{at the same time in}} all assets for such a portfolio. The dependence is therefore directly linked to the risk of the portfolio. The risk can be estimated by several different risk measures, for example Value-at-Risk and Expected shortfall. This paper studies some different ways to measure risk and model dependence, both in a theoretical and empirical way. The main focus is on copulas, which is a way to model and construct complex dependencies. Copulas are a useful tool since it allows the user to separately specify the marginal distributions and then link them together with the copula. However, copulas can be quite complex to understand and it is not trivial to know which copula to use. An implemented copula model might give the user a "black-box" feeling and a severe model risk if the user trusts the model too much and is unaware of what is going. Another model would be to use the linear correlation which is also a way to measure dependence. This is an easier model and as such it is believed to be easier for all users to understand. However, linear correlation is only easy to understand in the case of elliptical distributions, and when we move away from this assumption (which is usually the case in financial data), some clear drawbacks and pitfalls become present. A third model, called historical simulation, uses the historical returns of the portfolio and estimate the risk on this data without making any parametric assumptions about the dependence. The dependence is assumed to be incorporated in the historical evolvement of the portfolio. This model is very easy and very popular, but it is more limited than the previous two models to the assumption that history will repeat itself and needs much more historical observations to yield good results. Here we face the risk that the market dynamics has changed when looking too far back in history. In this paper some different copula models are implemented and compared to the historical simulation approach by estimating risk with Value-at-Risk and Expected shortfall. The parameters of the copulas are also investigated under calm and stressed market periods. This information about the parameters is useful when performing stress tests. The empirical study indicates that it is difficult to distinguish the parameters between the stressed and <b>calm</b> <b>market</b> period. The overall conclusion is; which model to use depends on our beliefs about the future distribution. If we believe that the distribution is elliptical then a correlation model is good, if it is believed to have a complex dependence then the user should turn to a copula model, and if we can assume that history will repeat itself then historical simulation is advantageous...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} policy {{response}} to the 2007 – 09 financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} a senior Treasury official at the time. Government agencies faced severe constraints in addressing the crisis: lack of legal authority for potentially helpful financial stabilization measures, a Congress reluctant to grant such authority, and the need to act quickly in the midst of a market panic. Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications, but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers. The suddenness of Bear Stearns’ collapse in March 2008 made rescue necessary and led to preparation of emergency options should conditions worsen.

40|$|Much {{of recent}} work {{has raised the}} issue that the surge in prices of {{foodgrains}} {{in the last two}} years cannot be explained satisfactorily in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand. It has also been suggested that the part that cannot be explained in this way is due largely to speculation. Speculation influences food prices in two distinct ways: one is the huge influx of capital from commodity index funds, hedge funds and pension funds in commodity futures markets or options. Some evidence suggests that expiry prices in commodity futures markets are considerably higher than cash or spot prices, implying that futures markets are not facilitating price discovery. The second form is purchase or hoarding of commodities on the presumption that their prices will continue to rise. The present analysis, based on a rational distributed lag model of global stocks of wheat, maize and rice and their prices over the period 1986 - 2008, confirms a positive long-run effect of rising prices on stocks. In the case of rice, this effect is considerably stronger. If this finding has any validity, although the need for correcting demand-supply imbalances remains a top priority, careful attention must also be given to limiting speculation. Various suggestions include the imperative of a ‘virtual grain reserve’ to be established to help <b>calm</b> <b>markets</b> through the futures market. But, above all, there is a strong case for a better functioning trading system-in particular, for trade liberalization in agriculture and to build trust in global food markets and stock management. ...|$|R

In view of the urgency of assisting people and countries in need, {{the first set of}} policy actions— an emergency package—consists of steps that can yield immediate impact: 1. expand emergency responses and humanitarian assistance to food-insecure people and people threatening government legitimacy, 2. eliminate agricultural export bans and export restrictions, 3. undertake fast-impact food production programs in key areas, and 4. change biofuel policies. A second set of actions—a resilience package—consists of the following steps: 5. <b>calm</b> <b>markets</b> with the use of market-oriented regulation of speculation, shared public grain stocks, strengthened food-import financing, and reliable food aid; 6. invest in social protection; 7. scale up investments for sustained agricultural growth; and 8. complete the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Investment in these actions calls for additional resources. Policymakers should consider mobilizing resources from four sources: the winners from the commodity boom among countries; the community of traditional and new donor countries; direct or indirect progressive taxation and reallocation of public expenditures in the affected countries themselves; and mobilization of private sector finance, including through improved outreach of banking to agriculture. Because of countries' diverse situations, the design of programs must be country driven and country owned. Accountability for sound implementation must also rest with countries. At the same time, a new international architecture for the governance of agriculture, food, and nutrition is needed to effectively implement the initiatives described, and especially their international public goods components.
