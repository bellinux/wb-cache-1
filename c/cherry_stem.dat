40|$|Purpose To {{study the}} {{composition}} of extracts of Ginja <b>cherries</b> <b>stems</b> and leaves obtained after extraction using different solvents and to evaluate their antioxidant activities. Stems and leaves are by-products of the Ginjinha cherry liquor production; extracting valuable compounds with the most appropriate solvent would valorise these wastes. Method The extraction was performed using different solvents (acetone, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, water, 2 -propanol); liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) was utilized to identify the predominant phenolic acids and flavonoids present in the resulting extracts. The Total Phenolic Content was determined with the Folin-Ciocolteau method. The antioxidant activity was also tested using the ABTS? essay. Results Stems extracts showed a higher concentration in polyphenols than those from leaves. The solvent affected remarkably the extracts compositions: considering the polyphenols content ethanol and water gave the best results for stems and leaves, respectively. A good correlation was established between the antioxidant activity of the extracts and their polyphenolic composition...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} many studies on {{cherries}} {{have revealed that}} they are rich sources of bioactive compounds, mainly due to their polyphenolic phytochemicals. In this work, by-products of the sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) used in the Óbidos liquor from Portugal, were evaluated by determination of their total phenolic and anthocyanins contents. The mix samples (leaves and stems) and pomace (skins with and without kernels) were extracted by maceration using two different extraction methods with different solvents: ethanol and methanol. Overall, significant differences were observed between all the extracts {{in relation to the}} solvent used and anthocyanin and phenol contents. Stem and leaf extracts showed a polyphenol concentration higher than those from pomace. For all samples the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents were higher in methanol extracts than in ethanol extracts showing that methanol was the best solvent. For the pomace extracts the samples without kernels (skin samples) gave the highest values for both parameters. The tested <b>cherry</b> <b>stems</b> and pomace could be regarded as a promising agro-industrial by-product, being a low-cost polyphenols source, with potential to be added in functional cosmetics formulations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} sweet cherry regarding nutritional composition of the fruits, and individual phytochemicals and bioactive properties of fruits and stems. The chromatographic profiles in sugars, organic acids, fatty acids, tocopherols and phenolic compounds were established. All the preparations (extracts, infusions and decoctions) obtained using stems revealed higher antioxidant potential than the fruits extract, which is certainly related with its higher phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavonoids) concentration. The fruits extract was the only one showing antitumor potential, revealing selectivity against HCT- 15 (colon carcinoma) (GI 50 ~ 74 μg/mL). This could be related with anthocyanins that were only found in fruits and not in stems. None of the preparations have shown hepatotoxicity against normal primary cells.

40|$|Ice nuclei {{active at}} {{approximately}} − 2 °C and intrinsic to woody tissues of Prunus spp. {{were shown to}} have properties distinct from bacterial ice nuclei. Soaking 5 -centimeter peach stem sections in water for 4 hours lowered the mean ice nucleation temperature to below − 4 °C, nearly 2 °C lower than stems inoculated with ice nucleation-active Pseudomonas syringae strain B 301 D. Ice nucleation activity in peach was fully restored by air-drying woody stem sections for a few hours. The ice nuclei in woody tissue were inactivated between 40 and 50 °C, but unaffected by treatment with bacterial ice nucleation inhibitors (i. e. NaOCl, tartaric acid, Triton XQS- 20), sulfhydryl reagents (i. e. p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and iodine) and Pronase.

40|$|In food science, colour is a {{fundamental}} property {{for the evaluation of}} freshness, quality and conformity. One of the most important attributes indicating sweet cherry freshness is stem colour and shape. Fruit post-harvest cool storage retards respiration and colour ripening changes. The common technology of refrigeration is based on active cooling determining high evapotranspiration for the passage of air over the products surface. An innovative preservation system, such as the Passive Refrigeration System (PRS™), could guarantee perfect shelf-life preservation maintaining optimal temperature and relative humidity close to 100 %, minimizing colour changes in medium-long storage range. There is the need to numerically quantify <b>cherry</b> <b>stem</b> thickness and colour changes to compare fruit postharvest conditions under the two systems.

40|$|Background: Sweet {{cherries}} (Prunus avium L.) are a nutritious fruit {{which are}} rich in polyphenols and have high antioxidant potential. Most sweet cherries are consumed fresh and {{a small proportion of}} the total sweet cherries production is value added to make processed food products. Sweet cherries are highly perishable fruit with a short harvest season, therefore extensive preservation and processing methods have been developed for the extension of their shelf-life and distribution of their products. Scope and approach: In this review, the main physicochemical properties of sweet cherries, as well as bioactive components and their determination methods are described. The study emphasises the recent progress of postharvest technology, such as controlled/modified atmosphere storage, edible coatings, irradiation, and biological control agents, to maintain sweet cherries for the fresh market. Valorisations of second-grade sweet cherries, as well as trends for the diversification of cherry products for future studies are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Sweet cherry fruit have a short harvest period and marketing window. The major loss in quality after harvest include moisture loss, softening, decay and stem browning. Without compromising their eating quality, the extension in fruit quality and shelf-life for sweet cherries is feasible by means of combination of good handling practice and applications of appropriate postharvest technology. With the drive of health-food sector, the potential of using second class <b>cherries</b> including <b>cherry</b> <b>stems</b> as a source of bioactive compound extraction is high, as cherry fruit is well-known for being rich in health-promoting components...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} Australian distribution, {{invasion}} biology and genetics of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, its predation of {{woolly apple aphid}} (WAA) and intraguild compatibility with the parasitoid Aphelinus mali in apple orchards, the impact earwigs have upon sweet cherry production and the chemical ecology of F. auricularia with special reference to the isolation of its aggregation pheromone. F. auricularia {{was found to be}} spread across all of southern Australia with records indicating it probably invaded Australia, in Tasmania, over 170 years ago. The mtDNA analysis of Australian and New Zealand F. auricularia populations indicated only one of the two known European earwig subspecies is found in these regions and that there are two differing clades of this subspecies within Australia but only one in Tasmania and New Zealand. Comparing these results to samples collected throughout Europe indicates that the genetic diversity of the mainland Australian population is only half that of Europe and the diversity in Tasmania and New Zealand is half that again. Possible European sources for only one of the two Australian clades were found. These results indicate that multiple invasion events are likely to have occurred on the Australian mainland, but this seems less probable within Tasmania or New Zealand. The investigation into the intraguild compatibility of earwigs and A. mali in apple orchards was determined by weekly monitoring of arthropod communities (including WAA, earwigs, A. mali) within 5 orchards over two entire apple production seasons. Earwig trap catches were observed to rapidly decline after the imaginal moult at all sites and during both seasons. The thesis shows that trees which possess large earwig trap catches (> 22 earwigs/tree/week) within the first 7 weeks after blossom contain little to no WAA {{at the end of the}} season. Trees that contained fewer earwigs had larger WAA infestations unless the first generation of A. mali numbers exceeded 0. 5 wasps per sticky trap per week. If these beneficial insect targets were not met, extreme WAA infestations occurred, despite other predators being observed feeding on WAA colonies. Cherry fruit and <b>cherry</b> <b>stem</b> damage assessments were conducted on four commercial cherry varieties; Ron‟s Seedling, Lewis, Sweet Georgia and Lapin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Food {{contamination}} and spoilage {{is a problem}} causing growing concern. To avoid it, the use of food packaging with appropriate characteristics is essential; ideally, the packaging should protect food from external {{contamination and}} exhibit antibacterial properties. With this aim, methylcellulose (MC) films containing natural extracts from the stems of Ginja cherry, an agricultural by-product, were developed and characterized. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of films was screened by the disc diffusion method and quantified using the viable cell count assay. The films inhibited the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains (Listeria innocua, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli). For the films with lower extract content, effectiveness against the microorganisms depended on the inoculum concentration. Scanning electron microscope images of the films showed that those containing the extracts had a smooth and continuous structure. UV-visible spectroscopy showed that these materials do not transmit light in the UV. CONCLUSION: This study shows that MC films containing agricultural by-products, in this case Ginja <b>cherry</b> <b>stem</b> extract, {{could be used to}} prevent food contamination by relevant bacterial strains and degradation by UV light. Using such materials in food packaging, the shelf life of food products could be extended while utilizing an otherwise wasted by-product. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Preharvest {{gibberellic}} acid-treated California ‘Bing ’ sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.) {{were treated}} with hot water baths (46 – 58 ◦C for 0. 25 – 18 min), followed by hydrocooling. The fruit were then stored to simulate either air shipment or sea shipment to overseas markets, both followed by 15 h of shelf life at 20 ◦C. In separate experiments, cherries were also infested with codling moth larvae and subjected to similar hot water bath heating. The quality attributes showed different sensitivity to the combinations of temperature and time used for hot water bath treatment. Pitting was more common in fruit treated at lower temperatures for longer times, while stem browning was more common in fruit treated at high temperatures. Berry browning, stem color, and pitting were the quality attributes most affected by heat treatment. Browning of <b>cherry</b> <b>stem</b> color was a crucial factor in determining whether a combination of temperature and time for hot water bath treatment was successful. All cherries stored at 0 ◦C for 14 days to simulate sea shipment were of unacceptable quality after shelf life. Hot water bath treatments that provided 100 % codling moth mortality and maintained overall acceptable fruit quality were very limited and included treatments at 50 ◦C for 10 min and at 54 ◦C for 6 min. Delaying the hot water bath treatment after fruit harvest, even if the cherries were kept at 0 ◦C, resulted in a greater loss in fruit quality compared with those treated on the harvest day.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of the}} extracts of stems and leaves of Ginja <b>cherry</b> plant. Both <b>stems</b> and leaves are waste {{in the production of}} the cherry liquor and they could be valorised by extracting valuable compounds, making the process more environmentally sustainable. Methods: The ethanol extracts from both stems and leaves were analysed by LC-ESI/MS to determine the phenolic composition. They were tested against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flavobacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella), using the disk diffusion technique and the broth dilution technique. Results: The extracts showed good antibacterial properties towards Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The values of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) were lower for Gram positive bacteria (10 – 15 mg/ml) than for Gram negative ones (10 – 100 mg/ml). The values of Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 2 and 4 times higher than the MICs. Conclusions: The waste from Ginja cherry plants can be successfully employed to extract valuable compounds such as polyphenols, with antibacterial properties...|$|R
30|$|Farmers {{and land}} {{managers}} are often reluctant to implement AFS due to additional shade cast and subsequent nutrient export {{brought about by}} the culture of trees above annual crops. To date, beneficial or disadvantageous effects of AFS with a focus on the production of valuable wood in middle Europe to carbon and nutrient cycles have not been fully understood. Also different management measures such as pruning or harvesting exert an influence on carbon and nutrient storage and export within AFS, meanwhile, exact figures are still missing. Our idea is that AFS could be planned and managed in a more customised way towards valuable wood production, and carbon storage or nutrient recirculation, if appropriate models would be available. One of the most important valuable tree species, which can be used for the composition of AFS in middle Europe is wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) as it displays a rather fast growth and its timber can be of high value (Spiecker and Spiecker 1988; Balandier and Dupraz 1999; Morhart et al. 2014). Besides, its fruits, flowers and leaves are a food source for numerous animals and microorganisms. Wild cherry is neither a large nor long lived tree, mean dimensions are often quoted as 20 to 30  m in height (Evans 1984; Joyce 1998; Ducci et al. 2013), while diameters at breast height of between 50 and 90  cm are achievable within a 70 or 80  year rotation (Otter 1954; Evans 1984; Spiecker 2006; Ducci et al. 2013). Within published volume tables for wild <b>cherry</b> merchantable <b>stem</b> volumes are suggested to reach over 2  m 3 within a full rotation (Pryor 1988; Röös 1994), or more if radial increment is greater on high productivity sites (Spiecker 1994). Carbon is widely accepted to encompass up to 50  % of total woody biomass (e.g., Fang et al. 2001; Kurz et al. 2009; Pretzsch 2010). Applying such volume tables as a basis, the carbon content can be calculated utilising the density and a general conversion factor as suggested by Pretzsch (2010). This efficient approach has some limitations {{due to the fact that}} the density is acknowledged not only to differ within tree species (Hamilton 1975) and between sites (Maniatis et al. 2011), but is also recognised not to be homogenous throughout a tree (Wassenberg et al. 2015). Additionally, the carbon content is neither the same between tree species nor among tissue types (Thomas and Martin 2012). Furthermore, volume functions usually are not prepared for the prediction of wood with diameters below merchantable timber size.|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the {{invasion}} of black cherry Prunus serotina Ehrh. {{have a long history}} in Western Europe. However, effective methods of eliminating it that do not bear negative side effects for ecosystems have not yet been developed. Mechanical methods are the first choice in environmentally sensitive areas. In this study, we aimed to find answers to the questions: does the application of cutting at a height of 1 m from the ground limit the sprouting capacities of black <b>cherry?</b> And, is <b>stem</b> girdling an effective method of eliminating black cherry? The study was carried out in the Kampinos National Park, on two mixed pine forest plots with undergrowth of black cherry. Three mechanical methods of elimination were applied: cut-stump at the base, cutting at a height of 1 m above the ground and girdling of the stem at a height of ca 1 m above the ground. In both locations, 225 trees were treated, at three different dates corresponding with three different phenological phases of black cherry development. The evaluation of effectiveness of treatments was based on the sprouting capacity of the tree afterwards, which included: the number of generated sprouts, the length of three longest sprouts, dry mass of sprouts, and the assessment of tree survival rate. It was discovered that girdling is a significantly more effective method of control than ground-level cut-stump or cutting at a height of 1 m above the ground in the conditions of central Poland. However, in the season of treatment, even though recurring sprouts were removed, only a part of the girdled trees died (24 % to 54 %). There is a slight difference between the sprouting response of cutting at a height of 1 m above the ground (4 % to 24 % of dead trees) and the basal cut-stump method (0 % of dead trees) ...|$|R
