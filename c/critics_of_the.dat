5|$|Among {{the cities}} {{that have been}} {{proposed}} to house {{the headquarters of the}} United Nations are Saint Petersburg, Montreal, Dubai, Jerusalem, and Nairobi. <b>Critics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relocation say that the idea would be expensive and would also involve the withdrawal of the United States from the organization, and with it much of the agency's funding.

5|$|Datta (2005) shows that, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta examines how writers and <b>critics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data.

MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for <b>critics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis.|$|E
