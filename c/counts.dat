The new {{indictment}} had eight <b>counts.</b> The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth <b>counts</b> charged that Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh <b>counts</b> charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The <b>counts</b> different only {{in the interest of}} the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. <b>Counts</b> four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E

Rather than all cards having a value of +1, 0, or −1, an advanced <b>count</b> might also include card ranks that are <b>counted</b> as +2 and −2, or +0.5 and -0.5.

5|$|After an {{investigation}} that lasted six years and cost $6 million, police laid charges against Croitoru and Andre Gravelle.
