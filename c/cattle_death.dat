So far there have been no documented effects of the species being present in the Great Lakes. However, this bacterium has been linked to liver damage and even death in humans after the contamination of water supplies.

50|$|In <b>cattle,</b> <b>death</b> by acute {{cardiac arrest}} is seen {{following}} drinking {{or some kind}} of exertion. Affected animals will show dyspnoea and arrhythmias before this. There may occasionally be neurological signs such as trembling, twitching and convulsions. Death occurs 4 to 24 hours after ingestion. In rare cases, an animal will survive the initial period only to drop dead months later of heart failure - so-called chronic gifblaar poisoning. On post-mortem, leaves may be found in the rumen, cyanosis may be seen, as well as signs of heart failure - congestion, haemorrhage, and myocardial necrosis (on histopathology). Diagnosis is based on these as well as the presence of gifblaar in the camp, particularly if signs of consumption are seen. Tests can be done for monofluoroacetate in rumen fluid, kidneys and liver.|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) {{causes a}} variety of diseases and is globally distributed. It infects via mucosal epithelium, leading to rapid lytic replication and latent infection, primarily in sensory ganglia.

The bovine immune response to BHV- 1 is rapid, robust, balanced, and long-lasting. The innate immune system {{is the first to}} respond to the infection, with type I interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, killing of infected host cells, and priming of a balanced adaptive immune response.

A total of 28, 629 plants among S. brasiliensis (flower-of-souls, 10, 122) and S. madagascariensis (fireweed, 18, 507) were almost completely eliminated in a two-year period. The number of sheep was kept at 3. 0 stock units/ha, but a variable number of cattle were temporarily stocked according to pasture availability. The major sanitary practice applied to the sheep was anthelmintic administration.

For example, more than 20 % of the humid western and southwestern Ethiopia, which is {{home to more than}} 14 million heads of cattle, is under varying levels of trypanosomosis risk. Our study was, therefore, initiated to document farmers’ perception on trypanosomosis and Sheko’s trypanotolerance character. Our findings showed that trypanosomosis was the most frequently reported cattle disease in the Bench Maji Zone. Accordingly, 76. 7 % of the farmers reported the epidemiological importance of trypanosomosis, and they also noted that trypanosomosis on average accounted for 63. 0 % of annualized <b>cattle</b> <b>death.</b> The reported signs of trypanosomosis and trypanotolerance indicators were consistent with literature reports.

40|$|The cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin is {{produced}} by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum {{in many parts of}} the world. A human poisoning incident occurring at Palm Island, Queensland, Australia in 1979 was subsequently ascribed to cylindrospermopsin. The structure of cylindrospermopsin, a tricyclic guanidinium moiety bridged to hydroxymethyluracil, was deduced in 1992. A number of studies have investigated the acute toxicity of cylindrospermopsin in mice. It is primarily a hepatotoxin with a 24 -hour acute intraperitoneal (IP) LD 50 of 2 mg/kg, a 5 -day acute i. p. LD 50 of 0. 2 mg/kg and a 5 -day acute oral LD 50 of approximately 6 mg/kg. A human health risk assessment using data from longer-term oral dosing studies suggests a guideline value for cylindrospermopsin in drinking water of approximately 10 μg/L. We have recently studied cattle poisonings by cylindrospermopsin and detected the toxin in a number of tissues after necropsy. Concentrations of 1 mg/L or above in drinking water (dose is approximately 50 μg/kg/day) were shown to result in <b>cattle</b> <b>death</b> after short-term exposure (less than 10 days). Oral dosing of mice at levels up to 5 mg/L with cylindrospermopsin in drinking water for 90 days did not produce any significant toxicity. Human health risk assessment based on cattle however, which are much more sensitive to cylindrospermopsin than rodents, would produce a guideline for human drinking water of approximately 0. 05 μg/L. A consideration of reported human poisoning incidents that implicate cylindrospermopsin suggests that humans may also be more sensitive than rodents to this toxin...|$|E

Drought conditions {{are set to}} increase as climate change is increasingly becoming an important threat to food security. In southern Africa, people recently discovered Neorautanenia brachypus (Harms) C. A. Sm., as an important medicinal feed that they now use to help cattle survive drought. N. brachypus was evaluated {{with the aim of}} providing scientific substantiation of peoples’ claims by determining the extent of its use, feed and anthelmintic value, and the ecological characteristics that explain its distribution. Information on characteristics and use of N. brachypus was gathered from focus group discussions and a semi-quantitative survey that employed structured interviews with both closed and open questions. The results showed that N. brachypus is used during drought by 59 % of cattle owners, 14. 5 % do not use it because they have alternative grazing, and 26. 5 % did not know it can be used as cattle feed. Feed value of N. brachypus was evaluated as well as the anthelmintic value in the feeding trials with cattle and goats. N. brachypus contains adequate nutrients to maintain ruminant livestock during a drought. Infected animals fed on N. brachypus ended with less strongyloid worm infection in small ruminants (P < 0. 05) and in large ruminants (P < 0. 01) similar to animals dosed with the conventional recommended drugs. In the natural environment, N. brachypus was more commonly found in eutric vertisols and chromic luvisols than in ferric arenosols and leptosols, more in open spaces than in closed forests and more in cultivated areas than in naturally vegetated areas. It grows in a range of different types of soils and management affects its abundance. Ethnobotanical studies can offer important options on adaptation of human livelihoods to climate change...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), USDA:APHIS:Veterinary Services {{conducted}} a national study of beef production, the Beef Cow/Calf Health and Productivity Audit (CHAPA). This {{study was designed to}} provide both participants and the industry with information on cow/calf health, productivity, and management practices. Data for Part III: Beef Cow/Calf Health & Health Management were collected by federal and state veterinary officers (VMO's) in 18 of the largest cow/calf producing states between January 4 and February 28, 1993. These 18 states represented 70 percent of the U. S. beef cow inventory. Participating producers had five or more beef cows or beef replacement heifers and fifty percent or more of their 1992 calf crop born between January 1 and June 30, 1992. Nearly forty-seven percent of operations removed bulls from the female breeding herd for at least one estrus cycle to manipulate calving dates. Forty-seven percent of operations that purchased, leased, or borrowed bulls semen tested the bulls. Thirty-two percent of operations fed replacement heifers separately {{from the rest of the}} herd. The average per-calf weaning weight of calves weaned in 1992 was 502 pounds; the average value was $ 451. 15. For breeding-age females, the average weight per animal sold was 988 pounds; the average value was $ 549. 44. For breeding-age males, the average weight per animal sold was 1, 494 pounds; the average value was $ 1, 154. 04. The largest single cause of total <b>cattle</b> <b>death</b> loss was calving problems (26 percent of death loss). Two of the top conditions producers believed had a significant economic impact on the cow/calf operation included internal and external parasites. Other such conditions included late reproduction, pinkeye, and calf scours. Operation-level vaccine usage varied by animal class.
