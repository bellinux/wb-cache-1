50|$|When Fiction Lives in Fiction is {{the title}} of a {{significant}} narrative essay written in 1939 by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. Weighing in at something less than three pages in length, Borges explores in his inimitable way the teleological nature of metadocuments in fiction such as, for example, False documents. Amongst the works examined in this essay are William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, with its play-within-a-play, Gustav Meyrink's novel The Golem with its motifs of dreams within dreams within dreams, and the nub of the essay itself, a short review of the then recently published At Swim-Two-Birds by Irish writer Flann O'Brien with its circular daisy <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> writing novels about each other.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a work in}} progress within the ANR project Archaedyn, which concerns the development of an ‘alphabet’ designed to characterize and compare the evolution of the settlement pattern in several French microregions during the Roman period. The ‘alphabet’ is a composite indicator, built from 3 criteria relating to the quantitative, hierarchical and spatial evolution of the settlement pattern. The different combinations of these criteria form the characters of the ‘alphabet’. The evolution of the settlement system of each microregion between two periods can thus be written as a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> It is then possible to compare these ‘signatures’ of the different microregions through time. This indicator has a strong temporal dimension as it is designed in terms of stability/instability with the previous situation. Synthesising the evolutions of the settlement pattern on the long term, it is an efficient tool to identify major types of dynamics...|$|E

For faster processing, QuickRanking does not move data, but stores for each data, where the following data is. To evaluate the effectiveness of QuickRanking, I compared with QuickSort on lists of random data. - Sorting and classification of digital data: QuickSort is more efficient than QuickRanking only on large lists of data. QuickRanking takes the advantage in other cases. Advantage emphasised when the data {{at the beginning of the}} list are already classified, when the list is made up of few different values, or when the minimum or maximum value is often represented. - Sorting and classification of alphanumeric data, or sorting only: QuickRanking is often faster than QuickSort. Advantage emphasised on the processing <b>of</b> large <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Conclusion: ideally random list or highly classified list, large data or reduced size data, numeric or alphanumeric data, the reality is often between these extremes.

40|$|One of {{the useful}} tools for {{analyzing}} {{the mechanism of}} narratives, especially folk tales, is the method of Todorov. This method {{has been used for}} analyzing mythical narratives. Todorov considered different aspects of these stories and in doing so he divided their various speech parts into the categories of noun, adjective and verb. Thus by analyzing narratives we can gain formal units which resemble various parts of grammar. This paper studies speech parts in âJoneyd-namehâ and tries to understand reciprocal relations between âJoneyd-namehâ characters. To achieve this aim, first it explains Todorovâs theory of speech parts. Then speech parts like noun (character), verb (treatment) and adjective (property) are considered in âJoneyd-namehâ and, finally, the relation <b>of</b> each <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the story is analyzed with regard to these parts. The study of this property contributes {{to our understanding of the}} organization of narrative as well as the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> relationships between <b>characters</b> on which the story is based...|$|R
40|$|Arce, GonzaloThe grow {{of smart}} phone and mobile devices market, {{has created a}} new set of {{opportunities}} for companies to develop new publicity strategies. In particular the association of printed materials with online content is increasingly used. One of the most widespread forms of engaging mobile users from printed materials is based on the use of QR codes, which have been adopted for many different applications such as accessing web sites or downloading premium content. QR Codes are a very reliable and convenient way to introduce textual information into mobile devices without the hassle <b>of</b> typing complicated <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> These applications are outside of the original functional purpose for which these codes were designed in the auto part industry and other considerations besides robustness and speed of decoding have become increasingly important. The problem related to QR code integration into billboards and printed materials presents and important and interesting design challenge since this integration pursue two conflicting objectives: the improvement of visual appearance and the maximization of decoding robustness. This thesis focuses on the development of algorithmic techniques for embedding QR codes into logos or images in order to make them visually appealing to the user while maintaining acceptable decoding robustness. In contrast to previous approaches the methods presented here allows to automatically embed QR codes into color, gray scale or binary images with bounded probability of detection error and minimal intervention of the user. These embeddings are designed to be compatible with standard decoding applications and can be applied to any color or gray scale image with full area coverage. The embedding problem is solved by the integration of different halftoning and visual quality assessment techniques with numerical optimizations specially tailored for each problem. A model of the probability of error at the QR detector is developed and then used in the optimization to yield the best possible combination of transformation parameters for each particular image.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Ensuring {{that all}} cancer {{patients}} {{have access to}} the appropriate treatment within an appropriate time is a strategic priority in many countries. There is in particular a need to describe and analyse cancer care trajectories and to produce waiting time indicators. We developed an algorithm for extracting temporally represented care trajectories from coded information collected routinely by the general cancer Registry in Poitou-Charentes region, France. The present work aimed to assess the performance of this algorithm on real-life patient data in the setting of non-metastatic breast cancer, using measures of similarity. METHODS: Care trajectories were modeled as ordered dated events aggregated into states, the granularity of which was defined from standard care guidelines. The algorithm generates each state from the aggregation over a period of tracer events characterised on the basis of diagnoses and medical procedures. The sequences are presented in simple form showing presence and order of the states, and in an extended form that integrates the duration of the states. The similarity of the sequences, which are represented in the form <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters,</b> was calculated using a generalised Levenshtein distance. RESULTS: The evaluation was performed on a sample of 159 female patients whose itineraries were also calculated manually from medical records using the same aggregation rules and dating system as the algorithm. Ninety-eight per cent of the trajectories were correctly reconstructed with respect to the ordering of states. When the duration of states was taken into account, 94 % of the trajectories matched reality within three days. Dissimilarities between sequences were mainly due to the absence of certain pathology reports and to coding anomalies in hospitalisation data. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the ability of an integrated regional information system to formalise care trajectories and automatically produce indicators for time-lapse to care instatement, of interest in the planning of care in cancer. The next step will consist in evaluating this approach and extending it to more complex trajectories (metastasis, relapse) and to other cancer localisations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{syntactic}} approach for character recognition using approximate string matching and <b>chain</b> coding <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Here we deal only with the classification <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and not on other phase <b>of</b> the <b>character</b> recognition process in a Optical character Recognition. The character image is first normalized to a specified size then by boundary detection process we detect the boundary <b>of</b> the <b>character</b> image. The character now converted to boundary curve representation <b>of</b> the <b>characters.</b> Then the curve is encoded to a sequence of numbers using Freeman chain coding. The coding scheme gives a sequence of numbers ranges from 0 to 7. Now the characters are in form of strings. For training set we will get a set of strings which is stored in the trie. The extracted unclassified character is also converted to string and searched in the trie. As {{we are dealing with}} the character which can be of different orientation so the searching is done with approximate string matching to support noisy <b>character</b> that <b>of</b> different orientation. For approximate string matching we use Look Ahead Branch and Bound scheme to prune path and make the approximation accurate and efficient.
