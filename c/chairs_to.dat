5|$|After the war, Emeco {{started selling}} 1006 <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> prisons, {{hospitals}} and government offices. The chair {{was sold to}} restaurants in the 1980s and 1990s, under Jay Buchbinder's leadership, then as a designer chair in the 2000s after Emeco was acquired by his son, Gregg. French designer Philippe Starck designed a total of 14 chairs and 4 tables for Emeco.|$|E
5|$|Next was the World Tag Team Championship {{match between}} the {{defending}} champions Rated-RKO and D-Generation X (DX). During the match, Triple H did a spinebuster on Orton and injured his right leg. The match ended when Michaels hit the referee and then assaulted Rated-RKO with a chair. DX used steel <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> beat down Rated-RKO. After the match, DX brutalized Rated-RKO {{and left them}} a bloody mess on the announcers' tables. Triple H gave Edge a Pedigree on the announce table, and Shawn Michaels did the diving elbow drop on Randy Orton through the Spanish announce table.|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Killarney {{arrived in}} Bangkok on April 26. How {{they would be}} received was speculative, since Hawaii had no treaty with Siam. Upon arrival, they were carried aboard a royal yacht up the Menam River to Bangkok. From there, they were carried on silk <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the many}} palaces in Bangkok for the duration of their visit. The following day they met with King Chulalongkorn who told Kalākaua that the Siamese and Native Hawaiians were related by the common Malayan bloodline. A member of the Siamese royal family escorted Kalākaua to see the nation's famed white elephants.|$|E

5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline angle, Rated-RKO {{attacked}} Ric Flair {{with steel}} <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> enrage DX on November 27. At New Year's Revolution in January 2007, Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. At Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match {{with a time of}} 44:02 and eliminated 5 men and made it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels, With Triple H out of action, the team continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels. Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29, 2007. Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months, In April 2007, Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt Hardy threw him onto a ladder and encouraged Jeff Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) ladder, and drove him through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge & himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers. After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship. Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship, and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash in April.|$|E

25|$|When Dziekański {{left the}} Customs hall, he became visibly agitated. Bystanders and airport {{security}} guards {{were unable to}} communicate with him {{because he did not}} speak English.

25|$|In 1932, Olive Smith-Dorrien {{was named}} {{principal}} of the Royal School of Needlework (RSN). In 1937, the RSN worked on the Queen's Train (Coronation Robe), canopy and the two <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> be used in Westminster Abbey during the Coronation. She was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal for work done. During the Second World War, she led the RSN in collecting lace which was sold for the war effort. She revived the manufacture of hospital bags. She died on 15 September 1951.|$|E
25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E

25|$|In May 2015, WWH {{opened its}} {{state-of-the-art}} medical home at 1525 14th Street, NW. In comparison to Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, the 42,000 square foot building doubled exam room space to 28, tripled dental <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> nine and {{allowed for a}} street-facing pharmacy open to the whole community. With services spread over seven floors, the building (dubbed “1525”) houses primary medical care, dental care, behavioral health, legal services, wellness programs, and HIV counseling and testing. Administration staff continues to work out of Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center, and some programs continue to be housed there.|$|E
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|E
25|$|During {{the main}} {{fundraising}} campaign {{to build the}} organization's endowment fund, which launched in October 1921, the Wilson Foundation named chairs for each state to coordinate fundraising activities on a state basis. These, in turn, named county <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> help localize fundraising activity. This system was roughly analogous to the wartime sales of Liberty bonds, which made similar use of formal state and local officers to coordinate sales. By the end of September 1921, chair of the National Executive Committee Cleveland Dodge boasted that 37 of the 48 American states had been organized on such a basis. Three more states were organized {{in the first half}} of October, running the total to 40.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s rolled T-shaped (or single-flanged T {{parallel}} rail) and I-shaped (or double-flanged T parallel or bullhead) rails were introduced; both required cast-iron <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> support them. Originally, iron keys {{were used}} to wedge the rail into the vertical parallel jaws of the chair; these were superseded by entirely wooden keys. The wooden keys were formed from oak, steam softened and then compressed with hydraulic presses and stored in a drying house. When inserted into the chair, exposure to the wet atmosphere caused the key to expand, firmly holding the rail. The wedge {{may be on the}} inside or outside of the rail. In Britain they were usually on the outside.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history, {{access to}} the Western Wall has been limited by the {{controlling}} political power of the time. Under the British Mandate, Jews {{were not allowed to}} bring <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> the Kotel, nor could they put up a mechitza in order to separate between men and women and conduct traditional services. After the Kotel's capture from the Kingdom of Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967, part of the southern area next to the Kotel was cleared of abandoned Arab homes that had all but hid the place, and traditional worship was restored. Women of the Wall have been criticized as unwitting allies in ignoring the destruction of these homes and in supporting the Wall as a symbol of Israeli nationalism. Most of the Western wall runs the length of East Jerusalem, with the Temple Mount to the east and dwellings to the west.|$|E
25|$|An {{adaptation}} of the seal of the Order of St. Augustine, the seal of Villanova University {{is one of the}} campus's most ubiquitous images, adorning everything from buildings to <b>chairs</b> <b>to</b> backpacks. A ribbon carries the University motto: Veritas, Unitas, Caritas (Truth, Unity, and Charity), virtues to which every member of the Villanova community should aspire. A book symbolizes Augustine's dedication to education and the New Testament where he found Christianity. A cincture is part of the habit worn by members of the Order of Saint Augustine. Hovering above is the flaming heart, symbol of Augustine's search for God and his love of neighbors. Behind the book is the crosier – a staff traditionally held by a Bishop – commemorating Augustine's service as Bishop of Hippo. Above and behind the book are two crosses, symbolic of Augustine's conversion and the University's commitment to Christianity. Framing the central portion of the seal is a laurel wreath exemplifying victory through the pursuit of knowledge, and 1842 is the year of the University's founding. Surrounding the seal is the incorporated fide of the University: Universitas Villanova In Statu Pennsylvaniae.|$|E
