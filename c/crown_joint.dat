Little is known of Lothair's early life, which was {{probably}} passed at the court of his grandfather Charlemagne. In 814, the elderly Charlemagne died, and left his son Louis the Pious his vast empire. The next year, Lothair was sent to govern Bavaria in 815 for his father Louis the Pious. In 817, Louis the Pious drew up his Ordinatio Imperii. In this, Louis designated Lothair as his principal heir and ordered that Lothair would be the overlord of Louis' younger sons Pippin of Aquitaine and Louis the German, as well as his nephew Bernard of Italy. Lothair would also inherit their lands if they were to die childless. Lothair was then <b>crowned</b> <b>joint</b> emperor by his father at Aachen. At the same time, Aquitaine and Bavaria were granted to his brothers Pippin and Louis, respectively, as subsidiary kingdoms.

50|$|Like Mussorgsky's earlier Boris Godunov, Khovanshchina {{deals with}} an episode in Russian history, first {{brought to the}} composer's {{attention}} by his friend the critic Vladimir Stasov. It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the two young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V, who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. Khovansky had helped to foment the Moscow Uprising of 1682, which resulted in Sofia becoming regent on behalf of her younger brother Ivan and half-brother Peter, who were <b>crowned</b> <b>joint</b> Tsars. In the fall of 1682 Prince Ivan Khovansky turned against Sofia. Supported by the Old Believers and the Streltsy, Khovansky — who supposedly wanted to install himself as the new regent — demanded the reversal of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. Sofia and her court were forced to flee Moscow. Eventually, Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair) {{with the help of}} the diplomat Fyodor Shaklovity, who succeeded Khovansky as leader of the Muscovite Streltsy. With the rebellion crushed, the Old Believers committed mass suicide (in the opera, at least).|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} design of turbine blades aims at verifying the structural integrity against High Cycle Fatigue damage. For this reason Forced Response are simulated {{in order to}} evaluate the distribution of variable stress in the blade. One of the main parameter affecting {{the level of the}} response is the structural and the mechanical damping. When resonant excitation can not be avoided in service the second source of damping is enhanced by the design of friction joints which can limit the amount of oscillation due to the dissipation of energy caused by the slip of contact surfaces. One of the typical feature in a blade that is a source of damping is the blade root attached to the slot of the rim of the disk. Despite the relatively low value of the damping introduced by the blade root joint, it can reach the same order of magnitude of the structural damping. In order to increase its effectiveness, different geometries of blade root joints are usually adopted (fir tree, dovetail) and optimized according to the operating conditions of the bladed disk. In this paper a test campaign is presented in order to collect a database of measurements of the damping introduced by two different geometry of blade root joints: dovetail <b>joint</b> and the <b>crowned</b> <b>joint.</b> The test rig is first described together with the excitation system and the measurement system. Due to the low amount of damping that must be measured, both systems are non-contact {{in order to avoid the}} introduction of any spurious damping. The excitation system is provided by a an electromagnet facing the dummy blade carrying the real geometry of the root attachment. Commissioning of the exciter and of the measurement system is described and discussed in order to define the fastest and most reliable Forced Response measurement, including issues like the heating of the dummy blade and the calibration of the electromagnetic exciter. The test campaign shows the effectiveness of the two geometries at a different level of pulling loads simulating the centrifugal force and different amplitude of the exciting forc...|$|R

40|$|Calcium {{pyrophosphate}} deposition (CPPD) {{disease is}} an arthropathy caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal deposits in articular tissues, most commonly fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage. According to EULAR, four different clinical presentations can be observed: 1) asymptomatic CPPD; 2) osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD; 3) acute CPP crystal arthritis; 4) chronic CPP inflammatory crystal arthritis. Acute CPP crystal arthritis {{is characterized by}} sudden onset of pain, swelling and tenderness with overlying erythema, usually in a large joint, most often the knee, wrist, shoulder, and hip. Occasionally, ligaments, tendons, bursae, bone and the spine can be involved. CPPD of the atlanto-occipital <b>joint</b> (<b>crowned</b> dens syndrome) can cause periodic acute cervico-occipital pain with fever, neck stiffness and laboratory inflammatory syndrome. Chronic inflammatory arthritis is characterized by joint swelling, morning stiffness, pain, and high ESR and CRP. The relationship between OA and CPPD is still unclear. The main problem is whether such crystals are {{directly involved in the}} pathogenesis of OA or if they are the result of joint degeneration. Diagnosis is based on evaluation of history and clinical features, conventional radiology, and synovial fluid examination. Non-polarized light microscopy should be used initially to screen for CPPD crystals based upon their characteristic morphology, and compensated polarized light microscopy, showing the crystals to be weakly positive birefringent, is recommended for definitive identification, although this last pattern only occurs in about 20 % of samples.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the modern history {{of money and}} finance in Congo from 1885 to 1995, {{against a background of}} pre-colonial traditional monetary practices observed since the 15 th century and still in use today in some regions of the Congo basin within the current Democratic Republic of the Congo. The work makes use of historical research methods and is aimed, firstly, at interpreting the survival of the pre-colonial monetary tradition and its influence on the Congolese modern monetary and financial systems and, secondly, at explaining major monetary and financial developments that have occurred in Congo since 1885. First of all this study explores a series of devices that were used as money in the ancient Kingdom of Congo (13 th- 17 th century). Two devices used as currency in the Kingdom of Congo - the nzimbu, a seashell as small as a coffee bean, and the lubongo, a small mat made of raffia fibre - are analysed. Mbongo, the common term for money or wealth in today's Congolese languages, derives from lubongo. The mitako, a brass rod of different lengths, which was granted the quality of legal tender by the authorities of the Congo Free State (1885 - 1908) in 1886, alongside the state currency, is explored in the process of introducing modern currencies in Congo. New light is shed on some controversial issues, such as the origin and genuine identity of the nzimbu. Also explained are the significance and limits of the monetary functions of devices used for these purposes in traditional communities accustomed to essentially barter-based mechanisms of exchange. Secondly the study addresses monetary and financial provisions set up for the Congo Free State, and analyses the six main strands of King Leopold IPs financial and development policy: (1) designation of non-occupied lands as State property; (2) setting up of a vast royal property as Crown land for the purpose of generating income for the King; (3) granting of concessions to various companies, in which the King took substantial shareholdings; (4) regime of labour-tax intended to ensure a sufficient workforce for both the State land and <b>Crown</b> land; (5) <b>joint</b> ventures with private businesses to carry out investments that required large amounts of capital; (6) placing trade activities under an absolute State monopoly. Thirdly, exploring the colonial period (1908 - 1960), the study demonstrates that depending on what was at stake, the Belgian colonial power addressed Congolese monetary and financial issues regardless of the legal separation established by the 1908 Charte Coloniale (Colonial Charter) between Belgium and its Colony as two distinct entities. Lastly the major political events that occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo {{from the start of the}} 1960 s onwards resulted in a very high cost for the country in terms of waste of resources and inflation, among other adverse effects. The Congolese monetary and financial crises that started in 1960 were a consequence of irrelevant and inefficient policies combined with a lack of long-term vision in the management of public affairs. The monetary and financial developments of the early 1990 s onwards were characterised by political imbroglio and hyperinflation that undermined people's trust in the national money. This study recommends further research on a number of issues, such as the use of foreign currencies in the economy that resulted from this mistrust, the development of street money markets and the coexistence of different monetary zones in the same country.
