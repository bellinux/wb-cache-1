The introduction of ZrO 2 particles strengthened the interface intensity of grain boundary.

40|$|Supersonic {{motion of}} {{dislocation}} in solids {{is a topic}} of hot current research endeavor. The approach is mostly based on molecular dynamics and computer simulation. There is concurring evidence that dislocations cross the shear wave speed barrier, in particular under shock loading condition. Here the analytic solution is presented for a dislocation, both screw and edge, accelerating through the shear-wave speed barrier. The analysis is based on solution for general motion of a Volterra dislocation, obtained and evaluated at the instant when the velocity of the dislocation {{is equal to the}} shear-wave speed, but acceleration is present. At this transition, the Mach wave cone is starting to form and the roots of the function that defines the interval of the dislocation motion the wavelets from which contribute to the wave-front change from complex conjugate to real, and the coefficient of the delta function of the stress at the forming Mach wave cone is logarithmic-over-square-root singular. While the step discontinuity of the displacement of a Volterra dislocation is too strong of a dislocation model for the <b>crystal</b> <b>dislocation,</b> the solution is useful because it is the kernel for a variable core model, which removes the singularity as shown here.

40|$|Atomic-scale {{computer}} simulation {{is used to}} investigate the interaction of a moving 1012 twin boundary in a hcp metal with either a straight 1 / 3 (0001) dislocation lying perpendicular to the direction of twinning shear or a periodic row of perfect dislocation loops. The screw dislocation does not decompose in the moving interface and {{has no effect on}} its motion. The 60 º -mixed dislocation is attracted by the boundary and decomposes into twinning dislocations and a disconnection (an interfacial defect with both step and dislocation character) : the sign of the <b>crystal</b> <b>dislocation</b> determines the form of the disconnection and, thus, its effect on twin boundary motion. Boundary reactions with crystal dislocations are likely to be important for assisting the twinning process. Loops with Burgers vector,b, parallel to the interface are reformed in the other crystal after the twin boundary has passed through. The boundary attracts both interstitial and vacancy dislocation loops with inclined b, but is not transparent to them because the complete loop is swept along its glide prism by the moving interface. Depending on its nature, a loop either retains its structure in its parent crystal or is absorbed in the interface. The decomposition product in the latter case is consistent with the reactions of straight dislocations. The results indicate that twinning is efficient at sweeping loops from the microstructure when their density is low and is suppressed by loops when their density is high.

The exposition is elementary and self-contained. ‘‘Le discese ardite e le risalite su nel cielo aperto e poi giù il deserto e poi ancora in alto con un grande salto [...] . ’’ (Lucio Battisti, ‘‘Io vorrei [...] . non vorrei [...] . ma se vuoi [...] . ’’) The purpose of this note, which is mainly pedagogical, is to show in a simple, concrete example how singular integrals naturally arise as a continuous limit of discrete, long jump random walks, and to recall a simple description of the integral kernels {{in terms of the}} Fourier multipliers. Singular integrals and nonlocal (especially fractional) operators are a classical topic in harmonic analysis and operator theory [Lan 72, Ste 70] and they are now becoming impressively fashionable because of their connection with many real-world phenomena.

40|$|The {{study of}} defects {{especially}} dislocations and grain boundaries in semiconductors {{has received a}} great deal of attention for over 60 years, primarily due to the importance of the defects in microelectronics. The defect sources and their properties are therefore fairly well understood and can be avoided. However, growth of silicon crystals free from dislocations for example, is expensive following the requirements, i. e. the use of very pure silicon materials and the use of high energy consumption crystal growth techniques. Defect level requirements are less stringent on materials for solar cell applications, and most importantly, lowering costs on materials and processes is essential for sustainability and for the contribution of the energy generated from solar cells to be substantial. New materials and new processes have been developed or are being developed with defects and defect properties that are not yet well understood. Continued efforts for understanding these defects are therefore necessary. This thesis is based on microstructure investigations of the defects, particularly grain boundaries, dislocations and stacking faults in standard multicrystalline silicon for solar cells and is primarily aimed at understanding the formation and multiplication mechanism of dislocations. Investigation of the microstructure of dislocations in the clusters show that the dislocations are in polygonised structures forming walls normal to the glide plane and assuming line directions in near-most possible normal to the surface. These results are in accordance to the recovery process at high temperature where the dislocations acquire lower energy configurations, for minimization of the elastic strain energy of the <b>crystal.</b> <b>Dislocation</b> generation and multiplication processes in directionally solidified industrial multicrystalline silicon for solar cells are therefore most likely occurring at temperatures close to the melting point. Dislocation density reduction by high temperature annealing of as-grown industrial multicrystalline silicon may therefore be difficult and expensive. In addition to the general high-angle grain boundaries which are generally known to be sources of dislocations and to form barriers to dislocation glide, sub grain boundaries with misorientation < 5 ° as well as stacking faults appear to generate dislocations and to form barriers to dislocation glide as well. These sources appear to be operational during the ingot cooling stage as well, which makes annihilation and re-arrangement difficult following existence of stable configurations of grain boundaries, stacking faults and dislocations generated at higher temperature PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging {{is widely}} used in {{clinical}} practice for disease diagnosis, patient follow-up, therapy evaluation and human brain mapping. In order to extract useful information from MR images, image registration and image segmentation are two crucial procedures in practice. Image registration is {{necessary in order to}} compare or combine information obtained from different images. Image segmentation is commonly used to extract more meaningful representation of an image for analysis. In medical image analysis, the two processes are not independent but closely related to each other. Due to some image artifacts introduced in the imaging stage, automatic segmentation relying on the segmenting image alone is still challenging for brain MR images. Therefore, registration-based segmentation is essential and commonly applied for simplifying the segmentation task. In this thesis, we make contributions in both image registration and registration-based segmentation areas. In the first part, we propose a novel image registration method derived from a physics model, i. e., the <b>crystal</b> <b>dislocation</b> model. An analogy is made between the registration process and the dislocation system in physics, and thus an elastic interaction between the reference image and the moving image is derived to drive the registration process. It is proved that the proposed registration method not only can improve the registration accuracy, but also achieve a high convergence rate in the optimization procedure. In the second part, we focus on improving the performance of registration-based segmentation. In registration-based segmentation methods, the target image is segmented through registering the atlas image to the target image and transforming the atlas tissue labels to the target image. An atlas is defined as the combination of an intensity image and its pre-segmented image. We first propose a new way for atlas construction from a population of subjects. It is proposed to divide the whole population into several subgroups and a newly designed tissue-wise weighted groupwise registration method is implemented to produce atlas for each subgroup. The new atlas construction scheme is evaluated through using the constructed atlas(es) for segmentation. It is experimentally validated that our method outperforms other conventional ways for building the atlas. The second contribution in registration-based segmentation is that a new concept, i. e., atlas-guided groupwise segmentation, is proposed. Groupwise segmentation uses one single atlas image as guidance to segment a population of target images simultaneously. It is developed based on a Markov Random Field (MRF) deformation model to impose the consistency constraints among the population of target images and to embed the prior shape information of the atlas. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed groupwise segmentation method can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art registration-based segmentation methods...|$|E
