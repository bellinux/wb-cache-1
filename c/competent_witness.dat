He did not run away at first, but staid in the neighborhood for a day or two, coming up sometimes to the feed trough even; but on the approach of the teamster he always got out of the way. At last, growing tired of the constant effort to catch him, he disappeared altogether. Nothing short of a Mexican with his lasso could have caught him. Regulations would not have warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lasso to catch that mule; but they did allow the expenditure [...] "of the mule," [...] on a certificate that he had run away without any fault of the quartermaster on whose returns he was borne, and also the purchase of another to take his place.

60|$|Whilst Egypt abounded with Monks above {{any other}} country, the veneration of the Saints began sooner, and spred faster there {{than in other}} places. Palladius going into Egypt in the year 388 to visit the Monasteries, and the sepulchres of Apollonius and other Martyrs of Thebais who had {{suffered}} under Maximinus, saith of them: Iis omnibus Christiani fecerunt ædem unam, ubi nunc multæ virtutes peraguntur. Tanta autem fuit viri gratia, ut de iis quæ esset precatus statim exaudiretur, eum sic honorante servatore: quem etiam nos in martyrio precati vidimus, cum iis qui cum ipso fuerunt martyrio affecti; & Deum adorantes, eorum corpora salutavimus. Eunapius also, a heathen, yet a <b>competent</b> <b>witness</b> of what was done in his own times, relating how the soldiers delivered the temples of Egypt {{into the hands of}} the Monks, which was done in the year 389, rails thus in an impious manner at the Martyrs, as succeeding in the room of the old Gods of Egypt. Illi ipsi, milites, Monachos Canobi quoque collocârunt, ut pro Diis qui animo cernuntur, servos & quidem flagitiosos divinis honoribus percolerent, hominum mentibus ad cultum ceremoniasque obligatis. Ii namque condita & salita eorum capita, qui ob scelerum multitudinem à judicibus extremo judicio fuerant affecti, pro Divis ostentabant; iis genua submittebant, eos in Deorum numerum receptabant, ad illorum sepulchra pulvere sordibusque conspurcati. Martyres igitur vocabantur, & ministri quidem & legati arbitrique precum apud Deos; cum fuerint servilia infida & flagris pessimè subacta, quæ cicatrices scelerum ac nequitiæ vestigia corporibus circumferunt; ejusmodi tamen Deos fert tellus. By these instances we may understand the invocation of Saints was now of some standing in Egypt, and that it was already generally received and practised there by the common people.|$|E
6000|$|In {{my opinion}} {{the courage of}} the {{minister}} was the most wonderful part of the transaction, especially as he must have read, or rather the right honorable gentleman says he has read for him, whole volumes upon the subject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part so numerous as the right honorable gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order to frighten you from inquiry; but in these volumes, such as they are, the minister must have found a full authority for a suspicion (at the very least) of everything relative to the great fortunes made at Madras. What is that authority? Why, no other than the standing authority for all the claims which the ministry has thought fit to provide for,--the grand debtor,--the Nabob of Arcot himself. Hear that prince, in the letter written to the Court of Directors, at the precise period whilst {{the main body of}} these debts were contracting. In his letter he states himself to be, what undoubtedly he is, a most <b>competent</b> <b>witness</b> to this point. After speaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of other measures which he censures, (whether right or wrong it signifies nothing,) and into which he says he had been led by the Company's servants, he proceeds in this manner:--"If all these things were against the real interests of the Company, they are ten thousand times more against mine, and against the prosperity of my country and the happiness of my people; for your interests and mine are the same. What were they owing to, then? To the private views of a few individuals, who have enriched themselves at the expense of your influence and of my country: for your servants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY, neither do you pay them high wages; yet in a few years they return to England with many lacs of pagodas. How can you or I account for such immense fortunes acquired in so short a time, without any visible means of getting them?" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} provide a fresh evaluation of a testimony in general and {{an evaluation of the}} weight of woman's testimony in particular. By using an empirical methodology, the research responds to the equality issue between women and men as <b>competent</b> <b>witnesses,</b> as Western jurisprudence claims, and the issue of non-equality between women and men as <b>competent</b> <b>witnesses,</b> as Islamic Sharia scholars claim. This study found numerous results, one of which was that womanhood affects a woman's ability to bear in mind a witnessed fact. Therefore, womanhood should be dealt with as a discrediting her testimony factor. Another result was that woman's testimony is admissible, even if she was alone; because womanhood is a factor relating to the weight of a testimony not a stipulation for the admissibility of testimony. Moreover, the research classified testimony in regard to its weight into two kinds. The first kind is Attestation, which always requires corroboration from a man or woman to renders it admissible as evidence. The second kind is Testimony, which does not generally require corroboration, even if the witness is a woman. However, corroboration may be necessary if the testimony has been affected by any discrediting factor regardless the sex of the witness. One more result of the research was that corroboration for testimony is affected by womanhood in certain cases, can be attained by summoning another woman as a witness, inferring factual presumptions, or examining the surrounding circumstances...|$|R
6000|$|This last {{purchase}} {{was made}} {{by a man named}} Stevens on behalf of General Fremont, who at that time commanded the army of the United States in Missouri. Stevens had been employed by General Fremont as an agent on the behalf of government, as is shown with clearness in the report, and on hearing of these muskets telegraphed to the general at once: [...] "I have 5000 Hall's rifled cast-steel muskets, breach-loading, new, at 22 dollars." [...] General Fremont telegraphed back instantly: [...] "I will take the whole 5000 carbines. [...] . I will pay all extra charges." [...] . And so the purchase was made. The muskets, it seems, were not absolutely useless even as weapons of war. [...] "Considering the emergency of the times?" [...] a <b>competent</b> <b>witness</b> considered them to be worth [...] "10 or 12 dollars." [...] The government had been as much cheated in selling them as it had in buying them. But the nature of the latter transaction is shown by the facts that Stevens was employed, though irresponsibly employed, as a government agent by General Fremont; that he bought the muskets in that character himself, making on the transaction 1l. 18s. on each musket; and that the same man afterward appeared as an aid-de-camp on General Fremont's staff. General Fremont had no authority himself to make such a purchase, and when the money was paid for the first installment of the arms, it was so paid by the special order of General Fremont himself out of moneys intended to be applied to other purposes. The money was actually paid to a gentleman known at Fremont's headquarters as his special friend, and was then paid in that irregular way because this friend desired that that special bill should receive immediate payment. After that, who can believe that Stevens was himself allowed to pocket the whole amount of the plunder? ...|$|E
60|$|But if the Judge {{continues}} {{to put forward}} the declaration {{that there is an}} unholy and unnatural alliance between the Republicans and the National Democrats, I now want to enter my protest against receiving him as an entirely <b>competent</b> <b>witness</b> upon that subject. I want to call to the Judge's attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these debates, at Ottawa, on the 21st of August. In order to fix extreme Abolitionism upon me, Judge Douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had been passed by a Republican State Convention, in October, 1854, at Springfield, Illinois, and he declared I had taken part in that Convention. It turned out that although a few men calling themselves an anti-Nebraska State Convention had sat at Springfield about that time, yet neither did I take any part in it, nor did it pass the resolutions or any such resolutions as Judge Douglas read. So apparent had it become that the resolutions which he read had not been passed at Springfield at all, nor by a State Convention in which I had taken part, that seven days afterward, at Freeport, Judge Douglas declared that he had been misled by Charles H. Lanphier, editor of the State Register, and Thomas L. Harris, member of Congress in that district, and he promised in that speech that when he went to Springfield he would investigate the matter. Since then Judge Douglas has been to Springfield, and I presume has made the investigation; but a month has passed since he has been there, and, so far as I know, he has made no report of the result of his investigation. I have waited as I think sufficient time for the report of that investigation, and I have some curiosity to see and hear it. A fraud, an absolute forgery was committed, and the perpetration of it was traced to the three,--Lanphier, Harris, and Douglas. Whether it can be narrowed in any way so as to exonerate any one of them, is what Judge Douglas's report would probably show.|$|E

Significant levels of violence were found in both schools and homes. The study also showed the need for special attention for the protection of boys.
