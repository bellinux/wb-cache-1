5|$|Sonic & Knuckles was {{developed}} at the Sega Technical Institute by members of Sonic Team in the United States. It and Sonic 3 were originally planned as a single game; due to time constraints and the prohibitively expensive manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cartridge with more memory, Sega split the game in half, with Sonic & Knuckles as {{the second part of}} the Sonic 3 story.|$|E
5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset {{a significant proportion}} of the economy-wide social <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The cartridge has {{a small amount of}} non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge. Sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia grossed over $300,000 in {{the first}} sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount {{in the first}} ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3 million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in {{production}} and installation <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single Fantasound setup, along with theatres having to be leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source {{of as much as}} forty-five per cent of the studio's income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film's distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{announcement}} of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly {{unable or unwilling}} to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period as may Castle Greg in West Lothian, which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby Pentlands, from the Forth to the Clyde Valley.|$|E
5|$|The period {{also saw}} the rise of piracy across the Eastern Mediterranean. Pirate {{activity}} was high in the Aegean, while pirate captains frequently offering themselves as mercenaries to {{one or the other}} of the region's powers, providing for the latter a quick and cheap way of raising a fleet for particular expeditions, without the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standing navy. Thus a Byzantine fleet of 66 vessels sent by Isaac II to recapture Cyprus from Isaac Komnenos was destroyed by the pirate Margaritus of Brindisi, who was in the employ of the Normans of Sicily. The depredations of the pirates, especially the Genoese captain Kaphoures, described by Niketas Choniates and his brother, the Metropolitan of Athens Michael Choniates, finally forced the Angeloi to action. The fleet tax was once again levied from the coastal regions and a navy of 30 ships was equipped, which was entrusted to the Calabrian pirate Steiriones. Despite scoring a few early successes, Steiriones' fleet was destroyed in a surprise attack by Kaphoures off Sestos. A second fleet, augmented by Pisan vessels and again commanded by Steiriones, was finally able to defeat Kaphoures and end his raids.|$|E
