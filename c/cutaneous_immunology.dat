40|$|The skin {{provides}} {{the first line}} defense {{of the human body}} against injury and infection. By integrating recent findings in <b>cutaneous</b> <b>immunology</b> with fundamental concepts of skin biology, we portray the skin as a multitasking organ ensuring body homeostasis. Crosstalk between the skin and its microbial environment is also highlighted as influencing the response to injury, infection, and autoimmunity. The importance of the skin immune network is emphasized by the identification of several skin-resident cell subsets, each with its unique functions. Lessons learned from targeted therapy in inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, provide further insights into skin immune function. Finally, we look at the skin as an interacting network of immune signaling pathways exemplified by the development of a disease interactome for psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|A {{substantial}} part of ongoing research in experimental dermatology focuses on skin T cellsfor that reason, we find important to highlight the pioneering work of Jan D. Bos et al. from 1987 (The skin immune system (SIS) : Distribution and immunophenotype of lymphocyte subpopulations in normal skin) [URL] ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/ 3494791. This key article sets the record straight, once and for all, {{about the presence of}} lymphocytes in healthy skin, characterized the immunophenotypes of subpopulations, quantified these cells and studied their location. It was perhaps the critical discoveries made by Bos et al. that fuelled the scientific community's interest in skin lymphocytes, contributing to a new generation of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>immunology</b> research. We briefly describe additional scientific breakthroughs made since 1987. Nonetheless, the study of cutaneous lymphocytes remains essential to understand the relationship of these cells to human diseases and to develop therapies that can be leveraged to selectively mobilize, enhance or deplete these cell...|$|E
40|$|Langerhans cells (LC) are {{a unique}} {{population}} of tissue-resident macrophages that form {{a network of}} cells across the epidermis of the skin, but which {{have the ability to}} migrate from the epidermis to draining lymph nodes (LN). Their location at the skin barrier suggests a key role as immune sentinels. However, despite decades of research, the role of LC in skin immunity is unclear; ablation of LC results in neither fatal susceptibility to skin infection nor overt autoimmunity due to lack of immune regulation. Our understanding of immune processes has traditionally been centered on secondary lymphoid organs as sites of lymphocyte priming and differentiation, which is exemplified by LC, initially defined as a paradigm for tissue dendritic cells that migrate to draining LN on maturation. But, more recently, an awareness {{of the importance of the}} tissue environment in shaping effector immunity has emerged. In this mini-review, we discuss whether our lack of understanding of LC function stems from our lymph node-centric view of these cells, and question whether a focus on LC as immune regulators in situ in the skin may reveal clearer answers about their function in <b>cutaneous</b> <b>immunology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Canine demodicosis is a common, non-contagious, {{inflammatory}} parasitic dermatosis {{characterized by}} excessive proliferation of the commensal mite Demodex canis within the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Demodex canis {{are found in}} small number in most dogs, but only few animals will develop clinical demodicosis. The etiological agent is not entirely responsible for the pathological process, so demodicosis is a multifactorial disorder where genetic, <b>immunology,</b> <b>cutaneous</b> ecology, environment, bacteriology and parasitology intervene at various degrees. Canine demodicosis is classified as localized (CLD) or generalized (CGD) according {{to the extent of}} the disease, as the course and prognosis of the two types of demodicosis are vastly different. Typically both types of demodicosis start during puppyhood (3 to 18 months), but adult onse...|$|R
40|$|Inflamed skin {{contains}} CD 4 T-cell subsets that express chemokine receptors CCR 4, CCR 6, and/or CCR 10. Prior {{attempts to}} reveal the distinct role(s) of each receptor in T-cell trafficking to skin have not produced a coherent story. Different conclusions drawn by separate research groups are difficult to reconcile because of the disparate inflammation models used. Here we directly compare CD 4 T cells from wild-type, CCR 4 −/−, CCR 6 −/−, and CCR 10 −/− mice in parallel assays of trafficking to skin. Our models require direct competition between wild-type and receptor-deficient populations for access to inflamed cutaneous sites. Major histocompatibility complex-peptide tetramers allowed us to identify antigen-specific endogenous long-term memory CD 4 T cells within skin after multiple topical immunizations. We separately analyzed cells from the dermal and epidermal layers, allowing us to assess the involvement of each receptor in trafficking between dermis and epidermis. We found that CCR 4 deficiency reduces accumulation of memory CD 4 T cells in skin by approximately 20 -fold, but neither CCR 6 nor CCR 10 deficiency yielded any detectable effects. Strikingly, no differences in dermal versus epidermal localization were observed for cells lacking any of these three receptors. Our findings raise the possibility that CCR 6 and CCR 10 play (as yet) unknown roles in <b>cutaneous</b> T-cell <b>immunology,</b> unrelated to skin-specific trafficking...|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{inflammatory}} {{reactions that}} follow the intracutaneous inoculation of antigen into specifically sensitized animals of certain species, especially guinea pigs, have {{become one of}} the cornerstones upon which the modern concept of cellular immunity is based. In transplantation <b>immunology,</b> <b>cutaneous</b> hypersensitivity reactions have been adapted to study the initiation of homograft sensitivity in vivo (1), to assess the degree of immunogenetic disparity between recipients and graft donors (2 - 5), and to discriminate between normal and sensitized lymphoid cell populations (6). These studies have been conducted principally in guinea pigs (6), hamsters (7), and man (8), {{and to a lesser extent}} ill rabbits (6, 9), rats (10), and dogs (11), and have provided considerable insight into the cellular events underlying the immunologically based cutaneous inflammatory response. But since appropriate, genetically defined stocks of these species are not generally available, the genetic requirements for the development of these reactivities are poorly understood. If skin reactivities could be studied in mice, the broad array of well-defined isogenic strains available, together with our detailed knowledge of the histocompatibilit...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} immune system, {{which leads}} to secretion of polymeric immunoglobulins along mucosal surfaces, has not {{been shown to have}} any definite role in <b>cutaneous</b> <b>immunology,</b> although the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, secretory component (SC), has been found in sweat glands and possibly in the epidermis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine normal human skin and cultured human keratinocytes for the presence of SC. Positive staining for SC was found in sections of normal human skin along the basement membrane zone with use of a polyclonal antibody to SC and focally on the surfaces of epidermal cells with use of a monoclonal antibody to SC. Granular cell-surface fluorescence of an intensity far less than that of the positive control HT 29 cells was seen when cultured human keratinocytes were stained for SC by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Study of lysates of both HT 29 cells and HK by immunoblotting have been negative, perhaps due to destruction of the protein or loss of antigenicity during the extraction process. If human keratinocytes are capable of expression of sc, and the receptor can interact with IgA and IgM, this might be a mechanism for protection of the skin from microbial agents or foreign antigens and might be relevant to the deposition of IgA seen in certain skin diseases...|$|E
40|$|The skin-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} is {{composed}} of keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, skin trophic T cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells of the skin. The epidermis, which is involved in many viral infections, contains all of the components needed for an effective immune response: antigen-presenting Langer-hans cells, T cells, and cytokines from leukocytes and keratinocytes. There have been some recent advances {{in the study of}} the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>immunology</b> involved in infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). In general, viral diseases with cutaneous manifestations lead to a decline in epidermal Langerhans cell numbers, which probably reflects Langerhans cell emigration out of the epidermis and entry into regional lymph nodes, leading to Langer-hans cell activation and antigen presentation to T cells. In HSV, there is a subsequent T-cell infiltration of the epidermis, composed of CD 4 + cells that have both immune modula tory action and direct cytotoxic action. In HIV, where there is a systemic depletion of CD 4 + cells, the epidermis is left with reduced numbers of T cells. Intradermal injection of interleukin- 2, however, leads to an epidermal cellular infiltration in HIV+ individuals. In HPV-induced condyloma, in-tralesional interferon increases Langerhans cells and CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells in the skin, as well as transforming growth factorβ 1, tumor necrosis factor-α, pRB, and p 53. Therefore, viral infections involving the epidermal immune system have certain similar characteristics, whereas other factors are unique to the infecting virus.
