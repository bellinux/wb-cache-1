40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with computation of a lift force generated by flow past a cylinder. It provides definition of fundamental terms regarding flow and recounts the laws of balance. It offers an alternative formulation of balance of momentum for the particular case of steady flow - Crocco's theorem - which formulates balance of momentum using total enthalpy and links the change of entropy with vorticity. Next, Biot-Savart's law for vortex filament in a fluid is derived. Potential flow and complex potential are then used to describe flow past a cylinder; lift force is calculated {{as a product of}} velocity at infinity, the fluid's density and circulation. Using Crocco's theorem, the thesis considers release of the heat of condensation, the change in entropy and the following emergence of vorticity resulting in circulation and, consequently, lift force. The thesis can be used to provide basis for an experiment.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation was}} conducted to analyze the unsteady flow and heat transfer characteristics for cylinders of square cross-section in a laminar channel flow The study focuses on differences in the drag, lift, and heat transfer coefficients for a single and tandem pair of cylinders due to the proximity to a channel wall. Both uniform and parabolic inlet velocity profiles are considered. The cases are calculated for a fixed cylinder Reynolds number of 500 and a Prandtl number of 0. 7. The heated cylinder is held at a constant temperature and is initially centered in the channel. The eddy promoter has side dimensions one-half of the downstream cylinder and is placed at a fixed distance upstream. The upstream cylinder is either located midway between {{the top and bottom}} cylinder surfaces (inline) or it is centered on the top or bottom edges (offset) of the primary cylinder. The results show that the cylinder Nusselt number decreases for both single and inline tandem cylinders as they approach the wall in a parabolic flow but remain almost constant in a uniform flow. This is primarily due to the reduced mean velocity near the wall. The time-averaged drag coefficient decreases for both single and inline tandem cylinders as they approach the wall in a parabolic flow. The presence of the upstream cylinder significantly reduces the drag on the downstream cylinder when compared to that of a single cylinder but has little affect on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>lift.</b> Additionally, the overall cylinder Nusselt number increases slightly in both uniform and parabolic flows. The Strouhal number is much larger for an inline tandem pair than for a single cylinder for all cylinder positions. The amplitude of eddy-shedding induced oscillations is significantly dampened as the cylinder(s) approach the channel wall. Offsetting the eddy promoter causes a significant reduction in the heat transfer and a large increase in the drag coefficient for the channel-centered cylinder when compared to the inline tandem case. The offset cylinder is found to slightly reduce the overall heat transfer and increase the drag from the downstream heated cylinder for the other two cross-stream locations. The study also indicates that placing the eddy promoter in higher velocity fluid increases the Strouhal number of the downstream cylinder...|$|E
40|$|The {{quest for}} cleaner, cheaper and {{reliable}} energy has motivated {{the development of}} magnetic confinement fusion reactor technology as a possible means of harnessing the energy produced by nuclear fusion for power generation. It is known that magnetohydrodynamic effects act to reduce the thermal-hydraulic performance of the duct flows within the cooling blankets by greatly increasing the pressure drop and reducing the heat transfer coefficient through Laminarisation of the flow. Despite the considerable efforts {{that have already been}} dedicated to the study of convective heat transfer in these flows, a further investigation for a more efficient and practical solution to the aforementioned issues is yet to be carried out. In this thesis, a numerical investigation of an electrically conducting fluid flowing in a heated duct under the influence of a strong magnetic field is presented. The major driving motivation of this work is to propose a better mechanism for improving convective heat transfer transversely from a hot wall into a cooler fluid flowing within the duct. The idea of heat-transfer enhancement from a duct wall is based on generating intensive vortices parallel to a magnetic field. As a prelude to the heat transfer analysis, the decay of these vortices has been quantified, whereby a vortex decay model has been proposed. The devised model describes the decay behaviour of the peak vorticity within stable wake vortices behind a circular cylinder under the influence of a strong magnetic field. Comparison with published data demonstrates remarkable consistency. The model suggests that the instantaneous spatial decay rate of vorticity is strongly dependent on friction parameter and Reynolds number at their higher and lower ranges, respectively. The model also proposes that far downstream, the vortex decay is mainly due to magnetic damping, where the decay rate asymptotes to the rate described by the Hartmann friction term, and that the viscous dissipation remain important only in the near wake. When the friction parameter is above the critical value, Hartman braking dominates the decay for the entire wake. Further analysis on the model also reveals that this critical friction parameter is dependent on Reynolds number and blockage ratio, and the dependency becomes more apparent at lower ranges of these parameters. However, these passively generated wake vortices tend to be suppressed by the strong magnetic damping. The potential of current injection to intensify these vortices is therefore explored. The derivation of an analytical solution of the electrical forcing velocity fields and the outcomes from the investigation are presented in Chapter 5. Electric current enters the flow through electrodes {{around the base of the}} cylinder, and radiates outward, imparting a rotational forcing around the electrode due to the Lorentz force. The results indicate that the employment of current injection as a vortex enhancer appears to be principally viable. The results indicate that the imposed magnetic field strength and current injection significantly alter the kinematic behaviour of the wake behind a cylinder. Spectral analysis of the response in the wake of the cylinder to the current injection revealed a distinct spectrum of <b>cylinder</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient in the unlock-in regime. A maximum Nusselt number improvement of almost twofold was observed, with a moderate additional pump power required to drive the flow in the presence of current injection (a maximum additional pressure drop of approximately 30 % was recorded). Following this, the performance of electrically-driven vortex generator without the presence of the cylinder is then evaluated. The only source of vorticity that is responsible for the thinning of the thermal boundary layer is induced by the current injection. The aim is to investigate the sensitivity of the Nusselt number to the variations of the current injection parameters. Findings are presented in Chapter 6 and they revealed a gain in thermal-hydraulic performance over the case when the cylinder is present, particularly for cases with high current amplitude, long pulse widths, and strong magnetic field. This is likely due to the absence of the detrimental nonlinear interaction between the electrically generated vortices and the naturally shed vortices from the cylinder. The results also indicate a maximum pressure drop induced by the current injection of less than 2 %, which is an order of magnitude less than the gain in pressure drop due to the employment of the current injection in the presence of a cylinder. Ultimately, this thesis has found that a perturbation system composed solely of electrically generated vorticity is far more effective for increasing heat transfer in high Hartmann number MHD duct flows than systems employing physical obstacles for vortex promotion...|$|E

The lift coefficient {{and the frequency}} of the alternating force have been determined. For smooth <b>cylinders,</b> the <b>lift</b> coefficients were found to depend on both the Reynolds and the Keuglegen-Carpenter numbers for Reynolds numbers between about 20, 000 and 150, 000. For rough <b>cylinders,</b> the <b>lift</b> coefficients were found to be independent of the Reynolds number within the range of relative roughnesses and Reynolds numbers tested. The results have also shown that the lift coefficients for smooth cylinders at low Reynolds numbers are nearly identical with those obtained for rough cylinders at very high Reynolds numbers at the corresponding amplitude ratios. For both rough and smooth cylinders, the transverse force is a significant fraction of the in-line force and must be taken into consideration in the design of structures.

40|$|Abstract Optimal {{control of}} a wheel loader {{operating}} in the short loading cycle is studied in order to investigate the potentials for fuel consumption reduction while maintaining acceptable production rates. The wheel loader is modeled as a system with five states and three control inputs including torque converter nonlinearities. The torque converter is modeled with no lockup enabling power transmission in both directions. The geometry of the wheel loader boom and the demanded force in the <b>lift</b> <b>cylinders</b> during <b>lifting</b> are used {{to ensure that the}} in-cylinder pressure remains below component’s limits. The lift-transport section of the short loading cycle is divided into four phases due to discontinuities in the gearbox ratios and fuel consumption is calculated in each phase. Time optimal and fuel optimal transients of the system and the power consumption in each and every component is presented showing the dominance of the torque converter losses compared to the other components especially in the time optimal solutions. It is shown that introducing path constraints on the maximum lifting speed of the bucket due to limitations in hydraulic pumping speed moves the diesel engine operation towards higher speeds {{in order to maintain the}} lifting speed. Trade-off between fuel optimal and time optimal transients is calculated which is found to be in agreement with the results of experimental studies...|$|R
