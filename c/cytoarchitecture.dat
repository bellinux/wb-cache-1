5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of <b>cytoarchitecture</b> and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
25|$|A greater {{density of}} grey {{matter in the}} {{inferior}} parietal cortex is present in multilingual individuals. It {{has been found that}} multilingualism affects the structure, and essentially, the <b>cytoarchitecture</b> of the brain. Learning multiple languages re-structures the brain and some researchers argue that it increases the brain's capacity for plasticity. Most of these differences in brain structures in multilinguals may be genetic at the core. Consensus is still muddled; it may be a mixture of both—experiential (acquiring languages during life) and genetic (predisposition to brain plasticity).|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} primary {{olfactory system}} has retained {{the ability to}} continuously regenerate during adulthood. Olfactory receptor neurons have an average lifespan of 6–8 weeks and therefore must be replaced by cells differentiated from the stem cells that are within a layer at the nearby epithelium's base. The new olfactory receptor neurons must project their axons through the CNS to an olfactory bulb {{in order to be}} functional. Axonal growth is guided by the glial composition and <b>cytoarchitecture</b> of the olfactory bulb in addition to the presence of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs).|$|E
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{are located}} in a {{specific}} region of the spinal cord's gray matter. This region is designated lamina IX in the Rexed lamina system, which classifies regions of gray matter based on their <b>cytoarchitecture.</b> Lamina IX is located predominantly in the medial aspect of the ventral horn, although there is some contribution to lamina IX from a collection of motor neurons located more laterally. Like {{other regions of the}} spinal cord, cells in this lamina are somatotopically organized, meaning that the position of neurons within the spinal cord is associated with what muscles they innervate. In particular, α-MNs in the medial zone of lamina IX tend to innervate proximal muscles of the body, while those in the lateral zone tend to innervate more distal muscles. There is similar somatotopy associated with α-MNs that innervate flexor and extensor muscles: α-MNs that innervate flexors tend to be located in the dorsal portion of lamina IX; those that innervate extensors tend to be located more ventrally.|$|E
500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring {{as the result of}} brain damage. [...] Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. [...] One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or lesions) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as [...] "epoch-making" [...] and [...] "pivotal" [...] to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. [...] Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension. [...] The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. [...] Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who [...] "mapped" [...] the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's <b>cytoarchitecture</b> (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, the reeler mutant mouse was {{described}} [...] by Falconer as a naturally occurring mutant. It exhibits some behavioral abnormalities, such as ataxia, tremor and hypotonia, which were discovered {{to be related}} to problems in neuronal migration and consequently, <b>cytoarchitecture</b> in the cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.|$|E
2500|$|The insular cortex has {{regions of}} {{variable}} cell structure or <b>cytoarchitecture,</b> changing from granular in the posterior portion to agranular in the anterior portion. The insula also receives differential cortical and thalamic input along its length. [...] John Allman {{and his colleagues}} have shown that the anterior insular cortex contains a population of neurons, called spindle neurons. These are also called von Economo neurons, identified as characterising a distinctive [...] subregion as the agranular frontal insula.|$|E
2500|$|The ARAS is {{composed}} of several neuronal circuits connecting the dorsal part of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons to the cerebral cortex via distinct pathways that project through the thalamus and hypothalamus. The ARAS {{is a collection of}} different nuclei – more than 20 on each side in the upper brainstem, the pons, medulla, and posterior hypothalamus. The nuclei have their own <b>cytoarchitecture</b> and neurochemical identity and act as neuromodulators. The neurotransmitters that these neurons release include acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine, and glutamate. They exert cortical influence through direct axonal projections and indirect projections through thalamic relays. The thalamic pathway consists primarily of cholinergic neurons in the pontine tegmentum, whereas the hypothalamic pathway {{is composed}} primarily of neurons that release monoamine neurotransmitters, namely dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. The orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system and coordinate activity within the entire system. The most significant components of the ARAS include: ...|$|E

50|$|A Brodmann area is {{a region}} of the {{cerebral}} cortex, in the human or other primate brain, defined by its <b>cytoarchitecture,</b> or histological structure and organization of cells.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>cytoarchitecture,</b> it is bounded caudally by the opercular area 44 (BA44), rostrodorsally {{by the middle}} frontal area 46 (BA46), and ventrally by the orbital area 47 (BA47) (Brodmann, 1909).|$|E

50|$|Prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909 is a {{subdivision}} of the frontal lobe {{in the human}} defined {{on the basis of}} <b>cytoarchitecture.</b> Defined and illustrated in Brodmann-1909, it included the areas subsequently illustrated in Brodmann-10 as prefrontal area 11 and rostral area 12.|$|E
50|$|Defining {{cerebral}} <b>cytoarchitecture</b> {{began with}} the advent of histology—the science of slicing and staining brain slices for examination. It is credited to the Viennese psychiatrist Theodor Meynert (1833-1892), who in 1867 noticed regional variations in the histological structure of different parts of the gray matter in the cerebral hemispheres.|$|E
50|$|Nissl {{staining}} uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in {{the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum, which is abundant in neurons.

50|$|Dum and Strick {{hypothesized}} on {{the basis}} of <b>cytoarchitecture</b> and connections to the spinal cord that the portion of SMA in the cingulate sulcus, on the medial part of the hemisphere, can be split into three separate areas, the cingulate motor areas.

50|$|The premotor cortex {{has been}} divided into finer subregions {{on the basis}} of <b>cytoarchitecture</b> (the {{appearance}} of the cortex under a microscope), cytohistochemistry (the manner in which the cortex appears when stained by various chemical substances), anatomical connectivity to other brain areas, and physiological properties. These divisions are summarized below in Divisions of the premotor cortex.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cytoarchitecture</b> (cellular organization) of the {{cerebellum}} {{is highly}} uniform, with connections organized into a rough, three-dimensional array of perpendicular circuit elements. This organizational uniformity makes the nerve circuitry {{relatively easy to}} study. To envision this [...] "perpendicular array", one might imagine a tree-lined street with wires running straight through the branches of one tree to the next.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the <b>cytoarchitecture</b> of pancreatic islets differs between species.In particular, while rodent islets are characterized by a predominant proportion of insulin-producing beta cells {{in the core of}} the cluster and by scarce alpha, delta and PP cells in the periphery, human islets display alpha and beta cells in close relationship with each other throughout the cluster.|$|E
50|$|Brodmann area 43, the {{subcentral}} area, is a structurally distinct area of {{the cerebral}} cortex defined {{on the basis of}} <b>cytoarchitecture.</b> Along with Brodmann Area 1, 2, and 3, Brodmann area 43 is a subdivision of the postcentral region of the brain. The histological structure of Area 43 was initially described by Korbinian Brodmann, but it was not labeled on his map of cortical areas.|$|E
50|$|This area is {{also known}} as angular area 39 (H). It {{corresponds}} to the angular gyrus surrounding the caudal tip of the superior temporal sulcus. It is bounded dorsally approximately by the intraparietal sulcus. In terms of its <b>cytoarchitecture,</b> it is bounded rostrally by the supramarginal area 40 (H), dorsally and caudally by the peristriate area 19, and ventrally by the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cytoarchitecture</b> (Greek κύτος= [...] "cell" [...] + αρχιτεκτονική= [...] "architecture"), {{also known}} as cytoarchitectonics, {{is the study of}} the {{cellular}} composition of the body's tissues under the microscope.

5000|$|Raymond Dart {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} dual evolutionary origins of the neocortex. During his research in 1930s in Africa, he studied the architecture of reptilian brains. He was able to identify a [...] "premordial neocortex" [...] (paraphrased), the oldest structure that {{can be considered as}} a neocortex, in a reptile. He identified a distinction between the <b>cytoarchitecture</b> in an area which split it into a Para-Hippocampal and a Para-Pyriform region.|$|E
5000|$|With Paul Bucy (1904-1992), Bailey made {{investigations}} {{involving the}} structure of intracranial tumors and meningeal tumors.

With Gerhardt von Bonin (1890-1979), Bailey authored two works, [...] "The Neocortex of Macaca Mulatta" [...] and [...] "The Isocortex of Man", which provided an accurate description concerning the <b>cytoarchitecture</b> of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
50|$|Problems in migration, {{especially}} those that arise {{from the lack of}} reelin production, may influence brain development and lead to disorders in brain's normal functioning. In the 1950s, the reeler mutant mouse was described by Falconer as a naturally occurring mutant. It exhibits some behavioral abnormalities, such as ataxia, tremor and hypotonia, which were discovered to be related to problems in neuronal migration and consequently, <b>cytoarchitecture</b> in the cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.|$|E
50|$|Endogenous neural {{stem cells}} are often in close {{physical}} proximity to blood vessels. Signals from blood vessels regulate their interaction with stem cells {{and contribute to the}} <b>cytoarchitecture</b> of the tissue. The STAT3-Ser/Hes3 signaling axis operating in Hes3+ cells is a convergence point for several of these signals (e.g. Delta4, Angiopoietin 2). Hes3, in turn, by regulating the expression of Shh and potentially other factors, can also exert an effect on blood vessels and other cells comprising their microenvironment.|$|E
50|$|BA46 {{is known}} as middle frontal area 46. In the human brain it {{occupies}} approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on <b>cytoarchitecture</b> rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex.|$|E
50|$|In the guenon Brodmann area 26 is a {{subdivision}} of the cerebral cortex defined {{on the basis}} of <b>cytoarchitecture.</b> The smallest of Brodmann's cortical areas in the monkey, it represents cortex that is less differentiated and smaller in monkey and human than in other species. Brodmann regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the combined human ectosplenial area 26, granular retrolimbic area 29 and agranular retrolimbic area 30 (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): thin cortex; distinct but narrow layers.|$|E
