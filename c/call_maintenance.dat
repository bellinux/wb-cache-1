A satellite link may be used to support any of the interfaces in TETRA network. However, the selection of particular interface applies to specific scenarios and provides different advantages and disadvantages. The viability of a satellite link for the interconnection of two TETRA networks using the Inter-System Interface (ISI) is studied with respect to desired functionality and QoS. ISI-based TETRA over satellite can be used in emergency situations when no terrestrial infrastructure exists between the two networks, as well as in normal operations as an alternative to ground based interconnection infrastructure. The response time of different services in a given network architecture is of primary concern because large propagation delay is the main source of service degradation. A modified version of critical path analysis, as it applies to protocols, is used to estimate total propagation delays for a set of ISI services. The appealing property of the critical path length is that it gives an accurate estimate of total propagation delay for a given service and thus represents a quantitative measure of QoS degradation as experienced by the end user. The results presented show larger degradations of QoS for the group call scenarios. The most disturbed are acknowledged group call setup and group <b>call</b> <b>maintenance.</b> A Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is proposed to improve the performance of the TETRA services over the ISI if satellite links are involved.

5000|$|In a valve {{regulated}} {{lead acid battery}} (VRLA) the hydrogen and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water. Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the electrolyte level, they have been <b>called</b> <b>maintenance</b> free batteries. However, this is somewhat of a misnomer. VRLA cells do require maintenance. As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells [...] "dry-out" [...] and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal resistance, conductance or impedance measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required. Recent maintenance procedures have been developed allowing [...] "rehydration", often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.|$|R

40|$|Decision-making in {{maintenance}} {{has to be}} augmented to instantly {{understand and}} efficiently act, i. e. the new know. The new know in maintenance needs to focus on two aspects of knowing: 1) what can be known and 2) what must be known, in order to enable the maintenance decision-makers to take appropriate actions. Hence, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to propose a concept for knowledge discovery in maintenance with focus on Big Data and analytics. The concept is <b>called</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Analytics (MA). MA focuses in the new knowledge discovery in maintenance. MA addresses the process of discovery, understanding, and communication of maintenance data from four time-related perspectives, i. e. 1) “Maintenance Descriptive Analytics (monitoring) ”; 2) “Maintenance Diagnostic Analytics”; 3) “Maintenance Predictive Analytics”; and 4) “Maintenance Prescriptive analytics”.

Based on the considered system, we aim to use the monitoring data and the time-limited information for maintenance decision support {{in order to reduce}} its costs. We propose two predictive maintenance policies based, respectively, on cost and reliability criteria. Classical age-based and condition-based policies are considered as benchmarks.

50|$|Family Medicine Certification (FMC) is {{the process}} that {{provides}} the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) with the means to continually assess Diplomates. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) determined that ABMS specialists within every discipline {{should be required to}} meet the highest standards of accountability. In response, the ABMS designed a process <b>called</b> <b>Maintenance</b> of Certification, and each specialty board within the ABMS has agreed to adhere to a set structure in developing their own individual programs. This structure consists of four components, each designed to assess important physician characteristics: Professionalism, Self-assessment and Lifelong Learning, Cognitive Expertise, and Performance Improvement. Although these elements are similar to and consistent with the ABFM's long-standing recertification program, Family Medicine Certification stresses the importance of ongoing participation in activities that evaluate each of these components between recertification examinations. Family Medicine Certification is a requirement that the ABFM believes encourages clinical excellence and benefits both physicians and their patients.|$|R

Consumption of energy for all processes other than growth is <b>called</b> <b>maintenance.</b> In the absence of maintenance and decay the microbial 'food chain' is intrinsically stable But when decay is included in the description this is not necessarily the case.

40|$|Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are a {{powerful}} formalism for reasoning under uncertainty but bear some severe limitations: they require {{a large amount}} of information before any reasoning process can start, they have limited contradiction handling capabilities, and their ability to provide explanations for their conclusion is still controversial.

TMSs incorporating measure of uncertainty are <b>called</b> Belief <b>Maintenance</b> Systems (BMSs). This paper describes how a BMS based on probabilistic logic can be applied to BBNs, thus introducing a new class of BBNs, called Ignorant Belief Networks, able to incrementally deal with partially specified conditional dependencies, to provide explanations, and to detect and handle contradictions.

With the rest of its time being dedicated to alert <b>calls,</b> <b>maintenance</b> behavior (resting, sun bathing, grooming) and sexual behavior in males and females. During their mating season sexual behavior plays a larger role in its above ground activity, involving a 'frenzy' like pattern of males entering and exiting their burrows sporadically, most likely observed as a type of courting behavior. The spotted ground squirrel have 7 different alert postures used to warn others about likely predators in the area or to stake a territory claim against other males during mating seasons. Hibernation behavior has been observed to begin in late July and go all the way through to April and May. Seasonal activity cycles occurs during the months of April/May through July/August and is estimated to be 115-135 days for males and 95-125 days for females.|$|R
