50|$|The {{differences}} between a hydrogen ICE and a traditional gasoline engine include hardened valves and valve seats, stronger connecting rods, non-platinum tipped spark plugs, {{a higher voltage}} ignition coil, fuel injectors designed for a gas instead of a liquid, larger <b>crankshaft</b> <b>damper,</b> stronger head gasket material, modified (for supercharger) intake manifold, positive pressure supercharger, and a high temperature engine oil. All modifications would amount to about one point five times (1.5) the current cost of a gasoline engine. These hydrogen engines burn fuel {{in the same manner}} that gasoline engines do.|$|E
50|$|Tuned mass dampers {{stabilize}} against violent motion {{caused by}} harmonic vibration. A tuned damper reduces the vibration {{of a system}} with a comparatively lightweight component so that the worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking, practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. An example of {{the latter is a}} <b>crankshaft</b> torsional <b>damper.</b> Mass dampers are frequently implemented with a frictional or hydraulic component that turns mechanical kinetic energy into heat, like an automotive shock absorber. An electrical analogue is an LCR circuit.|$|R
5000|$|Tuned {{absorber}} type of [...] "dampers" [...] {{often referred}} to as a harmonic dampers or harmonic balancers (even though it technically does not dampen or balance the <b>crankshaft).</b> This <b>damper</b> uses a spring element (often rubber in automobile engines) and an inertia ring that is typically tuned to the first torsional natural frequency of the crankshaft. This type of damper reduces the vibration at specific engine speeds when an excitation torque excites the first natural frequency of the crankshaft, but not at other speeds. This type of damper is analogous to the tuned mass dampers used in skyscrapers to reduce the building motion during an earthquake.|$|R
50|$|A straight-eight can be timed for {{inherent}} {{primary and}} secondary balance, with no unbalanced primary or secondary forces or moments. However, crankshaft torsional vibration, present to some degree in all engines, is sufficient to {{require the use of}} a harmonic damper at the accessory end of the <b>crankshaft.</b> Without such <b>damping,</b> fatigue cracking near the rear main bearing journal may occur, leading to engine failure.|$|R
5000|$|A {{harmonic}} damper is {{a device}} fitted {{to the free}} (accessory drive) end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine to counter torsional and resonance vibrations from the crankshaft. This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which {{is dependent on the}} damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes <b>crankshaft</b> <b>damper,</b> torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The harmonic balancer often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices.|$|E
5000|$|The update program {{commenced}} in late 2002 {{with production}} launch {{slated to be}} fall of 2004. The engineering team chose the engine variant out of the GMT560 truck (the C4500) because it packaged better into the H1 engine bay; however, 23 engine component changes were required and the team {{had to do a}} 2.0 in body lift to accommodate the taller engine and its turbo housing (a prior 0.5 in lift had been done for MY96 to accommodate the turbo on the 6.5L engine). The 8th digit of the VIN number is 3, setting this version of the 6.6L Duramax apart from the versions used in pickup trucks. The GMT560 engine calibration was used with minimal modification; engine output was [...] and 520 lbft Nm of torque. The Duramax engine was equipped with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and an internal engine oil cooler, thus, requiring a 40 percent heat rejection increase to engine coolant. Because space was limited between the air-lift brackets that protrude from the hood, the fan system was modified by putting it directly under the coolpack and driving it through a special gearbox directly off the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>damper</b> pulley. Several other cooling system modifications were required to assist with cold starting from [...]|$|E
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} {{engineered}} to increase performance and high-RPM reliability over standard 289 fare. It had solid lifters with hotter cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point, centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (the standard 289-4V was 480 CFM). The water pump, fuel pump, and alternator/generator pulleys were altered, fewer vanes, extra spring, and larger diameter, respectively; to help handle the higher engine speeds. Even the HiPo’s fan was unique. Bottom-end improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker {{main bearing caps}} and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron {{as opposed to the}} regular items at 40%, all were checked for correct 'nodularity' by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing that surface using a magnification arrangement against a picture datum, increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier connecting rod big ends, the increased external counter weighting at the front was split between the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>damper</b> and a supplementary counterweight place adjacent to the front main bearing journal (all designed to reduce the 'bending moment' in the crankshaft at high-rpm), all for high-rpm reliability. The HiPo carried SAE gross ratings of [...] at 6,000 rpm and 312 lbft Nm at 3,400 rpm. About 25,000 were manufactured at CEP1 between March 1963 and June 1967.|$|E
40|$|The {{point of}} the {{dissertation}} is to describe the design of powertrain of four-cylinder diesel engine equipped with vibration damper.

The following part describes the safety factor solution of crankshaft fatigue using FEM. The dissertation provides a useful comparison for versions with and without <b>damper.</b> <b>Crankshaft</b> and viscous type vibration damper drawings are also included as appendices...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{high-speed}} inline {{internal combustion}} engines {{are prone to}} torsional vibration of their crankshafts; the straight six and straight eight engines being particularly prone to this problem due to their long crankshaft length. Although straight eight engines faded from the marketplace in the 1950s, many straight six engines have and still do feature <b>crankshaft</b> vibration <b>damping</b> utilizing rubber bushes. The 3,442 cc Jaguar XK 6-cylinder engine of 1948 and most subsequent versions of the ubiquitous Jaguar XK engine used a proprietary Metalastik vibration damper to protect their crankshafts from potentially damaging torsional vibrations. To quote William Heynes, [...] "The Metalastik damper consists of a steel plate to which is bonded, through a thick rubber disk, a malleable iron floating weight. Variations of the weight, rubber volume and mix, give these dampers a very wide field over which they can operate." ...|$|R
5000|$|The new [...] car {{appeared}} in 1901 and remained in production until 1905, with only minor design modifications. He became {{a friend of}} Rudyard Kipling and would send him experimental models to test. In 1905, Lanchester produced a [...] four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a [...] six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional <b>crankshaft</b> vibration <b>damper</b> {{as a solution to}} the problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a harmonic balancer to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is design an {{unconventional}} powertrain V- 6 engine with cylinder opening lines offset 90 degrees and 30 degrees of crank pin offset. It is {{an analysis of the}} balance of the crank mechanism, proposed unbalance, build a model of discrete torsion system, design of viscous torsional vibration damper, compares the results of the calculation of strength without <b>crankshaft</b> <b>damper</b> and with damper...|$|E
50|$|An OEM damper {{consists}} of an outer mass bonded/vulcanized to an inner hub. An aftermarket performance damper consists a mass which attached/mounted to a housing (steel, aluminum, titanium, etc.). Based on {{the different types of}} damper and where the mass is controlled differently. The first three use older technology; First is the liquid type damper which surrounds the mass immersed in the housing which is then bonded or welded together. Second is the o-ring type which surrounds the mass with a number of o-rings as it sits in its housing. Third is the friction type which has clutches and spring acting on the mass inside the outer housing. Fourth is the newest type in which the mass sits over and is attached an elastomer ring which is then attached to the outer housing. The <b>crankshaft</b> and <b>damper</b> together become (in its torsional response) a spring-mass-damper system again which can only occur by the two being interference fit together.|$|R
40|$|Doctoral thesis {{deals with}} {{combustion}} engine cranktrain vibrations and vibration analysis methods. The work applies new computational models aimed at powertrain vibration decrease. The computational models {{can be used}} in the first stages of powertrain development. Temperature dependences of the rubber shear modulus and loss factor characteristic are found by response analysis of the free damped vibrations {{in the first part of}} the thesis. Viscoelastic model parameters of two dampers with different rubber hardness are calculated using optimization methods. Temperature distribution inside the rubber part during the harmonic oscillation is calculated with the knowledge of previous values. Computational models together with a user interface are assembled in Matlab/Simulink software tool. Computational model results of the viscoelastic rubber damper are verified by measurements on a prototype diesel engine in the whole operating engine speed range. Torsional vibrations of the <b>crankshaft</b> with torsional <b>damper</b> are measured by POLYTEC laser rotational tools. The temperature distribution on the damper surface is obtained by Infratec VarioCAM thermographic system. Combustion pressures in the cylinder are measured by SMETEC Combi indication tools. Both the temperature distributions and combustion pressures are used for computational purposes. All the measurement procedures are described also in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} six {{papers with}} the overall theme of measurement, assessment and control of diesel engine noise, with an emphasize on control. The radiation of noise is shown {{to be dominated by}} {{the low end of the}} engine sides and by the engine front. The mode shapes of the crankcase, the oil sump and the timing transmission cover are investigated. The vibrations are measured and analysed through running mode, modal analyses and SEA. The noise radiation is explored in detail with near-field measurements of sound intensity. In the engine front, the noise radiation is shown to have contributions from the timing casing, the oil-sump front and the <b>crankshaft</b> torsion vibration <b>damper.</b> The radiation from the torsion damper is analysed by a regression analysis of measured intensity data and the vibrations of the damper are investigated with a laser-doppler vibrometer. The results show that the damper vibrates in the axial directions with vibration modes that both radiate noise and interfere with the radiation from the engine structure. It is shown that there in the engine front are strong coupled vibration modes between the timing cover and the oil sump front m the frequency range 500 Hz - 1 kHz. The importance of the strong vibration modes in the crankcase and the oil-sump sides is shown. The propagation paths of noise and vibration to the engine front have been examined with an SEA powerflow analysis and by opening the front cover to measure the sound power from the timing gears. The main excitations of the front cover are found to be by engine block vibrations below 1. 25 kHz and by tuning gears noise above 2 kHz. Various constructions to control the noise are tested. Two stiffeners are designed and tested to reduce vibrations m the engine low end, one ladder frame introducing stiffness at the crankcase flange and one bearing beam introducing stiffness at the main bearing caps. The stiffeners have hem evaluated by sound intensity measurements and mobility measurements. The ladder frame gave good noise reductions but the bearing beam merely caused frequency shifts of the bearing modes. A decoupling of the oil sump resulted in significant noise and vibration reductions. The timing cover is modified by increasing the damping and by decrease the radiation efficiency. Various interior panels are tested, like plexiglass and aluminium panels of different thicknesses, a rubber damping layer and a combined rubber/steel-sheet damping layer. A thin plastic sheet has low radiation efficiency and may thereby lower the noise emission. A slightly improved model for calculation of radiation efficiency of small irregularly shaped plates is suggested. The traditional SEA prediction model is shown to be ill-conditioned for engine applications. An improved model using geometric averaging is suggested and evaluated. The results show that the new SEA model is working well for frequencies down to 800 Hz for predictions of damping treatments, decoupling of the oil sump and for power-flow determinations. The concept of equivalent mass is found valuable and validations are made according to the consistency and reciprocity theories. A hemi-anechoic engine laboratory is constructed and evaluated. New efficient low-cost diffusing absorbers have been designed, the performance is evaluated with standard deviation analysis of sound pressure measurements. The performance of the absorbers is found to be compeatable with much more expensive commercial designs. Measured sound intensity in three-dimensional vectors is a powerful tool to identify and illustrate sound fields. When used in near-fields to identify complex noise sources large errors may occur. It is shown that the low relative levels of vector components and the reactivity of the sound field give large errors m repeated measurements. Analyses and comparisons are performed on a simple source and on an engine. A two- and a six-microphone probe were used that were hand-held and robot-controlled. It is concluded dig in point-intensity measurements on engineering noise sources, a 4 - 6 microphone probe and a precision positioner should be used to get reliable measurements.
