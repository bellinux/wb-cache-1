An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west.

Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting {{had a tendency to}} rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, he looked to use his feet to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the off-side.|$|E
25|$|The major {{commercial}} {{importance of}} the Louisiana Purchase territory was the Mississippi River.

The first commercial shipment to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River was of deer and bear hides in 1705. The area, always loosely defined in those early times of European claims and settlements, extended as far east as the city that is now Mobile, Alabama, begun by French settlers in 1702.|$|E

25|$|Weekes had {{a classic}} batting style, possessed {{a variety of}} shots {{on both sides of}} the wicket, and is {{considered}} one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by The Times as lightly bow-legged, with a wonderful eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always the right place to play a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action said he was the closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{from the}} public and critics was very good with ratings {{averaging}} around 7.5 out of 10. Most criticism is of the player designs not resembling the actual people, which is a licensing issue. There is also {{a problem with the}} wicket keeper who doesn't wear a helmet like in many other cricket games. Some other shortcomings include no overthrows and running on overthrow, batsman cannot <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> track to hit or defend, the ball is always thrown to the wicketkeeper rather than at the stumps or to the bowler leaving balls driven to midoff easier to run on, and leaving the ball without playing a shot reduces the batsman's confidence. Batting and bowling averages of players do not evolve with play, unless the player has created a career player.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February, Captain Winecoff {{received}} {{a message from}} Colonel Barrow, 9th Marines Commanding Officer, {{to set up an}} ambush along Route 922. The Captain's men needed rest, and he requested a postponement but was denied by Colonel Barrow. The Captain utilized his 1st and 2nd Platoons, and at 16:10, 1st Platoon moved out and made its way to 2nd Platoon's position. At 18:30, Winecoff briefed his men on the ambush. After dark they moved out towards route 922, about 900 meters away. By 01:00, Captain Winecoff and Hotel Company were in place and setting up the ambush. Within minutes of getting into position they started hearing trucks coming down the road and continued to observe as 40 minutes later, a lone truck and one PAVN soldier also walked through the kill zone. Winecoff had not wanted the ambush sprung on one truck or soldier, realizing that eventually a bigger target would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road. At 02:30, the lights of eight trucks appeared, and as three trucks came into the kill zone the column of vehicles stopped. Not wanting to give away the ambush or their position Winecoff, set off the claymores and the ambush. The Marines poured small arms and automatic weapons fire on the three vehicles, the forward observer alerted the artillery, and rounds bracketed the company position.|$|E

500|$|The first non-Native Americans to {{pass through}} the area of Castle Lake were hunters and trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company, who began to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Siskiyou Trail from present-day Washington into Mexican-controlled California, in the late 1820s and early 1830s, in search of beaver and other pelt-bearing animals. [...] At about this same time, Ewing Young led the first group of Americans up the Siskiyou Trail, passing near Castle Lake. [...] In 1841, an {{overland}} party of the United States Exploring Expedition, the first cartographers and scientists came through the area.

North Korean troops made a second effort, much weaker than the first, around 02:30, but artillery and mortar fire dispersed them before they reached the UN lines.|$|E

500|$|Miriam Coleman from Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} the songs's [...] "easy poppy beat" [...] and its [...] "repeated refrains", factors she believed contributed {{to make the}} song a [...] "determined note for the new album".

Melinda Newman from HitFix saw the song as a [...] "change of pace" [...] for Perry, whilst Andrew Hampp from Billboard believed it to be a return to the style of her album One of the Boys, but criticized its tempo and its lyrics that [...] "rarely rise above easy clichés and rhymes".

500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity...

This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form {{may be the most}} overrated, under-financed piece of film to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pike in a long time." [...] A critic from The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "The concept is clever, suggesting a new way to build horror-movie suspense without much on-camera gore. The film would be better as a 30-minute short, though, since its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while, and there's not much room for character development within the very limited plot." [...] R. L. Schaffer of IGN gave it two out of ten, and described it as [...] "boringreally boring", and [...] "a Z-grade, low-rent horror outing with no real scares into a genuine big-budget spectacle".|$|E
