40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{aeration}} process are for removal methane (CH 4), removal carbondioxide (CO 2), removal HS 2, removal odors and taste, also removal other gases. But, at the reality {{the purpose of}} aeration increase dissolved oxygen concentration {{in the water and}} equipment used is aerator. The aeration used is <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> remove CO 2 at least than the other aerator model. The purpose of this experiment for know large of oxygen transfer at <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> combination spray aerator model. This experiment used <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> are from 3 step variable cascade distance between 10 cm until 50 cm. Above the pipe cascade posted spray so that make water smooth bubbles which down in every cascade can binded more oxygen, so result of the value of oxygen transfer more higher. Beside taht, rate of flow used in this experiment also variation range 1300 ml/mn to 2200 ml/mn. Experiment result indicated that the best of DO value when height between cascade 50 cm with rate of flow 2200 ml/mn is 7, 29 mg/lt and KLa (oksigen transfer) value is 0, 94.

40|$|In Indonesia, the {{contamination}} from domestic wastewater {{is becoming the}} greatest pollutant and reaches up to 85 % {{that goes into the}} body of water. This might worsen the river water quality. To anticipate this condition, there should be some way out, by making use of wastewater as a source of energy. One of those systems is by employing Cone-tray <b>Cascade</b> <b>Aerator</b> combined with Biofilter by using Hydrilla plant which can be used as an alternative of waste water treatment for both domestic and institutional scale. This research was aimed at determining the system capability of aeration combined with biofilter by using hydrilla plant to reduce or eliminate the pollutant load of BOD, COD, and TSS. This research was conducted in a continuous stream of water at 200 L/hour. The result showed that the best system of Conetray <b>Cascade</b> <b>Aerator</b> combined with biofilter could reduce BOD as much as 69, 11 %, COD at 61, 14 %, and TSS at 65, 45 %...|$|E
40|$|Combination between {{oxidation}} and filtration can be {{used for}} removing iron and manganese from groundwater especially when the concentrations of these metals were high. This study focused on the effectiveness of the <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> {{and the size of the}} limestone filter media to remove iron and manganese from groundwater. Water samples used for this study were collected from orphanage home, Rumah Nur Kasih, Taiping. Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) has provided a tube well of 15 m depth and 150 mm diameter for the orphanage home. However, the water cannot be used for domestic consumption due to high amount of iron and manganese at 6. 48 and 1. 9 mg/L which exceeded the drinking water standard of 0. 3 and 0. 1 mg/L respectively. Using laboratory physical model, the study has shown that the removals of iron and manganese have reduce the concentration until 0. 17 and 0. 2 mg/L respectively. Thus, the results from this study which utilize <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> and limestone roughing filter could be implemented on site for the community to use the ground water for domestic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality and}} its {{enhancement}} {{have a close}} connection {{with the presence of}} dissolved oxygen. In fact, the oxygen concentration in surface waters is a prime indicator of the water quality for human use {{as well as for the}} aquatic biota. The physical process of oxygen transfer or oxygen absorption from the atmosphere acts to replenish the used oxygen. This process is termed re−aeration or aeration. Aeration enhancement by macro−roughness is well−known in water treatment, and one form is the aeration cascade. The macro−roughness of the steps significantly reduces flow velocities and leads to flow aeration along the stepped cascade. This paper seeks influence of channel slope on oxygen content in stepped <b>cascade</b> <b>aerators.</b> It is demonstrated that the aeration efficiency of the stepped <b>cascade</b> <b>aerators</b> increases with increasing channel slope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wastewater {{reclamation}} and its reuse for beneficial purposes is {{a common}} goal in all countries particularly in water stressed countries around the world. Cutting edge technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO), micro and ultra filtration etc. are often used to purify wastewater effluent generated in conventional systems. However, the rejected wastewater from these processes is usually laden with concentrated nutrients, salts, inorganic materials while it is devoir of organic materials those are removed {{in the course of}} treatment. Safe disposal/reuse of these wastewaters is a growing concern. A study was carried out to investigate a number of selected processes that have potential of removing the nutrient concentrates from the reject wastewater. At bench-scale, three most promising processes were developed unifying available unit processes proven to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in brackish water and they were tested with synthetic RO reject water. The processes were: A. Up-flow sludge blanket filtration process; B. <b>Cascaded</b> <b>aerator</b> system with partial anaerobic condition and C. Denitrifing process with bacterial growth on fixed anaerobic porous media followed by algae pond. Three carbon sources methanol, acetate and glucose were supplied in proportion o...|$|R

A non-mixing winter lake aeration system has been designed and field tested that can maintain water temperature stratification in the lake and not create open water. The performance of a <b>cascade</b> <b>aerator</b> was evaluated for which the design discharge and dissolved oxygen input rate were 85 lis and 70 kg/d, respectively, Unusually high levels of dissolved oxygen due to photosynthetic productivity under the ice-cover were also observed and are reported.
