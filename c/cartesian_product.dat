25|$|In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of two circles: S1×S1, and {{the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context.

The ring torus {{is one way to}} embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another {{way to do this is}} the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of the embedding of S1 in the plane.

40|$|<b>Cartesian</b> <b>products</b> of graphs {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} since the 1960 s.

Hypergraphs were introduced as a generalization of graphs and the definition of <b>Cartesian</b> <b>products</b> extends naturally to them. In this paper, we give new properties and algorithms concerning coloring aspects of <b>Cartesian</b> <b>products</b> of hypergraphs. We also extend a classical prime factorization algorithm initially designed for graphs to connected conformal hypergraphs using 2 -sections of hypergraphs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an algebraic characterization of mathematical structures formed by <b>cartesian</b> <b>products</b> of fuzzy relations with sup-min composition. A simple {{proof of a}} representation theorem for Boolean relation algebras satisfying Tarski rule and point axiom was given by G. Schmidt and T. Strohlein, and <b>cartesian</b> <b>products</b> of Boolean relation algebras were investigated by B. J'onsson and A. Tarski. Unlike Boolean relation algebras, fuzzy relation algebras are not Boolean but equipped with semi-scalar multiplication. First we present a set of axioms for fuzzy relation algebras and add axioms for <b>cartesian</b> <b>products</b> of fuzzy relation algebras. Second we improve the definition of point relations. Then a representation theorem for such relation algebras is deduced. Keywords : fuzzy relations, <b>cartesian</b> <b>products,</b> relation algebras, representation theorem. 1 Introduction In 1941 Tarski [8] proposed a problem, that is, "Is every relation algebra isomorphic to an algebra of all Bo [...] ...|$|R

25|$|In {{geometric}} topology, the Clifford torus is {{the simplest}} and most symmetric Euclidean space embedding of the <b>cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of two circles Sa1 and Sb1. It resides in R4, as opposed to R3. To see why R4 is required, note that if Sa1 and Sb1 each exist in their own independent embedding spaces Ra2 and Rb2, the resulting product space will be R4 rather than R3. The historically popular view that the <b>cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of two circles is an R3 torus in contrast requires the highly asymmetric application of a rotation operator to the second circle, since that circle will only have one independent axis z available to it after the first circle consumes x and y.|$|E
25|$|The concept {{can still}} further be {{extended}} by considering a function that also produces output that is expressed as several variables.

25|$|The {{notation}} Rn {{refers to}} the <b>cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of n copies of R, which is an n-dimensional vector space over the field of the real numbers; this vector space may be identified to the n-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry {{as soon as a}} coordinate system has been chosen in the latter.

As a regular polytope with three cubes folded together around every edge, it has Schläfli symbol {4,3,3} with hyperoctahedral symmetry of order 384. Constructed as a 4D hyperprism made of two parallel cubes, it can be named as a composite Schläfli symbol {4,3}×{}, with symmetry order 96. As a 4-4 duoprism, a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of two squares, it can be named by a composite Schläfli symbol {4}×{4}, with symmetry order 64. As an orthotope it can be represented by composite Schläfli symbol {}×{}×{}×{} or {}4, with symmetry order 16.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{construct}} orders out of given orders. The dual order is one example. Another important construction is the <b>cartesian</b> <b>product</b> of two partially ordered sets, taken together with the product order on pairs of elements. The ordering is defined by (a, x) ≤ (b, y) if (and only if) a ≤ b and x ≤ y. (Notice carefully that there are three distinct meanings for the relation symbol ≤ in this definition.) The disjoint union of two posets is another typical example of order construction, where the order is just the (disjoint) union of the original orders.|$|E
