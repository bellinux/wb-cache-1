5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now <b>called</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> Batesian mimicry.|$|E

25|$|In Sicily, Emperor Frederick II {{endorsed}} a deep {{reform of the}} laws culminating with the promulgation of the Constitutions of Melfi (1231, also known as Liber Augustalis), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and {{was a source of}} inspiration for a long time after. It made the Kingdom of Sicily a centralised state and established the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the Liber Augustalis remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819. His royal court in Palermo, from around 1220 to his death, saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian, that had a significant influence on what was to become the modern Italian language. During this period, he also built the Castel del Monte, and in 1224, he founded the University of Naples, now <b>called,</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> Università FedericoII.|$|E
25|$|He {{retained}} {{to the end}} {{an intense}} love of country, which made him wish to die in Portugal, and in 1796 a royal decree permitting his return there and ordering the restoration of his goods was issued, but delays occurred in its execution, and {{the transfer of the}} court to the Portuguese colony of Brazil {{as a result of the}} French invasion finally dashed his hopes. Before this the Count of Barca had obtained him a commission from the Portuguese government to translate the De Rebus Emanuelis of Jerónimo Osório; the assistance of some fellow-countrymen in Paris carried him through his last years, which were cheered by the friendship of his biographer and translator Alexandre Sane and of the Lusophil Ferdinand Dénis. Lamartine addressed an ode to him; he enjoyed the esteem of Chateaubriand; and his admirers at home, who imitated him extensively, were <b>called</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> Os Filintistas. Exile and suffering had enlarged his ideas and given him a sense of reality, making his best poems those he wrote between the ages of seventy and eighty-five, and when he died, it was recognized that Portugal had lost her foremost contemporary poet.|$|E

[...] Great Britain was successfully represented in this Tournament by a team from the London Central YMCA who won all their games. [...] The London Central YMCA (also written about as Centymca Harriers in the Dutch press) were reigning National YMCA Champions this championship having been established in 1922. One of the players from the victorious YMCA team introduced the game to the Netherlands, i.e. A.M.V.J. Amsterdam in 1929.

2500|$|Traditionally, the Greek philosopher Hippodamus (5th century BC) is {{regarded}} as the first town planner and ‘inventor’ of the orthogonal urban layout. Aristotle called him [...] "the father of city planning", and until well into the 20th century, he was indeed regarded as such. This is, however, only partly justified. The Hippodamian plan that was <b>called</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> is an orthogonal urban layout with more or less square street blocks. Archaeological finds from ancient Egypt—among others—demonstrate that Hippodamus cannot truly have been the inventor of this layout. Aristotle's critique and indeed ridicule of Hippodamus, which appears in Politics 2. 8, is perhaps the first known example of a criticism of urban planning.|$|E
2500|$|Acacius took {{a leading}} {{place among the}} prelates who succeeded in {{splitting}} into two the ecumenical council which Constantius II had proposed to summon, and thus nullifying its authority. While the Western bishops were assembling at Rimini, 359, he and his brethren of the East gathered at Seleucia Isauria in Syria (now Silifke, Turkey). The number of bishops present has been variously estimated as somewhere between {{one hundred and fifty}} and one hundred and sixty. The Semi-Arians were in a large majority; while Acacius had a well-disciplined group of followers, <b>called</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> Acacians. With the Anomoeans, he could count on his side some forty bishops. After the majority had confirmed the Semi-Arian creed of Antioch ("Creed of the Dedication"), Silvanus of Tarsus proposed to confirm the Lucianic Creed, when Acacius and his party arose and left the assembly, by way of protest. In spite of this move the Creed was signed the next morning with closed doors; a proceeding which Acacius promptly characterized as a [...] "deed of darkness." [...] On Wednesday Basil of Ancyra and Macedonius I of Constantinople arrived with Hilary of Poitiers, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Eustathius. Cyril was already under censure; and Acacius refused to bring his followers back to the synod until he and some other accused bishops who were present had withdrawn. After a stormy debate his plan was agreed to and Leonas, the representative of Constantius II at the deliberation, rose and read a copy of a new Creed which Acacius had put into his hands. It rejected the terms Homoousion and Homoiousion [...] "as alien from Scripture," [...] and anathematizing the term [...] "Anomoeon," [...] but distinctly confessing the [...] "likeness" [...] of the Son to the Father. This formula, which interpreted the [...] "likeness of the Son to the Father" [...] as [...] "likeness in will alone," [...] oμοιον κατα την βούλησιν μόνον, the semi-Arian majority rejected, and it proceeded to depose Acacius and his adherents.|$|E
