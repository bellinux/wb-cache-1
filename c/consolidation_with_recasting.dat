Pneumonia appears as a <b>consolidation</b> <b>with</b> irregular and somewhat blurred margins, commonly associated with dynamic tree-shaped air bronchograms and pleural effusion. The sonographic signs of pulmonary embolism consist of generally two or more small pleural based, hypoechoic <b>consolidations</b> <b>with</b> sharp margins and without central vascularization. Importantly, these two kinds of consolidations cannot be reverted by a lung recruitment maneuver.|$|R

50|$|According to Pennsylvania Department of Education {{enrollment}} reports, {{there are}} 1,155 {{students enrolled in}} preschool-12th in the 2014-15 school year at Northern Cambria School District. In 2007 there were 1,273 pupils. There were 88 students in the Class of 2009. The District's class of 2010 had 97 students. Enrollment at Northern Cambria School District is projected to decline to 1,144 students by 2020. In 2008, the district administrative costs were $631.64 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school districts in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration of Northern Cambria School District with an adjacent school district, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. The study examined <b>consolidation</b> of administrations <b>with</b> five neighboring school districts. <b>Consolidation</b> <b>with</b> Blacklick Valley School District was predicted to save $2 million in 2007. <b>Consolidation</b> <b>with</b> Cambria Heights School District would save taxpayers over $4 million in redundant administration costs. Similarly, <b>consolidation</b> <b>with</b> Harmony Area School District would save taxpayers over $2 million. <b>consolidation</b> <b>with</b> Penns Manor Area School District would save taxpayers over $2.6 million. Finally, <b>consolidation</b> of administrations <b>with</b> Purchase Line School District projected taxpayer savings of over $4 million.|$|R

Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools will continue to rise.|$|R
