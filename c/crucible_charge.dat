40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Carbon-bonded silicon carbide and clay-bonded graphite crucibles are used in non-ferrous induction melting furnaces. Silicon carbide crucibles especially have encountered premature failure when used at high power densities and operating frequencies. This {{is thought to be}} related to their non-uniform properties. To gain a more thorough understanding of the problem, an equivalent circuit analysis has been applied to the composite load of <b>crucible</b> and metal <b>charge.</b> [Continues. ...|$|R

The coral wall which circumscribes the isles but continues upward the deep buried crater of the primal chaos. In the first times this <b>crucible</b> was <b>charged</b> with vapors nebulous, boiling over fires volcanic. Age by age, the fluid thickened; dropping, at long intervals, heavy sediment to the bottom; which layer on layer concreted, and at length, in crusts, rose toward the surface. Then, the vast volcano burst; rent the whole mass; upthrew the ancient rocks; which now in divers mountain tops tell tales of what existed ere Mardi was completely fashioned. Hence many fossils on the hills, whose kith and kin still lurk beneath the vales. Thus Nature works, at random warring, chaos a crater, and this world a shell." ...|$|R

5000|$|The furnace is {{initially}} loaded {{with the material}} to be fused, which is introduced into the <b>crucible</b> from the <b>charge</b> door. Once the loading is completed, current {{is sent to the}} electrodes, which generate an electrical arc between them. The arc produces heat which is transmitted to the material to be melted through thermal radiation heat transfer, which is why the furnace is referred to as an indirect or radiant arc device. During the process, the charge door can be reopened to introduce into the crucible further amounts of scrap and cast iron. When all the material has been melted, it undergoes a first refining before it is poured out from the taphole.|$|R

40|$|The electrometallurgical {{processing}} of spent fuel developed at Argonne National Laboratory produces a cathode which contains dendrites of heavy metal (principally U), salts, and residual cadmium. The cathode requires further treatment which {{is accomplished by}} loading it into a cathode processor to first purify and then consolidate the heavy metal. The principal steps in cathode processing are: the cathode is loaded into a crucible and both loaded into the cathode processor; the crucible is heated under vacuum to an intermediate temperature to distill the salt and cadmium from the crucible; the crucible is heated further to melt and consolidate the heavy metal; the <b>crucible</b> and <b>charge</b> are then cooled forming a heavy metal ingot in the crucible mold. The cathode processor development program has progressed through the design, fabrication, qualification, and demonstration phases. Two identical units were built. One (a prototype unit) has been installed at Argonne's site in Illinois and the other (the production unit) has been installed in the Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) at Argonne's Idaho site. Both units are presently in operation. The most recent activities completed in the FCF fuel processing project were the EBR-II driver fuel and blanket fuel demonstration phases. All of the cathode processor success criteria were met during these demonstration phases. These included finalizing the operation conditions applicable to irradiated fuel and process throughput criteria...|$|R
40|$|Relationship between {{preparation}} {{conditions of the}} raw <b>charge,</b> <b>crucible</b> material, growth regimes and structure defectness and electrophysical properties of crystals Cd₁₋x ZnxTe has been studied. The crystals were grown both from the raw material which had been pre-synthesized in quartz ampoules and from the raw material synthesized from the elements directly in the growth furnace. It is shown that the best values of electric resistivity ρ (up to 10 ¹¹ Ohm⋅cm) and sensitivity to X-ray and gamma-radiation are obtained for crystals grown in crucibles of highly pure coal-graphite material from the pre-synthesized raw charge. Correlation has been established between values of ρ and crystal defectness: decrease of dislocation density by 10 ⁴ times led to 10 ⁷ times higher values of resistivity. Concentration of dislocation etching pits regularly decreased with higher purity of the raw material and optimization of crystal preparation technology...|$|R
5000|$|An {{induction}} furnace {{consists of a}} nonconductive <b>crucible</b> holding the <b>charge</b> of metal to be melted, surrounded by a coil of copper wire. A powerful alternating current flows through the wire. The coil creates a rapidly reversing magnetic field that penetrates the metal. The magnetic field induces eddy currents, circular electric currents, inside the metal, by electromagnetic induction. [...] The eddy currents, flowing through the electrical resistance of the bulk metal, heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic materials like iron, the material may also be heated by magnetic hysteresis, the reversal of the molecular magnetic dipoles in the metal. Once melted, the eddy currents cause vigorous stirring of the melt, assuring good mixing. An advantage of induction heating is that the heat is generated within the furnace's charge itself rather than applied by a burning fuel or other external heat source, which can be important in applications where contamination is an issue.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a numerical solution method for the simulation {{of a cold}} crucible induction melting process involving the coupling of electromagnetic, temperature and turbulent velocity fields. The cold crucible induction melting (CCIM) is a process to melt extremely reactive alloys when purity is required. An example of such an alloy is titanium, {{which can be used}} for the manufacturing of medical implants, turbine blades and turbocharger rotors. During the CCIM process, the metal charge is contained on a water cooled segmented cooper crucible, and the energy necessary to heat, melt, and overheat the charge is generated by an electromagnetic field induced by a solenoidal coil surrounding the <b>crucible.</b> Once the <b>charge</b> is melted, the induced electromagnetic forces push the metal away from the wall. Hence, the electromagnetic field and the associated force fields are strongly coupled to the free surface dynamics of the liquid metal, the turbulent fluid flow within it, and the heat mass transfer. In order to understand how each parameter of the process affects in the overheating of the liquid, a computer simulation model has been developed using the software COMSOL Multiphysics. The electromagnetic field is solved in the frequency domain, while temperature and fluid flow phenomena are solved in the time domain...|$|R

On crystal growth experiments, the Pt <b>crucible,</b> which was <b>charged</b> with Li₂CaSiO₄ powder and LiCℓ flux, was soaked at the temperatures of 885 ～ 1025 ℃ and then slowly cooled at the rates of 1. 6 ～ 4. 2 ゜/h to about 600 ℃. Many of the Li₂CaSiO₄ crystals were generally colorless and transparent, and partly included imperfections. Some of them were free from inclusions and good of quality. Single crystals of Li₂CaSiO₄ were crystallized into octahedron except prismatic shape and bounded by o{ 111 } faces. From the XRD and DTA, the phase relation is as follows: 963 ℃ low₋Li₂CaSiO₄ ⇌ high₋Li₂CaSiO₄ The low ⇌ high transformation at 963 ℃ is relative rapid and reversible. The tetragonal cell constants of the low-Li₂CaSiO₄ crystal are α= 7. 1319 and c= 6. 4746 Å. The possible space groups may be P 4 ₂/ncm, P 4 /mcc.
