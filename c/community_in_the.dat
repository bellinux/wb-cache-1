5|$|A turn-of-the-20th-century {{apartment}} construction boom {{allowed the}} expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area. The transition was rapid and marked with conflicts such as the Race Riot of 1919. Some white Protestants left to form an exclusive residential <b>community</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership.|$|E
