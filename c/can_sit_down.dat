Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality {{to a greater extent than}} ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and talk about it." ...|$|E

One such section is of The Wash, rich in mediaeval detail. Marshes {{such as those in}} Lincolnshire, Norfolk and the Pevensey Levels were reclaimed at this time, whole communities working together, often under the Danelaw.|$|E

If, as a viewer, you <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and {{say they}} are the same, then there is little point of making any new shows, if the {{slightest}} similarity (puppets and animals) can be suggested as idea stealing. I am surprised Basil Brush hasn't been on the blower, as he is a fox, and that must be a copy! Right? I worked on both, and {{know for a fact}} where they both come from.

500|$|The {{corporations}} happily publicized {{the efforts}} of these “literary mill girls”, boasting {{that they were the}} “most superior class of factory operative,” which greatly impressed foreign visitors to Lowell. But this masked the bitter opposition of many workers to the twelve to fourteen hours of monotonous, exhausting work, which they saw was corrosive to their desire to learn and educate themselves. “Who,” asked an operative writing in the Voice, “after thirteen hours of steady application to monotonous work, <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and apply her mind to deep and long continued thought? …Where is the opportunity for mental improvement?” ...|$|E
500|$|The Avatar Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was {{released}} on , 2010. Three {{different versions of the}} film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut, the special edition cut, and a collector's extended cut (with the DVD set spreading them on two discs, but the Blu-ray set presenting them on a single disc). The collector's extended cut contains 6 more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening". He stated the [...] "Earth opening" [...] is an additional 4½ minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release. The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.|$|E
2500|$|Referee Dougie McDonald {{announced}} his early retirement {{with immediate effect}} after the strike weekend, in order to remove the issue of his disputed actions which in part led to the strike, from the ongoing debate about referees treatment. A statement from the referees after the strike said, [...] "Dougie retiring caps a sad time for Scottish refereeing. We hope the right people <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with referees and play a full part in delivering the real changes required." [...] adding that they hoped the strike had [...] "allowed everyone connected with Scottish football to have the period of reflection we felt was needed". Although Celtic made no official comment, Paul McBride, a QC {{closely linked to the}} Celtic board of directors, commented that the club felt vindicated by the departures of Dallas and McDonald.|$|E

2500|$|Ted and Robin playfully {{argue about}} who should slap Barney, begging off the honor to each other, but when Robin accepts, Ted gets angry. They then start to argue seriously on {{who gets to}} slap him. Barney tries to extend the argument, frightened of being tied to a chair and slapped. Robin gifts the slap to Ted, praising his growth since being left at the altar. Ted then gifts the slap to Robin, as closure to her {{relationship}} with Barney. Robin, unable to slap Barney, gifts the slap to Mickey as a welcome to the gang. Mickey then gifts the slap to Lily as an apology for his absentee parenting. Lily can't bring herself to slap Barney, and Marshall explains that he gave out the slap to bring everyone together. Barney is released from the chair, but before he <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to dinner, Marshall slaps him in the face, proclaiming, [...] "That's four!".|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
