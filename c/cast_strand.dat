The main preconditions for numerical simulation of {{the temperature}} fi eld of the solidifying strand are correct boundary conditions, especially the surface condition in the secondary zone of the caster. The paper deals with techniques of determining the surface condition under cooling nozzles {{as well as their}} approximation and implementation into the model algorithm. Techniques used for laboratory measurements of both cold and hot spraying characteristics of water or water-air cooling nozzles are described. The relationship between the cold and hot characteristics was found. Implementation of such a dependence into the model algorithm reduces the duration and cost of laboratory measurements.

The design of the numerical model of the steel continuous casting process was presented and which was developed based on the actual dimensions of the slab continuous casting machine in ArcelorMittal Poland Unit in Kraków. The S 235 steel grade and the <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> format of 220 × 1280 mm were selected for the tests. Three strand casting speeds were analysed: 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1 m min- 1. An algorithm was presented, allowing the calculation of the heat transfer coefficient values for the secondary cooling zone. In order to verify the results of numerical simulations, additional temperature measurements of the strand surface within the secondary cooling chamber were made.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the cast strands’ primary structure {{is a very complex}} process in terms of the thermodynamics and physicochemical. It occurs during solidification and crystallization of the liquid steel in the crystallizer and in the secondary cooling zone of the CC device. On the basis of the experience gained in the industry and knowledge arising from theory of metals and alloys solidification it can be concluded, that substantial influence on the shape of <b>cast</b> <b>strands</b> primary structure have the temperature of overheating of the liquid steel above liquidus temperature and solidification velocity. A proper control of those casting parameters allows to obtain the <b>cast</b> <b>strands</b> with desired primary structure. In the one and two-way symmetric devices regulation like this is not problematic, in the multi-way devices - specially in the asymmetric - causes a series of problems. In those devices can occur a major temperature difference in each outlet zone of the tundish working space caused by i. e. the distance length diversity of liquid steel stream from the inlet to each outlet and by disadvantageous layout of liquid steel flow zones (turbulent flow zone, plug flow and dead zones) in working area of tundish. Particularly high values of those diversity can be expected in the asymmetric tundishes...|$|R
50|$|Profitable {{operations}} {{as well as}} market demand prompted a major commitment to build a Continuous Casting department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous <b>casting</b> <b>strands</b> and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to {{the efficiency of the}} operations and improved the quality of the finished product.|$|R
40|$|By {{a special}} {{plastometric}} method, the straightening {{operation of a}} vertically <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> of two carbon steels was simulated. The temperature dependence of the low strain rate plasticity of both the steels examined is analogous although caused by very different reasons. As to the plain carbon steel, the amount of ferrite and its location is of prime importance, whereas {{in the case of}} eutectoid steel various modes of fracture and the influence of temperature on the relative plasticity of type II MnS inclusions are influencial. To avoid transverse cracking, it seems to be suitable to keep the strand at a rather high temperature (above 900 degrees C). Temperature cycling seems to be fundamental as to the structural changes taking place in the strand (grain size refining, ferrite fraction if any), whereas analogous influences of straining are more or less inexpressive. Of course, the results obtained are of quality only since the practical and laboratory conditions differ significantly. The knowledge obtained could be applied in regulating the intensity of strand cooling with the aim of lowering the waste portion and improving the surface quality of worked products...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the methods of}} inverse {{problems}} solution are applied for the identification of substitute heat transfer coefficient in the primary cooling zone of continuous casting plant. The heat exchange between the <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> and the continuous casting mould proceeds in the very complex conditions (air gap, layer of mould dressing, fouling etc.). For the needs of casting solidification modelling the real boundary condition on the contact surface should be simplified and one can introduce the mean boundary heat flux (the Neumann condition) or the substitute heat transfer coefficient (the Robin condition). These values can be found using the inverse approach. In order {{to solve the problem}} of identification, the gradient methods are here applied (the least square criterion with regularization parameter). The algorithm presented bases on the sensitivity analysis methods, in other words the values of temperature derivatives with respect to the unknown nodal heat transfer coefficients must be known.

The strand width exiting from the casting machine, has a direct influence on the product yield which in turn influences the profitability of the company. In general, the strand width control on the austentic and ferritic type steels achieved is excellent {{with the exception of the}} 12 % chrome non stabilised ferritic steel. This steel type exhibited different strand width changes when a sequence of different heats was cast. The strand width changes corresponded to the different heats in the sequence. Each heat has a unique chemistry and a relationship between the austenite and ferrite fraction at high temperature and the resulting strand width change was explained by Siyasiya[27].

A level of steel in the tundish is changing during sequential continuous casting. The most significant decrease in the steel level occurs when replacing ladles. It is generally known that if the height of steel level in the tundish drops below a certain critical level, it may generate vortexes over the nozzles {{and as a consequence}} entrainment of tundish slag into individual <b>casting</b> <b>strands</b> can occur. Thus, it is necessary to identify the critical level of steel for specific operational conditions.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the areas}} in the {{continuous}} casting process {{that has not been}} definitively instrumented is a method for reliably locating the part of a continuously <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> that remains liquid for a period after the outer portion has solidified. Therefore, this paper is focused on the measurement of the solidification point made by a through transmission technique based on the relationship between ultrasonic speed and measured temperature using an EMAT sensor. Design/methodology/approach: An EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) has been designed and fabricated with an elongated spiral coil and a permanent magnetic core. Al 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mm holes were produced and demonstrated that the location of the final solidification point during the continuous casting process can be monitored using a 1. 0 MHz frequency. Findings: The solidification point in a continuous casting bloom could be detected through a series of tests {{with the use of a}} fabricated probe and the amplitude extent of ultrasonic wave decreases as the hole diameter of the simulators increases. Furthermore, through a test of lift-off effect it was found that the extent of amplitude decreases as lift-off increases, thus one of the most important factors for a field application. Research limitations/implications: As cutting speed and cutting length can be predicted from a miniaturization of the sensor and construction of an on-line system for a field installation, a considerable amount of time and energy can be saved by reducing mistake ratio and curtailing unnecessary processes. Originality/value: The measured ultrasonic waves allow for prediction of the casting speed necessary to correctly locate the liquid core and thereby maximize the benefits of soft reduction and the productivity of the machine...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were made on the 42 CrMo 4 steel based process of small-size rings manufacture of weight not exceeding 100 kg and the internal diameter up to 600 mm. Findings: Microstructure heterogeneity has been proven on the cross section of rods and rings under hot rolling and thermal treatment. Non-uniformity in hardness distribution was found on the hot rolled rings’ face surface and cross section. Final products made from rings with heterogeneous properties characterize: difficulties with machining, cracking during surface hardening and decrease of life time. After the process modification, the rings’ microstructure homogeneity and advantageous hardness distribution were obtained. Practical implications: A good quality of final rings after heat treatment is obtained in the case of charge characterized by a uniform pearlitic/ferritic microstructure. After the process technology modification, the rings’ microstructure homogeneity and advantageous hardness distribution were obtained.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{new knowledge}} about physical and numerical modelling of a non-stationary steel flow into a mould through a subentry shroud with an inner, pressed metering nozzle. The physical and numerical modelling was realized under {{the conditions of}} the Department of Metallurgy and Foundry at VSB-Technical University of Ostrava. A special type of the subentry shroud is used during continuous casting of steel in Tøinecké `elezárny, a. s. During continuous casting of steel, two unfavourable phenomena were observed. In the first case, {{it was not possible to}} increase the casting speed, though the diameter of the metering nozzle was extended. In the second case, a fluctuation of the casting speed among individual <b>casting</b> <b>strands</b> was detected. These two problems did not allow an improvement of the performance of the casting machine. Therefore, the physical and numerical modelling was performed. Attention was focused on the verification of the effect of the inner diameter of the nozzle body and internal diameter of the metering nozzle on the resulting volume flow rates. Four diameters of the metering nozzle – (16; 17; 17. 5; 18) mm – were tested. The physical modelling was done on a 1 : 1 model constructed from Plexiglas. The numerical modelling was realized in the ANSYS FLUENT software. On the basis of the results of the modelling study and in cooperation with the VESUVIUS company, a new type of the profile of the subentry shroud with a metering nozzle was designed.
