50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process thereafter {{is similar to}} that of handmade paper. The boiled pulp is then put through pulp beaters. Colours or dyes are added when the pulp is beaten in the beater. Then the pulp is mixed with water, and lifted up on flat sieves, to dry into reams of paper. Once the paper has dried, it is either smoothened by stones or by passing it through a <b>calendering</b> <b>machine</b> to make it smooth and usable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} <b>calendering</b> <b>machine</b> and experimental results of calendering process. A particular pattern was printed on PET film by means of roll-to-roll gravure printing machine. The calendering process was applied {{to a set of}} samples and the effect was analyzed after measuring the surface roughness and the thickness of pattern. Although only mechanical pressure provided by a nip roll was applied during the calendering process, the experimental results indicate that the calendering process should be useful for enhancing the surface quality of roll-to-roll printed electronics products...|$|E
40|$|In this study, bulk {{conductivity}} of commercial base paper impregnated with different ionic liquids blends and additives, through bench coating was investigated. Bulk conductivity of base paper, ion conductive paper and surface sized ion conductive papers {{with and without}} the influence of calendering were evaluated at different concentrations of ionic liquids using at resistivity cell and four point probe technique. It was shown that {{bulk conductivity}} of base paper was increased by {{increasing the amount of}} ionic liquids. Nano fibril cellulose also showed positive influence on the bulk conductivity of coated papers. By increasing the line load in the <b>calendering</b> <b>machine,</b> a positive influence on the bulk conductivity was observed. The tensile index of all the coated papers was lower than that of the base paper...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the process and}} challenges of adding a new <b>calender</b> <b>machine</b> to AvCarb Material Solutions' pyrolytic graphite production plant. Before the machine {{could be used for}} mass production, several experiments needed to be conducted to better understand the capabilities of the machine. A process control procedure was designed to set up the machine to produce parts within specification. By using a one-factor-at-a-time approach, the process capability (Cpk) ofthe <b>calender</b> <b>machine</b> can be significantly improved. Additionally, the <b>calender</b> <b>machine</b> was used to investigate the significance of common defects on the uncalendered material. Experiments show that spots that are 3 millimeters or less, scratches, and certain ripples do not cause a destructive effect on the calendered sheet; therefore, sheets with these defects can be safely passed through the quality inspection stage. Foreign object debris causes bubbles, which are destructive effects, to appear on the calendered sheet; therefore, sheets with foreign object debris should not pass inspection. However, if the foreign object debris is physically removed from the sheet before calendering, the resulting sheet will not have any destructive defects. Thus, by not rejecting uncalendered sheets with certain defects, AvCarb can improve its process yield. Additionally, a thermal conductivity test apparatus was designed and used to determine that the calendered heat spreader is 70 % more thermally conductive than its uncalendered counterpart. by Ernest Knute Svenson.

40|$|Abstract. A {{simplified}} numerical approach {{based on}} the Finite Element Method (FEM) to compute the steady state temperature field and thermal stresses in a thermal roll of a <b>calender</b> <b>machine</b> is proposed. The temperature distributions of the working roll and thermal oil were investigated by fluid dynamics theory. With the acquired roll body temperature, the deformation and stress were calculated. This approach is suitable for fluid-structural and thermal-stress problems and hence helpful for the design and improvement of such equipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an investigation on {{the failure of}} a large leaded bronze bearing that supports a nine-ton roller of a plastic <b>calendering</b> <b>machine.</b> At the end of the normal service life of a good bearing, which lasted for seven years, a new bearing was installed. However the new one failed catastrophically within a few days, generating a huge amount of metallic wear debris and causing pitting {{on the surface of the}} cast iron roller. Following the failure, samples were collected from both good and failed bearings. The samples were analyzed chemically and their microstructures examined. Both samples were subjected to accelerated wear tests in a laboratory type pin-on-disk apparatus. During the tests, the bearing materials acted as pins, which were pressed against a rotating cast iron disk. The wear behaviors of both bearing materials were studied using weight loss measurement. The worn surfaces of samples and the wear debris were examined by light optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and energy-dispersive x-ray microanalyzer. It was found that the laboratory pin-on-disk wear data correlated well with the plant experience. It is suggested that the higher lead content (similar to 18) of the good bearing compared with 7 lead of the failed bearing helped to establish a protective transfer layer on the worn surface. This transfer layer reduced metal-to-metal contact between the bearing and the roller and resulted in a lower wear rate. The lower lead content of the failed bearing does not allow the establishment of a well-protected transfer layer and leads to rapid wear...|$|E
