50|$|Richard Arkwright was a hard-nosed {{businessman}} from Preston. Arkwright {{produced a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> that was unlike Hargreaves hand operated spinning jenny. The jenny required two motions, one to draw {{and the other}} to spin and wind. Arkwrights frame spun and wound {{at the same time and}} was operated by turning a wheel. The prototype that was powered by hand, was patented in 1769. The process was particular suitable to the application of power which in those times meant a water wheel. Arkwright developed the principle into an industrial machine where a pair of frames would have 96 spindles. In searching for a reliable source of power Arkwright set up his first factory on Cromford, on the River Derwent in Derbyshire. In 1775, he filed a patents for powered preparatory machines that would card and scutch the roving needed by the waterframe. The lantern frame, to draw the roving, and development of the waterframe known as a throstle followed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{strength}} parameters of cotton yarns formed on the Rieter R 1 <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> {{and on the}} Textima ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> were analysed. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the influence of linear density of the feeding sliver and of yarns on their specific strength, elongation and elasticity was evaluated. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the following parameters were used: ■ rotational speed of the rotor- 100, 000 r/min (1666. 7 r/s) ■ rotational speed of the opening roller- 7, 000 r/min (116. 7 r/s) ■ linear density of yarns: 18, 20, 25, 30 tex. The <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> was fed with slivers after the second passage of drawing with the linear densi-ties: 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0 ktex. On the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> yarns of linear densities of 25 and 40 tex were formed from the roving 400 tex. Analysis of the results for rotor-spun and ring-spun yarns showed that rotor-spun yarns are characterised by higher elasticity, which makes them a very good material for knitting purposes.

40|$|FANCY YARN is a yarn with {{deliberate}} imperfections. Strange {{as it may}} appear, {{in present}} times when defect-free yarn {{is considered to be}} a premium product, fancy yarns, with all their imperfections, are also in demand. It is a different matter that the volume production of fancy yarn is insignificant in comparison to the normal yarn production. The demand for fancy yarns is due to the special aesthetic appeal it imparts to the fabric made using such fancy yarns. Fabrics produced using fancy yarn find applications in normal and high-fashion clothing, curtains, carpets, upholstery fabrics, as a base for "effect" wallpaper manufacture and many more. Ring spinning is successfully employed to manufacture fancy yarn. Rotor spinning, which offers economical benefits over ring spinning, has also been employed to produce fancy yarn. A number of ideas have been applied in practice to produce fancy yarn on rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machines.</b> The approach of these conventional devices has been to control the speeds of the mechanical elements of the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine.</b> Because the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> is a very high speed <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> with the latest ones having rotor speeds of over 100 000 rpm, the conventional devices become limited in their approach, not application. A new approach is therefore necessary to produce fancy yarn on rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machines.</b> This work is a new approach in that direction. The principal idea is to affect the fibre flow without altering the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine.</b> To bring about this influence of the fibre flow, pressurized air has been employed for the first time. The concept of using pressurized air not only offers a new alternative to produce fancy yarn on rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machines,</b> but also offers a simple and relatively inexpensive route to fancy yarn manufacture. Hence, this approach has been referred to as pressurized air method of producing fancy yarn. The fibres flowing in the fibre transport channel of the rotor spinning box are affected by pressurized air. This influence of the flowing fibres by the pressurized air causes the effects or the imperfections in the yarn being spun to result in a fancy yarn. The duration of the time the pressurized air is applied to affect the fibre flow, influence the characteristics of the effects such as thickness, length and appearance. By programming the pressurized air blowing time, effects can be produced in a predetermined way. In this way the need to alter highly frequently the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> is obviated. As with the conventional methods employed on rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> in the production of fancy yarns, the pressurized air method also has its own limitations. While the conventional methods can only produce effect lengths longer than the rotor circumference, the pressurized air method can only produce effect length shorter than the rotor circumference. But by combining the conventional method and the pressurized air method, the shortcomings of the two methods can be overcome in a unique way. This work, being the first of its kind, provides a fairly comprehensive understanding of the concept of using pressurized air in the production of fancy yarns on rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss in}} a {{systematic}} way the gauge theory for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle proposed by Schuster and Toro. We show that it is naturally formulated in a cotangent bundle over Minkowski spacetime where the gauge field depends on the spacetime coordinate x^μ and on a covector η_μ. We discuss how fields can be expanded in η_μ in different ways and how these expansions are related to each other. The field equation has a derivative of a Dirac delta function with support on the η-hyperboloid η^ 2 + 1 = 0 and we show how it restricts {{the dynamics of the}} gauge field to the η-hyperboloid. We then show that on-shell the field carries one single irreducible unitary representation of the Poincaré group for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle. We also show how the field can be used to build a set of covariant equations found by Wigner describing the wave function of one-particle states for a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle. Finally we show that {{it is not possible to}} couple minimally a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particle to a background abelian gauge field, and make some comments about the coupling to gravity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{description}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> massless fields of mixed-symmetry type in Minkowski space {{at the level of}} equations of motion. It is based on the appropriately modified version of the constrained system originally used to describe massless bosonic fields of mixed-symmetry type. The description is shown to produce generalized versions of triplet, metric-like, and light-cone formulations. In particular, for scalar continuous fields we reproduce the known Schuster-Toro formulation. Because a <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> system inevitably involves infinite number of fields, specification of the allowed class of field configurations becomes a part of its definition. We show that the naive choice leads to an empty system and propose a suitable class resulting in the correct degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate that the gauge symmetries present in the formulation are all Stueckelberg-like so that the <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> system is not a genuine gauge theory.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a gauge theory action for <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particles formulated in a spacetime enlarged by an extra coordinate recently proposed by Schuster and Toro. It requires one scalar gauge field {{and has two}} gauge symmetries. We show that the gauge symmetry is reducible {{in the sense that}} the gauge parameters also have a gauge symmetry. Using reducibility we get an action which has two scalar gauge fields but just one irreducible gauge symmetry. We then show how the equations of motion are related to previously proposed equations for <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> particles. There is a limit where the <b>continuous</b> <b>spin</b> Schuster-Toro action reduces to a higher spin action containing all integer helicities. We then show how the action with two fields and its field equations are related to other known formulations of higher spin field theories. We also discuss briefly the physical content of each formulation. ar X i...|$|R
