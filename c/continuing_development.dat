In the same year, the Tenrikyo central church announced {{the construction of the}} first wing of the yakata. The <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> of the oyasato-yakata is currently overseen by a committee with a small office in Tenri Seminary.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E
5|$|Among the Antaimoro people, the {{production}} of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists. Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> {{of fine arts in}} Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by {{overgrazing}} during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, as {{a result}} of the <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> in the {{relationship}} between the university and the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the Privy Council approved the necessary changes to the university's Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became The University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, the university and Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004. This move ended the federal partnership between the two institutions, although collaboration between the two is being maintained.|$|E
5|$|The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II (in the {{indigenous}} language Mapuche, Pulqúi: Arrow) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank {{in the late}} 1940s in Argentina, under the Perón government, and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unrealized fighter project, the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. The Pulqui II's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy, {{with two of the}} four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes. Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora, the political, economic and technical challenges faced by the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential, and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F-86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of <b>continuing</b> <b>development</b> of {{the indigenous}} fighter to production status.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Southeast Asian heroin entering into China, Southwest Asian heroin enters northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.

25|$|Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.
