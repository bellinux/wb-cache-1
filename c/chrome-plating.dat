50|$|Niobium alloys {{in general}} are {{inconvenient}} to weld: {{both sides of the}} weld must be protected with a stream of inert gas, because hot niobium will react with oxygen and nitrogen in the air. It is also necessary to take care (e.g. hard <b>chrome-plating</b> of all copper tooling) to avoid copper contamination.|$|E
5000|$|His {{earlier work}} was styled after {{that of the}} Taylor brothers, with broad {{rectangular}} keys {{along the back of}} the chanter, operated by small touches that wrapped around {{to the front of the}} chanter. The regulator keys at first resembled the Taylors' design, though Brown mounted them in wooden blocks, rather than between metal plates, as the Taylors did. His keywork is generally nickel-plated brass, though some are chromed (some chanters have both nickel- and <b>chrome-plating</b> [...] ).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s most {{refrigerators}} were white, {{but from the}} mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, brushed <b>chrome-plating</b> (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models from different brands. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, earth tone colors were popular, including Harvest Gold, Avocado Green and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s stainless steel came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to specializing in pliers, the company strategy includes complete in-house manufacturing. The intention {{here is to}} directly influence all the products' quality based characteristics, like precision, hardness and ease of operation. In {{addition to}} drop forging with its own tool manufacturing the production offering also includes machining (broaching, drilling, milling and grinding) as well as laser machining. The joining of the two pliers shanks - typically by riveting - is followed by repeated heat treatment (heating and tempering) as well as various surface treatments (<b>chrome-plating,</b> painting, polishing).|$|E

40|$|AbstractStainless steels {{are used}} to intake and exhaust valves {{production}} applied as internal combustion engines. In general valves are requested to support cyclic stresses applied due to opening and closing processes during the operation. The objective {{of this research is}} to study the influence on the axial fatigue strength of the resulting microstructure after heat treatment at the martensitic X 45 CrSi 93 steel, combined with different surface treatments as hard <b>chrome-plating,</b> nitride and grinding. It was verified a significant increase on the fatigue strength of the martensitic steel after nitriding, compared with results from the <b>chrome-plating</b> specimens. A slight increase in the tensile strength was also noticed on nitrided parts as a consequence of a resistance increase due to nitrogen and carbon solid solution...|$|E
40|$|A new {{membrane}} {{process is}} described {{that can be}} used to recoverplating chemicals from electroplating rinse waters. The process, called coupled transport, is based on liquid membranes that are comprised of a thin, polymeric microporous support containing a metal-ion complexing agent within the pores. Metal ions present in the rinse solutions are transported across these membranes and can be concentrated into a relatively small volume. The results of a small-scale field test are presented in which hollow-fiber coupled-transport membranes were used to recover chromium from <b>chrome-plating</b> rinse waters. The results of a 125 -day test are used as the basis of an economic analysis that predicts a I. 7 -year payback period for a full-sized coupledtransport unit...|$|E
40|$|Chromium is corrosive, cytotoxic, and {{carcinogenic}} {{for humans}} and can induce acute and chronic lung tissue toxicity. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate Cr levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of workers exposed to Cr(VI) and to assess their relationship with biochemical changes in the airways by analyzing EBC biomarkers of oxidative stress, namely, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and malondialdehyde (MDA). EBC samples were collected from 24 <b>chrome-plating</b> workers employed in a <b>chrome-plating</b> plant both before and after the Friday work shift and before the work shift on the following Monday. Cr-EBC levels increased from the beginning (5. 3 µg/L) to the end of Friday (6. 4 µg/L) but were considerably lower on Monday morning (2. 8 µg/L). A similar trend was observed for H 2 O 2 -EBC levels (which increased from 0. 36 µM to 0. 59 µM on Friday and were 0. 19 µM on Monday morning) and MDA-EBC levels (which increased from 8. 2 nM to 9. 7 nM on Friday and were 6. 6 nM on Monday). Cr-EBC levels correlated with those of H 2 O 2 -EBC (r = 0. 54, p < 0. 01) and MDA-EBC (r = 0. 59, p < 0. 01), as well as with urinary Cr levels (r = 0. 25, p < 0. 05). The results of this study demonstrate that EBC is a suitable matrix that can be used to investigate both Cr levels and biomarkers of free radical production sampling the epithelial-lining fluid of workers exposed to Cr(VI).

30|$|The {{activity}} of iron titanate films was estimated using two photocatalytic {{processes of the}} anthropogenic pollutant removal: (i) the tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) originated from extensive development of pharmaceutical industry, and the wide human consumption, its accumulation in the soil and water sources leads to the change in ecological equilibrium of our Earth and (ii) the dichromate ions derived from the <b>chrome-plating</b> and electronic industries. These processes include two different mechanisms where a photogenerated hole {{is involved in the}} TC degradation and a photoformed electron participates in the dichromate reduction. Comparing the conversion efficiency of both processes, the estimation of the photocatalytic properties of the films can be done. Based on the obtained data, it was concluded that the photocatalytic {{activity of}} the films is connected with the adsorption capability of the films that is, in turn, dependent on the annealing temperature.|$|E
40|$|ASTRACT Decorative plastic {{films are}} {{becoming}} more and more popular in the industry, substituting paint, <b>chrome-plating</b> and hydrographics. Thermal formability of these films is extending the uses of these materials into newer applications within industry, but early observation have shown that certain film constructions will wrinkle upon heating. Despite growing interest and markets to use these films in thermal forming processes, there is insufficient knowledge in the field to explain or compensate for these undesirable surface wrinkles. The purpose of this study is to find out what caused the wrinkles, what the underlying behaviour was and if they could be avoided. The experiments were performed using a pressure sensitive adhesive coated decorative film, supplied by 3 M Canada, which was laminated on one of two different secondary substrates (either steel or polypropylene). Samples were heated in a specially built hot stage with vacuum drawing capability at two different heating rates up to one of two final temperatures (110 °C and ISO°C) and cooled down at two different rates, afterwards. A CCD camera was used to track the changes in the wrinkle pattern on th...|$|E
40|$|The study {{consisted}} in {{the analysis}} of the mobilization mechanisms of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) into groundwater from a decommissioned contaminated factory. The site is located in the Province of Vicenza and formerly was a <b>chrome-plating</b> plant. The subsoil consists predominantly of gravelly deposits with a thickness of at least one hundred meters. An unconfined aquifer is present with water table at about 23 m depth bgl. During the seven years of monitoring (2008 - 2014), the fluctuation of groundwater level was more than 6 m; hydraulic conductivity is about 1. 0 E- 03 m/s and groundwater seepage velocity about 12 m/day. At the area of the source of contamination, the unsaturated soil is contaminated by hexavalent chromium throughout the thickness: concentrations range from 200 to 500 mg/kg. At the bottom of zone of groundwater level fluctuation, the hexavalent chromium concentration decreases to below the detection limit. The available data (e. g. hexavalent chromium concentrations in groundwater, groundwater level, local rainfall) give the opportunity to assess the effects, on the magnitude of groundwater contamination, of the effective infiltration versus the fluctuation of groundwater level. The main analysis was performed on a statistical basis, in order to find out which of the two factors was most likely related to the periodic peaks of hexavalent chromium concentration in groundwater. Statistical analysis results were verified by a mass balance. Data show that at the site both the effective infiltration through the unsaturated zone and the leaching of soil contaminated by groundwater, when it exceeds a certain piezometric level, lead to peak concentrations of hexavalent chromium, even if with characteristics and effects different...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Exposure to {{hexavalent}} chromium in plating operations {{is associated with}} skin ulceration, contact dermatitis, respiratory tract irritation, cancer, and kidney damage. We investigated {{the possibility of using}} biological monitoring to assess exposure to {{hexavalent chromium}} in <b>chrome-plating</b> workers. We compared mean Cr 6 concentrations in the breathing zone plus urine chromium, β 2 microglobulin (B 2 M), and N-acetyl-B-D- glucosaminidase (NAG) {{at the end of the}} working shift. Then we assessed the correlation between exposure to hexavalent chromium and biological indicators. Materials and Methods: This study involved 45 chrome platers (Cases) and 40 zinc platers (Controls) in Isfahan. Air and urine samples were collected at the end of the work shift. Measurement of Cr 6 concentrations in the workers breathing zone was performed using the NIOSH Methods 7600. Urine Cr levels were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, with a graphite furnace (Shimadsu, AA 680). B 2 M and NAG were measured by Kits. Results: Overall, geometric mean of hexavalent chromium concentrations in the breathing zone was significantly higher among chrome platers (14. 577 μg/m 3) compared to zinc platers (0. 862 μg/m 3, p 0. 05). A significant correlation was found between Cr 6 concentrations in the chrome platers' breathing zone and their urinary chromium levels (r= 0. 838, p< 0. 001). A similar association was found between concentrations of Cr 6 and NAG in the breathing zone (r= 0. 304, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: As urinary B 2 M concentration did not change significantly, it may not be a sensitive indicator in evaluating exposure to hexavalent chromium. There were significant differences between mean urinary Cr and NAG concentrations in the two groups. The significant correlations between Cr and NAG concentrations indicate that these markers may be suitable indicators of exposure to hexavalent chromium. Our results indicate that NAG is an early indicator of renal dysfunction in chrome platers...|$|E
