[...] This same UN body had reiterated and extended his vote in his Opinion of August 2012, calling for triggering the relevant human rights mechanisms instead of relocation, and had reconfirmed that the conditions in the new location, Camp Liberty [...] "are synonymous with that of a detention centre as there is no possibility of freedom and interaction with the outside world" [...] and that [...] "there is no free movement and within the camp as well, rendering residents as detainees or prisoners. Furthermore, Martin Kobler had commissioned a report from a UNHCR shelter management expert, Martin Zirn, expecting him to certify that the foreseen location, Camp Liberty was matching international standards. However, the resulting draft report stated that the UNHCR cannot [...] "certify and/or verify that the above location meets Humanitarian Standards", [...] "bearing in mind that these are thought for Refugees in Emergencies". In fact, the shelter expert considered Camp Ashraf a community that was facing eviction from a site where they had lived for over 26 years, what is different from a situation of emergency like a civil war or a natural disaster.|$|E
