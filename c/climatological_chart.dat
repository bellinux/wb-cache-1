40|$|Recent work {{demonstrated}} that the shape of tornado intensity distributions from various regions worldwide is well described by Weibull functions. This statistical modeling revealed {{a strong correlation between}} the fit parameters c for shape and b for scale regardless of the data source. In the present work it is shown that the quality of the Weibull fits is optimized if only tornado reports of F 1 and higher intensity are used and that the c-b correlation does indeed reflect a universal feature of the observed tornado intensity distributions. For regions with likely supercell tornado dominance, this feature is the number ratio of F 4 to F 3 tornado reports R(F 4 /F 3) = 0. 238. The c-b diagram for the Weibull shape and scale parameters is used as a <b>climatological</b> <b>chart,</b> which allows different types of tornado climatology to be distinguished, presumably arising from supercell versus nonsupercell tornadogenesis. Assuming temporal invariance of the climatology and using a detection efficiency function for tornado observations, a stationary climatological probability distribution from large tornado records (U. S. decadal data 1950 - 99) is extracted. This can be used for risk assessment, comparative studies on tornado intensity distributions worldwide, and estimates of the degree of underreporting for areas with poor databases. For the 1990 s U. S. data, a likely tornado underreporting of the weak events (F 0, F 1) by a factor of 2 can be diagnosed, as well as asymptotic climatological c,b values of c = 1. 79 and b = 2. 13, to which a convergence in the 1950 - 99 U. S. decadal data is verified...|$|E
40|$|This Atlas {{presents}} {{primary data}} on meteorology, oceanography, and hydrobiology from the Barents, Kara, Laptev, and White Seas, which {{were collected by}} scientists from different countries during the period 1810 - 2001. The data format that we use in the electronic (DVD) part of the atlas allows one to quantitatively access information for oceanographic variables as well as plankton, benthos, fish, sea birds, and marine mammals. The data are divided into one-degree squares with monthly climatic characteristics calculated for every square, which were used to plot monthly <b>climatological</b> <b>charts</b> of temperature and salinity. Access to the primary data is carried out through a graphical interface presented {{in the shape of}} a geographical chart. The Atlas also includes, in electronic format, selected copies of rare books and articles about the history of Arctic exploration and climate studies as well as photos and drawings, which provide information about the people and nature of the northern polar latitudes throughout the past two centuries...|$|R
40|$|An {{account is}} given of the {{climatology}} and interannual variability of dynamical quantities and ozone mixing ratios during the Southern Hemisphere spring for 1979 - 1984. The seasonal variation in {{temperature in the}} lower stratosphere is repeatable; a steep decrease in zonal mean ozone mixing ratios is observed around 60 deg S toward the South Pole in September which, with time, becomes shallower in association with minor warmings and a final warming. <b>Climatological</b> synoptic <b>charts</b> in the lower stratosphere show the circumpolar circulation in the geopotential height field and the prominence of planetary wave 1 in the temperature and ozone fields. When wave activity is strong, there are weaker westeries, higher temperatures, and higher ozone mixing ratios at high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|In 2015, the microclimatic {{monitoring}} of winter wheat canopy in location of Branišovice and Žabčice (the Czech Republic, central Europe) was established. Air {{temperature and humidity}} were measured in the ground layer of the vegetation. The soil temperature was measured in the depth of 5 centimetres. Measured data were compared with {{the data from the}} nearest <b>climatological</b> weather stations. <b>Charts</b> of differences between the microclimate of the undergrowth and the climate at the station were created. Data were evaluated using linear or polynomial regression analysis to create relation models between observed meteorological measurements. According to the Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture methods, the occurrence of the leaf pathogens was observed. The development of temperatures and humidity had been evaluated before the diseases struck...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{climatology}} and interannual variability of dynamical quantities and ozone mixing ratios during {{the southern hemisphere}} spring. Analyses are made mainly for six years, from 1979 to 1984,September through December, using the temperature and geopotential height data provided by the National Meteorological Center (NMC) and the ozone mixing ratio data derived from the solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument on board the Nimbus 7. The zonal mean climatology shows that the coldest temperatures and zonal winds move poleward and downward from September through November, probably in response to wave forcing. A steep decrease in zonal mean ozone mixing ratios is observed around 60 °S toward the south pole in September. With time, this high latitude ozone minimum (or "ozone hole") gets shallower in association with minor warmings and a final warming. <b>Climatological</b> synoptic <b>charts</b> in the lower stratosphere show the circumpolar circulation in the geopotential height field and a prominent planetary wave 1 in the temperature and ozone fields. The phases of the temperature and ozone waves in the lower stratosphere are very similar. The year-to-year variation of the ozone mixing ratio at high latitudes is related {{to that of the}} wave activity during the winter and spring. When the wave activity is vigorous, there are weaker westerlies, higher temperatures and higher ozone mixing ratios at high latitudes. It is possible that the long term change in the lower stratosphere are also related to the long-term trend in wave activity, although the evidence is not clear. Because the wave activity in 1979 was very vigorous, a simple comparison of atmospheric states between the 1979 and other recent years could lead to misleading conclusions on the rate of ozone decrease over the Antarctic. A long-term chemical effect is not precluded...|$|R

The seasonal variation of temperature in the southern hemisphere lower stratosphere is rather repeatable, indicating that means over a few years should provide a useful estimate of the climatology.

40|$|Images {{from the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{satellite}} {{have been used}} to investigate the meteorological and climate induced variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the North Sea. The meteorology has been characterized by the 11 weather types deduced from a refined system of Lamb’s classification of synoptic weather <b>charts.</b> <b>Climatological</b> effects have been related to the North Atlantic Oscillation index. The surface SPM concentration maps from MODIS have been ensemble averaged according to these weather types or climatological conditions. The data show that each type has a distinct distribution of surface SPM concentration in the North Sea. The differences are explained by different hydrodynamic and wave conditions. The occurrence of storms will impact the shallow regions by increasing the resuspension of bottom material. Prevailing winds will, on the other hand, change the residual transport of SPM in the North Sea. The more protected Southern Bight exhibits relatively stronger influences of advection, whereas in the central North Sea and the German Bight resuspension is more pronounced. This patterns result in an alternation of relatively high SPM concentration in the Southern Bight and {{in the rest of the}} southern North Sea during certain weather conditions. Limitations in satellite images have been assigned to stratification effects due to the occurrence of highly concentrated mud suspensions during certain weather types. The approach provides a tool to improve our understanding of coastal and shelf sea processes, especially with respect to variations of SPM concentration distribution according to weather, climate and climate change...|$|R
