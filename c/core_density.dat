40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Overall wood {{density is}} a complex trait {{resulting}} from the interaction of three components: average earlywood density, average latewood density, and latewood proportion. In order {{to better understand the}} genetic control of wood density in juvenile Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and to assess the utility of information on its components for improving the efficiency of selection for overall wood density, wood density components were examined in 15 -year-old trees of 60 open-pollinated families. Wood density traits were obtained on a ring-by-ring basis by X-ray densitometry of increment cores. In addition to providing information on overall wood density traits over the entire cores, these data made it possible to examine changes in wood density traits with increasing distance from the pith. Relationships between wood density traits and growth phenology, and their implications for tree breeding, were also examined. Overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> showed strong genetic control (h = 0. 59) and a negative genetic correlation with bole volume (rA = - 0. 52). Wood density components were strongly genetically related with overall <b>core</b> <b>density,</b> but they were also strongly related among themselves and had lower heritability than overall <b>core</b> <b>density.</b> Therefore, information on density components would not be useful for improving the efficiency of selection for overall <b>core</b> <b>density,</b> or for reducing the negative correlated response on volume growth. It is possible, however, to substantially increase volume growth without loss in wood density, or even while slightly increasing wood density, when both traits are included in selection indices. Genetic control of overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> and its components increased with age (ages 7 to 15). Overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> and its components at age 15 were also strongly genetically correlated with their respective traits at all younger ages examined. Thus, early selection for overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> at age 15 would be very effective. Including density components as secondary traits did not enhance the efficiency of early selection for overall <b>core</b> <b>density.</b> Ring density and its components (adjusted by ring size) followed different age trends, but the slopes of the trends did not differ significantly among families. A plateau in the earlywood density trend was observed around age 12 in some trees, and families varied in the proportion of trees having this plateau. This proportion was not correlated with overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> or with growth traits at age 15. It is hypothesized that the plateau in earlywood density trend might be related to an earlier juvenile-mature transition age. Overall <b>core</b> <b>density</b> and all its components were negatively correlated with dates of cambial growth initiation and latewood transition, and positively correlated with date of cambial growth cessation.

These investigations concentrated on (Pb,Bi) 2223 phase high temperature superconducting tapes. Superconductors and their applications were briefly evaluated. It was found that high temperature superconductors have unique properties which cannot be duplicated by their counterparts. However, {{it was noted that}} there are significant improvements to be made before they can be commercially viable. An investigation was carried out into the variation of <b>core</b> <b>density</b> within cross sections and along lengths of (Pb,Bi) 2223 tapes during fabrication. It was observed that rolling and thermal treatment brought about a non-uniform <b>core</b> <b>density</b> in both these aspects of tile tape. This was followed by an investigation into the effect of <b>core</b> <b>density</b> on the formation of the (Pb,Bi) 2223 phase. It was shown that a high <b>core</b> <b>density</b> formed the (Pb,Bi) 2223 phase at a slower rate than a lower <b>core</b> <b>density</b> under the thermal treatment. A high <b>core</b> <b>density</b> and a slow heating rate produced smaller 2212 grains {{at the end of the}} incubation period. Smaller 2212 grains were thought to be linked to the faster formation of the (Pb,B 1) 2223 phase. The highest Jc was from a high <b>core</b> <b>density</b> tape which had the smaller 2212 grains at the end of incubation period. Smaller 2212 grains were thought to aid a more homogeneous conversion to the (Pb,Bi) 2223 phase. Alloy-sheathed (Pb,Bi) 2223 superconducting tapes were produced in order to fabricate a more homogeneous <b>core</b> <b>density.</b> It was found that the alloy sheath (with an addition of 15 % wt Ag in the precursor powder) changed the characteristics of the core in several ways: the formation of the (Pb,Bi) 2223 phase was homogeneous across the thickness of the core, a smaller 2212 grain size was formed at the end of the incubation period and a higher <b>core</b> <b>density</b> during thermal treatment. All these factors together produced a higher Jc and a more homogeneous tape with reproducible results. A rig was designed and built to detect inhomogeneities in a non-destructive manner. The rig incorporated the use of an array of hall probes to measure the magnetic field above a high temperature superconducting tape. The method was successful in detecting macroscopic inhomogeneities such as cracks caused by bending the tape and holes drilled through the core. Finally, a rig was designed and built to measure the transport current as a function of V along consecutive 1 cms of length of high temperature superconducting tapes at liquid neon temperatures. The inferior sections of the tape appeared to be more significant at 27 K compared to 77 K.
