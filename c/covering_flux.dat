In order to assess the melting behaviour, the granules were heated at 700 °C for 30 min under three different protective environments, including <b>covering</b> <b>flux,</b> argon atmosphere and their combination. Thermal analysis experiments were carried out to disclose the heating profile of the granules and to detect any probable characteristic temperatures.

With {{the means}} of {{thermodynamic}} calculation and alloy smelting, the reaction of Mg-Y-Mishmetal-Zr melt {{in the process of}} smelting is studied and the relevant thermodynamic data are obtained. The results show that when rare earth (RE) reacts with MgO to seize the oxygen, Y has the strongest capacity while La has the weakest capacity, and Y is most likely to be burned due to preventing melt oxidation.

The purpose is to investigate the influence of alloy composition and oxidation conditions on mechanical properties of oxide films; to study the enrichment of the aluminium-lithium alloys with sodium and calcium impurities and the influence of impurities on ductility ofthe alloy grade 1420 and to design the <b>covering</b> <b>fluxes</b> for aluminium-lithium alloys. It is shown that the amorphous oxide films have maximum strength and the crystalline films have minimum strength at a moment when they lose their dictility. The principles of selection of protective additions are substantiated. The negative influence of sodium on the dictility of the alloys grade 1420 due to the formation of extended pores is detected. The recommendations for impurity limitations in the aluminium alloys are given in order to decrease the oxidation and to increase the ductility of the alloys.

Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} sensorless direct flux vector control scheme for {{synchronous}} reluctance motor drives. Torque is controlled at constant switching frequency, via the closed loop regulation of the stator flux linkage vector and of the current component in quadrature with it, using the stator flux oriented reference frame. A hybrid flux and position observer combines back-electromotive force integration with pulsating voltage injection around zero speed. Around zero speed, the position observer takes advantage of injected pulsating voltage. Instead of the commonly used current demodulation, the position error feedback is extracted here at {{the output of the}} observer's flux maps, thus resulting in immunity towards the cross-saturation position error. The Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) strategy is used. A detailed analysis puts in evidence the key advantages and disadvantages related {{to the use of the}} MTPA in the sensorless control of the Synchronous Reluctance machine, for both the saliency based and the back-EMF based sensorless methods.

As recent studies have shown, Lyα fluxes can be underestimated {{by a factor of}} two or more via traditional methods, and so we undertake a careful assessment of each object's Lyα flux using a curve-of-growth analysis to account for extended emission. We describe our self-consistent method for determining the completeness of the sample, and present an {{estimate of the}} global Lyα luminosity function between redshifts 2. 91 < z < 6. 64 using the 1 /Vmax estimator. We find the luminosity function is higher than many number densities reported in the literature by a factor of 2 - 3, although our result is consistent at the 1 σ level with most of these studies. Our observed luminosity function is also in good agreement with predictions from semi-analytic models, and shows no evidence for strong evolution between the high- and low-redshift halves of the data. We demonstrate that one's approach to Lyα flux estimation does alter the observed luminosity function, and caution that accurate flux assessments will be crucial in measurements of the faint end slope.

At first, the application {{share of the}} inverter voltage vectors for the stator <b>flux</b> <b>covering</b> half a sextant is defined and predicted. The prediction indicates that, under operation at fixed inverter dc link voltage and stator flux magnitude, the application share depends only on the supply frequency of the motor and, to a small extent, on the load. Afterwards, the inverter transitions and the corresponding phase commutations within a stator flux sextant are analyzed. The outcome of the analysis permits to compute the commutations of the inverter phases in one turn of the stator flux and, from them, the inverter switching frequency is obtained.

Hydrophilic particles were readily engulfed while hydrophobic particles, at best, adhered to the surface of the drop, or failed to attach. Moreover, the recovery of the hydrophilic silica particles was significantly higher than the recovery of hydrophobic coal particles, with the selectivity ratio approximately 1. 5. Spherical ballotini particles were the most sensitive, with a notable increase in recovery when cleaned, and evidence of increased recovery with increasing particle size.

However, studies simultaneously accounting for both spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2 aq) and CO 2 fluxes in lakes are rare. We measured pCO(2 aq) (by both manual sampling and mini loggers) and CO 2 <b>fluxes,</b> <b>covering</b> spatial variability in open water areas of three lakes of different character in a Swedish catchment for 2 years. Spatial pCO(2 aq) variability within lakes was linked to distance from shore, proximity to stream inlets, and deepwater upwelling events. Temporally, pCO(2 aq) variability was linked with variability in dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen. While previous studies over short time periods (1 to 6 h) observed gas transfer velocity (k) to be more variable than pCO(2 aq), our work shows that over longer time (days to weeks) pCO(2 aq) variability was greater and affected CO 2 fluxes much more than k. We demonstrate that 8 measurement days distributed over multiple seasons in combination with sufficient spatial coverage (8 locations during stratification periods and 5 or less in spring and autumn) are a key for representative yearly whole lake flux estimates.

We sought to test whether the quiet Sun flux detected by Hinode is due to a local or the global dynamo by studying long-term variations in the polarisation signals detectable at the disc centre of the quiet Sun between November 2006 and May 2012, with particular emphasis on weak signals in the internetwork. Methods. The investigation focusses on line-integrated circular polarisation Vtot and linear polarisation LPtot profiles obtained from the Fe I 6302. 5 Å absorption line in Hinode SOT/SP. Results. Both circular and linear polarisation signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected pixels from 2006 until 2012. There is also no variation in the magnetic flux in this interval of time. The probability density functions (PDF) of the line-of-sight magnetic flux can be fitted with a power law from 1. 17 × 1017 Mx to 8. 53 × 1018 Mx with index α = − 1. 82 ± 0. 02 in 2007. The variation of α’s across all years does not exceed a significance of 1 σ. Linearly polarised features are also fitted with a power law, with index α = − 2. 60 ± 0. 06 in 2007.

500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the <b>flux</b> <b>covering</b> disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|R

40|$|Humans {{have greatly}} {{impacted}} the processes and intensities of erosion, sediment {{transport and storage}} since the introduction of agriculture. However, {{the relation between the}} intensity of anthropogenic disturbance and the magnitude of change in sediment dynamics is highly non-linear due to the importance of intrinsic controls on sediment propagation. Especially the buffering capacity of slopes and floodplains can be held responsible for this non-linearity, as both sinks store the produced sediment temporarily, obscuring the relation between sediment production and sediment output. Slope-stream connectivity, but also the duration and typology of anthropogenic disturbance controls the existence of thresholds that need to be crossed before significant changes in downstream sediment dynamics are recorded following human impact. Many internal feedback mechanisms, such as those between erosion and soil thickness, further complicate the story. Several concepts have been developed over the last few decades to explain the complex behavior of sediment transfers in the combined hillslope-fluvial system, including the 'sediment cascade' model and the 'fast-in, slow-out' model. However, none of these concepts seems to hold universally when reconstructing historical sediment dynamics for contrasting environments, as is illustrated with case-studies from a range of environments in Belgium, Turkey and the USA. Detailed field-based sediment budgets from these contrasting settings combined with spatial modeling of sediment <b>fluxes</b> <b>covering</b> time periods ranging from 200 to over 5000 years, as well as the use of pollen and sediment provenancing techniques, shows that no overarching concept of sediment source-to-sink following anthropogenic disturbance can be established. Rather, depending on the duration and typology of anthropogenic disturbances, in combination with local environmental conditions, unique patterns of geomorphic process response emerge. As a result, unravelling the human impact from current-day sediment archives and predicting the impact of future human disturbances on river and sediment behavior remains a major challenge. This has important implications for interpreting contemporary sediment yields as well as downstream sediment records in large floodplains, delta's and the marine environment, in terms of changes in the drivers of environmental change. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Montane {{forests are}} exposed to high ambient ozone (O 3) {{concentrations}} that may adversely affect physiological processes in internal cells when O 3 molecules enter the plants through the stomata. This study addresses the model results of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose metric (POD) based on estimation of stomatal O 3 flux to dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We focused on two different bioclimatic regions: (1) the temperate mountain forests in the High Tatra Mts (SK–HT) of the Western Carpathians, and (2) the Mediterranean forests of the Alpes–Mercantour (FR–Alp) in the Alpes–Maritimes. Field measurement of O 3 concentration and meteorological data incorporated into deposition model DO 3 SE showed lower O 3 flux in FR–Alp than in SK–HT plots for the 2016 growing season. Model outputs showed that soil humidity {{play a key role}} in stomatal O 3 uptake by montane pines at the alpine timberline. We found that temperate climatic conditions in SK–HT with sufficient precipitation did not limit stomatal conductivity and O 3 uptake of P. mugo and P. cembra. On the other hand, the Mediterranean mountain climate characterised by warm and dry summer reduced stomatal conductance of pines in FR–Alp. POD without threshold limitation i. e. POD 0 as a recently developed biologically sounded O 3 metric varied near around and below critical level (CLef) depending upon different conditions of sunshine exposure in SK–HT plots. Field observation at these plots showed relatively weak visible O 3 injury on P. cembra (2  % and 7  %) when compared with P. mugo (8  % and 18  %) for one year (C+ 1) and two year (C+ 2) old needles, respectively. Despite of low POD 0 values, clearly below CLef, the highest level of visible O 3 damage on average from 10  % (C+ 1) to 25  % (C+ 2) was observed on P. cembra needles in Mediterranean (FR–Alp) area. Further research is needed to clarify the effect of real soil moisture regime on stomatal closure in dry areas (FR–Alp) and resistance of pine species against visible O 3 injury in wet subalpine zones (SK–HT). More attention should be paid to O 3 <b>fluxes</b> <b>covering</b> a year-round growing season as well as intra-daily dynamics, especially the night hours, since these time spans appear to play significant role in O 3 uptake by mountain conifers...|$|R
40|$|Dust has the {{potential}} to modify global climate by influencing the radiative balance of the atmosphere and by supplying iron and other essential limiting micronutrients to the ocean (Martin et al., 1990, doi: 10. 1038 / 345156 a 0; Martin, 1990, doi: 10. 1029 /PA 005 i 001 p 00001). Indeed, dust supply to the Southern Ocean increases during ice ages, and 'iron fertilization' of the subantarctic zone may have contributed up to 40 parts per million by volume (p. p. m. v.) of the decrease (80 - 100 p. p. m. v.) in atmospheric carbon dioxide observed during late Pleistocene glacial cycles (Watson et al., 2000, doi: 10. 1038 / 35037561; Kohfeld et al., 2005, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 1105375; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2009, doi: 10. 1029 / 2008 PA 001657; Sigman et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 09149; Hain et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1029 / 2010 gb 003790). So far, however, the magnitude of Southern Ocean dust deposition in earlier times and its role in the development and evolution of Pleistocene glacial cycles have remained unclear. Here we report a high-resolution record of dust and iron supply to the Southern Ocean over the past four million years, derived from the analysis of marine sediments from ODP Site 1090, located in the Atlantic sector of the subantarctic zone. The close correspondence of our dust and iron deposition records with Antarctic ice core reconstructions of dust <b>flux</b> <b>covering</b> the past 800, 000 years (Lambert et al., 2008, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 06763; Wolf et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 04614) indicates that both of these archives record large-scale deposition changes that should apply to most of the Southern Ocean, validating previous interpretations of the ice core data. The extension of the record beyond the interval covered by the Antarctic ice cores reveals that, in contrast to the relatively gradual intensification of glacial cycles over the past three million years, Southern Ocean dust and iron flux rose sharply at the Mid-Pleistocene climatic transition around 1. 25 million years ago. This finding complements previous observations over late Pleistocene glacial cycles (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2006), providing new evidence of a tight connection between high dust input to the Southern Ocean and the emergence of the deep glaciations that characterize the past one million years of Earth history...|$|R
