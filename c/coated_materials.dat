As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging.

The anodic precursor oxide layer preserves the microstructure of the alloy {{because of the presence}} of secondary phases having a different behavior relative to the matrix during conventional anodizing. After PEO treatment, the coatings consisted of a mixture of alpha-Al 2 O 3, gamma-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and mullite (3 Al(2) O(3) center dot 2 SiO(2)). The effect of pre-anodizing on energy efficiency was investigated revealing considerable energy savings with the precursor porous films, because of the faster establishment of the so-called 'soft sparking' regime that promotes faster coating growth rate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{residual}} stress (RS) status induced in the substrate of <b>coated</b> <b>materials</b> by the coating process plays frequently {{a major role}} in lending the componentâs characteristics. RS assessment can give, thus, a substantial contribution in justifying different cases of failure or else bad performance of coated components due to e. g. the coating delamination or to other occurrences which are not simply interpretable via the conventional mechanical tests or microstructure analyses. The adoption of both neutron diffraction (ND) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques has revealed its usefulness in assessing the RS values in proximity of the coating interface area, respectively, without any layer removal or hole drilling at the extreme surface. In this paper, some real cases of RS determination in <b>coated</b> <b>materials</b> by using these techniques and exploiting their complementarity are described. ND, in particular, is very suitable for crucial applications, where a much different stress situation than that assessed by XRD could be present at some depth below the surface.
