A flush after <b>chlorpropamide</b> but not placebo was reported by 6. 2 % of non-diabetics (17 / 273), 9. 7 % of insulin-dependent diabetics (14 / 145), and 10. 5 % of non-insulin dependent diabetics (25 / 239), excluding those receiving long term <b>chlorpropamide</b> treatment. The differences were not significant. This response was unrelated to age, sex, body mass index, and family history of diabetes in all three groups. Patients taking long term <b>chlorpropamide,</b> however, showed a significantly (p less than 0. 01) higher prevalence of flushing after both <b>chlorpropamide</b> and placebo (56. 3 %; 9 / 16) compared {{with the rest of}} the non-insulin dependent diabetics (16. 7 %; 40 / 239), the insulin dependent diabetics (6. 9 %; 10 / 145), and the non-diabetics (5. 9 %; 16 / 273).

40|$|<b>Chlorpropamide</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} into clinical practice {{as a treatment for}} dia-betes insipidus (Arduino, Ferraz & Rodrigues, 1966) but its mode of action is unclear. The effect of <b>chlorpropamide,</b> its two principle breakdown products and two other sulphonylurea drugs has been studied both alone and in combination with vaso-pressin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP on water transport across the bladder wall of the marine toad, Bufo marinus (Bentley, 1958). A hemi-bladder from each toad acted as control to that used experimentally (sides A and B in Table 1) and the internal bladder solution was 10 mM-choline chloride. When added to various concentrations of vasopressin in Ringer's solution on the serosal surface of the bladder, <b>chlorpropamide</b> (3 =. =x 0 =-mol/l) caused a significant increase in water transport across the bladder wall. However, the drug alone had no effect (expt A). <b>Chlorpropamide</b> did not significantly increase water transport after the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the serosal surface (expt B) but there was a significantly greater response to the addition of 10 mmol/ 1 theophylline to the bladder in the presence of <b>chlorpropamide.</b> An interesting feature is that the response to <b>chlorpropamide</b> plus theophylline was significantly greater when <b>chlorpropamide</b> rather than theophylline was included in the incubation immediately before both drugs were present in the medium (expt C).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} previously that <b>chlorpropamide</b> and other hypoglycemic sulfonylureas interfere with hepatic triglyceride breakdown.

Ketogenesis from endogenous lipids was inhibited by 1 mM <b>chlorpropamide,</b> while ketone production from exogenous oleate did not change. The effect of <b>chlorpropamide</b> on hepatic triglyceride metabolism was further studied in the isolated perfused liver of normal rats {{in the presence of a}} continuous [3 H]oleate infusion and in isolated liver cells incubated in the presence of [3 H]oleate. In liver perfusion experiments, 1 mM <b>chlorpropamide</b> enhanced the incorporation of tritium into triglycerides (but not other lipid classes) and increased both liver triglyceride content and triglyceride secretion. Using isolated cells similar effects could be demonstrated at 0. 5 mM <b>chlorpropamide.</b> <b>Chlorpropamide,</b> tolbutamide, and carbutamide, all of which inhibited endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, also inhibited lysosomal triglyceride lipase activity in rat liver homogenates. The drugs were not inhibitory towards alkaline lipase activity. Demethylglycodiazin (2 -benzolsulfonamid [...] 5 -(beta-hydroxyethoxy) -pyrimidin), which did not inhibit endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, did not affect lysosomal lipase activity. The lysosomotropic drug chloroquine was markedly antiketogenic when tested in liver cells. The reduction in endogenous ketogenesis, the enhanced accumulation of liver triglycerides, and the stimulation of hepatic triglyceride output by <b>chlorpropamide</b> are ascribed to an interference of the drug with hepatic triglyceride breakdown.

Plasma <b>chlorpropamide</b> concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with positive ion electrospray ionization using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). From the <b>chlorpropamide</b> plasma concentration vs time curves, the following pharmacoldnetic parameters were obtained: AUC(0 - 72 h), AUC(inf) and C-max. Results: The limit of quantification was 0. 1 mu g/mL for plasma <b>chlorpropamide</b> analysis. The geometric mean and respective 90 % confidence interval (Cl) of Test/Reference percent ratios were 93. 99 % (87. 11 %- 101. 41 %) for C-max, 92. 45 % (85. 96 %- 99. 44 %) for AUC(0 - 72 h) and 90. 30 % (83. 35 %- 97. 82 %) for AUC(0 -inf). Conclusion: Since the 90 % CI for AUC(0 - 72 h), AUC(0 -inf) and C-max ratios were within the 80 - 125 % interval proposed by the US FDA, it was concluded that <b>chlorpropamide</b> 250 mg tablet (test formulation) was bioequivalent to the reference 250 mg tablet for of both the rate and extent of absorption...|$|E

The diabetic rats were divided equally into five groups and respectively treated: saline (diabetic control), extracts from neem and bitterleaf combined, neem only, bitterleaf only and <b>chlorpropamide</b> for a 24 day period. After oral administration of the first dose of extract (400 mg kg - 1 b. w.) and <b>chlorpropamide</b> (4. 286 mg kg - 1 b. w.), blood glucose was monitored in vivo at various time intervals for 9 h, thereafter daily administration continued for 24 days. Whereas single dose treatment with neem only showed peak reduction (28. 56 %) an hour after, treatments with combined extracts, bitterleaf and <b>chlorpropamide</b> had their peak reductions all at the 7 th hour (24. 78, 47. 31 and 60. 51 %, respectively).

Materials: Diabetes was induced by STZ injection (160 mg/kg, ip) in neonates (2 -day-old) Wistar rats. Treatment: n-STZ diabetic rats were treated with <b>chlorpropamide</b> (200 mg/kg, 15 d, by gavage) 8 weeks after STZ injection. Methods: Carrageenan-induced paw edema and pleural exudate volumes were assessed concomitantly with peripheral and exudate leukocyte count.

Glucose responsiveness was preserved in islets precultured {{in the presence of}} glimepiride, whereas high glucose level did not elicit any significant increase of insulin secretion from islets preincubated with glibenclamide or <b>chlorpropamide.</b> These alterations were reverted by an additional 48 -h incubation in drug-free conditions. The amount of apoptotic cells did not differ significantly among the experimental groups. Quantitative RT-PCR studies showed that, compared with the control islets, cells preincubated with glibenclamide or <b>chlorpropamide</b> had an increased expression of insulin mRNA, with no change in the expression of GLUT- 1. In conclusion, prolonged exposure of human islets to different sulphonylureas causes different disturbances of islet cell function, with glimepiride showing milder effects, as compared with <b>chlorpropamide</b> and glibenclamide.
