40|$|Abstract—Designing and verifying {{distributed}} protocols in a multi-rate asynchronous system is, in general, extremely diffi-cult {{when the}} distributed computations require consistent input views, consistent actions and synchronized state transitions. In this paper, we {{address this problem}} and introduce a formal, complexity-reducing architectural pattern, called Multi-rate PALS system, to support virtual synchronization in multi-rate distributed computations. The pattern supports a component to be virtually synchronized with other components in different instantiations of this pattern. We present an application of a hierarchical control system {{to show that the}} composition of these instantiations can be used to achieve desired system-level properties, such as distributed <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> distributed <b>coordination.</b> We verify the logical synchronization guarantee of this pattern which holds as long as the pattern assumptions are satisfied.

Pre-mission intelligence indicates that the airfield is not defended, and mission planning proceeds accordingly. While the UAVs are {{en route to the}} target, new intelligence indicates that a mobile surface-to-air missile launcher now guards the airfield. The UAVs autonomously replan their mission, dividing into two groups—a SAM-suppression unit and an airfield-suppression unit—and proceed to accomplish their objectives. During the flight, specialized algorithms for detecting and recognizing SAM launchers automatically upload and are integrated into the SAM-suppression unit’s software. In this scenario, new software components are dynamically inserted into fielded, heterogeneous systems without requiring system restart, or indeed, any downtime. Mission replanning relies on analyses that include feedback from current performance.

40|$|Executive Summary and Recommendations: Prevention and {{preparedness}} are crucially {{important considerations}} in determining natural disaster funding priorities and {{are capable of}} having much greater magnitude of influence and cost effectiveness compared to emergency response and recovery. Natural disaster funding also needs to include psychosocial recovery, which is {{an essential component of}} restoring individuals’ and communities’ mental health and wellbeing. Natural disasters will almost always overwhelm existing psychosocial services, and Federal funding is needed to augment services to meet increased demand. The APS makes the following recommendations in relation to the Inquiry: Recommendation: Preventive and preparedness initiatives are crucial Preventive and preparedness initiatives are a crucial funding priority. These initiatives equip a community to protect itself from a future disaster, reduce the impact of an event on individuals and communities, hasten the recovery, and have a much greater magnitude of influence and effectiveness than initiatives that come after the disaster. From a psychological perspective, these initiatives would include a host of risk reduction initiatives, including behavioural risk reduction strategies, improved warning systems and public messaging, community disaster preparedness education programs, psychological and household preparedness, psychological first aid, as well as thorough evaluation of program effectiveness so that evidence-based best practices are prioritised. Recommendation: Psychosocial recovery models need to be 3 -tiered, flexible, integrated and local Funding a 3 -tiered model of psychosocial care is critical to cost-effective funding options as it directs the majority of an affected population to the least expensive, population-based assistance which is likely to meet their needs, and reduces the demands on primary and specialist mental health care resources. Funding mechanisms for identifying mental health risk and need in a timely way throughout the population impacted by disaster are essential. This enables rapid mental health triage so that people at high risk can be rapidly matched to brief, evidence-based care. The use of these triage systems for mental health enables rational allocation of limited resources. Psychosocial recovery funding needs to be provided to local leaders in disaster-affected regions so that they can develop an integrated system of psychosocial and mental health care for disaster recovery tailored to their particular area. This funding {{can also be used to}} provide additional training in levels 1, 2 and 3 psychosocial care to saturate the workforce and bolster the existing pathways of care. Funding of a centralised, non-governmental agency designed to promote excellence in psychosocial recovery would improve the quality, <b>consistency,</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> of psychosocial responses to disasters in Australia.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} European Union and its member {{states have been}} able to balance {{normative}} priorities – specifically the promotion of human rights – and material priorities – specifically economic interests – within the strategy of constructive engagement towards China embraced since 1995. In order to respond to this central question this thesis originally elaborates a liberal intergovernmental approach {{for the study of the}} promotion of human rights within the EU’s system of multilevel governance in external relations. Such an approach is applied to analyse the issues of <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> in the policies for the promotion of human rights in China elaborated by the European Community and three selected member states, namely Germany, France and the UK. The choice of the country cases serves theoretical and analytical purposes. At a theoretical level it allows consideration as to whether the EU’s overall policies were mainly influenced by the interests and policy preferences of the three selected member states, which had the most bargaining power and the highest stakes in China, as expected by liberal intergovernmentalism. At an analytical level, the choice of the country cases allows for consideration of whether the EC’s policies for the promotion of human rights in China were coordinated with those of the three selected member states, which had the most conspicuous development assistance policies towards China and whose approaches to human rights in the country were broadly representative of the other member states. This supports the assessment of the achievement, or otherwise, of a significant EU promotion of human rights through development assistance in China. From the study it emerges that the EC and its three selected member states have been unable to devise consistent and coordinated policies for the promotion of human rights in China. On the one hand these findings suggest that the EU and its member states have been unable to balance normative and material priorities in their relations with China. On the other hand this thesis illustrates that this was due to the influence of the material interests and policy preferences of Germany, France and the UK, thus supporting the expectations of liberal intergovernmentalism. These findings form an original contribution to the study of the EU’s promotion of norms because they suggest that the EU can promote human rights, as well as other norms, in a consistent, coordinated and ultimately strategic way, only if the member states with the most bargaining power and the highest stakes in a specific policy issue privilege normative interests over material ones. At the same time this thesis offers an original contribution to EU-China studies on human rights, as it suggests that due to the present interests of the most influential member states, the EU’s promotion of human rights should be reframed to address what Chinese authorities are willing to accommodate in the human rights field, namely give preference to the support of socio-economic rights, where a consensus among the EU’s member states can more easily be built.

HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services {{and the role of the}} main actors in health systems. They also describe the institutional framework, process, content, and implementation of health and health care policies, highlighting challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Undoubtedly the dominant issue in the Dutch health care system at present is the fundamental reform that came into effect in 2006. With the introduction of a single compulsory health insurance scheme, the dual system of public and private insurance for curative care became history. Managed competition for providers and insurers became a major driver in the health care system. This has meant fundamental changes in the roles of patients, insurers, providers and the government. Insurers now negotiate with providers on price and quality and patients choose the provider they prefer and join a health insurance policy which best fits their situation. To allow patients to make these choices, much effort has been made to make information on price and quality available to the public. The role of the national government has changed from directly steering the system to safeguarding the proper functioning of the health markets. With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health care sector and the privatization of former sickness funds, the Dutch system presents an innovative and unique variant of a social health insurance system. Since the stepwise realization of the blueprint of the system has not yet been completed, the health care system in The Netherlands should be characterized as being in transition. Many measures have been taken to move from the old to the new system as smoothly as possible. Financial measures intended to prevent sudden budgetary shocks and payment mechanisms have been (and are) continuously adjusted and optimized. Organizational measures aimed at creating room for all players to become accustomed to their new role in the regulated market. As the system is still a "work in progress", it is too early to evaluate the effects and the consequences of the new system in terms of accessibility, affordability, efficiency and quality. Dutch primary care, with gatekeeping GPs at its core, is a strong foundation of the health care system. Gatekeeping GPs are a relatively unusual element in social health insurance systems. The strong position of primary care is considered to prevent unnecessary use of more expensive secondary care, and promote <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> of individual care. It continues to be a policy priority in The Netherlands. The position of the patient in The Netherlands is strongly anchored in several laws concerning their rights, their relation to providers and insurers, access to information, and possibilities to complain in case of maltreatment. In terms of quality and efficiency of the health care system, The Netherlands is, with some notable exceptions (e. g. implementation of innovations such as day surgery and electronic patient records), an average performer when compared to other wealthy countries. It is too early to tell whether efficiency and quality gains will occur as a result of the 2006 reform...|$|E

In particular strong effects of shared leadership on team performance were evident when both age diversity <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> were low, whereas shared leadership was not related to team performance when both age diversity <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> were high...|$|R

40|$|Agility in supply chains is {{critical}} for competitive advantages as it helps to explore and exploit opportunities in fast changing markets. Finns are increasingly dependent on information technology (IT) for supply chain management as a competitive tool to facilitate such agility. However, {{little research has been}} done on the role of IT on supply chain agility. The paper aims to address this gap by further investigating how IT applications affect supply chain agility. We propose that IT infrastructure integration, consisting of data <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> cross-functional application integration {{is critical}} to achieve agility as various integration processes in agile supply chains can be hampered by fragmented IT infrastructures which enable information flow <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> activities across function units and network partners. We further illustrate IT infrastructure integration impacts on agility in various operational dimensions, such as speed, flexibility across the supply chain. ...|$|R

In particular, we highlight two extraordinary managerial challenges that e-government poses: novelty and cross-agency cooperation. E-government is novel because it offers some fundamentally new possibilities for how government does business. The management of e-government is, in significant part, the management of ideas, creativity, and knowledge. E-government requires cross-agency cooperation because of functional needs for scale, <b>consistency,</b> <b>and</b> integration. We examine how four governments that have adopted a project-based approach {{to the introduction of}} e-government have coped with {{the challenges of}} novelty and cross-agency collaboration. Our findings indicate that e-government projects experience different activities <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> mechanisms according to the stage of completion of the project and the complexity of the task at hand. We discuss the implications of our findings for the management of e-government projects. ...|$|R
