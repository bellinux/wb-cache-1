50|$|They {{devised a}} plug {{placed in front}} of a {{radiating}} diaphragm to control the transition from compression cavity to horn throat. They found that the bandwidth of the transducer could be extended to higher frequencies using their phase plug. They also outlined criterion for the design of the channels in the plug and suggested a path-length based design approach to maximize the bandwidth. Significantly, their plug moves the <b>coupling</b> <b>point</b> between the cavity and horn away from the axis of rotation. This change significantly improves the transducer response as the effect of the acoustical resonances in compression cavity is reduced.

40|$|The average {{velocity}} {{field at the}} pump–turbine interface in a scaled version of a truck torque converter was studied. Seven different turbine-to-pump rotational-speed ratios were examined, ranging from near stall (0. 065) to overspeed (1. 050) so as {{to determine the effect}} of the speed ratio on the flow field and on the mass flow rate. Laser velocimetry was used to measure the flow velocity through the pump's exit and the turbine's inlet plane. At the pump's exit, as the speed ratio increases, the high velocities move to the pressure-shell corner and then to both the core-suction and the pressureshell corners. Concentrated velocity gradients are largest at the lowest speed ratio, but areas of velocity gradients are largest near the <b>coupling</b> <b>point.</b> Near the <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> the flow field is most nonuniform, which yields a highly periodic flow into the turbine inlet. Above the <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> the high velocity remains in the pressure-shell corner but separation is seen to develop at the highest speed ratio. At the turbine's inlet, reverse flow is seen at low speed ratios and is an indicator of flow leakage through the core. Velocity gradients are very large at low speed ratios. As the speed ratio increases to the <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> the high velocities remain on the shell side. Above the <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> the high-velocity flow migrates from the shell side to the core side. The mass flow rate decreases significantly and nonlinearly with the increase of the speed ratio, but for speed ratios greater than 1. 000, the negative slope decreases...|$|E

40|$|This thesis shows {{a concept}} of a <b>coupling</b> <b>point</b> for gripper fingers. These {{gripping}} fingers {{are part of a}} three-finger-gripper for a new research robot at the DLR (German Areospace Center). Changing the gripper fingers gives high flexibility with regard to the feasible gripping tasks and a simple structure of the three-finger-gripper with only four degrees of freedom. The concept includes a PCB with spring loaded contacts for electical connection and a conical dovetail joint for mechnical connection. The mounting direction of the <b>coupling</b> <b>point</b> is in the acutation direction of the linear drive for the gripper finger. The transmission of the mechanical degree of freedom is achieved with two racks and pinions and the overload release is bases on the friction effect. The realisation of the concept is critical due to the geometrical boundaries which leads to gripping forces below the requirements. Some possible solutions are contemplated and unconsidered areas for alternative solutions are shown...|$|E
40|$|The soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN) Heterodera glycines Ichinohe is responsible for substantial economic losses in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) production throughout the U. S. Results from past efforts to quantify the severity of crop damage resulting from SCN are often subject to variable experimental conditions resulting from differences in weather, soil type, and cultivar. Because of the difficulty in accounting for these variables, a process–oriented crop growth simulation model was chosen as a platform for studying the dynamics of SCN damage and for transferring knowledge between crop production scenarios. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate hypotheses for coupling SCN damage to the process–oriented crop growth model CROPGRO–Soybean. A monomolecular function was used to relate daily SCN damage to initial population density of SCN eggs. The equation was incorporated into the crop model in order to test two hypotheses of how SCN damage occurs. The first hypothesis was that SCN reduce daily photosynthesis (Pg), while the second hypothesis was that SCN reduce daily potential root water uptake (RWU). Canopy biomass data collected in 1997 and 1998 from a site in Iowa were used to estimate damage function parameters for two distinct coupling points, one applied to reduce daily photosynthesis (Pg) and the other applied to reduce daily potential root water uptake (RWU). Function parameters were estimated by minimizing the log transformation of root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and measured canopy biomass collected every 2 weeks during the season in Iowa. Biomass data collected in 1997 and 1998 from an independent site in Missouri were used to validate the SCN damage models. The minimum root mean squared errors (RMSE) of canopy and grain biomass were 0. 245 and 0. 198 log 10 (kg ha– 1), respectively, for the RWU <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> and 0. 238 and 0. 193 log 10 (kg ha– 1), respectively, for the Pg <b>coupling</b> <b>point</b> at the independent site in Missouri. The damage functions transferred very well to the independent site. Validation showed that the Pg <b>coupling</b> <b>point</b> represented the variability of both canopy and final yield data slightly better than the RWU <b>coupling</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{practical}} hybrid vibration absorber (HVA) is proposed for global vibration control of flexible structures under random stationary excitations. The HVA, regulated by a pole placement controller, uses a linear translational feedback signal to synthesize active moment via a moment actuator. It is shown, analytically and experimentally, capable of damping vibration {{in the entire}} primary structure. While the passive tuned mass damper (TMD) can suppress tonal vibration in the primary structure at {{the vicinity of the}} <b>coupling</b> <b>point,</b> it enhances vibration at other locations and other frequencies. The presented HVA, in contrast, can provide more than 48 % extra broadband attenuation on vibrations at multiple points when compared with the passive TMD in experimental verification on a beam structure.
