40|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> are {{available}} from many sources, often from materials separated from food production waste. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> for composite preparation should preferably be free of other plant material to allow optimum and consistent properties. Pure <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> have modulus and strength comparable with glass fibres and more favourable when relative fibre densities are considered. The pure fibres may be modified for compatibility with the matrix polymer. Physical and chemical separation and purification methods will be discussed with particular reference to bast fibres. The methods include retting, steam explosion, solvent extraction, alkali and enzyme treatment. Hydrophilic <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> require modification to reduce property variability with humidity and to increase compatibility with matrix polymers that are typically hydrophobic. Cellulose modifications include additive adsorption, reaction with surface additives including those that may directly further react with the matrix polymer, graft copolymerisation, absorption of additives into the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres,</b> and inclusion of fillers that can adsorb both <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> and matrix polymer.

30|$|The {{disintegration}} of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> into their structural components (microfibrils) has also found industrial interest. As mentioned above, in 1983, Turbak et al. [1] introduced a homogenisation procedure for fibrillating <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> with commercial purposes.

40|$|Traditionally, {{polymers}} and macromolecular components used in {{the foam}} industry are mostly derived from petroleum. The current transition to a bio-economy creates demand {{for the use of}} more renewable feedstocks. Soybean oil is a vegetable oil, composed mainly of triglycerides, that is suitable material for foam production. In this study, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil and variable amounts of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> were {{used in the}} production of bio-based foam. The developed macroporous bio-based architectures were characterised by several techniques, including porosity measurements, nanoindentation testing, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the introduction of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> during the foaming process was necessary to create the three-dimensional polymer foams. Using <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has potential as a foam stabiliser because it obstructs the drainage of liquid from the film region in these gas-oil interfaces while simultaneously acting as a reinforcing agent in the polymer foam. The resulting foams possessed a porosity of approximately 56 %, and the incorporation of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> did not affect thermal behaviour. Scanning electron micrographs showed randomly oriented pores with irregular shapes and non-uniform pore size throughout the samples...|$|R
50|$|Chemical pulping {{achieves}} this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules {{which can}} be washed away from the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> without depolymerizing the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> (chemically depolymerizing the <b>cellulose</b> weakens the <b>fibres).</b> The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods {{use a combination of}} chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping (TMP) and chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP). The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.|$|R

50|$|To {{enhance the}} paper's strength, {{cationic}} starch {{is added to}} wet pulp in the manufacturing process. Starch has a similar chemical structure as the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibre</b> of the pulp, and the surface of both the starch and fibre are negatively charged. By adding cationic (positive charged) starch, the fibre can bind with the starch and thus also increase the interconnections between the fibres. The positively charged portion of the starch is usually formed by quaternary ammonium cations. Quaternary salts that are used include 2.3-epoxy propyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (EPTAC, also known as or Glytac Quab, GMAC™) and (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC, also known as Quat 188, Quab 188, Reagens™).|$|E
5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibre</b> that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibre</b> and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} for polypropylene/cellulose composites {{has experienced a}} great increase in different applications such as car interiors and construction materials. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> are inexpensive, renewable, biodegradable, they present lower density and their mechanical properties {{can be compared to}} those of inorganic fillers. However, several factors must be considered when designing polypropylene/cellulose composites: the poor compatibility between the hydrophilic fibres and the hydrophobic thermoplastic matrix leads to a weak interface, which has to be improved by coupling agents; the hydrophilic nature of the fibres makes them very sensitive towards water absorption, which also leads to a loss of properties and swelling with subsequent dimensional instability; the reduced thermal stability of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> leads to degradation of the fibres at thermoplastic processing temperatures producing odours in the final material; and finally the properties of composites are greatly influenced by the structure, size and quality of the fibres. Pulp fibres modified by different methods in order to enhance the compatibility fibre-matrix, were tested. Modified fibres led to improved mechanical properties and thermal behaviour when used in composites with recycled polypropylene. Four different types of natural fibres were used as reinforcement in two different polypropylene types: virgin and recycled polypropylene. The mechanical properties of the composites were mostly dependent on the fibre loading and slightly dependent on the type of fibre. Moreover, water absorption kinetics was studied by the Fickian diffusion theory. After absorption, a remarkable loss of properties was observed. Hydrolysed <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> showed a greater enhancing effect on polypropylene than non-hydrolysed <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres.</b> This is attributed to the greater mechanical properties of reduced cellulose structures. The effect of using <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> in PP/clay nanocomposites was also studied.

50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} boards and cement fibre. Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibre,</b> {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|E

It was developed beginning in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers facility at Enka, North Carolina. This development was recognised by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) in 2003 by the awarding of their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention. The operating name for the fibre inside the Enka Organization was [...] "Newcell", and the development was carried through pilot plant scale before the work was halted. The fibre was developed further as Tencel in the 1980s by Courtaulds Fibres in Coventry, UK and at the Grimsby, UK pilot plant. The process was first commercialised at Courtaulds rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990) and at the Grimsby plant (1998). In 1998 Courtaulds was acquired by Akzo Nobel, who combined the Tencel division with other fibre divisions under the Acordis banner, prior to selling them off to private equity (CVC Partners).
