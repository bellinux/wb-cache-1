30|$|That corpus is {{exploited}} {{through the}} sequential and cross {{comparison of the}} significant variables, and through {{the analysis of the}} frequency of the legal references made. This analysis is completed by the textual statistical analyses performed with the software ALCESTE, so as to identify, through the language used in courts, the local specificities of the conflicts. These lexico-metric tools have only been used in the framework of the analysis of legal documents, which are well suited to this type of analysis due to the highly formalized structure of the argumentation. Without describing in detail the modalities implemented and the results obtained with this tool (Kirat and Torre 2004), it is useful to specify its scope as a component of a wider methodological approach to conflict analysis. The analysis of lexical statistics is justified {{by the fact that the}} language used in the court rulings is the product of the legislative or regulation texts used by the parties or the judge; this terminology is used to describe objects of protest or demand but also to express logics of action and goals (obtain the re-establishment of a right-of-way easement, the cancellation of a building permit in a zone of ecological interest, or the cancellation of a public inquiry conducted in the framework of a project of creation of a <b>Classified</b> <b>facility</b> for the protection of the environment). The lexical analysis is one of the elements of the study of the arguments mobilized by the actors. It enables us to show that one generic type of conflictual factors does not give rise to one unique and universal model of action in administrative courts. In other words, the actors seeking justice do not behave in a homogenous manner in all the cases studied.|$|E

Thus, intense conflictuality concerning urban development generally reflects a highly dynamic construction market. The succession of protests related to pollution issues is often the consequence of an area being highly exposed to nuisances because of the important number of <b>classified</b> <b>facilities.</b> However, the intensity of this conflictuality can be, in relative values, higher or inferior {{to that of the}} activity of reference.

A workshop to assist organizations in properly completing the list was held. Completed hazard screening lists were compiled for each ORNL division, and a master list was compiled for all Other Industrial, Radiological Hazard, and Non-Radiological facilities and activities. The master list was compared against the results of prior hazard analyses by research and development and environment, safety, and health personnel to ensure completeness.

40|$|Background: The {{surge of}} donor funds to fight HIV&AIDS {{epidemic}} inadvertently {{resulted in the}} setup of laboratories as parallel structures to rapidly respond to the identified need. However these parallel structures are {{a threat to the}} existing fragile laboratory systems. Laboratory service integration is critical to remedy this situation. This paper describes an approach to quantitatively measure and track integration of HIV-related laboratory services into the mainstream laboratory services and highlight some key intervention steps taken, to enhance service integration. Method: A quantitative before-and-after study conducted in 122 Family Health International (FHI 360) supported health facilities across Nigeria. A minimum service package was identified including management structure; trainings; equipment utilization and maintenance; information, commodity and quality management for laboratory integration. A check list was used to assess facilities at baseline and 3 months follow-up. Level of integration was assessed on an ordinal scale (0 = no integration, 1 = partial integration, 2 = full integration) for each service package. A composite score grading expressed as a percentage of total obtainable score of 14 was defined and used to <b>classify</b> <b>facilities</b> (# 80 % FULL, 25 % to 79 % PARTIAL and, 25 % NO integration).
