50|$|Because of {{sputtering}} {{occurring at}} the cathode, the colors emitted from regions near the cathode {{are quite different}} than the anode. Particles sputtered from the cathode are excited and emit radiation from the metals and oxides {{that make up the}} cathode.

50|$|Swept {{crystals}} are crystals {{that have}} undergone a solid-state electrodiffusion purification process. Sweeping involves heating the crystal above 500 °C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere, with a voltage gradient {{of at least}} 1 kV/cm, for several hours (usually over 12). The migration of impurities and the gradual replacement of alkali metal ions with hydrogen (when swept in air) or electron holes (when swept in vacuum) causes a weak electric current through the crystal; decay of this current to a constant value signals {{the end of the}} process. The crystal is then left to cool, while the electric field is maintained. The impurities are concentrated at the <b>cathode</b> <b>region</b> of the crystal, which is cut off afterwards and discarded. Swept crystals have increased resistance to radiation, as the dose effects are dependent on the level of alkali metal impurities; they are suitable for use in devices exposed to ionizing radiation, e.g. for nuclear and space technology. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and higher field strengths yields yet more radiation-hard crystals. The level and character of impurities can be measured by infrared spectroscopy. Quartz can be swept in both α and β phase; sweeping in β phase is faster, but the phase transition may induce twinning. Twinning can be mitigated by subjecting the crystal to compression stress in the X direction, or an AC or DC electric field along the X axis while the crystal cools through the phase transformation temperature region.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{physical}} model describing the electric arc attachment on electron emitting non-refractory (cold) cathodes is developed {{and applied to}} Cu, Fe and Ti cathodes. The model considers {{the possibility of a}} pressure build up in the <b>cathode</b> <b>region</b> due to the strong vaporization of the cathode, the formation of a cathode sheath according to the Bohm's model, and the ion-enhanced thermo-field emission of electrons by the cathode surface. The self-sustaining operating conditions of the discharge are defined by two simple criteria based on particle and energy balance considerations. Results clearly show the necessity of having high local metallic vapor pressures in the <b>cathode</b> <b>region</b> of non-refractory cathodes {{in order to have a}} self-sustaining arc attachment. A minimum pressure of at least 19 atm is needed for a Cu cathode. This minimum pressure is shown to decrease as the cathode material boiling temperature increases according to an exponential decay law. Current densities of the order of 1010 A m [...] 2 are maintained at the surface of a Cu cathode mainly by the emitted electrons. A comparison of the three different models for the electron emission current found in the literature allowed to define the limits of validity of each model for two typical arc-cathode interaction systems, and to evaluate the underestimation made on the emission current density when a less appropriate model is used. This underestimation is shown to cause an overestimation of important parameters such as the cathode surface temperature and metallic vapor pressure in the <b>cathode</b> <b>region.</b> An analysis of the mechanisms of heat transfer to the cathode surface allowed to show that the confinement of the cathode spot plasma forming the arc attachment could favor the production of vapors to the detriment of liquids.
