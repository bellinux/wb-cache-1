40|$|Results of {{this study}} show {{possibility}} of on-line measurement of colour using portable spectrophotometers. They are capable of evaluating extensive amount of animals on-line. Superchroma S-Spex is suitable for on-line measurements owing to its liw weight and efficient dimension. Determination of colour of pork was suggested to take on M. semimembranosus, on which colour can be evaluated without destruction of muscles. No significant difference can be suggested to be between the direction of muscular fibres of the M. Semimembranosus, which allows direct assessment of colour on carcasses, even if cuts on M. semimembranosus rising after halving are irregular to the direction of muscular fibres. Colour measured at 24 hours post mortem can not be foreseen at 45 minute post mortem. More work {{is needed to determine}} time of measurement. Measurement of colour at 45 minutes post mortem is performed together with <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>carcasses</b> but assessment of colour at 24 hours post mortem will be probably more agreed with parameters during sale.

Nevertheless, it is useful to look for other methods that will help enhance the parameters of the existing systems or that can be used independently in smaller abattoirs where it is impossible to use the existing costly systems. e method of bioelectric impedance analysis has been applied in research projects so far.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a lamb carcass classification {{system based on}} image and texture analyses together with multivariate statistical techniques (principal component analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant function analysis). Texture analysis is based on grey level co-occurrence matrix. A set of ninety texture features {{has been used to}} extract the texture information from the acquired images. In addition, twelve image area and thickness (geometric) variables have also been calculated. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original data set. Two feature sets were generated based on the results. These feature sets comprised of principal component (PC) scores calculated from the original variables and 14 (6 geometric and 8 texture) variables selected from the original set of variables. Both feature spaces were used for discriminant analysis. From the experimental results, it was established that the system enabled 66. 3 % and 76. 9 % overall classification based on 6 geometric PC scores and 14 (geometric and texture) PC scores, respectively.

40|$|<b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>carcasses</b> in the European Community {{is based}} on the lean meat {{percentage}} <b>of</b> the <b>carcass.</b> The lean meat percentage is predicted from instrumental carcass measurements, such as fat and muscle depth measurements, obtained in the slaughter-line. The prediction formula employed is derived from the data of a dissection experiment and has to meet requirements for authorization as put down in EC regulations. Requirements involve the sampling procedure and sample size for the dissected carcasses and the accuracy of prediction. Formulae are often derived by linear regression. In this paper we look at a particular type of sampling scheme. This involves selection <b>of</b> <b>carcasses</b> on the basis <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> measurements not all of which are intended to be used as prediction variables. This sampling scheme frequently appears in requests for authorization <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> measurement instruments and accompanying prediction formulae, {{despite the fact that it}} lacks formal statistical justification when used in conjunction with linear regression. The objective of this work was to assess the performance of the prediction formula that follows from this potentially faulty combination of sampling scheme and linear regression in relation to the requirements in the EC regulations. We show that this sampling scheme may produce poor predictions for lean meat percentage compared with proper sampling procedures with selection on prediction variables only or random sampling. We do so by computer simulation. Initially, simulated data were based on recent and historic data from The Netherlands. Prediction variables are fat and muscle depth measurements. The additional variable involved in sampling, but not included in the regression, was carcass weight. We also show that due to this faulty sampling scheme there is a serious risk that a new measurement instrument may not be authorized because performance criteria in the EC-regulations are not met...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the muscle fibre diameter of bulls (n = 136), heifers (n = 38) and steers (n = 18). The influence of age at slaughter, weight at slaughter, net daily weight gain, SEUROP meatiness and SEUROP fatness on the muscle fibre diameter was observed. The group of animals included Czech Red Pied and its crossbreeds (F 1) with the specialized meat breeds (Charolais and Galloway), further crossbreeds of hybrid bulls. Bulls were slaughtered at an average age of 587 days and average weight of 610 [*]kg. The average age of heifers was 644 days and average weight at slaughter was 550 [*]kg. The highest average age was that of steers (689 days) and they were fattened to the average weight of 610 [*]kg. The sample of musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis (m. l. th.) was used for the ana­ly­ses. The results showed that the muscle fibres were stronger in diameter in the negatively selected (culled) heifers (p > 0. 01) as compared to the category of bulls and steers. Apart from sex we also analysed the effect of age at slaughter of the individual animal categories on the fibre diameter. We discovered that the diameter of the fibre increased with age. The fibre diameter of bulls of up to 530 days of age was 37. 86 [*]µm and at the age of more than 601 days it was 39. 81 [*]µm. The diameter of the muscle fibres was also affected by the pre-slaughter weight. At lower weights the fibres of all categories of cattle were finer.

40|$|<b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>carcasses</b> in the European Community (EC) {{is based}} on the lean meat {{percentage}} <b>of</b> the <b>carcasses.</b> The lean meat percentage is predicted from instrumental carcass measurements, such as fat and muscle depth measurements, obtained in the slaughterline. The prediction formula for an instrument is derived from the data of a dissection experiment. When the relationship between percentage lean and instrumental carcass measurements differs between subpopulations, such as sexes or breeds, accuracy of prediction may differ between these subpopulations. In particular for some subpopulations predicted lean meat percentages may be systematically too low and for other subpopulations systematically too high. Producers or buyers that largely specialize in subpopulations where the percentage lean is underestimated, are put at a financial disadvantage. The aim {{of this paper is to}} gain insight, on the basis of real data, into the effects of differences between subpopulations on the accuracy of the predicted percentage lean meat <b>of</b> pig <b>carcasses.</b> A simulation study was performed based on data from dissection trials in The Netherlands, comprising gilts and castrated males, and trials in Spain, comprising different genetic types. The possible gain in accuracy, i. e. reduction of prediction bias and mean squared prediction error, by the use of separate prediction formulae for (some of) the subpopulations was determined. We concluded that marked bias in the predicted percentage lean meat may occur between subpopulations when a single overall prediction formula is employed. Systematic differences in predicted percentage lean between subpopulations that are overestimated and underestimated may exceed 4 % and for selected values of instrumental measurements may run up to 6 %. Bias between subpopulations may be eliminated, and prediction accuracy may be markedly improved, when separate prediction formulae are used. With the use of separate formulae the root mean squared prediction error may be reduced by 13 to 26 % of the expected value when a single prediction formula is used for all pig carcasses. These are substantial reductions on a national scale. This suggests that there will be a commercial interest in the use of separate prediction formulae for different subpopulations. In the near future, when the use of implants becomes more reliable, subpopulations will be recognized automatically in the slaughterline and use of different prediction formulae will become practically feasible. Some possible consequences for the EC regulations and national safeguards for quality of prediction formulae are discussed...|$|R

This model shows that the variables thickness of the thigh, height <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> and sex explain approximately 70 % of the complete variation of weight <b>of</b> a <b>carcass...</b>|$|R

40|$|Based {{upon what}} is known about the habits of common carrion eaters in Alberta, we review the {{patterns}} of postmortem scavenging <b>of</b> <b>carcasses</b> <b>of</b> cattle. We then compare with these patterns those reported in the lay press and by veterinarians investigating cattle mutilations in Alberta. We conclude that the so-called “mutilation” of cattle in Alberta was due to scavenging <b>of</b> <b>carcasses</b> and further conclude that claims of human involvement in such incidents require, as a first condition, that postmortem scavenging <b>of</b> the <b>carcass</b> be excluded...|$|R

With proper maintenance and monitoring, carcass composting systems can be safe and efficient with minimal environmental impacts. Importantly, proper composting eliminates many pathogens and may reduce levels <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> contamination with spore-forming bacteria, prions, and other pathogens...|$|R

Phenotypic correlation between cracass quality indices and meat yield <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> sides was investigated. Fatteners included in this research (117) were reared in non-conventional conditions, on deep litter, and as litter straw was used. Meat yield <b>of</b> pig <b>carcass</b> sides was evaluated on the slaughter line using the «two point » method (Džinić et al. 2004) and mathematical model using FOM-device (defined by Petrović et al. 1996). Meat yield <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> sides estimated using FOM was 56, 29 %, and by method of »two points « 53, 16 %. Of basic quality parameters <b>of</b> pig <b>carcasses</b> the strongest correlation assesed using FOM device was established between meat yield <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> side and thickenss of fat tissue – LF and RF, and using the method of two points, between meat yield <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> side and thickness of fat tissue- X 1 i X 2. Established correlations were negative, strong and statistically significant (- 0, 85 **;- 0, 87 ** and- 0, 97 **;- 0, 77 **). Results of the assessment of quality <b>of</b> pig <b>carcasses</b> obtained using method of two points (53, 16 %) and by instrumental method on right carcass sides using FOM device (56, 29 %) differed, which indicates need to develop new equations for evaluation/assessment of share of muscle tissue in pig carcasses...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{real-time}} ultrasound (RTU) {{can be used}} {{to gather}} live cattle data that subsequently can be used for the genetic prediction <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> cutability and meat quality traits. Initially, identification of sires that were superior for carcass merit could only be accomplished through progeny testing, an expensive, slow and logistically complicated process. Today, breed associations use RTU data solely or in combination with actual carcass data for computation <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> EPD. While much research should be done to improve the accuracy and cost of the technology, RTU provides a valuable tool for genetic selection <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> merit...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{collisions}} {{of birds}} with high-voltage electric power lines are scarce {{and are often}} gathered without protocols for the correction <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> disappearance. There is actually growing awareness {{that it is important}} to accomplish carcass removal trials in order to develop correction factors for producing adjusted estimates of mortality due to collisions. In this study, we provided for the first time raw counts and estimates of bird collisions across seven Italian areas that largely differ in their habitats. We also carried out carcass removal trials to compute the rate <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> disappearance and produce better estimates of collision events and of optimal time intervals <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> searches. Results <b>of</b> 1 -year monitoring showed a general low frequency of birds collided with the power lines. Carcass removal trials showed effects <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> size and season on the carcass disappearance, which varied largely among the study areas. In four areas, both small and large carcasses had more than 50 % probability to be removed within 3 – 5  days from their distribution. Given the high variation among study areas, we suggest that estimates <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> persistence and optimal time intervals should be conducted concurrently for each new study site...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was a trade <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> {{slaughter}} pigs by the SEUROP system in selected utilitarian breed. The experiment was conducted in a farm in Myslejovice. The {{first part of the}} thesis deals with the literature review on this topic. An experiment was conducted to assess the slaughter weight, the conformation, the inclusion in classes of the SEUROP system. The integral part of the experiment was to evaluate the production of pigs for slaughter. The obtained data were properly analyzed using mathematical and statistical methods. The experiment was conducted on 314 pigs during the period of 6 months. The results showed that 73 % of pigs were classified as a class E, the average price for 1 kg <b>of</b> <b>carcass</b> was 37. 82 CZK. The class S included 14 % of the slaughter pigs with the average price of 37. 3 CZK per 1 kg <b>of</b> <b>carcass.</b> The average conformation for the entire period amounted to 57. 6 %. The highest conformation of 59. 52 % was observed in the month of December. The conformation was much lower during the summer months...|$|R
