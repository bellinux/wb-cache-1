Bacteriol. 91 : 297 – 303. 1966. —Sodium citrate {{was found}} to effect {{extensive}} rupture of cyst coats of Azotobacter vinelandii. By filtering a citrate-ruptured cyst suspension through a Millipore microfiber glass prefilter, a preparation of viable <b>central</b> <b>bodies</b> was obtained that contained less than 1 % residual cysts and vegetative cells. Electron micrographs showed the <b>central</b> <b>bodies</b> to have a cell wall and cell membrane. Free <b>central</b> <b>bodies</b> germinated into typical vegetative cells. <b>Central</b> <b>bodies</b> exhibited approximately the same resistance to ultraviolet radiation, sonic treatment, and elevated temperatures as did vegetative cells; cysts were much more resistant. Manometric experiments indicated that <b>central</b> <b>bodies</b> and cysts have almost the same oxidative capabilities. Results of resistance studies indicated that the <b>central</b> <b>body</b> is a contracted vegetative cell encased in a protective coat. The cyst coat appears {{to account for the}} resistance of the cyst...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste computers {{is an issue that}} is gaining increasing interest around the world. In this paper, results from the fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor of three different waste computer monitor casings composed of mainly acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer and two different waste computer <b>body</b> <b>casings</b> composed of mostly poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) type polymers are presented. Preliminary characterization of the waste plastics was investigated using coupled thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FT-IR). The results showed that the plastics decomposed in two stages. For the ABS-containing monitor casings, aromatic and aliphatic material were released in the first and second stages. The PVC-containing computer <b>body</b> <b>casing</b> samples showed a first-stage evolution of HCl and a second stage evolution of aromatic and aliphatic material and further HCl. In addition, each of the five plastics was fast-pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C. The fluidized bed pyrolysis led to the conversion of most of the plastics to pyrolysis oil, although the two PVC computer body cases produced large quantities of HCl. The pyrolysis oils were characterized by GC-MS and it was found that they were chemically very heterogeneous and contained a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, halogenated, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds...|$|R

The <b>central</b> <b>body</b> is a sixteen-sided prism 1.75 m in diameter and 0.55 meters high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this <b>central</b> <b>body.</b> Exceptions are the masts and antennas used in scientific experiments and small telescopes that measure the zodiacal light that emerge from the <b>central</b> <b>body.</b> Two conical solar panels extend {{above and below the}} <b>central</b> <b>body,</b> giving the assembly the appearance of a diabolo or spool of thread.|$|R

40|$|Cyst {{germination}} in Azotobacter vinelandii ATCC 12837 was {{studied by}} using phase contrast and electron microscopy. Germination in this organism {{was accompanied by}} the formation of large cyst forms of two different types: giant cysts and cysts containing multiple <b>central</b> <b>bodies.</b> Previously, these two types have been reported only when yeast extract {{was added to the}} encystment medium. In this study, we observed giant cysts and cysts with multiple <b>central</b> <b>bodies</b> in nitrogen-free liquid medium. The germination of “normal” cysts is often preceded by enlargement to the giant form and division of the <b>central</b> <b>body</b> to produce cysts with multiple <b>central</b> <b>bodies.</b> Structures similar in appearance to ribosomal aggregates were observed only in cysts undergoing pregermination transformations...|$|R

When the mass density of this <b>central</b> <b>body</b> exceeds a particular limit, it triggers a gravitational collapse which, if it occurs with spherical symmetry, produces what is known as a Schwarzschild black hole. This occurs, for example, when the mass of a neutron star exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (about three solar masses).|$|R

Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearograph to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires {{over the life of}} the tire <b>body.</b> <b>Casings</b> fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.|$|R

We suggest that the evolutions of the waves' three fundamental frequencies and of the complex amplitudes of their spectral components encode (in principle) details of the <b>central</b> <b>body's</b> metric, the energy and angular momentum exchange between the <b>central</b> <b>body</b> and the orbit, and the time-evolving orbital elements.
