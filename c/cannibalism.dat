5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural <b>cannibalism,</b> {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural <b>cannibalism</b> first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural <b>cannibalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sexual <b>cannibalism</b> {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has {{sometimes}} been observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual <b>cannibalism.</b> Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape <b>cannibalism</b> after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard saw {{evidence}} of <b>cannibalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{voracious}} {{adults have}} very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They have a strong tendency for <b>cannibalism,</b> and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown <b>cannibalism</b> also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of <b>cannibalism</b> in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced <b>cannibalism.</b> Other evidence for <b>cannibalism</b> has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have {{suggested}} that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process. Evidence of <b>cannibalism</b> in Daspletosaurus was published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual <b>cannibalism</b> has been debated; {{experiments}} show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual <b>cannibalism</b> compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid <b>cannibalism</b> may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the <b>cannibalism</b> of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E
5|$|Nancy Graves {{was nine}} years old during the winter of 1846–1847. She refused to {{acknowledge}} her involvement even when contacted by historians interested in recording the most accurate versions of the episode. Nancy reportedly was unable to recover from her role in the <b>cannibalism</b> of her brother and mother.|$|E
5|$|Raksogana-bhojana (food of Rakshasas): Those who {{practise}} human-sacrifice and <b>cannibalism</b> are {{condemned to}} this hell. Their victims, {{in the form}} of Rakshasas, cut them with sharp knives and swords. The Rakshasas feast on their blood and sing and dance in joy, just as the sinners slaughtered their victims.|$|E
5|$|Spiders in the French {{territory}} of New Caledonia in the Pacific {{were identified as}} L. hasselti in 1920, based on morphology. Their behaviour differs from Australian redbacks, as they do not engage in sexual <b>cannibalism</b> and are less prone to biting humans. The first recorded envenomation in New Caledonia was in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Donner Party, or Donner-Reed Party, was a {{group of}} American pioneers led by George Donner and James F. Reed who set out for California in a wagon train in May 1846. They were delayed by a series of mishaps and mistakes, and spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the pioneers resorted to <b>cannibalism</b> to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Man-Eating Myth {{was widely}} {{reviewed}} in academic journals and also attracted attention from mainstream press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative {{nature of the}} work. Critics charged Arens with constructing straw man arguments and for exaggerating the methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of <b>cannibalism</b> led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy is an {{influential}} anthropological study of socially sanctioned cultural <b>cannibalism</b> across the world, which casts a critical {{perspective on the}} existence of such practices. It was authored by the American anthropologist William Arens of Stony Brook University, New York and first published by Oxford University Press in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The innate {{sexuality}} of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its intrinsic {{connection with}} <b>cannibalism</b> and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with semen being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and <b>cannibalism.</b> The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E
5|$|Workers use several {{different}} strategies {{to deal with}} their dead, including burying, <b>cannibalism,</b> and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends {{on the nature of the}} corpse a worker is dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).|$|E
5|$|Bokassa also {{hunted down}} Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died {{in prison in}} June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the {{exception}} of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until {{the downfall of the}} Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a witness in Bokassa's criminal trials for treason, murder, <b>cannibalism</b> and embezzlement during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, <b>cannibalism,</b> feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in <b>cannibalism,</b> and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. <b>Cannibalism</b> has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and <b>cannibalism</b> has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (<b>cannibalism)</b> might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for <b>cannibalism,</b> much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. <b>Cannibalism</b> amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale <b>cannibalism</b> has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of <b>cannibalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even <b>cannibalism</b> and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve <b>cannibalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|More unwelcome {{visitors}} then {{arrive in}} the shape of British pirates, who make a living by trading or stealing sandalwood. The three boys hide in a cave, but Ralph is captured when he ventures out to see if the intruders have left, and is taken on board the pirate schooner. He strikes up a friendship with one of the crew, Bloody Bill, and when the ship calls at the island of Emo to trade for more wood Ralph experiences many facets of the island's culture: the popular sport of surfing, the sacrificing of babies to eel gods, rape, and <b>cannibalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rick {{discovers the}} {{residents}} of Terminus engage in <b>cannibalism,</b> but the group manage to destroy Terminus and reunite. Some are injured and kidnapped to Grady, a hospital run by corrupt cops and doctors. When everybody regroups, they are approached by Aaron, inviting them to join a fortified community called Alexandria. The group are initially welcomed, but as the residents have not faced the zombie threat directly, Rick's group starts to take charge. Morgan, who has been searching for Rick, arrives and is shocked to see Rick killing an Alexandrian, who has been abusing his wife, in anger.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian media portrayed Franklin {{as a hero}} {{despite the}} expedition's failure and the reports of <b>cannibalism.</b> Songs were written about him, and statues of him in his home town, in London, and in Tasmania credit him with {{discovery}} of the Northwest Passage which was actually found by John Rae. Franklin's lost expedition {{has been the subject}} of many artistic works, including songs, verse, short stories, and novels, as well as television documentaries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cannibalism</b> of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other {{postulated}} causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), {{which are all}} within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual <b>cannibalism,</b> eating their mates after copulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of <b>cannibalism,</b> {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|Three court {{appointed}} psychiatrists found Kemper to {{be legally}} sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in <b>cannibalism,</b> alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with being labeled a serial killer.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} <b>cannibalism</b> may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
