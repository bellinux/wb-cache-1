The {{strength}} of nickel-based superalloys usually consists of {{solid solution strengthening}} from the gamma matrix and precipitation hardening due to the gamma ' and/or gamma " precipitates.

In low magnetic fields, H< 4 kOe, the measurements were performed {{in the range of}} vortex velocities v= 10 ⁻⁴– 2 m/s, which covers thermal creep and flux flow modes. The pinning force Fp nonmonotonically depends on magnetic field in both modes, though low-field minimum in the Fp(H) curve shifts to higher fields with increased velocity v, that is interpreted as partial ordering the vortex lattice. The increase of the pinning force Fp upon increasing the field, which is observed in the flux flow mode in fields H≥ 3 kOe, is interpreted by presence of finite transverse barriers. The barriers result in preserving the entangled vortex solid phase for the above-barrier vortex motion along the action of the Lorentz force.

By obtaining answers to pervade science questions on how to properly investigate the reliability of solder joints can increase lifespan (uptime) of all electronic devices, and especially those that are used in the process submitted severe external conditions (dust, humidity air, heat, mechanical stress). Design/methodology/approach - The basic demand for performing the experimental tests is to measure small displacements (order of fractions of micrometers or of single microns) occurring within the sample. The analysis of the displacement values in various environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, current flow) allows estimating how a given material behaves also in a longer time, under normal operating conditions. Unlike a commonly used method, based on measuring the time-to-failure, at which the item is damaged due to accelerated aging, a behaviour of the sample is being tested for the selected duration time and the given loading conditions. Findings - The theoretical analysis and performed numerical simulations of ATC tests based on developed failure and reliability investigation system (FRIS) imply proposed here combined loading approach a promising and affective method for accelerated reliability tests. Both indentation and FRIS techniques by numerous possibilities of loading conditions seem to be appropriate in order to study the creep and fatigue behaviour.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in finding the patterns of relaxation processes in metallic glasses under mechanical action at temperatures below that of glass-transition, which are a basis for approval of proposed theories to simulate relaxation processes in metallic glasses and implement their proactive behavior under various loading conditions. It is known that with tensile metallic glasses in <b>creep</b> <b>mode</b> at constant stress under isothermal conditions below the glass-transition temperature and stress in the nondestructive stress action the total strain consists of the elastic strain, immediately growing after the load applied, and the plastic deformation, growing in time. A Maxwell mechanical model takes into account that these two components of strain exist, and {{it can be used to}} describe the strain of solids at a qualitative level. The two available components of the total strain of both elastic and plastic form the basis for the proposed theories to describe the relaxation processes in metallic glasses. Therefore, in this paper we consider the possibility to simulate relaxation processes in metallic glasses, including quantitative estimates, using the Maxwell mechanical model. To solve this problem, in the mathematical description of the two-component mechanical model are introduced a dependence of viscosity on time, stress, activation energy, and temperature, as well as a provision of the activation energy being independent on the deformation modes when reaching the specified stress. Based on the equations has been developed a technique that uses the experimental creep curves to determine the elastic modulus and the parameters included in the dependence of viscosity. Applicability of the developed technique is demonstrated by comparing the experimental creep curves of metallic glass Co 57 Fe 5 Ni 10 Si 11 B 17 with the calculated creep curves of various histories. Based on the results obtained, the paper comes to conclusion that it is possible to use the Maxwell mechanical model to simulate the long-term relaxation processes in metallic glasses, provided that additional provisions and dependencies are introduced into mathematical description of model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Blowing snow in mountainous {{terrain is}} a complex {{nonlinear}} phenomenon driven by turbulent eddies with length scales ranging from millimetres to kilometres. Turbulent motions across {{a wide spectrum of}} sizes are superimposed on each other, interacting through a non-stationary energy and momentum cascade. In cold regions, snow redistribution by these turbulent motions impacts hydrology, glaciology, avalanche safety, and civil engineering. Blowing snow models typically rely on relating time-averaged turbulence statistics, which may oversimplify the complexity of the flow, especially in complex mountainous terrain, to steady-state snow transport. The present research sought to improve the understanding of the dominant structures in ASL turbulence relevant to snow transport, as well as characterize the short timescale response of blowing snow to specific eddy structures. A fundamental experiment was designed utilizing high-speed videography of laser illuminated near-surface blowing snow saltation coupled with adjacent 3 D sonic anemometer wind measurements at two heights. The experiments were conducted at Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta during nighttime blowing snow storms. Novel applications of particle tracking velocimetry and binarization algorithms to blowing snow recordings allowed extraction of time resolved snow particle velocities synchronized with instantaneous wind velocities, as well as time series of volumetric averages of blowing snow density in the first 30 mm above the surface. High-speed blowing snow video and measurements revealed the importance of the often- overlooked <b>creep</b> <b>mode</b> of transport to both transport initiation and flux. Blowing snow velocity and flux profiles were found to be temporally variable and dependent on instantaneous wind speed, with dominant modes of transport varying during turbulent gusts. Sweep and ejection wind events were coupled to blowing snow responses on sub-second timescales, with each quadrant event playing a unique role in transport initiation and sustaining snow fluxes. Finally, large low-frequency turbulent motions, hypothesized to follow a top-down characterization, were found to modulate the amplitude of near-surface turbulence, as well as directly contribute to blowing snow fluxes. The role of intermittent coherent turbulent structures challenges the ability of time-averaged turbulence statistics to represent the complexity of wind-snow coupling, especially in mountainous terrain. The strong relationship found between large-scale turbulence modulating eddies and near-surface turbulence, also challenges the efficacy of applying steady- state laboratory-derived flux relationships to model transport in the ASL. The results presented here, along with recent advances on coherent turbulent structures provide an optimistic semi- deterministic avenue for improving blowing snow models in complex mountainous terrain...|$|E

CYS is defined on a cyclic stress-strain curve, while monotonic yield strength (MYS, σm) is defined on a monotonic stress-strain curve. Both values of σc and σm are identified using a 2 -steps fitting procedure of the experimental stress-strain curves using Ramberg-Osgood and Chaboche material models. Comparison of σc and fatigue endurance limit σf on the S-N fatigue curve reveals that they are approximately equal. Hence, basically safe fatigue design is guaranteed in purely elastic domain defined by the σc. A typical creep rupture curve in time-to-failure approach for creep analysis has 2 inflections corresponding to the σc and σm. These stresses separate 3 sections on the creep rupture curve, which are characterised by 3 different <b>creep</b> fracture <b>modes</b> and 3 <b>creep</b> deformation mechanisms. Thus, basically safe creep design is guaranteed in linear creep domain with brittle failure mode defined by the σc. These assumptions are confirmed for several structural low- and high-alloy steels for normal and high-temperature applications...|$|R
