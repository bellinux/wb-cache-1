Flux calibrations of organic molecules and the initial growth of organic layers are described. For this purpose, the molecules 3, 4, 9, 10 perylene tetra carboxylic dianhydride and <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> were used. Layers were grown on oxidized and hydrogen passivated Si(100), Indium tin oxide and glass respectively. The growth was investigated with atomic force microscopy, reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. An investigation with x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy on the effect of atmospheric exposure is also included, showing little effect of surface pollution when the samples were handled carefully.

40|$|The {{interplay of}} {{exchange}} correlations and spin–orbit interaction (SOI) on the many-body spectrum of a <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> (CuPc) molecule and their signatures in transport are investigated. We first derive a minimal model Hamiltonian in {{a basis of}} frontier orbitals that is able to reproduce experimentally observed singlet–triplet splittings. In a second step SOI effects are included perturbatively. Major consequences of the SOI are the splitting of former degenerate levels and a magnetic anisotropy, which can be captured by an effective low-energy spin Hamiltonian. We show that scanning tunneling microscopy-based magnetoconductance measurements can yield clear signatures of both these SOI-induced effects...|$|E

The OSC devices are characterized by quantum efficiency, illumination and temperature dependent current voltage JV T measurements. The alteration of OSCs photovoltaic parameters is investigated as a function of ambiance, temperature, illumination and spectral irradiation. The main recombination pass which limits the solar cell performance, as observed from JV T measurements, is located at the CuPc C 60 domain interfaces. The lifetime of the devices is increased by about two orders of magnitude by storing devices under oxigen free conditions. Low temperatures do not significantly decrease the devices degradation rate. Light in the wavelength range of 495 570 nm increases the degradation rate of the organic solar cells. This fact is explained by alterations of the C 60 and CuPc C 60 interface physical properties under illumination in this wavelength range.

40|$|The initial {{interaction}} and interface formation between Cu(100) and the organic semiconductors 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> (CuPc) {{has been studied}} by means of angle-resolved UV photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS). Both CuPc and PTCDA are known to adsorb strongly on the Cu(100) surface. The bonding interaction is revealed via interface-related structures in photoemission spectra. However, the spectra develop rather differently in the low coverage regime: while CuPc molecular states are observed below monolayer coverage, the first PTCDA layer {{is found to be}} reacted such that the adsorbate-induced emission is strongly modified relative that of intact PTCDA molecules. We find a number of structures that are neither PTCDA- nor Cu-derived, and that the oxygen-related component of the PTCDA spectrum is completely missing in spectra from the monolayer. Importantly for device applications, we find evidence of interfacial electronic states in the form of new peaks located in the former HOMO-LUMO gap for both molecules. In the case of PTCDA these support a chemisorptive bonding model, whereas in the case of CuPc we interpret the state as a monolayer-specific resonance...|$|E
40|$|The {{mesocarp}} and epicarp {{components of}} the babassu palm tree were applied as novel alternative biosorbents for <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> textile dye removal from aqueous solutions. The natural biopolymers were characterized by elemental analyses, solid state (13) C NMR, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffractometry. Results demonstrated that the compositions of the mesocarp and epicarp {{are similar to those}} of other lignocellulosic materials, and that they were very effective for removal of the textile dye Turquoise Remazol. A pseudo second-order kinetic model resulted in the best fit with experimental data for both epicarp and mesocarp (R(2) = 0. 999), providing rate constants of sorption, k(2), of 0. 31 and 1. 43 g mg(- 1) min(- 1), respectively. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were employed for adsorption analysis of the experimental data in their linearized forms. The second model resulted in the better fit for Turquoise Remazol dye, which presented maximum adsorption of 1. 44 and 2. 38 mg g(- 1) at pH 6. 0 for mesocarp and epicarp, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Small-molecule layers for devices - Evaporation {{growth and}} {{characterization}} of thin films Måns Andreasson Applied Semiconductor Physics Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience Chalmers University of Technology Abstract Organic semiconductors constitute {{a relatively recent}} group of materials available for the electronic device designer. Substantially cheaper production technologies and integration with plastic materials are anticipated. Many different devices have been realized such as organic light emitting devices (OLED's), photovoltaic cells and transistors. This thesis describes vacuum-evaporation growth of small-molecule, thin film layers for device applications. The work covers three main parts. The first describes an organic molecular beam deposition system and the initial growth made for the purpose to determine the operational parameters. The molecular flux {{as a function of}} evaporation source temperature is measured and the relation between the thickness monitor reading and the real thickness of the film are determined. For this purpose thin films of the well known molecule 3, 4, 9, 10 perylene tetra carboxylic dianhydride is used. The film surfaces are characterized by reflective high energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy. They show amorphous and polycrystalline film with smooth to rough surface appearance depending on substrate and growth condition. The second part is an ultra violet photoemission study of thin films of <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> (CuPc) deposited on two differently treated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, wet treated or wet treated and subsequently heated respectively. Thin films of CuPc are commonly used in OLED's as a hole injection layer. Both the electronic properties of the substrate and the CuPc are found to depend on the substrate treatment. Specifically we find that the ITO workfunction is increased ~ 0. 4 - 0. 6 eV after heating, and that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is shifted ~ 0. 5 eV to a lower binding energy on the heated substrate. The shift in HOMO is interpreted as different Fermi level pinning at a spin split Cu derived orbital on the two surfaces. Finally three different fluorescent dopants are investigated in a standard OLED structure, 9, 10 -bis(phenyl-ethenyl) anthracene (BPEA), Zincporphyrin (ZnP), and Porhyrin (H 2 P). Current-voltage measurements show that BPEA doping increases the turn-on voltage whereas it remains the same for ZnP and H 2 P devices. Electroluminescence spectra show that BPEA has little effect on the emission spectra while ZnP and H 2 P doping result in a clear change with an almost complete energy transfer for the latter.

40|$|Electronic devices {{based on}} organic {{materials}} have recently become an emerging technology for many applications. Promising aspects are the compatibility with almost any substrate and low cost processing methods. The {{more or less}} infinite number of organic molecules {{as well as the}} means to tailor the molecular properties through different chemical reactions further extends the possibilities for devices. The organic device is a complex structure. In order to fully understand and improve its properties, both fundamental as well as device issues must be treated in parallel. A first, major part of this thesis is a characterization of the chemical composition and surface morphology of the transparent electrode material indium tin oxide (ITO) and its effect on the initial growth of molecules and devices. One particular system is the <b>copper</b> <b>phtalocyanine</b> (CuPc) /ITO interface. The Fermi level of ITO is highly sensitive to surface treatments and have a clear effect on the electronic levels in the CuPc layer with two distinct pinning levels formed based on the work function of the ITO. Further, we have investigated the molecular order in thin films of CuPc grown under a magnetic field on ITO, and found that the orientation and order of the molecules in the films can be changed. We have also studied the initial interaction of CuPc and 3, 4, 9, 10 -Perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) with Cu(100). Both molecules adsorb very strongly in the first monolayer and this is reflected in the formation of interface states observable with UV photoemission spectroscopy. The mechanisms behind these states are different for the two molecules. The PTCDA molecules undergoes a chemical reaction with the Cu surface with the loss of oxygen atoms as a consequence, whereas the interface state in the case of CuPc is interpreted as a quantum well state formed in the first monolayer which is quenched as the film thickness is increasing. The second part of the thesis concerns device studies. In order to increase the efficiency of n-type organic field effect transistors, we have studied the influence of grafting self assembly monolayers (SAM’s) on the contacts and substrate surface. We found that the SAM’s decreased the contact resistance with 1 - 2 orders of magnitude and increased the device mobility ~ 10 times. We believe the reason for this was two-fold. First, the SAM’s changed the work function of the gold contacts, secondly, they also affected the hydrophobic properties of the substrate which allowed the solution of the organic molecules to more easily flow down into the contact channels, thus improving the film quality and the efficiency. Another important device is the OLED, for which we have investigated the effect of different ITO preparations on the efficiency. It was found that an oxidative treatment with UV-light followed by nitric acid, decreased the device turn-on voltage from ~ 19 to ~ 2 V. This was contributed to a reduced hole-injection barrier, due to an increased ITO work function. We have also studied the influence of fluorescent dopants. The doping molecules were porphyrin derivatives with different central atoms, zinc and hydrogen. Both porphyrins affected the light emission with strong new peaks (red shifted) in the spectra. Further, the position of the spectral peaks of the porphyrins are such that the inclusion of different porphyrin dopants in the same device may allow for a white emission OLED, which is important for solid state lighting applications. Finally the thesis also includes studies of encapsulation of OLED’s. We have shown that it is possible with a simple technique to substantially prolong the lifetime of the device. Encapsulated devices were twice as efficient after two weeks compared to non-encapsulated ones...|$|E
