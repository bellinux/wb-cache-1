5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk <b>commodity</b> <b>trade</b> became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Villani {{was born}} into the Florentine {{merchant}} middle class. He {{was the son of}} Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who came from an old and well-respected arti maggiori family of merchants. Villani {{was a member of the}} Arte di Calimala (wool finishers) guild in Florence since 1300, serving on the mercanzia council of eight. During that year he visited Rome during the jubilee celebration. After observing the well-known ancient monuments of Rome and acknowledging its renowned historical personages, he was inspired to write the Cronica, a universal history of Florence in a strictly linear, year-by-year format. During the early years of the 14th century, he gained political perspective by travelling throughout Italy, Switzerland, France and Flanders for the Peruzzi bank, of which he was a shareholder from 1300 to 1308. Traveling abroad as a factor for the company, Villani was paid a regular salary in addition to his shareholding profits. On May 15, 1306, one of the first exchange contracts (cambium) to mention the city of Bruges involved two parties: Giovanni Villani, representing the Peruzzi Company, granting a loan to Tommaso Fini, representing the Gallerani Company of Siena. Villani and his brother Matteo transferred most of their economic activities to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-director of Buonaccorsi in 1324. The Buonaccorsi handled banking and <b>commodity</b> <b>trade</b> activities, spreading their influence throughout Italy, France, Flanders, England and several places in the Mediterranean.|$|E

25|$|Finnish {{politicians}} have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model. Nordic's have been free-trading and relatively welcoming to skilled migrants {{for over a}} century, though in Finland immigration {{is a relatively new}} phenomenon. This is due largely to Finland's less hospitable climate {{and the fact that the}} Finnish language shares roots with none of the major world languages, making it more challenging than average for most to learn. The level of protection in <b>commodity</b> <b>trade</b> has been low, except for agricultural products.|$|E
25|$|For {{the best}} part of two centuries, the {{independent}} Rajput Sultanate of Gujarat was the cynosure of its neighbors on account of its wealth and prosperity, which had long made the Gujarati merchant a familiar figure in the ports of the Indian Ocean. Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specializing in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as <b>commodity</b> <b>trade,</b> brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking.|$|E
25|$|In 1839 the Portuguese government, {{acting on}} British pressure, {{abolished}} {{the slave trade}} south of the equator which had so damaged Central Africa. Human trafficking continued {{until well into the}} 1920s, first as an illegal slave trade, then as contract labor. A <b>commodity</b> <b>trade,</b> at first focused on ivory and wax, but gradually growing to include peanuts and rubber, replaced the slave trade. This trade revolutionized the economies and eventually the politics of the whole of Central Africa. In place of the slave trade, largely under the control of state authorities, thousands, and eventually hundreds of thousands, of commoners began carrying goods from inland to coastal ports. These people managed to share in the wealth of the new trade, and as a result, commercially connected people constructed new villages and challenged the authorities.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Commodity</b> <b>trading</b> in India {{has a long}} history. In fact, <b>commodity</b> <b>trading</b> in India started much {{before it}} started in many other countries. However, years of foreign rule, {{droughts}} and periods of scarcity and Government policies caused the <b>commodity</b> <b>trading</b> in India to diminish. <b>Commodity</b> <b>trading</b> was, however, restarted in India recently. Today, apart from numerous regional exchanges, India has six national commodity exchanges namely, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), National Multi-Commodity Exchange (NMCE) and Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX), the ACE Derivatives exchange ( [...] ACE [...] )and the Universal commodity exchange (UCX). The regulatory body is Forward Markets Commission (FMC) which {{was set up in}} 1953. As of September 2015 FMC is merged with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI.|$|R
2500|$|Even more {{important}} in this respect was the staples market (stapelmarkt) itself that helped to manage the risk of price fluctuations. Related instruments were the provision of trade credit to suppliers {{in order to secure}} favored access to raw materials (Dutch merchants routinely bought up grain harvests in the Baltic area and grape harvests in France, important in the wine trade, [...] before they were harvested) and the financing of <b>commodity</b> <b>trade</b> with bills of exchange, which helped bind customers to the merchant.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008–09, Iranian oil {{accounted}} for nearly 16.5% of India's crude oil imports. Indian oil imports from Iran increased by 9.5% in 2008–09 due to which Iran emerged as India's second largest oil supplier. About 40% of {{the refined oil}} consumed by India is imported from Iran. In June 2009, Indian oil companies announced their plan to invest US$5 billion in developing an Iranian gas field in the Persian Gulf. In September 2009, the Mehr news agency reported a Pakistani diplomat as saying [...] "India definitely quitted the IPI (India-Pakistan-Iran) gas pipeline deal", in favour of Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement for energy security. Iranian officials however said India is yet to make an official declaration. In 2010, US officials warned New Delhi that Indian companies using the Asian Clearing Union for financial transactions with Iran {{run the risk of}} violating a recent US law that bans international firms from doing business with Iranian banks and Tehran's oil and gas sector, and that Indian companies dealing with Iran in this manner may be barred from the US. The United States criticises the ACU of being insufficiently transparent in its financial dealings with Iran and suspects that much of their assets are funnelled to blacklisted repressive organisations in Iran such as the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. The United States Department of the Treasury also believes that Iran uses the ACU to bypass the US banking system. On 27 November 2010, the Indian government, through the Reserve Bank of India, instructed the country's lenders to stop processing current-account transactions with Iran using the Asian Clearing Union, and that further deals should be settled without ACU involvement. RBI also declared that they will not facilitate payments for Iranian crude imports as global pressure on Tehran grows over its nuclear programme. This move by the Indian government will make clear to Indian companies that working through the ACU [...] "doesn't necessarily mean an Iranian counterpart has an international seal of approval". As of December 2010, neither Iran nor the ACU have responded to this development. India objected to further American sanctions on Iran in 2010. An Indian foreign policy strategist, Rajiv Sikri, dismissed the idea that a nuclear armed Iran was a threat to India, and said that India would continue to invest in Iran and do business. Despite increased pressure by the US and Europe, and a significant reduction in oil imports from Persian oil fields in 2012, leading political figures in India have clearly stated that they are not willing to stop trade relations altogether. To the contrary, they aim at expanding the <b>commodity</b> <b>trade</b> with the Islamic republic.|$|E
