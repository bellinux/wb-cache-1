30|$|As {{a second}} {{contribution}} of this paper, we present iterative (turbo-like) pilot-assisted <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> for both OFDM and SC block transmissions. Differently from the turbo-based <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> already proposed for SC transmissions over doubly selective channels [25, 26], the proposed turbo-like <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> are nonadaptive and hence {{more suitable for}} block transmissions. For both OFDM and SC cases, the proposed iterative <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> firstly estimate the time-domain channel exploiting the BEM, and then transform the time-domain channel into the frequency domain for equalization purposes. This strategy {{is similar to that}} used for OFDM doubly selective channel estimation in [21, 22]. However, differently from the <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> of [21, 22], the proposed <b>channel</b> <b>estimators</b> exploit the reliability of the estimated data and can thus also work in the presence of nonorthogonal pilot designs.|$|R

This allows versatile applications of our STF <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> to any fading environment, ranging from spatially-uncorrelated slow-varying frequency-flat channels to spatially-correlated fast-varying frequency-selective channels. The proposed STF <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> reduces to a time-frequency (TF) <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> when no spatial correlations exist. In another perspective, the lower-dimension TF <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> {{can be viewed as}} an STF <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> with spatial correlation mismatch for space-time-frequency selective channels.

We propose and evaluate an efficient and practical <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> that does not require previous knowledge of inter/intra-cell large-scale fading coefficients (i.e., interference) and noise power.

The conventional least-squares (LS) <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> performs poorly when narrowband interfering signals contaminate the multicarrier systems. A new weighted recursive least M-estimate (WRLM) <b>channel</b> <b>estimator</b> is hence developed to estimate multipath fading channels {{in the presence of}} NBI.

With the estimated channel coefficients, a robust multiuser detector is proposed to jointly suppress multiple access interference (MAI) and NBI. The performance of the linear decorrelator will degrade substantially in the presence of NBI. A weighted least M-estimate (WLM) algorithm is therefore developed to combat the NBI. The WLM multiuser detector is also based on the weighted M-estimate concept.
