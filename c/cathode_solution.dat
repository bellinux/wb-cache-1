40|$|The {{source of}} the {{background}} current in the usual operation of the electrochemical concentration cell ozonesonde is the reduction of tri-iodide normally present in the <b>cathode</b> <b>solution.</b> The time variations in the background current {{can be explained by}} the slow rates of solution mass transport and of heterogeneous electron transfer for tri-iodide. Oxygen does not contribute to the background current through reaction with iodide to produce tri-iodide. Direct reduction of oxygen at the cathode is negligible once the electrodes have been exposed to iodide for 24 hours. The present background current correction is altitude-dependent, since it is based on an assumed sensitivity of the electrochemical concentration cell to oxygen. If the background current is independent of altitude and of oxygen, a constant, uncorrected, background current of 0. 1 microamp would produce an error of + 5. 5 % for the total ozone value of the electrochemical concentration cell for a typical midlatitude total ozone value of 0. 345 atm-cm...|$|E
40|$|Sulfide can {{be removed}} from {{wastewater}} and recovered as elemental sulfur using an electrochemical process. Recently, we demonstrated this principle of product recovery on synthetic feeds. Here, we present a lab scale electrochemical reactor continuously removing sulfide from the effluent of an anaerobic treatment process operated on paper mill wastewater. The effluent contained 44 ± 7 mg of sulfide-S L− 1. Sulfide was reduced to 8 ± 2 mg-S L− 1, at a removal rate of 0. 845 ± 0. 133 kg-S m− 3 of total anodic compartment (TAC) d− 1. The removed sulfide was recovered (75 ± 4 % recovery) as pure concentrated alkaline sulfide/polysulfide solution, from which solid elemental sulfur was obtained. The electrochemical sulfide removal was not affected by different soluble constituents or particulate materials present in the wastewater. However, over time sulfide removal decreased due to biological sulfur reduction using the organics present in the wastewater. Therefore, a periodic switching strategy between anode and cathode was developed. Biofilm formation was avoided as the pH of the <b>cathode</b> <b>solution</b> increased to inhibitory levels during cathodic operation, while still allowing full recovery of the sulfur as end product...|$|E

40|$|A balloon {{flight to}} compare 18 ozonesondes with an ozone {{photometer}} and with ozone column measurements from Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers {{was completed in}} April 2004. The core experiment consisted of 12 electrochemical concentration cell ozonesondes, 6 from Science Pump Corporation (SP) and 6 from ENSCI Corporation (ES), prepared with <b>cathode</b> <b>solution</b> concentrations of 0. 5 % KI (half buffer) and 1. 0 % KI (full buffer). Auxiliary ozonesondes consisted of two electrochemical concentration cell sondes with 2. 0 % KI (no buffer), two reconditioned sondes, and two Japanese-KC 96 sondes. Precision of each group of similarly prepared ozonesondes was < 2 - 3 %. The six ozonesondes prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations (SP, 1. 0 % KI, ES 0. 5 % KI) overestimated the photometer measurements by 5 - 10 % in the stratosphere, but provided ozone columns in good agreement with the ground-based spectrophotometer measurements. This {{is consistent with the}} difference (similar to 5 %) in ozone photometer and column measurements observed during the experiment. Using cathode cell concentrations of 1. 0 % KI for ES sondes caused overestimates of the photometer by 10 - 15 % and of ozone column by 5 - 10 %. In contrast, 0. 5 % KI in SP sondes led to good agreement with the photometer, but underestimates of ozone column. The KC 96 sondes underestimated the photometer measurements by about 5 - 15 % at air pressures above 30 hPa. Agreement was within 5 % at lower pressures. Diluting the solution concentration and the buffers from 1. 0 % to 0. 5 % KI causes an approximately linear pressure-dependent decrease in ozone for both SP and ES sondes, ratio (0. 5 KI/ 1. 0 KI) = 0. 9 + 0. 024 * log(10) (Pressure) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{water management}} strategies to lengthen the run {{time of a}} batch fueled direct sodium borohydride/peroxide (NaBH 4 /H 2 O 2) proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The term "batch fueled" refers specifically to a fuel tank containing a fixed volume of fuels {{for use in the}} run. The length of a run using a fixed fuel tank is strongly influenced by water dynamics. The water that reacts at the anode is produced at the cathode, and is transported through the membrane via drag and diffusion. Resulting concentration changes in the fuel of the NaBH 4 /H 2 O 2 fuel cell were modeled to evaluate the run lifetime. The run time is defined as the amount of time required for NaBH 4 or for NaBO 2 (the byproduct compound) to reach either solubility limit or until the fuel is depleted, whichever occurs first. As part of the evaluation, an "effective" H 2 O drag coefficient (net drag minus back diffusion) with Nafion® 112 was experimentally determined to be 1. 14 and 4. 36 at 25 ° C and 60 °C, respectively. The concentrations of the NaBH 4 and NaBO 2 solutions were calculated as a function of initial concentration, and for the case where H 2 O was supplied to the anode compartment during operation. Several strategies to increase the run time by both passive and active water management were considered. It is found that the run time is increased from 10 W h to 57 W h, with a decrease in the initial NaBH 4 concentration from 30 wt % (typically employed in these cells) to 10 wt %. Adding 0. 125 ml/min H 2 O to the bulk anode solution increases the run time of a 10 wt % NaBH 4 solution by a factor of 1. 6. Adding 0. 225 ml/min H 2 O to 30 wt % NaBH 4 bulk solution increases the run time by a factor of 4. 4. While attractive for increasing run time, the practicality of water addition depends on its availability or requires incorporation of an added unit, designed to separate and recirculate water from the <b>cathode</b> <b>solution.</b> Copyright © 2010 by ASME. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A new cell {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} photosynthetic processes of plants to convert carbon dioxide into carbonaceous products and oxygen at high efficiency, has an improved configuration using a polymer membrane electrolyte and an alkaline medium. This increases efficiency of the artificial photosynthetic process, achieves high conversion rates, permits the use of inexpensive catalysts, and widens the range of products generated by this type of process. The alkaline membrane electrolyte allows for the continuous generation of sodium formate {{without the need for}} any additional separation system. The electrolyte type, pH, electrocatalyst type, and cell voltage were found to have a strong effect on the efficiency of conversion of carbon dioxide to formate. Indium electrodes were found to have higher conversion efficiency compared to lead. Bicarbonate electrolyte offers higher conversion efficiency and higher rates than water solutions saturated with carbon dioxide. pH values between 8 and 9 lead to the maximum values of efficiency. The operating cell voltage of 2. 5 V, or higher, ensures conversion of the carbon dioxide to formate, although the hydrogen evolution reaction begins to compete strongly with the formate production reaction at higher cell voltages. Formate is produced at indium and lead electrodes at a conversion efficiency of 48 mg of CO 2 /kilojoule of energy input. This efficiency is about eight times that of natural photosynthesis in green plants. The electrochemical method of artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach for the conversion, separation and sequestration of carbon dioxide for confined environments as in space habitats, and also for carbon dioxide management in the terrestrial context. The heart of the reactor is a membrane cell fabricated from an alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane and catalyst- coated electrodes. This cell is assembled and held in compression in gold-plated hardware. The cathode side of the cell is supplied with carbon dioxide-saturated water or bicarbonate solution. The anode side of the cell is supplied with sodium hydroxide solution. The solutions are circulated past the electrodes in the electrochemical cell using pumps. A regulated power supply provides the electrical energy required for the reactions. Photovoltaic cells can be used to better mimic the photosynthetic reaction.

Microbial fuel cells are devices which harvest electrons from microorganisms created by their enzymatic oxidation of complex carbon substrates or consumed by their reduction of chemical oxidants. Microbial fuel cells with photosynthetic biocathodes are of particular interest due {{to their ability to}} simultaneously produce electricity and hydrocarbons while reducing carbon dioxide. Most species of microorganisms including many bacteria and yeasts require exogenous electron transfer mediators in order to allow electron transfer with an electrode. While adding such chemicals is simple enough at a lab scale, problems arise with chemical costs and separation at a larger scale. The goal of this research was to develop electrodes composed of a robust material which will eliminate the need for added soluble electron mediators in a photosynthetic biocathode microbial fuel cell. Electrodes made from stainless steel 304 L have been coated in a conductive polymer (polypyrrole) and an immobilized electron transfer mediator (methylene blue) and tested chemically for stability and in a microbial fuel cell environment for use in bioanodes and biocathodes. The use of these immobilized mediator in the photosynthetic biocathode increased the open circuit voltage of the cell from 0. 17 V to 0. 24 V and the short circuit current from 8 mA/m 2 to 64 mA/m 2 (normalized to the geometric surface area of the electrode) when compared to using the same mediator in solution. The opposite effect was seen when using the electrodes in a bioanode utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The open circuit voltage decreased from 0. 37 V to 0. 31 V and the short circuit current decreased from 94 mA/m 2 to 24 mA/m 2 when comparing the immobilized mediator to soluble mediators.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Oxygen-reducing biocathodes {{previously}} {{developed for}} microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have required energy-intensive aeration of the catholyte. To avoid {{the need for}} aeration, the ability of biocathodes to function with passive oxygen transfer was examined here using air cathode MFCs. Two-chamber, air cathode MFCs with biocathodes produced a maximum power density of 554 ± 0 mW/m 2, which was comparable to that obtained with a Pt cathode (576 ± 16 mW/m 2), and 38 times higher than that produced without a catalyst (14 ± 3 mW/m 2). The maximum current density with biocathodes in this air-cathode MFC was 1. 0 A/m 2, compared to 0. 49 A/ m 2 originally produced in a two-chamber MFC with an aqueous cathode (with cathode chamber aeration). Single-chamber, air-cathode MFCs with the same biocathodes initially produced higher voltages than those with Pt cathodes, but after several cycles the catalytic activity of the biocathodes was lost. This change in cathode performance resulted from direct exposure of the <b>cathodes</b> to <b>solutions</b> containing high concentrations of organic matter in the single-chamber configuration.

The impact of the brush size and electrode spacing was examined by varying {{the distance of the}} brush end from the <b>cathode</b> and <b>solution</b> conductivity in multiple MFCs. The startup time was increased from 8 ± 1 days with full brushes (all buffer concentrations) to 13 days (50 mM), 14 days (25 mM) and 21 days (8 mM) when 75 % of the brush anode was removed. When MFCs were all first acclimated with a full brush, up to 65 % of the brush material could be removed without appreciably altering maximum power. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the main source of internal resistance (IR) was diffusion resistance, which together with solution resistance reached 100 Ω. The IR using EIS compared well with that obtained using the polarization data slope method, indicating no major components of IR were missed.

The conditions {{to be maintained}} have to be established based on laboratory studies. With a view to maximize the removal of metal ions the trends of removal of heavy metal ions such as iron, nickel and cadmium form a natural Indian kaolinitic red earth during different conditions maintained in the electrokinetic extraction process are studied. A laboratory electrokinetic extraction apparatus was assembled for this purpose. Attempts are also made to elucidate the mechanism of removal of the metal ions from soil. The composition of the flushing fluid, voltage and duration of extraction are varied. While dilute acetic acid {{has been used to}} neutralize the alkalinity that develops at the <b>cathode,</b> EDTA <b>solution</b> has been used to desorb heavy metals from clay surface. Generally the extent of removal was proportional to the osmotic flow. Nickel and Cadmium are more effectively removed than iron. The percentage removal of Ni is generally proportional to the osmotic flow but shows sensitivity to the pH of the system. There is an optimum voltage for removal of metal ions from soil. The removal of iron was negligible under different conditions studie...|$|R
40|$|Polarization of a {{rotating}} plat inum <b>cathode</b> in mixed <b>solutions</b> of NaC 1 and NaOH containing dissolved chlorine was measured. At relatively low current densities, cathodic reduction of C 10 - took {{place as the}} main reaction. The diffusion-limiting current density was {{a function of the}} concentration of C 10 - in solution and the reaction was first order with respect o C 10 -. There-fore, it was concluded that the mechanism C 10 - + H 20 -{- e = Clad-{- 2 OH-Clad-{- e = CI-was operative at low current densities. At high current densities, hydrogen formation is, of course, the main reaction. There {{is no doubt that the}} hydrogen electrode process is a high light of theoretical electrochemistry. Thus, many papers have been published. The main reaction on steel-cathode screens in th...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen-reducing biocathodes {{previously}} {{developed for}} microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have required energy-intensive aeration of the catholyte. To avoid {{the need for}} aeration, the ability of biocathodes to function with passive oxygen transfer was examined here using air cathode MFCs. Two-chamber, air cathode MFCs with biocathodes produced a maximum power density of 554 ± 0 mW/m 2, which was comparable to that obtained with a Pt cathode (576 ± 16 mW/m 2), and 38 times higher than that produced without a catalyst (14 ± 3 mW/m 2). The maximum current density with biocathodes in this air-cathode MFC was 1. 0 A/m 2, compared to 0. 49 A/m 2 originally produced in a two-chamber MFC with an aqueous cathode (with cathode chamber aeration). Single-chamber, air-cathode MFCs with the same biocathodes initially produced higher voltages than those with Pt cathodes, but after several cycles the catalytic activity of the biocathodes was lost. This change in cathode performance resulted from direct exposure of the <b>cathodes</b> to <b>solutions</b> containing high concentrations of organic matter in the single-chamber configuration. Biocathode performance was not impaired in two-chamber designs where the cathode was kept separated from the anode solution. These results demonstrate that direct-air biocathodes can work very well, but only under conditions that minimize heterotrophic growth of microorganisms on the cathodes. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction, at a mercury <b>cathode,</b> of dimethylformamide <b>solutions,</b> containing Et 4 NClO 4 as supporting electrolyte, of N-(2, 2, 2 -trichoroethyl) acetamides (1 a–f), with {{or without}} added water as proton source, has been investigated. In all cases, the nature and yield of the products from macroscale electrolyses as well as voltammetric data point {{to the formation of}} an intermediate carbanion, which undergoes β-elimination, or α-elimination, or acid–base reaction depending {{on the nature of the}} substituent on the carbon α to nitrogen and the medium. The formation of (2 a) from the electrolysis of (1 a–b) in the presence of H 2 O has been ascribed to nucleophilic substitution of the first-formed dehalogenated product by dimethylamine. The latter arises from decomposition of the solvent promoted by ions released in the follow-up reactions of the carbanion...|$|R
40|$|In {{the long}} road towards commercialization of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, {{improving}} the cathode’s performance is a major milestone. Achieving low Area Specific Resistances at temperatures around 600 °C are required to meet the market demands in terms of costs and lifetime. In this thesis, different research projects focusing on the electrolyte / cathode assembly are described with as aims, an improvement of the performance and {{a better understanding of}} the cells. To decrease the Area Specific Resistance (ASR) of the <b>cathodes,</b> two <b>solutions</b> are explored and combined in this thesis. The first possibility is to replace the-state-of-the-art cathode materials by new and innovative materials. A study on Lanthanum Nickelate (La 2 NiO 4 +δ) as a porous electrode is shown This material shows excellent oxygen surface exchange and ionic diffusion. The second possibility is to use one of the state-of-the-art materials and improve its microstructure. By engineering the electrolyte / cathode interface, it is shown for La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ and for La 2 NiO 4 +δ that the oxygen surface transport on the cathode grains can be enhanced. The trick consists of introducing a thin dense layer of the cathode material between the porous electrode and the electrolyte. Finally,a new method to produce a complete cell with Pulsed Laser Deposition is presented. PLD is a typical example of what nanotechnology can bring to improve Solid Oxide Fuel Cells...|$|R
