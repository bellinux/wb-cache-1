40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The forest {{products}} industry often uses intermediate-support cable logging systems to transport logs from the harvest site to a staging area. A method {{is presented to}} assist in the analysis and design of these cable systems. The method determines tensions in individual cables, forces on and stresses in the support trees, and the geometry of the system under load. Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. A good, automated initial guess for the unknown quantities, based on the physics of the problem, is provided. A model of an example intermediate support <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed by the proposed approach and the resulting behavior discussed. The method includes the effects of catenary sag and elastic stretch in the cables, and elastic behavior in the support trees. Friction is ignored in the formulation. The catenary and elastic stretch methodologies for the cables are each demonstrated on a single cable span as well as on a demonstration cable system. The effect of the support tree flexibility and cable mass are found to be significant on the response of the <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>system.</b> The effects of elastic stretch in the cables is not found to be significant for the cable logging systems considered...|$|E

The program will accept up to 110 road segments. Each segment is analyzed individually based on digitized data from a contour map and user defined road construction parameters. Three types of construction are analyzed for each segment: fullbench and sidecast, fullbench and endhaul and balanced construction. Program results and operation are exemplified {{in an analysis of}} a proposed transportation plan in a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> study area in New England.

Variations in the subgrade width and surfacing depth seem to affect cost the most. Fuel consumption of alternative <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> is also compared in this paper. The results indicate that <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> initially consumes more fuel due to increased road construction. However, once the roads are established, <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> consume less fuel than tractor logging.

40|$|The {{comercial}} thinning of second-growth {{stands in}} the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly important for satisfying the demand for timber. Cable logging will require the rigging of smaller intermediate support trees rather than those utilized on old-growth timber sales. This paper reports {{on the results of}} a study designed to evaluate the ability of second-growth trees to sustain the compressive forces similar to those generated by a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>system.</b> The movements of nine trees subjected to increasing amounts of force were measured with two theodolites. The conditions of loading were similar to those imposed on intermediate support trees. The study demonstrates that a tree will continue to move in the direction of its initial lateral movement. Once a tree is bent, the downward compressive force governs the movement of the tree. The results from the study are compared to Euler's design formula. It is suggested that a factor of safety be applied when designing an intermediate support. Additional research is proposed by the author to determine the forces acting on support trees during the actual yarding cycle...|$|E
40|$|Initially, a small {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to examine the}} influence of incline on the frequency of taut cables. The experiments consisted of exciting a short cable at angles of incline from zero to 90 degrees and at various tensions. The results from these experiments shows a small effect due to the incline as the cable approaches the vertical. However, this influence is small enough that the theoretical equation for the frequencies of a horizontal cable {{could be used to}} determine the frequencies of a taut, inclined cable. A computer model intended to simulate the dynamic behavior of a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> skyline is the main thrust of this paper. In developing the computer model both finite element and finite difference methods were considered. The finite difference method was selected based on its efficiency in achieving the desired solution. A nine point implicit finite difference scheme, which guarantees stability of the solution, was employed. Computer model output for skyline frequencies and tensions were compared with a number of field tests. The results were encouraging and indicated the model to be reliable in simulating the dynamic behavior of a skyline with a log load. This information can be used to determine the influence of dynamic skyline behavior on loads experienced by the tailspar...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Road {{changing}} i. s {{the activity}} of moving operating lines on a cable yarding operation to permit access to logs in an unyarded portion of a logging unit. The time required to perform this activity varies widely and may consume {{a significant portion of}} the total yarding time. With rising costs in the logging industry, the efficiency of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> is constantly under critical review. Additional research in the area of road changing has been suggested in several studies (Dykstra, 1974 and Peters, 1973) Road changing information was gathered on several yarding operations in conjunction with detailed production studies of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems.</b> On six of the operations the total time consumed by road changing was noted and recorded as a delay in the yarding process. On four operations, road changing was segmented into various activities, and factors hypothesized to influence road changing time were identified and measured. On the four operations studied in detail, two crewmen timed the road changing operation as the activities involved occurred at widely separated locations on the logging unit. The continuous time study method used on the overall production study (Dykstra, 1975 a) was also used during road changing. The analysis of road changing involves a descriptive analysis of all the operations studied and a quantitative analysis of road changing on the four operations studied in detail. The descriptive analysis consists primarily of a comparative investigation of road changing time between the operations. The quantitative analysis consists of a regression analysis of the four operations examined in detail. In the comparison of road changing times for the ten operations observed, road changing time varied widely. Even among similar systems a wide range was observed. This variability was most likely due to the differences in the road changing methods themselves, varying characteristics of the logging units and lengthy delays encountered during road changing. This could not be confirmed for six of the operations as road changing was not recorded in detail. However, among those operations observed in detail, this influence could be seen. Following a breakdown of road changing into machine intensive activities, labor intensive activities and delays, a large percentage of road changing time is occupied by delays. Also, the greatest proportion of delay-free time involved labor intensive activities. This was expected on the operations where pre-layout of roads was not done. On the operation where roads were pre-layed, other activities requiring labor intensive action occurred. Some of the delays encountered may have been due to characteristics of the particular yarder being used. A quantitative analysis was made of four operations. Road changing time, excluding delays and the time required to relocate the yarder was used as the dependent variable. Delay-free road changing time was found to be a function of the distance from the landing to the tailhold (SPAN) and groundslope. For two of the operations, identical machines and methods were used. A combined regression equation was formed based on the independent variable SPAN. Also, based on the scatter of observations for these systems, an equa. - tion using SPAN 2 as the independent variable was found to be a better predictor of delay-free road changing time than SPAN...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> were {{reviewed}} {{to compare the}} efficiency of potential biomass extraction from remote forest sites in Ireland based on productive machine hour (PMH) and unit cost of operation (â¬/m 3). Three operational scenarios (SC) were analysed where SC I was a three man crew operation (choker setter, the carriage operator and unhooking chokers). SC II was a variation of this with a two man crew operation. SC III was operating radio controlled chokers there was a two man crew (choker setter and carriage operator). The study aims to assess how operations in Ireland perform against previous known cable studies {{to determine whether the}} cost of timber extraction on remote forest sites inaccessible for mechanised felling, has a future given the increased demand for wood fibre in Ireland, both from the sawmilling industries and the wood for energy sector. The volume per PMH was recorded at 17. 97 for SC I, 15. 09 for SC II and 20. 58 m 3 for SC III. The difference in productivity versus SC III remote controlled chokers is 5. 49 m 3 /PMH for SC II crew and 2. 61 m 3 /PMH for SC I. The decrease in total volume extracted from SCs I and II versus SC III was recorded at 15. 69 m 3 (15 %) and 32. 97 m 3 (36 %) product respectively. In value terms, the unit cost (â¬/m 3) varied from 6. 29 (SC I) to 6. 43 (SC II) to 4. 57 (SC III). When looking at the production unit costs of normal wood energy supply chains in Ireland, the figures are similar ranging from 3. 17 â¬/m 3 to 8. 01 â¬/m 3. The value of the end product of course will always determine which market the eventually goes to but given that <b>cable</b> <b>log</b> wood fibre has been unthinned and unmaintained then the biomass sector may be an ever increasing demand point in the search for increased woody biomass given that the unit costs can be competitive with other wood energy supply chains...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 <b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> {{are being}} applied {{frequently}} in thinning young-growth forests, but {{the dynamics of}} these systems are relatively unknown. This study {{is part of a}} research project to develop aerial <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> for thinning and to analyze them for economic, silvicultural, and environmental implications. The objectives of my study were: 1) To measure the influence of thinning intensity, slope steepness, load size, skyline distance, lateral rigging distance, and number of workers on yarding times. 2) To develop a model to simulate these relationships under varying working conditions of the skyline system and to identify proposals for improved logging methods. I observed a cable-thinning operation on a 35 - 40 year old Douglas-fir stand on gentle and medium steep slopes. Three thinning intensities of 70, 50, and 20 percent, respectively, were applied. The skyline yarding work cycle was separated into six regular and three irregular e 1 ennts. I used the multimoment time study method to observe these elements and obtained values for the variables that influenced these elements. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the effect of these variables on tine required to finish an element. I developed regressions for four regular elements, carriage out, lateral out, lateral in, carriage in, and for total regular yarding tine. Regressions with the observed variables did not produce adequate results for other elements. I analyzed only their frequency distribution. I tested the results of the analysis against a sample from the same yarding system in a different operation. Close correspondence in a chi-square and t-test, respectively, suggests the reliability of the regressions. Several suggestions were made for modifications that may improve the skyline system. They concern hooking and unhooking, the cable configuration, and lateral yarding. I developed a simulation model in the GPSS-computer language to simulate skyline thinning. The elements of the model can be modified to adjust to distinctive situations. I tested the influence of lateral yarding distance on total yarding time and simulated a regular approach with limited lateral yarding distance and a "line thinning" method...|$|R

Little is known about planning logistics, operational requirements, and harvest costs for timber and site conditions of alternative silvicultural systems. Much of the terrain demands expensive <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> requiring up-to-date production and cost information for harvest planning and administration. This paper describes logging planning and harvest requirements, production, and cost results of an interdisciplinary experiment comparing alternative silvicultural systems for multiple resource management. The {{study was conducted in}} Oregon Coast Range, second growth timber using five types of group selection harvest setting designs. Skyline group selections were compared to a clearcut. Group sizes ranged from 0. 5 to 3 acres (0. 20 to 1. 21 hectares). Group shapes included rectangular to polygonal and wedge-shape, with parallel and fan shaped setting skyline road plans. Harvest units were assessed for their efficiencies and/or inadequacies for unit planning and layout, felling, and yarding production and cost. In group selection units, total harvest costs increased from 7. 3 to 31. 5 percent over clearcutting. Patch size had the largest influence over total costs (i. e. larger size; lower cost). Total cost was also related to skyline setting road plan and shape. Harvest cost components were greater for group selection units than the clearcut. Felling costs increased a minimal amount (0. 4 to 2. 6 percent) over clearcutting in most of the group selections because of the need for more directional tree wedging. However, standard yarding costs were estimated to be slightly lower than the clearcut (0. 2 to 4. 2 percent) in all group selections due to increased frequency of turn presetting. The wedge-shape group selection unit exhibited a 52 percent lower road change cost over the clearcut. Other group selection units were more costly (1. 6 to 107. 8 percent) than the clearcut road/landing change cost. The amount of timber volume removed was a key factor affecting the final yarding cost. Final yarding costs for all group selection units increased 3. 4 to 26. 0 percent over clearcutting. Logging planning is the key to operationally efficient and cost effective group selection harvesting. Although such planning required 2. 6 to 5. 9 times more planning time and cost commitment as the clearcut, lack of such planning would cause other harvest costs to escalate as a result of increased operational difficulties...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> {{will become}} more {{important}} as harvesting shifts to greater annual proportions on steep terrain in New Zealand. The costs of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> are considerably {{higher than that of}} conventional ground-based methods. Improving cost-effectiveness has been identified as key to ensuring the forestry industry remains cost competitive in the international market. This thesis focuses on ways to better understand and improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> methods by specifically focusing on rigging configurations. The investigation was conducted through a comprehensive literature review, an industry survey to establish current use and preferences, a Delphi survey with experts to establish actual advantages and disadvantages, scale model testing to establish some fundamental knowledge of tension to deflection relationship, and finally a series of targeted case studies to establish both productivity and skyline tension in actual operations. Each of these aspects of the research topic employed different methodology. The literature review highlighted the most relevant research relating to <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> world-wide spanning nearly a century. Various research papers, manuals, books and computer software were summarized. While many aspects of cable yarding operations have been investigated, much of it focusing on various aspects of operational efficiency through case studies, there is very limited information with regard to rigging configurations. The survey of 50 <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> practitioners determined what rigging configurations were commonly used in New Zealand. It includes their perceived advantages and disadvantages for varying levels of deflection, but also for specific scenarios such as pulling away from native forest boundaries and flying logs over a stream. Results showed that there were many conflicting perceptions about rigging configuration options. Using an expert panel, a Delphi process was used to derive consensus on what advantages were truly unique to each configuration. This allowed the longer lists of perceived advantages from the industry survey to be pared down to a concise list of ad/disadvantages that will be used in the updating of the Best Practice Guidelines for <b>Cable</b> <b>Logging.</b> To increase our fundamental understanding of tension / payload / deflection relationships, an experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. Using a model yarder in a lab and continuous tension and video recording devices, the dynamic skyline behavior of three similar configurations were tested: North Bend, South Bend and Block in the Bight. The tensions were compared by use of a two-way analysis of variance, which indicated configuration and choker length were significant variables in some but not all of the dynamic load tests. Results also showed that some configurations performed better than others in minimizing the shock loads due to dropping into full suspension, impact with ground objects, and breakout during bridling. Finally, a series of eight studies were conducted on targeted logging operations where relevant stand and terrain parameters were related to the continuous skyline tension monitoring, and recording of productivity through time study. The three targeted configurations included (1) North Bend, (2) Standing skyline using a motorized slack-pulling carriage and (3) a live skyline using a motorized grapple carriage. Results showed that peak and average tensions, as well as amplification factors and the payload to tension relationship, varied between configurations. The study also showed that tensions could be collected to compute measures of payload and tension efficiency, which provided insight into operational performance. The safe working load was exceeded in 53 % of all cycles studied and across seven of eight study sites and 14 of 16 spans. Cycle times were significantly different between rigging configurations and that production information could be used to compute measures of labor and energy consumption as well as payload and tension efficiency; which also provide insight into operational performance. The industry should give serious consideration to the use of tension monitors. Tension monitors have many benefits and have the potential to improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations in New Zealand. Monitoring tensions can help one learn new techniques or methods (i. e. rigging configurations), help improve payload analysis software for future planning and help evaluate new technology and machinery...|$|R

As a result of the evaluation, it is seen that the life <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> has a potential for managing knowledge work experiences on personal research environments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractâWe {{present a}} high {{performance}} <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> for embedded UNIX and GNU/Linux applications. Compared {{to the standard}} UNIX and GNU/Linux logging method, syslog, our method has two orders of magnitude lower latency and {{an order of magnitude}} higher message throughput. This speed-up is mainly due to the use of a memory-mapped file as the means of interprocess communication, fewer memory copies and the batching of output messages in the logging daemon. In addition, our <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> also accepts syslog messages, providing compatibility with existing applications. Our <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is in production use in the Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a forensic <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> that collects fine-grained trace evidence from target servers and networks. To {{provide a more}} reliable and efficient forensic <b>logging</b> <b>system,</b> we developed a dedicated network processor that collects network traffic and a hardened TCSEC-B 1 level secure operating system. The system also is capable of defending servers from malicious attacks as well as allowing system security managers to obtain forensic evidence from the forensic <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> when the target system is assaulted by malicious attacks from the internet. We present {{the structure of the}} system and discuss the benchmark test results of our prototype system...|$|R
