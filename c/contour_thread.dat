40|$|Birch bark lace is Estonian needle lace. Structurally {{it resembles}} needle lace {{as it is}} known {{elsewhere}} in Europe. It uses the same stitches and there are similarities in the material used in the embroidery. However, the technology employed is unique in certain remarkable respects – it has adapted to local needs and possibilities. Whereas traditionally <b>contour</b> <b>thread</b> was tightened onto a strong textile, or in earlier times also onto parchment, in Estonia a strip of birch bark was used as a base material instead. Birch bark has many advantages as a base material: it was always available on farms and cost nothing; also, it was easy to process into a suitable size. While European lace makers were forced to cover a light-coloured base material with a dark textile or paper, the lower surface of the birch bark used for making lace was naturally darker and as such provided a suitable background for the white thread. Birch bark also gave this type of lace its name – birch bark lace. Birch bark lace is characterised by a simple geometric pattern. The joining of various motifs is not used in the birch bark lace technique. To the best of our knowledge, birch bark lace was embroidered in one piece between contour threads. Of the various lace stitches, birch bark lace uses the buttonhole stitch and twisted buttonhole stitch. The pattern is formed from the holes left between tight buttonhole stitches. Birch bark lace net differs from other birch bark laces for its net-like material of paired buttonhole stitches that could be decorated with running stitch embroidery. Ornaments are characterised by geometrical motifs that can be stitched with either white or red thread. The birch bark lace technique is not particularly well known in Estonia. No distinctive surveys have been published, but birch bark lace has been comparatively discussed alongside other lace techniques used in Estonia or introduced with a brief overview in descriptions of how to make national costumes. Hence, neither the region where it was once used nor its uses are known. The problem is that Estonian language literature has never given accounts of systematic instructions on how to use the technique. Therefore, there are few experts who are familiar with the techniques of making birch bark lace and who can distinguish objects in this technique from other museum textiles. Birch bark lace may, depending on the stitches used, be visually similar to crochet lace or filet lace. For this reason, it is possible that our museums hold more objects decorated with birch bark lace than we are currently aware. This article provides an overview of the objects decorated with birch bark lace identified in the collections of the Estonian National Museum and describes three birch bark lace techniques...|$|E

The [...] "ptosis" [...] or descent of facial tissues with aging is a universal phenomenon to which much cosmetic facial surgery is directed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the event}} that a patient is unhappy with the results, the threads can be readily removed and the patient's face thence returns to its {{position}} prior to treatment. Thus, <b>Contour</b> <b>threads</b> have negligible permanent [...] "biological cost", as the effect is reversible. Effects last {{for a number of}} years, quoted as 2-5 years, after which time the positive effect is gradually lost and the patient's face returns to its state prior to treatment.|$|R
40|$|Techniques {{and issues}} are {{considered}} surrounding the characterisation of surface form represented by Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A set of software tools {{suitable for use}} in a raster based Geographical Information System (GIS) is developed. Characterisation has three specific objectives, namely to identify spatial pattern, to identify scale dependency in form and to allow visualisation of results. An assessment is made of the characteristics of error in DEMs by identifying suitable quantitative measures and visualisation processes that may be enabled within a GIS. These are evaluated by <b>contour</b> <b>threading</b> a fractal surface and comparing four different spatial interpolations of the contours. The most effective error characterisations are found to be those that identify high frequency spatial pattern. Visualisation of spatial arrangement of DEM error is used to develop a deterministic error model based on local surface slope and aspect. DEMs are parameterised using first and second derivatives of quadratic surfaces fitted over a range of scales. This offers advantages over traditional methods based on a 3 by 3 local window, as geomorphometric form can be characterised at any scale. Morphometric parameters are combined to give a feature classification that may also be applied over a range of scales. Multi-scale measurements are combined to give a feature membership function that describes how properties change with scale. These functions are visualised using modal and entropy measures of variability. An additional method of visualising scale dependency is suggested that graphically represents statistical measures of spatial pattern over a variety of spatial lags. This is found most appropriate for detecting structural anisotropy in a surface. Characterisation tools are evaluated by applying them to uncorrelated surfaces, fractal surfaces and Ordnance Survey DEMs of Lake District, Peak District and Dartmoor...|$|R
50|$|Contour {{lines are}} curved, {{straight}} or {{a mixture of}} both lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface {{with one or more}} horizontal planes. The configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer relative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places. Contour lines may be either traced on a visible three-dimensional model of the surface, as when a photogrammetrist viewing a stereo-model plots elevation contours, or interpolated from estimated surface elevations, as when a computer program <b>threads</b> <b>contours</b> through a network of observation points of area centroids. In the latter case, the method of interpolation affects the reliability of individual isolines and their portrayal of slope, pits and peaks.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} optimization of screws in {{the unit}} including connectingrod – {{connecting rod big end}} of the SW 680 Leyland motor related to uniform distribution of loading on all the thread coils. Optimization of screw geometry insists in partial turning of the thread coil at a determined angle. The stress state calculations were performed with the finite element method and the Nastran/Patran program. It has been shown that the angle 3 o is the optimum angle of partial turning of the <b>thread</b> <b>contour.</b> At that angle, when the screw was loaded by the tensile force 29 kN, we obtained the reduced stress decreased by 12 %, and more uniform distribution of the thread coil as compared with the traditional screw (not optimized) ...|$|R
40|$|Mellin-Barnes {{integrals}} are characterised by integrals involving {{products and}} ratios of gamma functions with integration <b>contours</b> that <b>thread</b> {{their way around}} sequences of poles of the integrands. They are a powerful tool {{in the development of}} convergent or asymptotic expansions of functions defined by integrals, sums or differential equations. Furthermore they can be com-bined with the closely related Mellin transform. The great utility of these integrals resides in the facts that the asymptotic behaviour near the origin and at infinity of the function being represented is related to the singularity structure in the complex plane of the resulting integrand and to inherent flexibility associated with deformation of the contour of integration over sub-sets of these singularities. For an exhaustive treatment of the Mellin-Barnes integrals we refer to the recent monograph by Paris and Kaminski [5]. The names refer to the two authors, who in the first 1910 ’s developed the theory of these integrals using them for a complete integration of the hypergeometric differential equation. However, as pointed out by Tricomi in [1] (Vol. 1, Ch. 1, § 1. 19, p. 49), these integrals were first used by S. Pincherle in 1888 [6]. For a revisited analysis of the pioneering work of Pincherle (1853 - 1936, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bologna from 1880 to 1928) we refer to the recent paper by Mainardi and Pagnin...|$|R
