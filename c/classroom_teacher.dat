40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to clarify the modes of understanding and attitude of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> who are put in charge of foreign students in Japanese elementary schools. In areas where there are few foreign children, the ways of accepting and guiding them as newcomers in the elementary schools are left to the <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> In many cases, these teachers have to struggle with the new types of challenges brought by foreign students without useful help and support. At the same time, adaptation of foreign students to Japanese school life depends on the classroom teachers’ attitude and behaviors. The interviews of teachers and the observation of the school life of foreign students bring us the findings as follows: 1) <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> recognized foreign children as a new type of student that they have not experienced and they have to struggle with acceptance and guidance of these students without suitable preparation, 2) the “barrier of language” is understood to be the source of most difficulties by <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> and this understanding seems to make them ignore the other problems of foreign students, 3) <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> have trouble with the conflict between cultural context and personal context when they face problems regarding the behavior of foreign students, 4) understanding of the support necessary for the learning of foreign students differs slightly among <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers,</b> so the support provided to these students is, in fact, not consistent, 5) <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> need and demand support services and advisers which can help to resolve their problems in acceptance and guidance of foreign students. 本研究では、外国人散在地域U市において実施した現地調査の結果から、小学校の学級担任教師のニューカマー児童に対する認識と態度を捉えようと試みた. 学校現場でニューカマー児童の受け入れと指導に苦慮している学級担任教師に共感しつつ、受け入れの過程でどのような困難や課題に直面するのか、また、それらの困難や課題にどのように対処しているのかを明らかにし、散在地域の学校現場における多文化教育の課題と今後のあり方を探る一助としたい...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} the concerns of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> regarding the implementation of resource-based learning in Newfoundland schools. Teachers' thoughts, perceptions and fears regarding this innovation represent their concerns. Several factors such as gender, age, size of student population, academic qualifications, date of last university study, teaching experience and the services of a full time learning resource teacher were studied to determine if they influenced the intensity of these concerns. The attitude of principals, learning resource <b>teachers</b> and <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> was also examined to determine if differences existed in the levels of these concerns. [...] The subjects for this study were 277 elementary (grades 4 - 8) <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> who were employed with the Roman Catholic School Board for St. John's during the school year 1991 - 92. Data were received from 145 or 52. 3 percent of the sample. [...] The data were gathered by using a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of a modified version of the Stages of Concern Questionnaire, as well as questions designed to gather demographic and implementation data about the subjects. Stratification into various sub-groups was based on the responses to these questions. [...] The teachers who responded expressed varying levels of intensity on the seven Stages of Concern: Awareness, Informational, Personal, Management, Consequence, Collaboration and Refocusing. The majority of teachers (83. 5 percent) had their highest level of concern on the self-oriented concerns - Awareness, Informational, Personal and Management. This indicates that these teachers need more general information about resource-based learning, what it is, how it works, what will be required to implement it and what are its long terms effects. [...] The study found that gender was of minimum significance and did not influence the concerns of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] Age resulted in differences between the youngest and oldest <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> on the Informational and Personal Stages. The results indicate that the youngest <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> expressed intense personal concerns. [...] The size of the student population did not result in any significant differences in the intensity of concerns. <b>Classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> working with smaller student populations indicated intense managerial concerns. [...] Academic qualifications resulted in statistically significant differenes for <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> with doctorate degrees but only at the awareness level. [...] The date of last university study in the area of education was of minimum significance and did not influence the concerns of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] The study found that the less experienced <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> expressed high levels of self-oriented concerns. [...] The services of a full time learning resource teacher resulted in statistically significant differences for <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> but only at the informational level. [...] The attitude of the principal towards learning resource programs resulted in some differences on the first three stages.

2500|$|Dewey {{believed}} that the successful <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. [...] For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one’s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. [...] "No one," [...] according to Dewey, [...] "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [...] who does not retain [...] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [...] entire career" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.34). [...] According to Dewey, {{it is not that}} the “teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,” rather, “a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: [...] history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35).

2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> has the mental propensity {{to overcome the}} demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers {{must be aware of}} how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E

For Dewey, [...] "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} differences and similarities of judgment between art <b>teachers</b> and <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> concerning the art curriculum in the elementary school and to bring these differences and similarities into focus. This study involved art <b>teachers</b> and <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> at two elementary schools in Anderson, Indiana during the Fall quarter of the 1974 - 75 school year. Fifteen art <b>teachers</b> and twenty-four <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> responded to the questionnaire used in the study. The questionnaire was designed to determine if there are differences between the perceptions of art and non-art teachers of the objectives of art in the elementary school curriculum and in their respective opinions concerning specific aspects of elementary art education. Identical questionnaires were distributed to <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> in an inner city school and in an upper middle class school in Anderson, Indiana. The same questionnaire was given to all art teachers in the Anderson school system. The questionnaires were distributed on February 3, 1975 and were to be returned to the researcher by February 10, 1975. The questionnaire consisted of thirty-two items. Fifteen items related to the objectives of art education in the elementary school and seventeen items elicited the opinions of teachers concerning specified aspects of art education. Fifty-five questionnaires were distributed. Of these questionnaires, seventeen were given to art teachers and thirty-eight were given to <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> Of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers,</b> twenty-four responded while fifteen art teachers responded. There was a sixty-three percent response from the <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> and an eighty percent response from the art teachers. Both the art and the non-art teachers were generally in accord with the objectives and opinions presented in the questionnaire. Both groups felt elementary art instruction should have the objectives of providing the students with an avenue of personal expression and provide an atmosphere which nurtures a child's self-confidence. The two groups also felt that the art teacher should have the same privileges and responsibilities as the <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> This attitude was reflected in the responses which indicated that both groups felt that art teachers should have time for advanced planning and preparation and should have a fully equipped art classroom to work in. The two groups differed somewhat on the objectives of elementary art education in teaching aesthetic qualities. A larger percentage of art <b>teachers</b> than of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> expressed agreement with the objectives. The <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> also indicated that they preferred to have some voice in the choice of materials selected for use in the elementary art class rather than permitting the art teacher to have complete control of this area. Although both groups of teachers agreed that there should be regularly scheduled art instruction geared to the degree of difficulty the child can master, they did not agree on the amount of structure the elementary art program should contain. The <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> were in favor of a more rigidly structured art program while the art teachers preferred more freedom in the art program. Both the art and non-art teachers are going to find it necessary to communicate to each other their ideas of the role and the need for the professional art instructor in the elementary school as well as work together to develop an art curriculum acceptable to both groups. Further studies are needed to discover methods of opening the lines of communication between the art instructors and the <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> Both groups have many of the same basic objectives and opinions and must learn to cooperate with one another in order to develop an adequate elementary art curriculum acceptable to all.

2500|$|For Dewey and his {{philosophical}} followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners {{are taught}} {{that knowledge is}} transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. [...] Dewey not only re-imagined {{the way that the}} learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. [...] For Dewey, “The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education” (Dewey, 1904, p.18). [...] Dewey’s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> Dewey envisioned.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{emphasis}} is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is “impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now” (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.25). [...] However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. [...] While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a “lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill and character” (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.242) of the nation’s workforce. [...] As Dewey notes, {{there is a lack of}} these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. [...] According to Dewey, the profession of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> is to produce the intelligence, skill and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.|$|E
2500|$|For many, education’s {{purpose is}} to train {{students}} for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed {{to meet the needs}} of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). [...] For Dewey, the school and the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher,</b> as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. [...] Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. [...] It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. [...] If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).|$|E
