40|$|AbstractA {{wide variety}} of rapidly {{evolving}} algorithms of lithium-ion battery charge leads {{to the lack of}} statistics on the differential coefficient of a specific battery degradation, or in other words, a misunderstanding of the difference in the state of charge after several charge-discharge cycles as compared to a single one. As a solution of the problem the authors propose the usage of a universal integrated algorithm of LiFePO 4 batteries charging with initial and final trickle charge, which will both train the battery and reduce the differential <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation,</b> as well as allow testing of local grid power which the battery is charging from. This approach, if distributed widely, may give rich statistic information to be used for further improvement of charge algorithms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{improper}} charging on the performance (capacity, EER, power consumption, SEER, and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation)</b> of a residential air conditioner during the steady state (wet and dry coils) and cycling operation was investigated. The fully charged condition was established as a base case. A full charge was obtained charging the unit to the superheat specified by the manufacturer's charging chart for specific set of indoor and outdoor temperatures. Once the full charge was determined, the unit was subjected to 20 %, 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % under and overcharging of refrigerant (by mass). The fully charged tests were compared to under and overcharging. The performance of the unit was evaluated {{as a function of}} charge as well as at four outdoor room temperatures (82 ?F, 90 ?F, 95 ?F, and 100 ?F). As the outdoor temperature increased, the total capacity and EER dropped. The investigation of improper charging showed that the total capacity, EER, and SEER were more sensitive to undercharging than overcharging conditions. A 20 % undercharge resulted in a 21 % reduction in SEER while a 20 % overcharge produced a 11 % reduction in SEER. Other data such as refrigerant flow rate, sensible heat ratio, superheat and subcooling are also presented...|$|E

This study was the continuation of ESL/CON/ 88 - 1 performed by Mohsen Farzad and Dennis O'Neal. A fully charged condition was established as a base case. The full charge was obtained by charging the unit to the subcooling specified by the manufacturer for a specific indoor and outdoor temperatures. Once the full charge was determined, the unit was subjected to 40 %, 30 %, 20 %, 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % undercharging and 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % overcharging of refrigerant by mass. The fully charged tests were compared to those for under and overcharging. The performance of the unit was evaluated {{as a function of}} charge as well as at four outdoor room temperatures (82 ?F, 90 ?F, 95 ?F, and 100 ?F). As the outdoor temperature increased, the total capacity and EER dropped. The maximum total capacity, EER, and SEER were found at 10 % undercharging (12 6 oz). The capacity and efficiency (EER and SEER) of the unit were found to be less sensitive to under/overcharging than the unit with a capillary tube expansion previously studied.

However, {{it is necessary to}} identify species that combine fast nutrient release and longer permanence of the straw on the soil surface. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate straw degradation and nitrogen release from cover crops under no-tillage cropping systems. The field trial was performed during two growing seasons in summer (2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010) in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial arrangement. Treatments were the combination of five plants (four cover crops species, 1 - Panicum maximum, 2 - Brachiaria ruziziensis, 3. Brachiaria brizantha and 4. Pennisetum glaucum [millet], and fallow as a control) with six sampling times (first six weeks after application of glyphosate on the cover crops). Pennisetum glaucum and fallow showed faster straw degradation and nitrogen release. The cover crops Panicum maximum, Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria ruziziensis stood out in biomass production and in the amount of nitrogen in their shoots but had the lowest <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> and persisted longer on the soil surface than Pennisetum glaucum and fallow. 201...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical study {{concerned with the}} transient performance of heat pumps is presented. A series of tests were performed to study and characterize the transient sensible and dehumidification performance of a heat pump in the cooling node. All the tests were conducted according to the ASHRAE Standard (1983). The effects of indoor dry-bulb temperature (72 to 80 F), indoor relative humidity (20 to 67 %), outdoor dry-bulb temperature (82 to 100 F), cycling rate (0. 8 to 10 cph) and percent ON-time (20 to 95 %) on the transient performance (sensible and latent capacity, efficiency and sensible heat ratio) are addressed in this study. The results indicated that part load factor (PLF) can be as low as 0. 65 at low percent ON-times and high cycling rates. The combination of low percent ON-times and high cycling rates produced maximum cyclic losses. The dehumidification process usually started between 60 to 150 seconds after start-up depending on the indoor ambient conditions, percent ON-time and cycling rate. The sensible and latent capacity response and part load efficiency of the heat pump increased {{with an increase in}} indoor relative humidity. There was a slight increase in PLF with indoor dry-bulb temperature. The outdoor dry-bulb temperature did not have any effect on the transient performance. Based on the functional relationship of PLF and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> (C_D) with the five independent variables a multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the experimental data. The analysis yielded two general equations to predict PLF and C_D. A lumped parameter heat pump transient analysis computer model was developed, which drew upon methodologies from the earlier models by Chi and Didion [1982] and Oak Ridge National Laboratory [1981]. The model was capable of simulating the transient response of a vapor compression air-to-air heat pump commonly used in residential applications. The simulated results were in good agreement with the laboratory results at high percent ON-times (> 20) and high relative humidities (> 45) ...|$|E

The <b>degradation</b> rates <b>of</b> the copolymers were compared with the respective homopolymers. The copolymers and the homopolymers degraded randomly along the chain. The degradation rate was determined using continuous distribution kinetics. For all the polymers, CS TiO 2 exhibited superior photo-activity compared to the uncatalysed and DP 25 systems, owing to its high surface hydroxyl content and high specific surface area. The time evolution of the hydroxyl and hydroperoxide stretching vibration in the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the copolymers indicated that the degradation rate follows the order MMA–MAA > MMA–EA > MMA–BMA. The same order is observed for the rate <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> photocatalytic <b>degradation.</b> The photodegradation rate coefficients were compared with the activation energy <b>of</b> pyrolytic <b>degradation.</b> In degradation by pyrolysis, it was observed that MMA–BMA was the least stable followed by MMA–EA and MMA–MAA.

The objective of this thesis is to harness the combined properties of porous silicon and iron oxide nanoparticles and investigate the suitability of this nanocomposite as T 2 tunable materials for magnetic resonance imaging guided drug delivery. In the first two chapters, the tools and methodologies necessary for the development and study of porous silicon iron oxide nanocomposite based IGDD (image guided drug delivery) agents are identified and described. The optimization of transverse relaxation rate is crucial to building agents for magnetic resonance imaging. In this regard, in Chapter 3 {{the effects of the}} structural properties of iron oxide aggregates on transverse relaxation were studied. The transverse relaxation of several shapes of iron oxide nanoparticle clusters were analysed through monte carlo simulations. A shape described by a combination of circular and linear clusters was found to produce optimal transverse relaxation. Then, in Chapter 4 we investigate another mechanism to increase transverse relaxation. Here, the effect of tuning self diffusion <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> protons on transverse relaxation is studied by confining iron oxide aggregates into porous silicon matrices of two different pore sizes. Iron oxide nanoparticles loaded into 15 nm porous silicon increased R 2 {{to a greater extent than}} iron oxide nanoparticles loaded into a 25 nm porous silicon matrix. In Chapter 5, the utility of the above mentioned porous silicon iron oxide nanocomposites as image guided drug delivery agents is studied. Nanoparticle formulations with an imaging and a therapeutic agent could allow non invasive assessment of low molecular weight drugs releasing from nanoparticles. In this regard, release of a hydrophobic drug and a hydrophilic drug from biodegradable porous silicon iron oxide nanocomposites were studied invitro. Quantification of drug release, self-diffusion <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> protons during <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the matrix and transverse relaxation times during 0 - 8 hours revealed the change in self- diffusion <b>coefficient</b> during <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the matrix as the mechanism for tuning transverse relaxation of porous silicon iron oxide nanocomposites.

The rate of dehydrochlorination at 1 % degradation (RDH) and the time required for dehydrochlorination to attain 1 % conver-sion (tDH) were used to assess the effect of the additives on the thermal susceptibility of PVC. It was found that the values of the RDH were relatively lower and the tDH were con-siderably higher than the value obtained {{in the absence of the}} additives. The degradation rate coefficients were determined from the rate of dehydrochlorinating. The following rate expressions R = k[PVC] 0. 77 [benzoic acid]- 0. 40, R = k[PVC] 0. 71 [1, 2 propane diol]- 1. 78, R= K[PVC] 0. 67 [EDTA]- 2. 18, and R = k[PVC] 0. 88 [phenol]- 0. 28 were obtained.

40|$|Nested {{sampling}} for parameter inference {{in systems}} biology: application to an exemplar circadian model Stuart Aitken 1 * and Ozgur E Akman 2 Background: Model selection and parameter inference are complex {{problems that have}} yet to be fully addressed in systems biology. In contrast with parameter optimisation, parameter inference computes both the parameter means and their standard deviations (or full posterior distributions), thus yielding important information {{on the extent to which}} the data and the model topology constrain the inferred parameter values. Results: We report on the application of nested sampling, a statistical approach to computing the Bayesian evidence Z, to the inference of parameters, and the estimation of log Z in an established model of circadian rhythms. A ten-fold difference in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation between <b>degradation</b> and transcription parameters is demonstrated. We further show that the uncertainty remaining in the parameter values is reduced by the analysis of increasing numbers of circadian cycles of data, up to 4 cycles, but is unaffected by sampling the data more frequently. Novel algorithms for calculating the likelihood of a model, and a characterisation of the performance of the nested sampling algorithm are also reported. The methods we develop considerably improve the computational efficiency of the likelihood calculation, and of the exploratory step within nested sampling. Conclusions: We have demonstrated in an exemplar circadian model that the estimates of posterior parameter densities (as summarised by parameter means and standard deviations) are influenced predominately by the length of the time series, becoming more narrowly constrained as the number of circadian cycles considered increases. We have also shown the utility <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation for discriminating between highly-constrained and less-well constrained parameters...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{health monitoring}} of aircraft engines. Two methods are offered for engine degradation assessment: (1) a direct method to isolate <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> engine components in-flight, and (2) an inverse method {{to quantify the}} level <b>of</b> <b>degradations</b> post-flight. The noted feature <b>of</b> the <b>degradation</b> isolation method is its independence from training, which makes it suitable for on-board implementation. The degradation quantification method, on the other hand, is a multi-output method of parameter estimation with the advantage of leveraging the shape attributes of model outputs. The representation of the shape attributes of the various time series, by continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs), is the salient feature of both the direct and inverse methods developed in this research. It enables the isolation of regions in the time-scale plane, called “signatures,” wherein the wavelet <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> a given transform time series dominate the wavelet <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the others. These methods <b>of</b> engine <b>degradation</b> isolation and quantification have been validated numerically using the transient outputs of a high-bypass turbo-fan engine model provided by Pratt 2 ̆ 6 Whitney Company. In the direct method, residuals will continually be formed in-flight to represent the difference between individual outputs and their baseline. These residuals will then be contrasted {{with each other to}} reveal “degradation signatures,” denoting the effect <b>of</b> the present <b>degradation</b> on individual residuals. To perform degradation isolation, the observed degradation effect will be compared with the pre-established effect <b>of</b> individual components’ <b>degradation</b> on the outputs according to the engine model. These pre-established effects are defined according to the sensitivity of outputs to component parameters, denoted as “output/parameter signatures,” and to combined component parameters, denoted as “output/component signatures. ” The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in engine simulations.

The samples are irradiated in air at room temperature with gamma rays from a $Co^{ 60 }$ source at a dose rate of 0. 26 Mrad/h. The change in crystallinity is measured by an x-ray technique. The expansion coefficient is found to increase with radiation dose below 140 K owing to the predominant effect <b>of</b> <b>degradation.</b> Above 140 K, the expansion coefficient is found to decrease with radiation dose because of the enhanced crystallinity. The temperatures of the two first-order phase transitions are also found to shift to lower temperatures owing to <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> PTFE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the image quality {{assessment}} (IQA) task using a natural image statistics approach. A reduced reference (RRIQA) measure based on the bidimensional empirical mode decomposition is introduced. First, we decompose both, reference and distorted images, into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and then we use the generalized Gaussian density (GGD) to model IMF <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the reference image. Finally, we measure the impairment of a distorted image by fitting error between the IMF <b>coefficients</b> histogram <b>of</b> the distorted image and the estimated IMF <b>coefficients</b> distribution <b>of</b> the reference image, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Furthermore, to predict the quality, we propose a new support vector machine-based (SVM) classification approach {{as an alternative to}} logistic function-based regression. In order to validate the proposed measure, three benchmark datasets are involved in our experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed metric compare favorably with alternative solutions for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> encountered in practical situations...|$|R

Gov'tBACKGROUND: Model {{selection}} and parameter inference are complex {{problems that have}} yet to be fully addressed in systems biology. In contrast with parameter optimisation, parameter inference computes both the parameter means and their standard deviations (or full posterior distributions), thus yielding important information {{on the extent to which}} the data and the model topology constrain the inferred parameter values. RESULTS: We report on the application of nested sampling, a statistical approach to computing the Bayesian evidence Z, to the inference of parameters, and the estimation of log Z in an established model of circadian rhythms. A ten-fold difference in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation between <b>degradation</b> and transcription parameters is demonstrated. We further show that the uncertainty remaining in the parameter values is reduced by the analysis of increasing numbers of circadian cycles of data, up to 4 cycles, but is unaffected by sampling the data more frequently. Novel algorithms for calculating the likelihood of a model, and a characterisation of the performance of the nested sampling algorithm are also reported. The methods we develop considerably improve the computational efficiency of the likelihood calculation, and of the exploratory step within nested sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated in an exemplar circadian model that the estimates of posterior parameter densities (as summarised by parameter means and standard deviations) are influenced predominately by the length of the time series, becoming more narrowly constrained as the number of circadian cycles considered increases. We have also shown the utility <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation for discriminating between highly-constrained and less-well constrained parameters.
