5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses {{as far as the}} eye <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Chandra Mahal has {{the most}} luxurious room in the palace, which houses gold plated deities and {{paintings}} inlaid with precious stones. In the royal bedroom, mirrors have been strategically placed so that the Maharaja <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from his bed, any intruder entering his room.|$|E
5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher <b>could</b> <b>see</b> everyone but each <b>could</b> <b>see</b> only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E
50|$|Carvings like Gajasinghe Katayama, Hansa Puttuwa, flower {{designs and}} sculptures of dancers <b>could</b> be <b>seen.</b> Other than that, carvings about day-to-day life {{can also be}} found. Many wood carvings that <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> in Embekka Devalaya <b>could</b> also be <b>seen</b> here.|$|R

5|$|The River Yar trail {{runs through}} the village with the {{milestone}} outside the village Pub. In addition to this, bridleways are maintained, running to nearby villages Wroxall and Niton. Future plans <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a pedestrian link from Whitwell to Niton along the main road.|$|E
5|$|The armier {{were men}} from Ariège in the Pyrenees who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{and talk to}} the souls of the dead. The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a {{lethargy}} and travelled in spirit {{to the land of the}} dead, to communicate with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{takes its}} name from Bredon Hill, a low rise in the Worcestershire countryside that Harrison <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from his home in Malvern.|$|E
5000|$|Captain Bertorelli <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> singing [...] "'O Sole Mio (It's Now or Never)"; and the British airmen in a {{prisoner}} of war camp <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> singing [...] "Hitler Has Only Got One Ball".|$|R

5|$|After seeing minor {{action in}} the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27, the 22nd {{remained}} in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond. The men of the 22nd <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the steeples of Richmond from their camp. By this time, the regiment {{had been reduced to}} roughly 750 men due to sickness {{over the course of the}} campaign and minor casualties in action.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site. This <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 degrees to the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments.|$|E
60|$|She <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> {{the outline}} of his head silhouetted against the wind-tossed sky; she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his eyes, nor his lips, but she felt his nearness, and the {{happiness}} of that almost caused her to swoon.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{calculated}} {{she must}} have seen a thousand miners {{in less than two}} miles of the gulch, and then she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> up the draws and washes that intersected the slope, and she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> beyond the camp.|$|R
50|$|From Mount Hureish, Mount Ebal <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> to {{the south}} and the Wadi Ara plain <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> to the northwest. At its western foot is the Palestinian village of Jaba', and Meithalun and Siris are the closest villages to the east.|$|R
5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{died before}} he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the GTP through to completion. He was eulogized {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. During the period in which Hays led the GTR it saw its most prosperous era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the right}} {{rear of the}} French {{position}} was the substantial village of Plancenoit, and at the extreme right, the Bois de Paris wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near La Belle Alliance early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.|$|E
60|$|Albinia {{thought of}} {{knocking}} and calling at the door, but somehow it seemed impossible, {{and she decided}} on promenading past his window to show that she was ready for him. But alas! those evergreens! She <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> in, and probably he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> out.|$|R
6000|$|The light flickered, he <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> {{her head}} appear, with hair all loose, {{and her face}} turning up to him. He <b>could</b> only half <b>see,</b> half imagine it, mysterious, blurry; and he whispered: ...|$|R
50|$|At 2pm, every Sunday in March 2011, a {{dialogue}} took place. The dialogues were devised {{so that a}} member of the scientific community dialogued with {{a member of the}} world of visual art. The audience <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> the two dialoguing people, who <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> each other either.|$|R
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch {{on each side of}} the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that <b>could</b> <b>see</b> but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade. The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large hydroelectricity project in highland Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Fyne moved {{a little}} in her chair. I turned to her and remarked gently {{that this was a}} charge, a criticism, which was often made. Some people always ask: What <b>could</b> he <b>see</b> in her? Others wonder what she <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> in him? Expressions of unsuitability.|$|R

60|$|I <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> Dian in the darkness, but I {{knew that}} she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> my {{features}} or recognize me; and I enjoyed in anticipation, even while I was fighting for her life and mine, her dear joy when she should discover that it was I who was her deliverer.|$|R
5|$|The {{team also}} {{emphasized}} gameplay for the player to learn without tutorial and storytelling {{that did not}} interrupt the play experience. Compared to the previous game, the developers wanted Lara Croft Go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling, such that the player <b>could</b> <b>see</b> puzzles in their entirety and focus instead on solving for the correct sequence. The camera also follows Croft rather than remaining stationary.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the picture...the Kingston Trio were {{probably the best}} commercial group going, {{and they seemed to}} know what they were doing.|$|E
5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
