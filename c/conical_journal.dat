40|$|This {{research}} paper {{deals with the}} theoretical study of comparison of capillary and orifice compensated non-recess hole-entry hydrostatic/ hybrid <b>conical</b> <b>journal</b> bearing. Modified Reynolds equation governing the flow of lubricant in the clearance space of <b>conical</b> <b>journal</b> and bearing has been solved using FEM, Newton-Raphson method and Gauss elimination method. Spherical coordinate system has been employed to obtain the results. The results have been computed for uniform distribution of holes in the circumferential direction with the range of restrictor design parameter C ̅_s 2 = 0. 02 - 0. 1. The numerically simulated result shows, the use of orifice restrictor is to increase bearing stiffness, threshold speed and maximum pressure compared to capillary restrictor for applied radial load...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of 4 -pocket capillary compensated conical hybrid journal bearing system operating with micropolar lubricant. The modified Reynolds equation for a <b>conical</b> <b>journal</b> bearing system operating with micropolar lubricant has been derived. In the present study, Eringen's micropolar theory {{has been used to}} model micropolar lubrication in cylindrical coordinate system. The study has been carried out for the different values of micropolar parameters, that is, characteristic length () and coupling number (). The conical bearing configurations having semicone angle 10 ∘, 20 ∘, 30 ∘, and 40 ∘ have been studied. The study suggests that micropolar lubricant offers better performance vis- á-vis Newtonian lubricant for bearing configurations having values of semicone angle 10 ∘and 20 ∘...|$|E
50|$|Spiral groove thrust {{bearings}} produce the required pressure {{to keep the}} bearing surfaces lubricated and separated purely by the pumping effect of the grooves, whereas <b>journal,</b> <b>conical</b> and spherical forms also get extra pressure generation by the hydrodynamic bearing wedge action. When {{the parts of the}} bearings are rotated with respect to each other the grooves push the lubricant through the bearing between the surfaces causing an overall rise in the pressure.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{theoretical}} {{analysis for}} performance {{characteristics of a}} <b>conical</b> multirecess hydrostatic <b>journal</b> bearing compensated with constant flow valve {{has been carried out}} considering micropolar lubricant. The numerical solution of the modified Reynolds equation for the conical bearing has been done using finite element method with necessary boundary conditions. The performance characteristics have been presented for various values of the restrictor design parameter, load, micropolar parameters, semi-cone angle and aspect ratio (L/D ratio) of the bearing at zero speed. It has been observed that the bearing develops large stiffness and damping coefficients with increase in restrictor design parameter, micropolar effect and semi-cone angle...|$|R
