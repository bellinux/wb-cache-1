40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the fantastic Voyage in French Literature from 1662 to 1789, that is to say a number of works of prose-fiction in which can clearly be {{recognised}} a pattern of voyage and discovery, but in which the author (in spite of a somotimes ambiguous attitude) encourages the reader's disbelief in the characters and the adventures recounted. This study therefore aims at being complementary to those of Geoffrey Atkinson on the Extraordinary Voyage. The Fantastic Voyage was felt as an entity by contemporaries, in spite of a certain <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> in the classification of fiction. Its sources are numerous, for {{it is one of the}} earliest types of fiction; but the genre underwent during the seventeenth century a definite twist which increased its dependence on contemporary philosophy, either of a rationalistic or of an occultist type. Nevertheless, the existing pattern could also be applied to literary criticism (of an author or a genre) to the satire of manners, or to the spreading of revolutionary ideas; its study therefore has a sociological as well as a literary interest. After an examination of the various types of fantastic Voyages (determined either by the setting or by the philosophical attitude of the author), there is a summary of the salient features of the genre. Finally, there is a bibliography of the works studied within the period considered, which helps one to appreciate the popularity of this type of fiction. <p...|$|E

5000|$|Well-established {{rules of}} {{evidence}} permit trial judges to exclude defense evidence if its probative value is outweighed by its unfair prejudice, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>issues,</b> or potential to mislead the jury. The Court noted that it had elaborated on this standard by permitting the exclusion of evidence that is [...] "repetitive, only marginally relevant or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the issues." [...] Rules regulating the admissibility of third-party guilt apply this principle, because this evidence is often too speculative or remotely associated with the crime. The Court observed that these rules are widely accepted, and were not {{in and of themselves}} being challenged in this case.|$|R
40|$|Proper {{conceptualisation}} of {{key concepts}} {{is crucial to}} the development of any field of study. However, this is not necessarily true {{when it comes to the}} field of strategy. Although it is widely accepted that firm performance is an essential variable in the strategy literature and that diversification is the most commonly studied variable of strategy (Dess, Gupta, Hennart, & Hill, 1995) the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> proper operationalisation is conspicuously absent. It is readily observable that there is a plethora of measures being employed to measure both diversification and firm performance. However, the measures of performance and diversification that have been employed have not been unanimously agreed upon. In addition to this general state <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> international variations across measures has not been evaluated.

California Evidence Code section 352 also allows for exclusion to avoid [...] "substantial danger of undue prejudice." [...] For example, evidence that the victim of a car accident was apparently a [...] "liar, cheater, womanizer, and a man of low morals" [...] was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant to whether he had a valid product liability claim against the manufacturer of the tires on his van (which had rolled over resulting in severe brain damage).|$|R
50|$|Old Chief v. United States, , {{discussed}} the limitation on admitting relevant evidence {{set forth in}} Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Under this rule, otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger <b>of</b> unfair prejudice, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>issues,</b> misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, wasting time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. In this case, Old Chief offered to stipulate to the fact of a prior conviction, which was {{an element of the}} crime with which he was charged. The prosecution resisted this stipulation, arguing that it had the right to present its case in any manner it chose. In Old Chief, the Court applied Rule 403 to the particular situation presented by this case, and concluded that Rule 403 required the trial court to accept the defendant's stipulation to a prior conviction over the prosecution's objection.|$|R
40|$|With the {{discovery}} of the five nearly complete hominin crania at the Dmanisi site in the Republic of Georgia, the discoverers have caused some controversy by aligning them with the middle Pleistocene Homo erectus based on facial and cranial morphology. This classification is used to imply that both H. habilis and H. erectus belong as a single highly variable species; a classification which ignores the presence of important primitive characteristics and earlier origin date that set Homo habilis apart from their descendants. There is even enough evidence for some anthropologists to consider splitting these two populations into still more classifications. In an attempt to clear up the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> this <b>issue,</b> both the stature and cranial capacity of the Dmanisi sample was compared to both available H. habilis and H. erectus data. When considered as two separate taxa, these tests strongly support the idea that the Georgian hominins in question should be considered Homo habilis, which in itself should remain apart from the H. erectus hypodigm...|$|R

European Journal of International Relations, 19 (4), 669 - 69 The {{notion of}} ?reflexivity? {{has been so}} intimately tied to the {{critique}} of positivism and empiricism in International Relations (IR) that the emergence of post-positivism has naturally produced the anticipation of a ?reflexive turn? in IR theory. Three decades after {{the launch of the}} post-positivist critique, however, reflexive IR has failed to impose itself as either a clear or serious contender to mainstream scholarship. Reasons for this failure include: the proliferation of different understandings of ?reflexivity? in IR theory that entail significantly different projects and concerns for IR scholarship; the equation of ?reflexive theory? with ?critical? and ?emancipatory theory? and the consequent <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> ethical/normative <b>issues</b> with strictly epistemic/theoretical ones; and the refusal to consider reflexive IR as a ?research programme? concerned with empirical knowledge, not just meta-explanation. The development of reflexivity in IR theory as a sustainable cognitive and praxeological effort is nonetheless possible ? and still needed. This article suggests what taking the ?reflexive turn? would really entail for IR. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how {{decreases}} in CO[subscript 2] emissions would affect global temperatures has been hampered {{in recent years}} by <b>confusion</b> regarding <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> committed warming and irreversibility. The notion that there will be additional future warming or “warming in the pipeline” if the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were to remain fixed at current levels (1) has been misinterpreted to mean that the rate of increase in Earth's global temperature is inevitable, regardless of how much or how quickly emissions decrease (2 – 4). Further misunderstanding may stem from recent studies showing that the warming that has already occurred as a result of past anthropogenic carbon dioxide increases is irreversible on a time scale of at least 1000 years (5, 6). But irreversibility of past changes does not mean that further warming is unavoidable...|$|R

40|$|The (mis) use of {{profitability}} analysis in competition law cases The UK Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission have recently taken {{the position that}} the analysis of an industry’s profits can yield important information about how competitive it is. This approach is not used in the US and rarely in the EU. There are a number of good reasons for this. First, it is not true that, even in a long-run competitive equilibrium, firms will earn zero economic profits as one would normally measure them. Second, {{there are a number of}} reasons why firms might earn economic profits well above their cost of capital that should not be of concern to competition authorities. Third, measuring profitability in an economically meaningful way is virtually impossible to do for any complex businesss. The analysis of profitability in competition cases will not help us distinguish successfully between competitive and co-operative pricing, but it will add <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>issues</b> and lead to bad policy decisions. 2 CRA COMPETITION POLICY DISCUSSION PAPERSThe model of perfect competition, much beloved by first year economic textbooks, holds that firms earn zero economic profits. At the other extreme, monopolists earn positive economic profits. A superficial analysis might suggest that one way to determine how competitive markets are is to look at how profitable the firms in that market are. Low profitability under this approach would be associated with a high degree of competitiveness; high profits would be evidence of a lack of competition. This certainly seems to be the view of the UK competition authorities. In his recent paper presented at Fordham,...|$|R

Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord at birth is the oldest intervention in humans. Even though many aspects of the timing for cord clamping have been clarified, some questions still remain unanswered. If delayed cord clamping is to become a standard approach which timing is the optimal? And depending on the mode of delivery should timing be the same or different for normal vaginal delivery or for caesarean section? What about  the compromised neonate, or the very preterm one? We have more questions than answers. More randomized controlled studies are needed in normal and pathologic neonates, in order to address these questions, before we practice delayed cord clamping with safety for the babies and the mothers. </p...|$|R

60|$|In {{a hollow}} of the hill, {{about a quarter}} of a mile from the field of battle, was a shepherd's hut; a miserable cottage, which, as the only {{enclosed}} spot within a moderate distance, the leaders of the presbyterian army had chosen for their council-house. Towards this spot Burley guided Morton, who was surprised, as he approached it, at the multifarious <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> sounds which <b>issued</b> from its precincts. The calm and anxious gravity which it might be supposed would have presided in councils held on such important subjects, and at a period so critical, seemed to have given place to discord wild, and loud uproar, which fell on the ear of their new ally as an evil augury of their future measures. As they approached the door, they found it open indeed, but choked up with the bodies and heads of countrymen, who, though no members of the council, felt no scruple in intruding themselves upon deliberations in which they were so deeply interested. By expostulation, by threats, and even by some degree of violence, Burley, the sternness of whose character maintained a sort of superiority over these disorderly forces, compelled the intruders to retire, and, introducing Morton into the cottage, secured the door behind them against impertinent curiosity. At a less agitating moment, the young man might have been entertained with the singular scene of which he now found himself an auditor and a spectator.|$|R
