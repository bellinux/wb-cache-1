50|$|ZIL-112 Sports was {{a soviet}} sports car made by Zavod Imeni Likhacheva in 1961 and competed in races from 1961 to 1969. Two cars were built. The 112S {{initiated}} {{a number of}} firsts for cars produced in the USSR such as <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential,</b> disc brakes, radial-ply tires etc. One ZiL-112S was powered by a 6.0 L V8 with 230 hp. A second ZiL-112S was equipped with a 270 hp 7.0 L V8. Both engines were developed from the ZIS-110 engine. Depending on the engine, the top speed was 260 - 270 km/h. It could do 0-100 km/h in 9 seconds. The total weight was 1330 kg. Steering and front suspension came from the GAZ M21 Volga. In the rear, it used De Dion suspension with triangular levers. The transmission, like the engine, was from the ZIS-110. The body {{was similar to the}} Ferrari 250.|$|E

50|$|The XWD system debuted on the 2008 {{limited edition}} Saab Turbo X, {{equipped}} with an electronically <b>controlled</b> limited <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> (eLSD) and was gradually made available {{through the rest of}} the 9-3 line (in sedan and combi body styles). XWD will be the standard drivetrain for the new generation Saab 9-5, expected as a 2010 model year vehicle and will also underpin Saab's upcoming cross-over utility vehicle, the 2011 Saab 9-4X, as well as the Saab 9-3X, an off-road modification of the 9-3 SportCombi. This XWD system is also used in Opel Insignia.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Mechanical limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> provide a low cost {{traction}} solution. However, their passive nature {{means that they}} cannot adapt to different scenarios and their yaw moment generation potential cannot be used for vehicle handling or stability <b>control.</b> Active limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> are becoming popular as {{they are able to}} exploit this potential and also achieve a better traction compromise due to their ability to adapt to different scenarios. This paper describes the development of a control algorithm for an ALSD fitted to a RWD sports saloon vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this master thesis work were to develop control strategies for electronically <b>controlled</b> limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> with main aspect on the yaw rate. The control strategies {{were developed in}} Matlab/Simulink {{with the use of}} VehSim, GM version of the commercial product CarSim. An ideal electronically controlled LSD (eLSD) and a new invention called Direction Sensitive Locking Differential (DSLD) were evaluated. A bicycle model was derived to use as a reference model and an extended model was derived to show the influence on the vehicle behaviour from the differential. The control strategy implemented for the eLSD combines logic with a variable PID-controller and the strategy for the DSLD was based on logic. To evaluate the control strategies, four different driving scenarios were simulated. The results from the simulations are that with the control strategies developed in this master thesis work the vehicle’s stability, traction and cornering performance are enhanced significantly...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} changes to the S15 model of the Silvia fitted with the 6-speed manual {{transmission}} built by Aisin AI was {{the implementation of a}} helical limited <b>slip</b> <b>differential.</b> The result was a safer, more track suited drive; in some contrast to its drifting heritage and subsequent media attention.

5000|$|Equalise {{the torque}} better between the driveshafts {{by using a}} low {{friction}} differential. The torque difference is zero if the differential is frictionless, and limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials,</b> intended to increase power transfer, actually make torque steer much worse. For this reason, limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> by automobile transmission manufacturers like Quaife, Torsen, TrueTrac, Gold Trac have not been much used until recently, and require other measures to be implemented, such as careful positioning of suspension pivot points and driveshaft CV joints, {{in order to keep}} the resultant torque steer to a manageable amount. Limited <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> do not improve cornering, or steering feel, however they will improve power transfer in situations where one wheel experiences limited adhesion, and so may improve overall performance.|$|R
