A hypothesis to explain the phenomenon of synergism between two endwise-acting cellobiohydrolases is presented. It is suggested that the cellobiohydrolases may be two stereospecific enzymes concerned with the hydrolysis of the two different configurations of non-reducing end groups that would exist in cellulose.

40|$|SummaryDiscovery of {{microorganisms}} producing enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze cellulosic biomass {{is of great}} importance for biofuel production. To date, however, only a miniscule fraction of natural biodiversity has been tested because of the relatively low throughput of screening systems and their limitation to screening only culturable microorganisms. Here, we describe an ultra-high-throughput droplet-based microfluidic system that allowed the screening of over 100, 000 cells in less than 20  min. Uncultured bacteria from a wheat stubble field were screened directly by compartmentalization of single bacteria in 20 pl droplets containing a fluorogenic <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> substrate. Sorting of droplets based on <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> activity resulted in a bacterial population with 17 - and 7 -fold higher <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> and endogluconase activity, respectively, and very different taxonomic diversity than when selected for growth on medium containing starch and carboxymethylcellulose as carbon source...|$|E

Several members of the class Zygomycetes are involved in different biotechnological applications, in consequence of their efficient extracellular enzyme production. Because of the increasing interest in the microbial biodegradation, isolates of Mucor corticolus (syn. : M. circinelloides f. corticolus) and Gilbertella persicaria were screened for their secreted <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> (1, 4 -β-D-glucan <b>cellobiohydrolase)</b> and beta-glucosidase activities.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the production of these cellulolytic enzymes on a cheap, exploitable agricultural waste.

The expression level of both recombinant enzymes was compared with that obtained using Pichia pastoris, {{under the control of}} the AOX 1 promoter to evaluate the utility of Y. lipolytica as a host strain for recombinant EGII and CBHII production. Extracellular endoglucanase activity was similar between TEF-preoproLip 2 -eglII expressed in Y. lipolytica and P. pastoris induced by 0. 5 % (v/v) methanol, but when recombinant protein expression in P. pastoris was induced with 3 % (v/v) methanol, the activity was increased by about sevenfold.

40|$|In the anaerobic, thermophilic, {{cellulolytic}} bacterium Clostridium thermocellum, efficient solubilization of the insoluble cellulose substrate {{is accomplished}} largely through {{the action of}} a cellulose-binding multienzyme complex, the cellulosome. A major <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> activity from the cellulosome has been traced to its Mr 75, 000 S 8 subunit, and an active fragment of this subunit was prepared by a novel procedure involving limited proteolytic cleavage. The truncated Mr 68, 000 fragment, termed S 8 -tr, was purified by gel filtration and high-performance ion-exchange chromatography. The purified protein adsorbed weakly to amorphous cellulose, and its enzymatic action yielded cellobiose as the major end product from both amorphous and crystalline cellulose preparations. The high ratio of exo- to endo-beta-glucanase activities was supported by viscosimetric measurements. The use of model substrates showed that the smallest cellodextrin to be degraded was cellotetraose, but cellopentaose was degraded at a much greater rate. Cellobiose dramatically inhibited the cellulolytic activities. In the absence of calcium or other bivalent metal ions, both the truncated <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> activity of S 8 -tr and the true cellulase activity of the parent cellulosome were relatively unstable at temperatures above 50 degrees C. Cysteine further enhanced the stabilizing effect of calcium. This is the first report of a defined <b>cellobiohydrolase</b> in C. thermocellum.
