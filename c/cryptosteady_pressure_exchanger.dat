40|$|The {{use of a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or wave rotor, in an air-cycle air {{conditioner}} is examined {{as an alternative to}} vapor-compression cycles which use chloroflourocarbons (CFC's), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). In a <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> expansion and normal shock waves are the mechanisms which transfer energy from a high pressure gas, by expanding it, to a low pressure gas, by compressing it. The device consists of a rotor which is divided into cells and a stator end-plate which controls inflow and outflow. A one-dimensional, homentropic unsteady numerical model was developed using the method of characteristics to simulate the flow through one cell. By entering the inlet and outlet pressures, the locations of the high pressure inlet and outlet ports and the low pressure inlet and outlet ports are calculated based on flow conditions. The mass flow rate through the system {{and the size of the}} rotor are also determined. Besides the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> an air-to-air heat exchanger and air compressor are necessary to develop an air conditioning cycle. These components can be arranged into six configurations of which two are superior to the rest. One configuration consists of the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor working in parallel to raise room air to a higher pressure and temperature so that the heat can be transferred outside. In the other configuration, room air is compressed in stages, first by the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and then by the compressor with heat exchangers located after each compression stage. Six configurations of these components can provide cooling. Three involve expanding outside air below atmospheric pressure to absorb heat from the cooled space. These are not practical because of variability due to outside ambient humidity, high outlet temperatures for cool air to prevent frosting, and high volumetric flow rates of air. Of the three systems which compress room air to extract energy, the configuration with the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor operating in parallel exhibited slightly better performance than the two configurations where the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor compress the air in series...|$|R

50|$|One {{particularly}} efficient type of <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> is a rotary <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger.</b> This device uses a cylindrical rotor with longitudinal ducts {{parallel to}} its rotational axis.

50|$|One {{application}} in which <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{are widely used}} is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> are used as energy recovery devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes C is directed 3 to the ERD D. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream 1 becomes stream 4), which it then merges (with {{the aid of a}} circulation pump B) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump A. This combined stream feeds the membranes C. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure 5, expelled by the incoming feedwater flow 1. <b>Pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the high pressure pump. In a seawater RO system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane feed flow. Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the high pressure pump. Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane feed flow is pressurized with almost no energy input.|$|R

40|$|Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a {{promising}} technology {{to reduce the}} specific energy consumption of a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant. In this study, it is projected that 25. 6 - 40. 7 millionkWh/day of energy can be recovered globally, if the brines from SWRO are used as the draw solution and diluted to the seawater level in a PRO system. Detailed integrated SWRO-PRO processes are developed in this study with the option to form a closed-loop SWRO-PRO process that can substantially reduce the pretreatment cost of desalination. The governing mathematical models that describe both the transport phenomena on a module level and the energy flow on a system level are developed to evaluate the performances of the SWRO-PRO processes. The model aims to investigate {{the performance of the}} hollow fibers as dilution occurs and provides guidelines on hollow fiber module design and process operation.

40|$|There are few energy {{recovery}} devices (ERD) {{available on the}} market for small reverse osmosis units (RO). With reference to small units, installations have been considered which could be driven easily by a photovoltaic (PV) generator with an output of 200 litres up to 10 m(3) desalinated water per day [1 - 14]. In this paper, a systematic analysis for typical reverse osmosis concepts is presented which allows better understanding of the energy demand of small RO processes with {{energy recovery}} and which {{can be used as a}} decision tool. In contrast to publications already in existence which compare energy recovery devices [9, 10, 12, 15 - 27], the smallest devices are considered here. These are often positive displacement devices [3, 10, 16, 28, 29]. The new method of analysis takes as a basis the same physical parameters for all RO concepts, starting with the calculation of the osmotic pressure. Assumptions by an expert for possible operating parameters (recovery ratio, the feed and the concentrate pressure), known as the hydraulic envelope (suggested by Manth and Oklejas [30]) are not required. All parameters are considered dependent on the recovery rate. The following RO concepts are analysed: without energy recovery (noER) with energy recovery via reverse running pump or turbine (ER-EC) <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> (ER-PE) intermittent operation with pressure storage (ER-BP) pressure intensifier (ER-PI) These basic concepts are compared for steady state operation. The analysis shows the ideal recovery ratio related to the specific energy consumption (SEC) for each RO concept. With this basic analysis it is possible to choose the most energy-efficient hydraulic concept for a specified RO capacity in order to combine it with a solar energy supply. In particular variable operation and frequent shutdowns and start-ups are typical requirements for small PV-RO systems without energy storage.

In other words, GHG minimization comes at a capital cost penalty for SWRO: a paradigm shift may be needed to adopt GHG minimization as the new optimum. There could also be opportunities for further energy reduction if novel super permeability RO membranes under development are used optimally. For example, {{it may be possible to}} reduce energy using a ‘close to osmotic pressure’ strategy with a multistage process, inter-stage booster pumps and energy recovery devices.

The effects of additional design parameters such as feed tank volume {{at the end of the}} cycle, volume of water in the pipes, per-pass recovery, cycle operating time, and cycle reset time on the performance of BRO are captured.

At low cycle-reset time (10 % of productive time) and low piping volumes (12 % of volume inside membrane elements), about 13 % energy savings is possible compared to a continuous system operating at the same overall pure water productivity. Under these conditions, we also show that the ideal per-pass recovery is close to 50 %, similar to single-stage RO. This recovery reduces the need for system redesign with additional pressure vessels in parallel, contrary to predictions in the literature.
