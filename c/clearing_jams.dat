50|$|The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission {{estimates}} that each year {{there are approximately}} 5,740 snowblower related injuries in the United States which require medical attention. One problem with {{the design of the}} snow blower is that snow can build up in the auger, jamming it and stalling the motor. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} the auger could deform before applying enough resistance to the motor to turn it off. If the <b>jam</b> is <b>cleared</b> by hand, it is possible for the auger to return to its natural shape suddenly and with great force, possibly injuring the user; snow blowers are a leading cause of traumatic hand and finger amputations. The correct procedure is to turn off the engine, disengage the clutch and then <b>clear</b> the <b>jam</b> with a broom handle or other long object. In an effort to improve safety, many manufacturers now include a plastic tool to be used to <b>clear</b> <b>jams,</b> often mounted directly to the snow blower.|$|R

50|$|Typically, users {{approach}} their artifacts {{with very different}} competencies. The Semantic Turn offers the possibility of accommodating these differences by allowing the design of several semantic layers.

50|$|To {{limit the}} weight, {{the amount of}} {{armouring}} also had to be reduced.

As the base of the turret was unprotected, a jacking feature was fitted to <b>clear</b> any <b>jam</b> resulting from enemy action.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the ready}} {{availability}} of a reliable synchronization gear, several methods were tried to mount a machine gun in a position from which it {{would be able to}} fire past rather than through the arc of the propeller. Even after reasonably reliable synchronization was available for closed bolt weapons such as the Vickers gun there were reasons for avoiding synchronization. Even the best synchronization gears were liable to failure, and there were special hazards in firing incendiary and explosive ammunition through the propeller arc. Some weapons, such as the Lewis gun, were not easy to synchronize at all. An alternative was to fire over the propeller, {{especially in the case of}} a biplane aircraft, where the structure of the upper wing formed a convenient base. A drawback was that such a mount was less robust than a mounting on the forward fuselage, and the accuracy of the gun, especially at long range, was affected by vibration. The main difficulty, however, was the need for the pilot or gunner to have access to the breech of the gun, to change drums or belts as well as to <b>clear</b> <b>jams.</b>|$|R
25|$|The most {{pressing}} complaint {{about the new}} Pfalz was that the guns were buried in the fuselage, preventing pilots from <b>clearing</b> gun <b>jams</b> in flight. This feature had been carried over from the earlier Roland designs. In November 1917, Pfalz responded by producing the slightly modified D.IIIa, which relocated the guns to the upper fuselage decking. The D.IIIa was distinguishable by its enlarged semicircular horizontal stabilizer and cropped lower wingtips. It also featured a more powerful version of the Mercedes D.III engine.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 May 1916, Urban and Otto Jäger, his aerial observer, engaged a Russian {{aircraft}} with a crew of three. During a prolonged battle of more than 25 minutes, Jäger fired 300 shots at the Russians before his machine gun jammed. Urban then fired with a carbine while his gunner <b>cleared</b> the <b>jam.</b> Jäger then reopened fire, and drove the Russian plane down just within its own lines. When friendly infantry verified the downing, Urban had his first aerial victory.|$|R
