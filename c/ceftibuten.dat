50|$|In 3,000 patients, <b>ceftibuten</b> {{was well}} tolerated. The most {{frequent}} reactions were gastrointestinal and nausea.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of third generation cephalosporins have the aminothiazole group at position C-7. Different groups are {{found at the}} 7-α-position like 7-α-iminohydroxy and 7-α-iminomethoxy. <b>Ceftibuten</b> however possesses a 7-α-ethylidene group. This group gives <b>ceftibuten</b> higher resistance to enhanced spectrum β-lactamases. Many of the oral third generation cephalosporins are esters of parenteral forms and are hydrolysed by esterases in the digestive tract (Cefteram-pivoxil). Some of the third generation drugs can be absorbed orally without the need of esterification. This is for example done with Cefixime and Cefdinir by putting a vinyl group in the C-3 position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceftibuten</b> {{is active}} against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. providence, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Streptococcus sp.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceftibuten</b> is {{a third-generation}} {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic. It is an orally administered agent, with two dosage forms, capsule or oral suspension. It is marketed by Pernix Therapeutics under the trade name Cedax.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceftibuten</b> is used {{to treat}} acute {{bacterial}} exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis. It is also indicated for pneumonia, infections of the urinary tract, enteritis, and gastroenteritis.|$|E
50|$|During {{the course}} of {{antibiotic}} treatment, serial {{white blood cell count}} and temperature are closely monitored. Typically, the intravenous antibiotics are continued until the patient is afebrile for at least 24 to 48 hours, then equivalent oral antibiotic agents can be given for a total of 2 - week duration of treatment. Intravenous fluids may be administered to compensate for the reduced oral intake, insensible losses (due to the raised temperature) and vasodilation and to optimize urine output. Percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement may be indicated to relieve obstruction caused by a stone. Children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, <b>ceftibuten</b> and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy. If intravenous therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective.|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity and}} spectrum of <b>ceftibuten</b> (7432 -S; SCH 39720) was determined {{on a wide}} variety of bacterial species selected for resistance to oral and parenteral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. <b>Ceftibuten</b> was found to be the most active beta-lactam tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 81. 6 % of strains at less than or equal to 8. 0 micrograms/ml compared with 75. 0 and 54. 8 % of strains inhibited by cefixime and cefuroxime, respectively. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae (MIC for 90 % of strains [MIC 90], less than or equal to 0. 06 microgram/ml), Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC 90, 3. 0 micrograms/ml), and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC 90, less than or equal to 0. 06 and 0. 019 microgram/ml) were susceptible to <b>ceftibuten.</b> Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, and G) were also inhibited by <b>ceftibuten,</b> but penicillin-resistant pneumococci were generally resistant to cefixime and <b>ceftibuten.</b> The activity and spectrum of <b>ceftibuten</b> seem most applicable to infections of the respiratory and urinary tract plus those infections caused by pathogenic Neisseria spp. <b>Ceftibuten</b> disks (30 micrograms) were evaluated and found to have an acceptable correlation (r = 0. 88) with <b>ceftibuten</b> MICs. Preliminary zone size interpretive criteria for MIC breakpoints of less than or equal to 4. 0 and less than or equal to 8. 0 micrograms/ml were calculated...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>ceftibuten,</b> an extended-spectrum oral cephalosporin, into middle ear fluid (MEF) was evaluated in pediatric patients during {{a course of}} daily oral doses of 9 mg/kg of body weight for 10 days. Plasma and MEF collected at 2, 4, 6, or 12 h after at least 3 days of dosing were analyzed for <b>ceftibuten</b> by a high-pressure liquid chromatography method, and the data were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma and MEF had almost identical maximum concentrations (Cmax) of <b>ceftibuten</b> (14 micrograms/ml). These Cmax values in MEF during acute otitis media were well {{in excess of the}} MIC for 90 % of the isolates of each of four major pathogens in this disease. The time to Cmax was longer in MEF (4 h) than in plasma (2 h). Excellent penetration (71 %) of <b>ceftibuten</b> into MEF was observed {{on the basis of the}} area under the curve ratio (MEF/plasma). These data clearly indicate that <b>ceftibuten</b> penetrated well into the MEF to yield clinically effective concentrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe carrier protein(s) {{responsible}} for the transport of <b>ceftibuten,</b> a peptide-like dianionic cefem, in rat renal brush-border membrane were solubilized and purified by a ceftibuten-ligand specific affinity chromatography technique. The proteoliposomes reconstituted from the solubilized brush-border membrane proteins by dialysis had H+-sensitive uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> and trans-stimulative effect by cephalexin. A specific uptake activity for <b>ceftibuten</b> {{was found in the}} 3. 5 M-eluted fraction but not the flowthrough and the 0. 5 M-eluted fraction of the affinity chromatography. Analyzing this active fraction by SDS/PAGE after reconstituting into liposomes gave two major proteins (approx. molecular masses of 130 and 107 kDa). The purification protocol presented in this study permitted an efficient isolation of the carrier proteins {{responsible for}} the transport of <b>ceftibuten</b> and other peptide-like compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and dose proportionality of <b>ceftibuten</b> {{were evaluated}} in healthy male volunteers receiving single oral doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg of <b>ceftibuten.</b> The drug was absorbed with similar {{times to the}} maximum concentration of drug in plasma for all three doses. Concentrations of <b>ceftibuten</b> in plasma increased with increasing dose. Analysis of variance was carried out on the dose-adjusted values for the maximum concentration of drug in plasma and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve; {{the results indicated that}} the concentrations in plasma after the 200 - and 400 -mg doses were dose proportional, and after the 800 -mg of dose they were less than dose proportional. The elimination half-life from plasma ranged from 2. 0 to 2. 3 h and was independent of dose. The total excretion of unchanged <b>ceftibuten</b> in urine accounted for 53 to 68 % of the dose, and the renal clearance was estimated to be 53 to 61 ml/min after all doses. The amount of ceftibuten-trans, the major in vitro and in vivo conversion product of <b>ceftibuten,</b> was low in both plasma and urine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} {{activity of}} <b>ceftibuten,</b> a dianionic peptide-like compound, was extracted from rat intestinal brush-border membrane by n-octylglucoside and reconstituted into asolectin liposomes by dialysis. The proteoliposomes prepared from the membrane extract showed an inward H+-gradient-dependent uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> and glycylsarcosine. Ceftibuten-immobilized affinity chromatography of the membrane extract permitted {{the isolation of}} two polypeptides (apparent molecular mass of 117 and 127 kDa) that can recognize the dianionic peptide structure of <b>ceftibuten.</b> Proteoliposomes prepared from reconstituting the isolated proteins into asolectin vesicles showed an overshooting uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> {{in the presence of}} an inwardly directed H+ gradient, and this uptake could be inhibited by l-valyl-l-proline. N-glycanase digestion of the isolated proteins, 117 and 127 kDa, trimmed them into 78 and 120 kDa products, respectively. The protein core size of the smaller protein was in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of ∼ 79 kDa for the rat PepT 1 transporter obtained by other investigators...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of the cephalosporin <b>ceftibuten</b> {{were determined}} after {{the fifth and}} final dose of 200 mg given every 12 h. Concentrations in plasma and cantharidin-induced inflammatory fluid were determined by a microbiological assay. Samples for three volunteers were assayed by a high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure to determine levels for both cis and trans <b>ceftibuten.</b> The mean peak level of <b>ceftibuten</b> in serum was 10. 9 micrograms/ml at a mean time of 1. 8 h after administration, and the mean elimination half-life from plasma was 2. 5 h. Penetration into the inflammatory fluid was good, the mean peak level being 9. 2 micrograms/ml at a mean time of 3. 7 h. The mean percent penetration into the inflammatory fluid was 113. 4 %. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the mean peak level of the trans isomer was 5. 7 % that of the cis isomer. This study suggests that twice-daily doses of <b>ceftibuten</b> should be sufficient to treat urinary or systemic infections caused by susceptible pathogens...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundUrinary tract {{infections are}} a {{leading cause of}} medical {{consultations}} in Mexico and the growth of antimicrobial resistance results in increased morbidity and rising costs. AimTo make an economic evaluation of <b>ceftibuten</b> as treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adults, {{from the perspective of the}} Mexican private health system. MethodsA cohort-based decision-making model was developed to compare <b>ceftibuten</b> with TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, and cefalexin. Effectiveness was measured using local susceptibility rates of Escherichia coli. Costs were obtained from official market value data and converted to 2014 USD values. Incremental analysis was employed to determine if <b>ceftibuten</b> was a worthwhile investment on the part of the private health system in Mexico. ResultsThe total expected cost per patient for ciprofloxacin was $ 116 USD and the corresponding costs for TMP/SMX and cefalexin were $ 92. 40 USD and $ 74. 80 USD, respectively. <b>Ceftibuten</b> had a lower expected cost ($ 34. 50 USD) and a higher percentage of therapeutic success (99. 4 %), compared with ciprofloxacin 21 %, cefalexin 41 %, and TMP/SMX 31. 7 %. ConclusionsEven though <b>ceftibuten</b> has a higher market price than other antimicrobials in Mexico, it can represent possible savings by avoiding the costs associated with undesirable results due to antimicrobial resistance to E. coli...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug-resistant {{typhoid fever}} (MDRTF) is an {{important}} problem {{in many developing countries}} and is an emerging problem in the developed world. The existence of MDRTF poses a serious clinical dilemma specifically in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. This paper examines the in vitro susceptibility of drug-resistant and "sensitive " Salmonella typhi isolates from Metro Manila, Philippines using the disc diffusion method (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) against a new third generation oral cephalosporin, <b>ceftibuten</b> (Cedax). The antimicrobial susceptibility discs used in this investigation were ampicillin (I 0 micrograms), chloramphenicol (30 micrograms), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1. 2 S/ 23. 75 micrograms), tetracycline (30 micrograms), and <b>ceftibuten</b> (30 micrograms). 168 "sensitive and 78 MDR clinical isolates of S. typhi were analyzed. 98. 8 % of the “sensitive" isoates and 96. 2 % of the MDR isolates were sensitive to <b>ceftibuten</b> whereas 1. 2 % of the " were “sensitive ” isolates and 3. 8 % of the MDR isolates were moderately sensitive. There were no isolates resistant to <b>ceftibuten</b> for both groups. Overall, <b>ceftibuten</b> showed very good in vitro activity against MDRTF isolates from Manila. It is recommended that quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility tests (i. e. minimum inhibitory concentration) be performed on MDR as well as the “sensitive ” isolates to confirm their disc diffusion results.

40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activity of}} <b>ceftibuten</b> was compared with cefuroxime and cefadroxil against 475 clinically-significant, epidemiologically-distinct isolates of Gram-nega-tive bacilli: 170 from blood, 212 from urine and 93 from a supplementary collection of multiply-resistant strains {{known to have}} resistance plasmids, to have caused sporadic or epidemic nosocomial infection, or both. <b>Ceftibuten</b> MICs ranged from 0 - 003 to> 32 mg/l, with a modal MIC of 0 - 01 mg/ 1 : 95 % of all isolates had <b>ceftibuten</b> MIC values of ^ 8 mg/ 1, the sensitivity breakpoint suggested by the manufacturer. Ninety per cent of isolates had MICs of 8 mg/ 1 (16, 16 and> 32 mg/ 1 respectively). Resistance (MIC> 16 mg/ 1) was more frequent among Enterobacter and Acinetobacter spp. Thirteen of 52 Entero-bacter spp., and seven of 18 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus had MICs of at least 32 mg/ 1. MIC ranges, modal MICs and MIC 90 s indicated that <b>ceftibuten</b> was, {{with the exception of}} only two strains, consistently more active in-vitro than cefuroxime, which was in turn more active than cefadroxil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe LLC-PK 1 cells stably {{transfected}} with a rat PEPT 1 cDNA transported <b>ceftibuten</b> (anion) and cephradine (zwitterion), both oral β-lactam antibiotics, in a H+-gradient-dependent manner. Diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine residue modifier, abolished <b>ceftibuten</b> uptake. This inhibition was prevented in {{the presence}} of glycylsarcosine or cephradine. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, replacement of either histidine 57 or histidine 121 of the rat PEPT 1 with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis eliminated <b>ceftibuten</b> and [14 C]glycylsarcosine transport activities. Immunostaining of oocyte sections indicated that insertion of the mutant transporters in the plasma membranes was not impaired. These findings suggest that both histidine 57 and histidine 121, which are conserved in the rat, rabbit and human PEPT 1, are involved in substrate recognition of this molecule...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the transport {{characteristics of the}} H 1 /dipeptide carrier that recognizes the orally active b-lactam antibiotic cef-tibuten, the uptake behaviors were compared of <b>ceftibuten</b> and Gly-Sar by rat intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles. The results show that 1) both the uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> and that of Gly-Sar were dependent on an inwardly directed H 1 gradient; 2) anionic compounds such as hippurylphenyllactic acid com-petitively inhibited <b>ceftibuten</b> uptake {{in the presence of}} H 1 gradient, whereas this anion did not inhibit Gly-Sar uptake; and 3) the carrier-mediated uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> did not disappear even in the presence of 20 mM Gly-Sar. The results provide an evidence that several transporters with different features are potentially responsible for the uptake of b-lactam antibiotics into the intestinal cells. It is suggested that the dianionic b-lac-tam antibiotics that carry a net negative charge such as ceftib-uten use multiple H 1 -dependent transport systems for absorp-tion. The excellent oral availability of certain b-lactam antibiot-ics is {{explained by the fact that}} they serve as substrates for intestinal oligopeptide transporter or transporters (Okano et al., 1986; Tsuji et al., 1986; Naasani et al., 1995).

40|$|Summary: Acute {{sinusitis}} is {{a common}} childhood illness. If it is overlooked or undertreated, suppurative and intracranial complications may develop. Amoxicillin has traditionally been the antibiotic of choice for treatment of acute sinusitis. However, the efficacy of amoxicillin has been reduced because {{of the emergence of}} bacteria producing b-lactamase and altered penicillin-binding proteins. This study compares the effectiveness of 10, 15, and 20 days of <b>ceftibuten</b> therapy with 14 days of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole therapy in treating acute sinusitis. The results indicate that both treatment regimens are effective in treating acute sinusitis (96 % clinical response for erythromycin-sulfisoxazole vs 92 % for a 10 - or 15 -day course of <b>ceftibuten</b> vs 100 % for a 20 -day course of <b>ceftibuten).</b> Longer treatment periods may be more effective in resolving the acute illness.

40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections {{have been}} empirically treated in Hong Kong {{with a single}} oral 400 -mg dose of <b>ceftibuten</b> since 1997. Following anecdotal reports of the {{treatment}} failure of gonorrhea with oral extended-spectrum cephalosporins, {{the current study was}} undertaken to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and molecular characteristics of isolates of N. gonorrhoeae among patients with putative treatment failure in a sexually transmitted disease clinic setting. Between October 2006 and August 2007, 44 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were studied from patients identified clinically to have treatment failure with empirical <b>ceftibuten.</b> The <b>ceftibuten</b> MICs for three strains were found to have been 8 mg/liter. These strains were determined by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing to belong to sequence type 835 (ST 835) or the closely related ST 2469. The testing of an additional eight archived ST 835 strains revealed similarly elevated <b>ceftibuten</b> MICs. The penA gene sequences of these 11 isolates all had the mosaic pattern previously described as pattern X. Of note is that the ceftriaxone susceptibility results of these strains all fell within the susceptible range. It is concluded that <b>ceftibuten</b> resistance may contribute to the empirical treatment failure of gonorrhea caused by strains harboring the mosaic penA gene, which confers reduced susceptibility to oral extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Screening for such resistance in the routine clinical laboratory may be undertaken by the disk diffusion test. The continued monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and molecular characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae isolates is important to ensure that control and prevention strategies remain effective...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} {{characteristics of}} <b>ceftibuten,</b> a dianionic cephem antibiotic, in rat renal and intestinal brush-border membranes were compared. <b>Ceftibuten</b> transport was mediated by two transport {{systems in the}} renal brush-border membrane and by one transport system in the intestinal brush-border membrane. The apparent kinetic parameters for the uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> by the renal brush-border membrane vesicles, respectively, were: Km 1, Km 2, values of 26 and 1946 μM and Vmax 1, Vmax 2 values of 105 and 1400 pmol/mg protein per 30 s. The apparent kinetic parameters for the uptake by the intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles were: Km of 425 μM and Vmax of 1701 pmol/mg protein per 30 s. In the renal brush-border membrane, l-Ala-l-Pro was partially competitive and competitive inhibitor for the uptake by {{the high and low}} affinity systems, respectively. However, l-Ala-l-Pro was a non-competitive inhibitor for the uptake by the intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles. l-Carnosine was a specific and competitive inhibitor for the high affinity system in the renal brush-border membrane, while it had no effect on the low affinity system of the kidney or on the transport system of the intestine. It was concluded that the transport characteristics of <b>ceftibuten</b> in the renal and intestinal brush-border membranes are similar in some aspects but they are not identical...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>ceftibuten,</b> a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and its conversion product, ceftibutentrans, {{were studied}} in healthy male volunteers following daily oral administration of a 400 -mg capsule for 7 days. Mean concentrations of <b>ceftibuten</b> in plasma obtained on day 5 {{were similar to}} those obtained on day 7. Analysis of variance indicated that the concentrations in plasma on days 5 and 7 were at steady state. The mean accumulation factor was 1. 14 for day 5 and 1. 13 for day 7. The half-life (2. 4 h) was independent of the duration of drug administration, and the mean maximum concentration of drug in plasma was 18 to 19 micrograms/ml. Urinary excretion was the major elimination route for <b>ceftibuten,</b> by which 57 to 59 % of the drug was excreted unchanged over a 24 -h period.

40|$|AbstractNateglinide, a novel oral hypoglycemic agent, {{possesses}} a carbonyl group and a peptide-type bond in its structure. We previously reported that nateglinide transport occurs via a single system {{that may be}} identical to the ceftibuten/H+ cotransport system by the rat small intestine. We speculated that the absorption system present on the intestinal epithelium may be similar to that found on the renal tubular epithelium. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the transporters on the apical side of the kidney that may contribute to the reabsorption of <b>ceftibuten</b> and nateglinide. The uptake of nateglinide by rat renal brush-border membranes is associated with an H+-coupled transport system. <b>Ceftibuten</b> competitively inhibited H+-dependent nateglinide uptake. In contrast, Gly-Sar, cephradine and cephalexin had no effect on nateglinide uptake. Nateglinide competitively inhibited H+-driven transporter-mediated <b>ceftibuten</b> uptake. We conclude that nateglinide transport occurs via a single system that is H+-dependent and may be identical to the ceftibuten/H+ cotransport system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOptimal {{procedures}} for the reconstitution of the transport activity of <b>ceftibuten,</b> a dianionic ß-lactam antibiotic, from rat kidney brush-border membrane were developed. The uptake activity into reconstituted proteoliposomes appeared to be particularly sensitive to the extraction conditions, and to the lipid composition used for reconstitution. Changes in the concentration of octyl glucoside significantly affected the extraction of <b>ceftibuten</b> transport activity, and optimal extraction was achieved at a concentration of 60 mM. Optimal reconstitution was achieved using a lipid composition of asolectin, cholesterol and phosphatidylserine in a w/w percent ratio of 60 : 30 : 10, respectively, and with a lipid-to-protein ratio of 10. The uptake of <b>ceftibuten</b> into the resulting proteoliposomes showed temperature and pH dependency, was inhibitable by a range of cephem antibiotics, oligopeptides and the organic anion PAH, and was trans-stimulated by cephalexin and dipeptides. This reconstitution system will likely prove useful in future studies on the functional analysis of the peptide transport system in a purified form...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the interaction of anionic cephalosporins (cefixime, <b>ceftibuten,</b> and cefdinir) with the renal peptide transporter (PEPT 2) and the intestinal peptide transporter (PEPT 1) using four different experimental model systems. In the first approach, the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco- 2 which expresses PEPT 1 and the SHR rat kidney cell line SKPT which expresses PEPT 2 were used. The uptake of the dipeptide Gly-Sar mediated by PEPT 1 or PEPT 2 in these cells was inhibited significantly by the anionic cephalosporins, with the following order of potency: ceftibuten>cefixime>cefdinir. The inhibition was competitive in nature. Even though the order of potency was the same for PEPT 1 and PEPT 2, PEPT 1 exhibited much lesser sensitivity to inhibition than PEPT 2. In the second approach, the cloned human PEPT 1 and PEPT 2 were functionally expressed in HeLa cells following which the cells were used to study the interaction of anionic cephalosporins with PEPT 1 and PEPT 2. Again, Gly-Sar uptake mediated by the human PEPT 1 and PEPT 2 in HeLa cells {{was found to be}} inhibited by the anionic cephalosporins with the same order potency as in Caco- 2 and SKPT cells. In the third approach, brush border membrane vesicles isolated from rat kidneys were employed. In this approach also it was found that PEPT 2 -mediated Gly-Sar uptake was inhibited by cefixime and <b>ceftibuten.</b> In the fourth approach, the human PEPT 1 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and PEPT 1 -mediated transport of <b>ceftibuten</b> was investigated directly by electrophysiological methods. <b>Ceftibuten</b> evoked inward currents in PEPT 1 -expressing oocytes but not in water-injected oocytes, showing that the transport of the anionic cephalosporin via PEPT 1 is associated with transfer of positive charge. The ceftibuten-evoked currents were saturable with respect to <b>ceftibuten</b> concentration and were markedly dependent on membrane potential. It is concluded that anionic cephalosporins interact with the peptide transporters expressed in the intestine (PEPT 1) {{as well as in the}} kidney (PEPT 2) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that oral antibiotic treatment {{in children with}} acute pyelonephritis and scintigraphy-documented lesions is equally as efficacious as sequential intravenous/oral therapy {{with respect to the}} incidence of renal scarring. A randomised multi-centre trial was conducted in 365 children aged 6 months to 16 years with bacterial growth in cultures from urine collected by catheter. The children were assigned to receive either oral <b>ceftibuten</b> (9 mg/kg once daily) for 14 days or intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 3 days followed by oral <b>ceftibuten</b> for 11 days. Only patients with lesions detected on acute-phase dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy underwent follow-up scintigraphy. Efficacy was evaluated by the rate of renal scarring after 6 months on follow-up scintigraphy. Of 219 children with lesions on acute-phase scintigraphy, 152 completed the study; 80 (72 females, median age 2. 2 years) were given <b>ceftibuten</b> and 72 (62 females, median age 1. 6 years) were given ceftriaxone/ceftibuten. Patients in the intravenous/oral group had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at baseline and larger lesion(s) on acute-phase scintigraphy. Follow-up scintigraphy showed renal scarring in 21 / 80 children treated with <b>ceftibuten</b> and 33 / 72 with ceftriaxone/ceftibuten (p = 0. 01). However, after adjustment for the confounding variables (CRP and size of acute-phase lesion), no significant difference was observed for renal scarring between the two groups (p = 0. 2). Renal scarring correlated with the extent of the acute-phase lesion (r = 0. 60, p < 0. 0001) and the grade of vesico-ureteric reflux (r = 0. 31, p = 0. 03), and was more frequent in refluxing renal units (p = 0. 04). The majority of patients, i. e. 44 in the oral group and 47 in the intravenous/oral group, were managed as out-patients. Side effects were not observed. From this study, we can conclude that once-daily oral <b>ceftibuten</b> for 14 days yielded comparable results to sequential ceftriaxone/ceftibuten treatment in children aged 6 months to 16 years with DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis and it allowed out-patient management in the majority of these children...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} interpretive criteria for agar diffusion tests with <b>Ceftibuten</b> disks according to DIN standards. MethodsMinimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and inhibition zones produced by <b>Ceftibuten</b> in the disk diffusion test were determined for 275 recent bacterial isolates, including 11 species with 25 strains each. Regression {{analysis was performed}} for two disk loads (10 μg and 30 μg). ResultsCorrelation of MICs and zone diameters was good, with correlation coefficients of r = − 0. 97 for both tested disk loads. Evaluation of the calculated zone size criteria for all species showed no very major discrepancies or no major discrepancies. The 30 -μg disks, however, produced unacceptably large inhibition zones for very susceptible strains, so that usage of 10 -μg disks must be recommended when testing according to DIN standards. ConclusionBased on the MIC breakpoints recommended by the DIN (≥ 8 mg/L and ≤ 1 mg/L), the following interpretive breakpoints for disk diffusion susceptibility tests with 10 -μg <b>Ceftibuten</b> disks were calculated using regression line analysis: ≤ 19 mm for resistance and ≥ 27 mm for susceptiblity. Proposed inhibition zone diameters for the reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 are between 31 and 36 mm...|$|E
40|$|The {{duration}} {{of time that}} serum drug levels remain above the MIC (time above the MIC) for the pathogen {{has been shown to}} be the most significant parameter determining the efficacies of beta-lactam antibiotics. In the described study, we investigated the optimal time above the MIC of <b>ceftibuten</b> and cefaclor using a nonneutropenic mouse model of intra-abdominal infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The abilities of the drugs to protect mice against the organisms were determined in mouse protection tests, and the doses were fractionated to produce various dosing regimens with different times above the MIC. All drug-organism combinations showed a significant correlation (r > 0. 9) between drug efficacy and the time above the MIC. Also, with <b>ceftibuten</b> treatment, the different dosing regimens that produced equal times above the MIC resulted in the same efficacy, whereas with cefaclor, an apparent dose-dependent effect was observed. These results showed that for a 100 % recovery from K. pneumoniae and E. coli infections, the optimal times above the MIC with <b>ceftibuten</b> treatment were 2. 2 and 1. 6 h, respectively. Relatively high doses of both antibiotics were required to ensure recovery from S. pneumoniae infections. In vitro time-kill studies demonstrated that cefaclor exhibits a marked inoculum effect against the pathogens, and there was a concentration-dependent killing at a large inoculum size. On the other hand, <b>ceftibuten</b> showed no inoculum effect. It is suggested that optimization of both dose and time above the MIC appears to be necessary for the treatment of S. aureus infections with cefaclor, and this may apply to other beta-lactams tht exhibit marked inoculum effects...|$|E

The development and adoption of oral III generation cephalosporins into clinical practice significantly widened the possibilities of treatment of inflammatoryinfectious diseases, including tonsillopharyngitis. One of the III generation cephalosporins is <b>Ceftibuten</b> (Cedax) — a drug with b-lactam properties, which inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis. It has relatively long post-antibiotic effect, characterized by high activity in point of majority of enterobacteria, and is very stable to destructive action of -lactamases. It also can be accumulated in tissues, providing high concentration of active substance in inflammation nidus. The therapeutic dose of the drug for adults is 400 mg/day. <b>Ceftibuten</b> is recommended and effectively used in pediatric practice in treatment of tonsillopharyngitis and otitis. </em...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{the older}} and more recent oral cephalosporins are reviewed. With the exception of cefadroxil the older agents (cephalexin, cephradine and cefaclor) have serum elimination half-lives of 80 % of oral dose) {{with the exception of}} cefaclor (54 %). Cefaclor is also chemically unstable. The newer agents can be divided into those that are prodrugs (cefpodoxime proxetil and cefuroxime axetil) and compounds that are absorbed as such (cefixime, cefprozil and <b>ceftibuten).</b> They all have half-lives> 1 - 25 h and can be given once or twice daily. The penetration of these agents into an inflammatory exudate was studied and found to be cefixime 132 %, <b>ceftibuten</b> 113 %, cefpodoxime 104 %, cefuroxime 92 % and cefprozil 79 % of the serum concentration. The penetration of cefpodoxime and cefixime into the respiratory tract was also studied; the mean percentage bronchial mucosal penetration was 52 % for the former and 38 % for cefixime. The urinary recovery of these newer agents (with the exception of <b>ceftibuten)</b> tends to be less than that of the earlier agents. There was a relationship between the serum elirrnhatioh half-ETe of these agents and the degree of tissue penetration, those agents with longer half-lives penetrating to a greater extent...|$|E
40|$|Although group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS) {{has been}} considered to be uniformly susceptible to β-lactams, the presence of GBS with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) was recently confirmed genetically. We developed a feasible and reliable method for screening PRGBS in clinical microbiology laboratories {{using a combination of}} <b>ceftibuten,</b> oxacillin, and ceftizoxime disks...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activities of}} cefixime, cefpodoxime, and <b>ceftibuten</b> were determined with 18 ampicillin-susceptible (Amps), 13 ampicillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing (AmprBLP), and 7 ampicillin-resistant non-beta-lactamase-producing (AmprNBLP) strains of Haemophilus influenzae. An effect of inoculum density on apparent MIC, the bactericidal activity of these agents, and {{the targets of}} the three cephems were determined. The MICs of cefixime, cefpodoxime, and <b>ceftibuten</b> for 90 % of the Amps and AmprBLP isolates were 0. 04, 0. 08, and 0. 08 microgram/ml, respectively. In contrast, the MICs for 90 % of the AmprNBLP strains were 0. 96, 1. 92, and 7. 68 micrograms/ml. No significant inoculum effect was observed for any group of strains comparing inocula of 10 (3) and 10 (5) CFU, whereas only the AmprNBLP isolates showed a marked effect at an inoculum of 10 (6) CFU. Although bactericidal levels were achieved for the Amps and AmprBLP strains, tolerance to cefixime and <b>ceftibuten</b> was observed. The bactericidal activity for the AmprNBLP strains was limited, with cefixime showing the highest activity of the three cephems. Penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 5 revealed high affinity, with 50 % inhibitory concentration levels below the MIC for all three cephems, suggesting that these are important targets of these agents in H. influenzae. We conclude that the cephems are highly active in vitro against Amps and AmprBLP strains of H. influenzae, but less so against AmprNBLP isolates...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{growing number}} of macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes {{represents}} an increasing worldwide problem. Macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes is mediated by several different genes, which determine different levels of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLS). Methods: This study compared the in vitro antimicrobial activity of azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, <b>ceftibuten,</b> cefaclor, and telithromycin against 287 strains of S. pyogenes by the broth microdilution method. All strains were characterized both phenotypically and genotypically for erythromycin resistance {{and most of them}} have been M-typed by means of PCR. Results: <b>Ceftibuten</b> and cefaclor showed the best antimicrobial activity, while MIC values for telithromycin were higher against constitutively MLS (cMLS) -resistant strains rather than against the other phenotypes. Conclusion: Oral cephalosporins retain the best activity against S. pyogenes; showing good activity except for cMLS-resistant strains, telithromycin is a valid alternative to these antimicrobials...|$|E
