5000|$|Brock Lesnar and John Cena {{would not}} have another match until Lesnar's {{unexpected}} WWE return in 2012 on the episode of Raw the day after John Cena lost to The Rock at WrestleMania. Lesnar would start a feud with Cena culminating in an Extreme Rules match at its eponymous pay-per-view Extreme Rules. By this point, it was likely {{that no one had}} remembered Cena's previous feud with Lesnar, as the WWE had seen multiple other matches between Lesnar and Cena in a time when Lesnar had been more dominant and more brutally aggressive than in his previous WWE run. Upon his return to the WWE, Lesnar had realigned himself with Paul Heyman and had established his character as [...] "The Beast Incarnate" [...] rather than the [...] "Next Big Thing." [...] In 2014, Cena and Lesnar had a rematch, this time for Cena's WWE World Heavyweight Championship, a unification of the WWE and World Heavyweight championships at WWE's Tables, Ladders, & Chairs pay-per-view in 2013. Lesnar had obliterated Cena with 16 German Suplexes, 2 F-5s, and a pinfall to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. He would retain his championship against Cena after a disqualification loss at the Night of Champions pay-per-view the next month and was not scheduled to reappear on television until January 2015, the month in which he successfully defended the title in a triple threat match between Cena and Seth Rollins at that month's Royal Rumble show. He would eventually lose the title to Rollins, who used his title <b>contract</b> <b>opportunity</b> at WrestleMania, challenging Lesnar to a match right then and there. Nonetheless, Lesnar has been once again {{on the road to the}} WWE Championship, occasionally having run-ins with John Cena.|$|E

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) plan to increase federal <b>contracting</b> <b>opportunities</b> for small business is aimed at eliminating unnecessary contract bundling and mitigating the effects of necessary contract bundling. Specifically it calls {{for a series of}} actions to (1) hold federal agency managers accountable for improving small business <b>contracting</b> <b>opportunities,</b> (2) strengthen the Federal Acquisition Regulation and Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations governing contract bundling, and (3) use SBA and agency small business resources to improve oversight and mitigate the effects of bundling. This testimony focuses on two implementation concerns: (1) the measures and information that will be used to monitor agencies' progress in eliminating unnecessary contract bundling and mitigating the effects of necessary bundling and (2) the ability of SBA's Procurement Center Representatives and agencies' Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization offices to meet the added responsibilities laid out in the plan. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} {{standard}} principal-agent {{results are not}} robust {{to the introduction of}} additional <b>contracting</b> <b>opportunities</b> for the agent.

In some settings, the agent unwinds part of those incentives through additional trades. These findings may call for a revision of some previous theoretical and applied conclusions. ...|$|R

40|$|We study {{capital markets}} subject to moral hazard when investors cannot prevent side trading, thereby facing an {{externality}} if firms raise funds from multiple sources. We analyze whether investors’ ability to design financial covenants that may include exclusivity clauses mitigates this externality. Following covenant violations, investors can accelerate the repayment of their loan, adjust its size, or increase interest rates. Enlarging <b>contracting</b> <b>opportunities</b> generates a severe market failure: with covenants, equilibria are indeterminate and Pareto ranked.

40|$|An informational {{alliance}} {{involves the}} consolidation of the private information of independent suppliers {{in anticipation of a}} <b>contracting</b> <b>opportunity</b> with a principal. An informational alliance is an intermediate form of organization between {{the consolidation of}} information as in a merger and the suppliers remaining separate entities.

An informational alliance forms at the nexus of internally-verifiable private information.
