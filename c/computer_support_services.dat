40|$|When an {{influential}} farmer who sells computers to his neighbours publicly describes {{the internet as}} 2 ̆ 7 the biggest pain 2 ̆ 7 for farmers and rural computer retailers, then it indicates that all is not well with the local rural internet service. The expanding {{use of the internet}} is exposing weaknesses in the rural telephone system, limitations in rural <b>computer</b> <b>support</b> <b>services</b> and a need {{for a wide range of}} training. This paper identifies the access and support problems experienced by a selection of early internet adopters in rural southern Queensland. Surveys and discussions were conducted with over 200 people who attended internet training events at Dalby and Applethorpe in southern Queensland in 1997. They perceived internet access to be costly and an often difficult and complex process. Existing ISPs and local <b>computer</b> <b>support</b> <b>services</b> had limited capabilities to cope with the complexity of factors needed to get local internet access to work consistently for different customers. Despite the promises of the internet, accessing it can be a major frustration for farmers and their computer suppliers. Better training and support services will be needed to expand rural internet use. The economic viability of rural internet services may be questionable unless the complex of social and technical constraints that early internet users are facing is not resolved...|$|E

40|$|In future {{ubiquitous}} computing environments, {{our daily lives}} will be influenced {{by a lot of}} <b>computer</b> <b>supported</b> <b>services</b> all over the place.

We propose an input-event framework that provides high-level abstraction for heterogeneous input devices, that we call MetaInputs, for distributed multi-modal applications. Our framework provides semantic and standard interfaces between input devices and services. It enables developers to deploy input devices and services independently.

For example, database server always listens on a designated port for structured query and responses them from the information it contains within. Since communication plays a major role, most of these intelligent techniques range from hardware level design to minimize overhead or latency in communication to software level optimization that reduces communication cost.

This study examines who {{is more or less}} likely to use a computer at a location other than work or home by using the 2002 – 2004 General Social Survey data and logistic regression analysis. Demographic variables (such as age, race, marital status, and region), socioeconomic status (such as education and family income), self employment, and satisfaction with financial situation are significant predictors of computer use at locations other than home or work; but occupation and gender make no difference. The findings will help institutions to provide <b>computer</b> infrastructure <b>support</b> and <b>services</b> for customers in public places, and especially help schools and libraries to improve computer labs and services. 過去在探討非居家或上班電腦使用地點的研究微之又微。本文針對 2002 - 2004 年總體社會調查資料進行對數回歸分析，分析更可能或不可能在家外或工作外使用電腦的族群。研究結果顯示，人口變量如年齡、種族、婚姻狀況、地區，社經地位（教育程度、家庭收入），是否自謀職業，是否對財政狀況滿意等，為解釋是否在家外或工作外使用電腦的有效自變量，然而職業和性別的影響則不顯著。本研究結果對於社會機構在公共場所提供計算機基礎設施和服務，以及對學校和圖書館改善電腦使用室及服務具有參考價值。 頁次： 116 - 13...|$|R

It addresses technological challenges by linking PET Centres and developing <b>supporting</b> <b>services</b> that permit remote consultation between professionals in the field. The technological platform (CE-marked) runs on WIN 2000 /NT/XP systems and incorporates advanced techniques for image visualization, analysis and fusion, as well as for interactive communication and message handling for off-line communications. Four PET Centres from Spain, France and Germany participate to the pilot system trials. The performance evaluation of the system is carried out via log files and userfilled questionnaires on the frequency of the teleconsultations, their duration and efficancy, quality of the images received, user satisfaction. as well as on privacy, ethical and security issues. TENPET promotes the co-opertation and improved communication between PET practitioners that are miles away from their peers or on mobile units, offering options for second opinion and training and permitting physicians to remotely consult paptient data if they are away from their centre. It is expected that TENPET will have a significant impact in the development of new skills by PET professionals and will support the establishment of peripheral PET units. To our knowledge, TENPET is the first telemedicine service specifically designed for oncological PET.
