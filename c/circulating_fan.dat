50|$|Since {{failure of}} the <b>circulating</b> <b>fan</b> will have {{immediate}} and unhappy consequences for the heat exchanger or heating elements, detection of circulation fan failure is vital. This {{can be done in}} several ways. First, monitor the surface temperature of the heater, whether coil or element. If the airflow fails, this will rise suddenly, and the control system can execute an immediate shut-off. Second, install at least one and preferably two airflow sensors. Since the airflow may be at very high temperatures, this can be done with remotely mounted pressure switches that connect to the high and low pressure sides of the fan by means of stainless steel tubing long enough to put the switches well inside the cool area of the inside of the vessel. These switches should be wired in series on one side for the control circuit, such that either one opening will disrupt the heater power, and in parallel on the other side so that the computer can detect which one has changed state.|$|E

Historically natural sand {{has been used as}} fine aggregates for concrete production in Sweden. Due to environmental reasons the Swedish government is limiting the extraction of natural sand resources. Manufactured sand is therefore being investigated in Sweden as a replacement product. Properties of the fine aggregates such as shape and particle size distribution are affecting the qualities of both the uncured and finished concrete. It is possible to produce manufactured sand with a good shape; however the crushing process results in a relatively large amount of fines (particles smaller than 63 µm). Research shows that the amount of fines in manufactured sand affects concrete properties such as, workability, water demand, drying shrinkage, compressive and flexural strength. To achieve a good concrete the manufactured sand should have somewhere between 5 - 10 mass percent of fines depending on rock type. It is common that manufactured sand has around 15 - 25 mass percent of fines after the crushing stage. In this thesis, dry air classification has been investigated {{to reduce the amount of}} fines in manufactured sand. There exists a number of air classifiers produced for different industrial use. This work has investigated four different air classifiers using different design approaches. Two air classifiers using an internal aerodynamic cycle and two with an open aerodynamic cycle. Both of the air classifiers with internal aerodynamic cycle investigated in the performed research are based around a centrifugal-crossflow separation zone. The classification process are for both of these air classifiers controlled by two fans, the <b>circulating</b> <b>fan</b> and the separator fan. The <b>circulating</b> <b>fan</b> creates the internal circulating air flow. The air flow created by the separator fan changes the cut size. Experiments performed on the air classifiers showed that it was possible to reduce the amount of fines from 15 mass percent to 5 mass percent. The investigated air classifiers with an open aerodynamic cycle were a two-stage air classifier and a mobile air classifier. The first stage of the two-stage air classifier used the same design as the mobile air classifier and is designed around a gravitational-crossflow separation zone modified to allow for recirculation of particles towards the separation zone. The second stage is based around a vertical standing centrifugal-counterflow zone modified to allow for recirculation of material. Both air classifiers can produce a product with the desired amount of fines. The performed empirical measurements and CFD simulations showed that the recirculation is important for the classification process, reducing the influence of particle to particle interaction. In conclusion, air classification has been technically proven to be able to reduce the amount of fines in the finished product. The classification result will depend on the chosen technology...|$|E

The Swedish concrete industry is therefore examining manufactured sand as an alternative that has equal or better product quality, and which the Swedish quarry industry already {{has the ability to}} deliver. However, in order to comply with the specifi cations set by the concrete industry, a better means of classifi cation is needed, as the proportion of fi ne particles (fi ller) smaller than 63 - 125 μm in size must be reduced. One classifi cation technology that meets the requirements may be air classifi cation. This paper examines the process of circulating air classifi cation, which is not yet commonly used in the Swedish quarry industry; suggesting that {{a better understanding of the}} process is needed.

40|$|Early fan studies {{positioned}} fans as 'textual poachers' (Jenkins, 1992), {{suggesting that}} fans poach characters and materials from texts {{as an act}} of resistance towards commercial culture to form their own readings through fan cultural production such as fan fiction. As such, fans are often presented as a unified, communal group interacting within the context of fan communities that are considered alternative social communities with 'no established hierarchy' (Bacon-Smith, 1992, p. 41). However, Milly Williamson argued that fans do not all operate from a position of cultural marginality. Fans not only go on to collaborate with the media producers they allegedly poach from, they also "engage in elitist distinctions between themselves and other [...] . fans" (Williamson, 2005, p. 103). In this dissertation, I look at fan cultural production (specifically fan fiction) by appropriating Bourdieu's (1993) theory on the field of cultural production. I also suggest that the field of fan cultural production manifests the principles of a gift economy (Mauss, 1954). In <b>circulating</b> <b>fan</b> cultural production as gifts, fans are entering into a social relationship of reciprocity, where fan reputation, or fan symbolic capital, becomes tied to the gifts presented to the fan community and the social network of the fan author. The accumulation of fan social, fan cultural and fan symbolic capitals creates a subgroup of fans who are often treated like celebrities by their peers, and these fan subcultural celebrities often go on to determine the social and cultural norms of a fan community. This often results in conflict within fandom as fan status is frequently contested and challenged. By employing an ethnographic study on the fandoms of The X-Files, Angel and the re- imagined Battlestar Galactica, I argue that fan culture is not as homogenous as early fan studies proposed as the boundaries of community and fan celebrity status are frequently challenged.

40|$|Better growing {{conditions}} are achieved in greenhouses by maintaining a higher internal ambient {{as compared with}} external ambient temperature. A computer-based control and monitoring system which provides visualization, control and coordination of temperature and humidity in a greenhouse was recently developed. To validate the system performance, a number of experiments were carried out during the autumn of 2003. In this paper, one of the experimental results conducted from 10 to 12 a. m. on December 7, 2003, {{in the city of}} Karaj, is presented and discussed. The system was tested for two modes of operation: the uncontrolled mode of operation and the controlled mode. Four sensors, three for temperature measurements and one for relative humidity measurements, were installed inside and outside. During the first hour and a half the system was tested as a data-acquisition system, ie, only data from the sensors were recorded and monitored on the screen with no operation of fans, sprayer and other installed environmental systems in the greenhouse. For the last 20 min of the experiment, inside air temperature was controlled by the system. The result on temperature measurements shows that external ambient temperature, Tout, is always less than the inside temperature. This is attributed to the solar radiation entering the greenhouse through transparent plastic and being trapped there. We also observed fluctuations on temperature profile inside the greenhouse. This is caused by natural conditions such as surface evaporation within the greenhouse, solar radiation, external ambient temperature and rapid weather changes {{during the time of the}} experiment. It was also found that the rate of change of temperature increase in the upper part, Tup, ie near plastic cover, is higher than that of the plants height, Tmid. This rise in vertical temperature gradient is partly due to the different amount of solar incident radiation being received at the locations of sensors. This trend proves the effectiveness of our polytube system, a re- <b>circulating</b> <b>fan</b> with an attached perforated polyethylene tube, in guiding the air toward the plant root zone. For the last 20 min of the experiment, the controller was put into action. The overall per- formance of the system in maintaining the temperature within a given range, around the set point, is found to be satisfactory. The time constant of the fan and heater combination was short, about 10 min, in reaching the desired set point temperature...|$|E
