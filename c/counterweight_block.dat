There was a ruined "dam" (house), now gone, the stones re-used by the locals. Also, a leg from a lion statue was found in the village (Çamarası) and given to the museum about fifteen years ago. A marble vase was found and sold out. Latitude: 37. 39. 43. 92 Longitude: 28. 42. 15. 18 Elevation: 659 mDescription: Farmstead located near Çamarası, extending over the area of two modern fields. Set on a plateau next to and part of a modern olive grove. A number of architectural fragments revealed by plowing. First visited in 2005 when two <b>counterweight</b> <b>blocks,</b> a socket block and a marble pithos (F 019) were discovered.

Surface pottery indicates that habitation on this site continued for a long period. From the earlier period there are three Hellenistic molded bowl fragments, and a large amount of Lime Cookware; from later periods is a large amount of the Gritty Cookware.

The site occupies a promontory-like schist outcropping overlooking a seasonal streambed, in which water still flows as late as June. A modern seasonal settlement (yayla) is located just below the ancient site, together with two dilapidated modern farmhouses. ** This settlement was a small village, spread out over an area approximately 140 m by 30 m. At least eight unmortared schist walls survive from the ancient settlement. Only one room, approximately 5 m square, is clearly outlined by walls, but leveled areas along the promontory indicate the presence of the other structures. Part of an isolated wall projecting from the face of a gully along the east boundary of the promontory is 1. 30 m wide, with a preserved height of 1. 90 m and a visible length of 1. 80 m. There is also one threshold block, perhaps in situ (L: 1. 14 m, W: 0. 56 m, visible H: at least 0. 25 m, W raised portion: 0. 20 m). A rock-cut tomb is seen midway up the settlement (B 078). Five schist <b>counterweight</b> <b>blocks</b> were found at the site, one inside the only visible room; the other four are scattered across the promontory. ** The date of the pottery from Çatak Tepesi is generally Hellenistic to Early Imperial, but there are also a number of brown glazed Ottoman or early modern sherds, presumably associated with seasonal occupation of the kind still practiced today.

H: 0. 53 mDescription: The site is located {{on the south side of}} the valley between the modern villages of Gökçeler and Yeşilköy, in rugged terrain where two additional settlements were discovered (C 032, C 033) within 3 km of each other. The settlement overlooks the Koca Dere, a seasonal torrent bed that carries runoff from the ridge to the southeast. The large Roman aqueduct that runs from the far side of this ridge to Aphrodisias passes close by, although none of these settlement sites appears to have been inhabited during the second century and later when the aqueduct was in use. ** The settlement occupies a level hilltop of approximately 85 m by 45 m, and contains two large buildings each with multiple rooms. The walls of the buildings are constructed of unmortared schist likely quarried from outcroppings nearby. At least nine rooms survive in the larger building, with an average room size of 5. 0 m by 7. 0 m. The second building consists of at least six rooms of comparable size, and the topography of the site suggests this was the full extent of these buildings. The walls are preserved to a maximum height of 0. 50 m and are approximately 0. 70 m thick. No other structures are identifiable, and there has been extensive illegal excavation across the site. ** There is evidence for at least two olive oil presses at the site. Two schist <b>counterweight</b> <b>blocks</b> survive in the larger building. There is also a schist socket block just west of the smaller building. Next to it is a press bed, which is the only block at the site carved out of marble. ** The datable pottery from this site is limited to the Hellenistic and Early Imperial periods. The cookware is of special interest. It consists largely of earlier LCW and includes an unusually broad selection of storage vessel and bowl rims, some of which are unknown from contexts at the city or elsewhere in the region. The general indication from the ceramics is that the site was largely or entirely abandoned by the Early Imperial period. It is possible, however, that after being inhabited year-round in the Hellenistic period, it was used only during production season in later periods. Finds: Iron slag.

The counterweight assembly failure includes <b>counterweight</b> <b>block</b> material loss and fractured washer {{which is the most}} crucial part for in-flight shutdown in this type of aeroengine. Macro observation, fractography analysis, metallograp-hy analysis and hardness test were conducted on the failed counterweight assembly. The result shows that failure mechanism of <b>counterweight</b> <b>block</b> and washer is fatigue. The washer failure is likely due to inappropriate heat treatment process and continuous impact in flight by slightly tilted roller. Count-erweight material loss is attributed to stress concentration, low structure strength and impact came from the tilted roller.
