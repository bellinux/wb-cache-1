5|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> is {{the leading}} cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{the leading}} cause of death {{worldwide}} and in all regions except Africa. In 2008, 30% of all global death was attributed to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Death caused by <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are also higher in low- and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global deaths caused by <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> each year.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> still {{ranks in}} first place among causes of death around the world. Environmental and genetic factors both play roles in the {{pathogenesis}} of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> One of the genetic changes that are claimed {{to contribute to the}} occurrence of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> is the Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) family that has been intensely examined recently. GST gene polymorphisms, which are among antioxidant system enzymes, have a relationship with each of the factors that are considered among the risk factors for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Consequently, {{it can be said that}} the polymorphisms of GST genes are effective both in the risk factors of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> and directly in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{represent}} the {{major cause of}} mortality in industrialized countries, including Switzerland, and affect {{a large percentage of}} hospitalized patients and patients seen in outpatient clinics. Recently, a decline in the incidence of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> has been observed, associated with a general improvement in prognosis. This has been attributed to progress achieved in the treatment of many <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> and to a better identification and treatment of various risk factors. Differences in the clinical manifestations of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> have been observed between men and women. Women seem to be protected until the time of menopause.

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> rises with aging {{and is one}} of the main causes of mortality in western countries. In view of the progressively aging population, there is an urge for a better understanding of age-associated <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> and its underlying molecular mechanisms. The risk factors for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> include unhealthy diet, diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and aging. Increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals plays an important role in mediating <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Oxidative stress affects the availability and/or balance of key-regulators of vascular homeostasis and favors the development of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Reactive oxygen species are generated by different intracellular molecular pathways principally located in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial protein p 66 Shc and the deacetylase enzyme SIRT 1 were shown to be involved in different aspects of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review focuses on the latest scientific advances in understanding <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> associated to aging, as well as delineating the possible therapeutic implications of p 66 Shc and SIRT 1 in this process...|$|R

5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Large {{proportion}} of Asian populations have {{moderate to severe}} periodontal disease and a substantial number are anticipated to be {{at high risk of}} morbidity and mortality from <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> This systematic review analyzes status of research from the South-Asian region on association of periodontal and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methodology: Observational studies (case-control, cohort) and clinical (randomized or nonrandomized) trials published during January 2001 - December 2012 focused on association between periodontitis and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in South-Asian countries were retrieved from various databases and studied for this systematic review. Results: Current evidence suggests that both periodontal and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are globally prevalent and show an increasing trend in developing countries. Global data on epidemiology and association of periodontal and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are predominantly from the developed world; whereas Asia with 60 % of the world’s population lacks substantial scientific data on the link between periodontal and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> During the search period, fourteen studies (5 clinical trials, 9 case-controls) from South-Asia met the inclusion criteria of this review; 100 % of clinical trials, 78 % case-control studies have reported a significant association between the oral/periodontal parameters and CVD. Conclusion: Epidemiological and clinical studies from South-Asian countries validate the global evidence on association of periodontal disease with CVDs. However there is a clear need for meticulous research for public health and scientific perspective of the Periodontal and <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> from South-Asia.

5|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors.

No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism.

40|$|CONTEXT: Though the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{the leading}} cause of {{mortality}} in India, {{little is known about the}} human and economic loss attributed to the disease. The aim of this paper is to account the age and sex pattern of mortality, hospitalisation and the cost of hospitalisation for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in India. DATA AND METHODS: Data for the present study has been drawn from multiple sources; 52 (nd) and 60 (th) rounds of the National Sample Survey, Special Survey of Death, 2001 - 03 and the Sample Registration System 2004 - 2010. Under the changing demographics and constant assumptions of mortality, hospitalisation and cost of hospitalisation, we have estimated the deaths, hospitalisation and cost of hospitalisation for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in India during 2004 to 2021. Descriptive analyses and multivariate techniques were used to understand the socio-economic differentials in cost of hospitalisation for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in India. FINDINGS: In India, the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> accounted for an estimated 1. 4 million deaths in 2004 and it is likely to be 2. 1 million in 2021. An estimated 6. 7 million people were hospitalised for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2004, and projected to be 10. 9 million by 2021. Unlike mortality, majority of the hospitalisation due to <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> will be in the prime working age group (25 - 59). The estimated cost of hospitalisation for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> was 94 /- billion rupees in 2004 and expected to be 152 /- billion rupees by 2021, at 2004 prices. The cost of hospitalisation for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> was significantly high in private health centres, high fertility states and among high socio-economic groups. CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation will be largely concentrated in the prime working age group and the cost of hospitalisation is expected to increase substantially in coming years. This calls for mobilising resources, increasing access to health insurance and devising strategies for the prevention, control and treatment of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in India...|$|R
