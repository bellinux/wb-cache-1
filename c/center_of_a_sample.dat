Evidence for very radial orbits is found, however, in the sample of NATs near the cluster center.

40|$|The main {{principles}} {{of producing a}} region near the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample,</b> compressed in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), with a very high pressure gradient and, consequently, with high pressure are predicted theoretically. The revealed phenomenon of generating extremely high pressure gradient is called the pressure self-focusing effect. Initial analytical predictions utilized generalization of a simplified equilibrium equation. Then, the results are refined using our recent advanced model for elastoplastic material under high pressures in finite element method (FEM) simulations. The main points in producing the pressure self-focusing effect are to use beveled anvils and reach a very thin sample thickness at the center. We find that the superposition of torsion in a rotational DAC (RDAC) offers drastic enhancement of the pressure self-focusing effect and allows one to reach the same pressure under a much lower force and deformation of anvils...|$|E

For rotating systems, we find that the minimum central enclosed mass is greater than or similar to the predicted black hole mass based on ground-based stellar velocity dispersions. By modeling the gas dynamics we will go on to constrain the masses of the black holes.

30|$|Delineation of {{homogeneous}} patches {{is possible}} when {{one or more}} characteristics of trees or stands (e.g., tree height, canopy cover, density) are considered in a forest ecosystem. However, stand Structural Variables (SVs) are relatively homogeneous across managed forests which may lead to better identification of HPs in such forests. As shown by recent studies, ALS data can describe three dimensional structure of forest stands to estimate SVs {{in order to identify}} HPs (Sverdrup-Thygeson et al. 2016; Alexander et al. 2017). If a starting point is set within the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> plot with a predefined size and specific variables extracted from ALS data are assigned to the point, it is possible to find the adjacent parts of a forest stand that are not different, to some extent, from the starting point at different spatial scales. Thus, the closely connected parts to the starting point in terms of statistical similarities of tree variables may be considered as HPs. Following these steps, one can use ALS data to artificially “extend” ground sample plots to identify clusters of similar areas following the previously presented idea of forest stratification (Parker and Evans 2004; McRoberts et al. 2012). Moreover, Næsset (2005) showed that integration of ALS data and measurements on ground enables a proper calibration of that first set, so the application of a combination of both datasets guarantees higher accuracies.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} large-sliding contact model {{coupled with}} strain-induced phase transformations (PTs) and plastic flow in a disk-like sample under torsion at high pressure in rotational diamond anvil cell (RDAC) is formulated and studied. Coulomb and plastic friction are combined and {{take into account}} variable parameters due to PT. Results are obtained for weaker, equal-strength, and stronger high pressure phases, and for three values of the kinetic coefficient in a strain-controlled kinetic equation and friction coefficient. All drawbacks typical of problem with cohesion are overcome, including eliminating mesh-dependent shear band and artificial plastic zones. Contact sliding intensifies radial plastic flow, which leads to larger reduction in sample thickness. Larger plastic strain and increased pressure in the central region lead to intensification of PT. However, {{the effect of the}} reduction in the friction coefficient on PT kinetics is nonmonotonous. Sliding increases away from the center and with growing rotation and is weakly dependent on the kinetic coefficient. Also, cyclic back and forth torsion is studied and compared to unidirectional torsion. Multiple experimental phenomena, e. g., pressure self-multiplication effect, steps (plateaus) at pressure distribution, flow to the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample,</b> and oscillatory pressure distribution for weaker high-pressure phase, are reproduced and interpreted. Reverse PT in high pressure phase that flowed to the low pressure region is revealed. Possible misinterpretation of experimental PT pressure is found.

40|$|Combined high {{pressure}} phase transformations (PTs) and plastic flow {{in a sample}} within a gasket compressed in diamond anvil cell (DAC) are studied {{for the first time}} using finite element method. The key point is that phase transformations are modelled as strain-induced, which involves a completely different kinetic description than for traditional pressure-induced PTs. The model takes into account, contact sliding with Coulomb and plastic friction at the boundaries between the sample, gasket, and anvil. A comprehensive computational study {{of the effects of the}} kinetic parameter, ratio of the yield strengths of high and low-pressure phases and the gasket, sample radius, and initial thickness on the PTs and plastic flow is performed. A new sliding mechanism at the contact line between the sample, gasket, and anvil called extrusion-based pseudoslip is revealed, which plays an important part in producing {{high pressure}}. Strain-controlled kinetics explains why experimentally determined phase transformation pressure and kinetics (concentration of high pressure phase vs. pressure) differ for different geometries and properties of the gasket and the sample: they provide different plastic strain, which was not measured. Utilization of the gasket changes radial plastic flow toward the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample,</b> which leads to high quasi-homogeneous pressure for some geometries. For transformation to a stronger high pressure phase, plastic strain and concentration of a high-pressure phase are also quasi-homogeneous. This allowed us to suggest a method of determining strain-controlled kinetics from experimentation, which is not possible for weaker and equal-strength high-pressure phases and cases without a gasket. Some experimental phenomena are reproduced and interpreted. Developed methods and obtained results represent essential progress toward the understanding of PTs under compression in the DAC. This will allow one optimal design of experiments and conditions for synthesis of new high pressure phases...|$|E

Pest management in organic onion farming is based on plant extracts with insecticide effects. However, the efficacy of such plant extracts has not been proved yet, and it was observed that they do negatively affect natural enemies. Plants surrounding onion fields, and that are attractive to natural enemies, may be a good option to farmers, since they may lead to increased diversity of arthropod species and, consequently, the natural control of pest populations.

Through careful examination of the unit cell parameters of coexisting ppv and H-phase using multigrain XRD, we characterized the compositional variations of both phases across the <b>center</b> area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laser-heated <b>sample</b> at 119  GPa. Chemical segregation due to a large temperature gradient can be problematic in some laser heating experiments. Previous ex situ TEM analyses of recovered samples revealed strong Fe depletion and Si enrichment in the hot area, and Fe migration to the cold margin through chemical diffusion due to a relatively large temperature gradient (Sinmyo et al. 2008; Andrault and Fiquet 2001). In this study, we observed relative Fe enrichment in both phases in the heating center, relative to the margin in a well-insulated and quasi-hydrostatic sample environment at 119  GPa. The temperature gradient in the center portion (20 – 30  μm) of the laser-heated sample was minimized by careful experimental preparation. Therefore, the relative Fe enrichment in the center may not be driven by thermal diffusion but could be caused by the effect of temperature on the partitioning. The temperature distribution in the laser heating spot should be measured in future experiments to quantitatively understand the effect of temperature on partitioning.|$|R

There were three groups according to the cluster analysis: hypermotor NES of the extremities with tonus alteration; NES with automatism; and axial NES with eye movements. In conclusion, the study of clinical semiology of NES during the PVEM provides both this nosological entity and the differential EP diagnoses while the provocative test helps to obtain the seizures...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{is thought to}} play an etiologic role in several gastroduodenal diseases including gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric MALT lymphoma, and distal gastric cancer. Several {{studies have suggested that}} H. pylori which express cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) may be more virulent than those that do not, but limited populations have been studied to date. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-H. pylori IgG, IgA and anti-CagA antibodies in peptic ulcer (PU) patients and healthy individuals in the city of Rafsanjan. &# 13; METHODS: <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 60 PU patients (30 males and 30 females, aged 17 to 60 years) and 138 age-matched healthy individuals (65 males, 73 females) were enrolled in this study. Diagnosis of PU disease was established on the basis of findings by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The control group was recruited from among healthy blood donors referred to Blood Transfusion <b>Center</b> <b>of</b> Rafsanjan. <b>A</b> blood <b>sample</b> was collected from each participant and the sera were tested for the presence of anti- H. pylori IgG and IgA antibodies and antibody to bacterial virulence factor (CagA) by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum concentrations of anti-H. pylori IgA and anti-CagA antibody were expressed as mean ± SD in each group. &# 13; RESULTS: In PU patients the overall seroprevalence of anti-H. pylori IgG (95. 8 %), IgA (96. 6 %) and anti-CagA (91. 6 %) were higher than those observed in the control group (73. 2 %, P< 0. 003; 79 %, P< 0. 002; 47. 82 %, P< 0. 0000001; respectively). In the control group the prevalence of serum anti-CagA IgG antibodies was significantly higher in males compared to females (58. 46 % vs. 38. 35 %; P< 0. 01). Moreover, the mean titer of anti-H. pylori IgA antibodies was significantly higher in anti-CagA+ subjects compared to anti-CagA- subjects (47. 5 Uarb/ml ± 35 vs. 27 Uarb/ml ± 18; P< 0. 01). Furthermore, an inverse association was found between levels and the prevalence of anti-CagA with advanced&# 13; age. &# 13; CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the H. pylori-specific antibodies, especially anti-CagA were more prevalent among PU patients compared to the control group. Moreover, it seems that the males are more susceptible to infection with CagA+ strains compared to females. It was also found that the magnitude of the IgG response to CagA decreased with advanced age. Furthermore, {{the results of the present}} study demonstrated that the seroprevalence of H. pylori {{infection is}} widespread among the healthy subjects in the city of Rafsanjan. &# 13; KEY WORDS: Seroprevalence, Helicobacter pylori, IgG, IgA, Anti-CagA, peptic ulcer, Rafsanjan...|$|R
40|$|In cold climates it was {{determined}} that the heat loss from the hot effluent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beef manure anaerobic digester represented <b>a</b> sizeable portion <b>of</b> the energy production of the digester. This suggested an effluent to influent heat exchanger was necessary. Available heat exchangers were unsuitable;A different concept heat exchanger using a vertical flat plate for the heat transfer surface with the hot and cold flows passing on either side was then considered. The exchanger would be divided into <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> tanks with <b>an</b> overall counterflow arrangement. The extra tanks and the counterflow arrangement would increase the effectiveness. Gravity flow would allow the introduction of gas agitation to keep the solids from settling, prevent plugging, and enhance the heat transfer coefficient. The concept was called a multipass mixed tank exchanger;Design equations and curves for the multipass mixed tank exchanger were developed using the number of transfer units, N(,tu). These equations were suitable for design when the overall thermal conductance, U, was known;A 1. 18 m by 2. 30 m prototype water to water heat exchanger was constructed and used to verify the design equations. The prototype was to have been used on an anaerobic digester at the ISU Beef Nutrition farm, but the digester was not yet completed {{at the time of this}} writing;To determine the convective heat transfer coefficient, h, (from which U can be estimated), and to consider the effects of air agitation, laboratory equipment was constructed. The equipment consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large vertical cylinder with a closed bottom and open top, containing <b>a</b> fixed <b>sample.</b> Heat was applied at a known rate to the outer cylinder. In the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sample,</b> <b>a</b> small, water cooled, pipe acted as a heat sink. The h value {{was determined}} from the known heat rate and the temperature drop between the sample and the <b>center</b> pipe;The effects <b>of</b> air agitation on h were determined by supplying varying amounts of air at the sample bottom. Sufficient air agitation to completely blend the sample was observed to greatly increase the h value compared to lower air rates. Additional air flow rates had a lesser effect;The experimental results indicated that the h value for <b>a</b> specific manure <b>sample</b> could be predicted by knowing the total solids and the air agitation rate. The h value for effluent could only be partly predicted by knowing the air agitation rate. It was hypothesized that other parameters, such as viscosity and Reynolds number, were necessary. These were not evaluated;The multipass mixed tank exchanger is a possible method to recover lost heat. Further studies are necessary to verify that the concept can be put to practical use...|$|R
