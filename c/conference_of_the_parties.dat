In 2003, the choir returned to Italy to perform at the annual <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parties</b> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The choir has also performed in France and Spain. On October 2, 2007, the Weill Institute of Music at Carnegie Hall announced that the City College choir {{was one of four}} high school choirs selected to participate in the National High School Choral Festival on March 10, 2008.

5|$|The main {{threat to}} {{crocodilians}} {{around the world}} is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the skins of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was legal to hunt them. At the <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parties</b> in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins. In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.|$|E

500|$|GCC {{opposed the}} signing of the Kyoto Protocol by Clinton. GCC was {{influential}} in the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol by the administration of President George W. Bush. According to briefing notes prepared by the United States Department of State for the under-secretary of state, Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was [...] "in part based on input from" [...] GCC. GCC lobbying was key to the July, 1997 unanimous passage in the United States Senate of the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, which reflected the coalition's position that restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions must include developing countries. GCC's chairman told a US congressional committee that mandatory greenhouse gas emissions limits were: [...] "an unjustified rush to judgement." [...] The coalition sent 50 delegates to the third <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parties</b> to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Kyoto. On December 11, 1997, the day the Kyoto delegates reached agreement on legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, GCC's chairman said the agreement would be defeated by the US Senate. In 2001, GCC's executive director compared the Kyoto Protocol to the RMS Titanic.|$|E
500|$|Before the CITES {{conference at}} which a vote would be taken on the proposal, support for the {{proposed}} change in status appeared to be limited {{because of the small}} amount of reported legal trade. In April 2007, the non-profit conservation group ProFauna Indonesia attracted news coverage with a demonstration held in Malang, Java. The demonstration—an appeal for increased protection for slow lorises—involved organization members suspending themselves from bridges while holding banners that read [...] "Stop jual kukang" [...] ("Stop the slow loris trade") and [...] "Jangan beli kukang" [...] ("Don't buy slow lorises"). From early to mid-June, the 14th CITES <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parties</b> (CITES COP-14) was held in The Hague, Netherlands. On 8June, Cambodia presented the proposal along with their rationale. Indonesia followed by announcing their support, along with Japan, India, Laos, Thailand, the United States, the European Union, Qatar, and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Although the proposal was adopted by consensus, some conservation groups objected on the grounds that rational analysis was being usurped by sentiment.|$|E
