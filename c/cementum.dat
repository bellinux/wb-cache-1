5|$|<b>Cementum</b> is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. <b>Cementum</b> is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of <b>cementum</b> is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the <b>cementum</b> is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of <b>cementum,</b> cellular <b>cementum,</b> covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with <b>cementum</b> cells {{overlying}} dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have <b>cementum</b> outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the <b>cementum</b> is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|Concrescence is {{the fusion}} of two {{separate}} teeth only in their <b>cementum.</b>|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and <b>cementum),</b> and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by <b>cementum).</b> Underneath the <b>cementum</b> and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Hypercementosis is {{excessive}} {{formation of}} <b>cementum,</b> which {{may result from}} trauma, inflammation, acromegaly, rheumatic fever, and Paget's disease of bone.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} <b>cementum</b> cells {{overlying}} dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have <b>cementum</b> outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior <b>cementum</b> or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or <b>cementum</b> and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, <b>cementum,</b> and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the <b>cementum</b> or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with <b>cementum,</b> which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, <b>cementum,</b> and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the <b>cementum</b> of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Cellular <b>cementum</b> {{develops}} after most of {{the tooth}} formation is complete and after the tooth occludes (in contact) with a tooth in the opposite arch. This type of <b>cementum</b> forms around the fiber bundles of the periodontal ligaments. The cementoblasts forming cellular <b>cementum</b> become trapped in the <b>cementum</b> they produce.|$|E
25|$|Like human teeth, whale teeth have polyp-like {{protrusions}} {{located on}} the root surface of the tooth. These polyps are made of <b>cementum</b> in both species, but in human teeth, the protrusions are {{located on the}} outside of the root, while in whales the nodule is located on the inside of the pulp chamber. While the roots of human teeth are made of <b>cementum</b> on the outer surface, whales have <b>cementum</b> on the entire surface of the tooth with a very small layer of enamel at the tip. This small enamel layer is only seen in older whales where the <b>cementum</b> has been worn away to show the underlying enamel.|$|E
25|$|Acellular <b>cementum</b> forms first. The cementoblasts {{differentiate}} from follicular cells, {{which can only}} reach {{the surface of the}} tooth's root once Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, are also secreted. Acellular <b>cementum</b> contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the <b>cementum,</b> and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.|$|E
25|$|As {{root and}} <b>cementum</b> {{formation}} begin, bone is {{created in the}} adjacent area. Throughout the body, cells that form bone are called osteoblasts. In the case of alveolar bone, these osteoblast cells form from the dental follicle. Similar {{to the formation of}} primary <b>cementum,</b> collagen fibers are created on the surface nearest the tooth, and they remain there until attaching to periodontal ligaments.|$|E
25|$|In humans, enamel {{varies in}} {{thickness}} {{over the surface}} of the tooth, often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border with the <b>cementum</b> at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).|$|E
25|$|Not {{only can}} {{the age of}} a human {{specimen}} be narrowed by evaluating the patterns of tooth eruption and tooth wear, recent studies provide evidence that <b>cementum,</b> the mineralized tissue that lines the surface of tooth roots, exhibits annual patterns of deposition. Aggrawal has presented a comprehensive account.|$|E
25|$|In around 2006, {{two teams}} {{attempted}} to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003, but both teams were unsuccessful. It {{has been suggested}} that this happened because the dentine was targeted; new research suggests that the <b>cementum</b> has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have denatured the DNA.|$|E
25|$|Guided by the palps, the chelicerae {{cut into}} the skin with their {{horizontal}} cutting action. These rip and tear at the epidermal layers and a small pool of blood is formed. The hypostome is inserted and this provides the initial attachment strength. In the case of Ixodes holocyclus the hypostome is inserted very deep into the dermis. The palps remain spread apart on the surface. The process by which Ixodid and Argasid ticks feed is termed telmophagy (= pool feeding). (This contrasts {{with the process of}} solenophagy, used by mosquitos, in which feeding is direct from a small venule.) The resultant pool expands {{as a result of the}} anticoagulants released from the salivary glands. In some Ixodid ticks a <b>cementum</b> is secreted into the wound within 5–30 minutes of cutting into the skin. This material hardens quickly into a latex-like covering around the mouthparts but excluding the palps that remain flattened out on the skin surface. Ixodes holocyclus, however, is one of the Ixodid ticks which does not produce <b>cementum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival recession occurs from either trauma or periodontal disease. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root’s <b>cementum</b> and then dentin {{to cause a}} chronic infection of the pulp (see further discussion under classification by affected hard tissue). Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative challenges and increased tooth loss.|$|E
25|$|Tooth enamel {{is one of}} {{the four}} major tissues that make up the tooth in humans and many other animals, {{including}} some species of fish. It makes up the normally visible part of the tooth, covering the crown. The other major tissues are dentin, <b>cementum,</b> and dental pulp. It is a very hard, white to off-white, highly mineralised substance that acts as a barrier to protect the tooth but can become susceptible to degradation, especially by acids from food and drink.|$|E
25|$|Teeth are {{bathed in}} saliva {{and have a}} coating of {{bacteria}} on them (biofilm) that continually forms. The minerals in the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and <b>cementum)</b> are constantly undergoing processes of demineralization and remineralisation. Dental caries results when the demineralization rate is faster than the remineralisation and there is net mineral loss. This happens {{when there is an}} ecologic shift within the dental biofilm, from a balanced population of micro-organisms to a population that produce acids and can survive in an acid environment.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and <b>cementum.</b> Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} caries is acid from {{bacteria}} dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and <b>cementum).</b> The acid is produced from food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's {{primary energy source}} and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than build up from sources such as saliva, caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva such as: diabetes mellitus, Sjogren's syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants. Caries is also associated with poverty, poor cleaning of the mouth, and receding gums resulting in exposure of {{the roots of the}} teeth.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{from the}} dental {{follicle}} {{give rise to}} the periodontal ligament (PDL). Specific events leading {{to the formation of}} the periodontal ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and permanent teeth and among various species of animals. Nonetheless, formation of the periodontal ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and <b>cementum.</b> This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The occlusion, which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of periodontal ligament. This perpetual creation of periodontal ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.|$|E
500|$|The {{periodontium}} is {{the supporting}} {{structure of a}} tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure. It consists of the <b>cementum,</b> periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and gingiva. Of these, <b>cementum</b> {{is the only one}} that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the <b>cementum.</b> Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or [...] "socket". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The tooth bud (sometimes {{called the}} tooth germ) is an {{aggregation}} of cells that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The enamel organ {{is composed of}} the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines a tooth's root shape. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells. Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth. [...] The dental follicle gives rise to three important cells: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the <b>cementum</b> of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through <b>cementum.</b>|$|E
500|$|FMNH PM 59520 is 9.8mm high. It {{is similar}} in many respects to UA8653, but is less curved and its occlusal surface {{contains}} a large [...] (funnel-shaped cavity), filled with <b>cementum</b> and surrounded by enamel that penetrates deeply into the tooth. There is also either a second infundibulum or a cementum-filled furrow. The differences in degree of curvature and occlusal morphology suggest that this tooth represents a different tooth position than UA8653. Krause and colleagues tentatively placed this tooth in Lavanify {{in view of the}} considerable variation among other gondwanathere teeth of a single species {{and in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|The {{anatomic}} {{crown of}} a tooth {{is the area}} covered in enamel above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or [...] "neck" [...] of the tooth. Most of the crown is composed of dentin (dentine in British English) with the pulp chamber inside. The crown is within bone before eruption. After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with <b>cementum.</b> As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has pulp canals. A tooth may have multiple roots or just one root (single-rooted teeth). Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots {{are referred to as}} supernumerary roots.|$|E
500|$|Columbian mammoths {{had four}} {{functional}} molar teeth at a time, {{two in the}} upper jaw and two in the lower. About [...] of the crown was within the jaw, and [...] was above. The crown was pushed forward and up as it wore down, comparable to a conveyor belt. The teeth had separated ridges of enamel, which were covered in [...] "prisms" [...] directed towards the chewing surface. Wear-resistant, they were held together with <b>cementum</b> and dentin. A mammoth's molars were replaced five times over the animal's lifetime. The first molars were {{about the size of}} those of a human, the third were [...] long, and the sixth were about [...] long and weighed [...] With each replacement, the molars grew larger and gained more ridges; the number of plates varied between individuals. Growing [...] of ridge took about 10.6 years.|$|E
500|$|The sperm whale's {{lower jaw}} is very narrow and underslung. The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth {{on each side}} of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. The teeth are {{cone-shaped}} and weigh up to [...] each. The teeth are functional, but {{do not appear to be}} necessary for capturing or eating squid, as well-fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws. One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males. Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth. Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw, but these rarely emerge into the mouth. Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale's age. [...] Like the age-rings in a tree, the teeth build distinct layers of <b>cementum</b> and dentine as they grow.|$|E
500|$|Woolly mammoths {{had four}} {{functional}} molar teeth at a time, {{two in the}} upper jaw and two in the lower. About [...] of the crown was within the jaw, and [...] was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a conveyor belt. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of enamel, which were themselves covered in [...] "prisms" [...] that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear resistant and kept together by <b>cementum</b> and dentine. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted {{of only a few}} plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, , the third were 15cm (6in) [...] long, and the sixth were about [...] long and weighed [...] The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement. The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant.|$|E
500|$|TNM02067 is a damaged, partial left dentary [...] (lower jaw bone). It {{preserves}} much of {{the body}} of the bone, which is short and deep, but is broken along a vertical fracture behind the toothrow. There is another fracture in the front part of the jaw. The bone is 19.5mm (0.77 in) long and 11.4mm (0.45 in) deep. All the teeth are incomplete or absent, and lack both enamel and <b>cementum,</b> but what remains indicates that there was a large incisor at the front and five cheekteeth further back, separated by a diastema (gap) of about 2.5mm (0.098 in). On the labial (outer) surface of the dentary, there is one large mental foramen (opening). The mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the lower jaw meet, is poorly preserved, but there is nothing to suggest that the left and right dentaries were fused. The lower margin of the bone is convex at the front, but concave further back, so that the depth of the dentary is 8.3mm (0.33 in) below the diastema, but only 7.0mm (0.28 in) below the third cheektooth. The origin of the coronoid process, a projection {{at the back of the}} dentary, lies far to the front.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the {{formative}} cementoblasts {{is believed to be}} different for cellular <b>cementum</b> and acellular <b>cementum.</b> One of the major current hypotheses is that cells producing cellular <b>cementum</b> migrate from the adjacent area of bone, while cells producing acellular <b>cementum</b> arise from the dental follicle. [...] Nonetheless, it is known that cellular <b>cementum</b> is usually not found in teeth with one root. [...] In premolars and molars, cellular <b>cementum</b> is found only in the part of the root closest to the apex and in interradicular areas between multiple roots.|$|E
