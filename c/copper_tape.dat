40|$|CERN's twisted-pair superconducting {{cable is}} a novel design which offers {{filament}} transposition, low cable inductance and is particularly suited for tape conductors such as 2 G YBCO coated conductors, Ag-sheathed Bi 2223 tapes and Ni/Monel-sheathed MgB 2 tapes. A typical design of such twistedpair cables consists of multiple superconducting tapes intercalated with thin <b>copper</b> <b>tapes</b> as additional stabilizers. The <b>copper</b> <b>tapes</b> are typically not soldered to the superconducting tapes so that sufficient flexibility is retained for the twisting of the tape assembly. The electrical and thermal contacts between the <b>copper</b> and superconducting <b>tapes</b> are an important parameter for current sharing, cryogenic stability and quench propagation. Using an MgB 2 twisted-pair cable assembly manufactured at CERN, we have carried out minimum quench energy (MQE) and propagation velocity (vp) measurements with point-like heat deposition localized within a tape. Furthermore, different contacts between the copper and superconductor around the hot spot have also been studied, including the co-twisted assembly in Kapton wrapping and locally separated tapes. The measurements have been performed in cooling helium gas at temperatures between 20 K and 35 K, with different current fractions {{with respect to the}} thermal runaway current. The results suggest a potential optimization strategy, compromising between: a higher stabilization with better contact between the copper and superconducting layers; and a faster propagation velocity and easier quench detection with a higher contact resistance...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} twistor {{system used}} permalloy tape {{wrapped around a}} 3 mil copper wire. For any given length of wire, the tape was wound up over only the first half. The copper wire was then bent {{at the point where}} the tape ended, and ran back alongside the portion with the tape, forming a return conductor. This meant all the connections were at one end. Several such twistor lines were laid side-by-side and then laminated into a PET film plastic sheet, with the twistors and their return wires about 1/10th of an inch apart. A typical tape might have five twistor wires and their returns, so the sheet was just over an inch wide. The solenoid was similarly constructed, consisting of a number of 0.15 inch wide <b>copper</b> <b>tapes</b> laminated into a plastic tape of the same basic dimensions as the twistor. Unlike a traditional solenoid with many turns of wire around an open core, this system was essentially nothing more than single wires in a sheet of plastic.|$|R
50|$|A {{shielded}} cable is {{an electrical cable}} {{of one or more}} insulated conductors enclosed by a common conductive layer. The shield may be composed of braided strands of copper (or other metal, such as aluminium), a non-braided spiral winding of <b>copper</b> <b>tape,</b> or a layer of conducting polymer. Usually this shield is covered with a jacket. The shield acts as a Faraday cage to reduce electrical noise from affecting the signals, and to reduce electromagnetic radiation that may interfere with other devices. (For more, see electromagnetic interference). The shield minimizes capacitively coupled noise from other electrical sources. The shield must be applied across cable splices.|$|E
5000|$|A {{somewhat}} similar system called [...] "concentric wiring" [...] {{was introduced in}} the United States around 1905. In this system, an insulated electrical wire was wrapped with <b>copper</b> <b>tape</b> which was then soldered, forming the grounded (return) conductor of the wiring system. The bare metal sheath, at earth potential, was considered safe to touch. While companies such as General Electric manufactured fittings for the system and a few buildings were wired with it, it was never adopted into the US National Electrical Code. Drawbacks of the system were that special fittings were required, and that any defect in the connection of the sheath would result in the sheath becoming energised.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{recrystallization}} texture of heavily cold-rolled pure copper is almost completely cubic. However, one of the main drawbacks concerning the use of pure copper cube-textured substrates for YBCO coated conductor is the reduced secondary recrystallization temperature. The onset of secondary recrystallization (i. e., the occurrence of abnormal grains with unpredictable orientation) in pure copper substrate was observed within the typical temperature range required for buffer layer and YBCO processing (600 - 850 °C). To avoid the formation of abnormal grains the effect of both grain size adjustment (GSA) and recrystallization annealing was analyzed. The combined use of a small initial grain size and a recrystallization two-step annealing (TSA) drastically reduced the presence of abnormal grains in pure <b>copper</b> <b>tapes.</b> Another way to overcome the limitation imposed by the formation of abnormal grains is to deposit a buffer layer at temperatures where secondary recrystallization does not occur. For example, La 2 Zr 2 O 7 (LZO) film {{with a high degree of}} epitaxy was grown by metal-organic decomposition (MOD) at 1000 °C on pure copper substrate. In several samples the substrate underwent secondary recrystallization. Our experiments indicate that the motion of grain boundaries occurring during secondary recrystallization process does not affect the quality of LZO film...|$|R

Using copper foil, {{the edges of}} the glass pieces are wrapped with adhesive <b>copper</b> <b>tape</b> and soldered together along the adjacent copper strips. The copper foil technique (commonly called Tiffany stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether John La Farge or Louis Comfort Tiffany originated it) was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of three-dimensional works, in addition to two-dimensional ones to which the lead came method is limited. A patent for the method of [...] "Joining Glass Mosaics" [...] was issued to Sanford Bray in 1886. This new method of joining pieces of stained glass used copper/copper foil instead of lead sashes.

50|$|One {{important}} fact {{to bear in}} mind is {{that the}} antenna lead, from the point where it leaves the relevant terminal on the HF ATU is a transmitting antenna. There is nothing that can or should be done to prevent RF radiation from this lead. It should be a specialist, high-voltage insulated, single-core wire and it should be rigidly mounted, well away from any other wiring, outside of any conducting faraday cage, in the shortest, straightest possible route {{to the point where it}} will connect to the external antenna, be that a whip or an insulated part of the standing rigging. If it has to cross other wiring, crossing should be at right-angles and with the maximum possible spacing or separation, preferably with earthed <b>copper</b> <b>tape</b> between the two cables and perhaps with ferrite chokes added to the other lead both sides of the crossing point. The purpose of any cable or lead so crossed should be noted and consideration given to de-powering whatever equipment it serves before any transmissions are ever made.

The electrical and thermal contacts between the <b>copper</b> and superconducting <b>tapes,</b> which are given by wrapping the complete ‘sandwich stack’ of tapes together in Kapton, are important parameters for current sharing, cryogenic stability and quench propagation. Observation of both IC and superconductor-stabiliser contact inhomogeneities due to the mechanical twisting process and the gas-cooling regime has shed light on overcoming the unique challenges these create in cable operation. Both an MgB 2 twisted-pair cable assembly manufactured at CERN and a short-length single-sandwich strand made at the University of Southampton have been studied and a novel method for measuring contact resistance in situ has be designed and validated. Tests included measuring thermal runaway propagation velocity (vp) and minimum quench energy (MQE) plus long-period stability tests for the cable, along with characterisation of current transfer as well as contact resistance measurements between the superconductor and stabiliser layers in the single-sandwich. The results suggest that an optimised cable operation strategy may exist, being a trade-oﬀ between: high stabilisation with lower superconductor-stabiliser contact resistance; and fast propagation resulting in easier quench detection with higher superconductor-stabiliser contact resistance.
