5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one side or the other. When the ships <b>cast</b> <b>anchor,</b> the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E

25|$|Tenedos was {{evacuated}} on 25 August and Senyavin {{set sail}} from Corfu on 19 September. Although {{he planned to}} proceed directly to Saint Petersburg, stormy weather induced him to enter the Tagus River and <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in Lisbon on 30 October. Within several days, John VI of Portugal fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the Royal Navy blockaded Lisbon, intercepting a Russian sloop as an enemy vessel: the Anglo-Russian War had been declared. In November, French forces under Duc d'Abrantès overran the Portuguese capital and Senyavin found himself wedged between two warring powers.|$|E
25|$|On the 18th they <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in Smerwick, {{where they}} garrisoned at Dún an Óir (Fort of Gold), and were joined on the 25th by two galleys with 100 troops; {{four days later}} their ships were {{captured}} by the English fleet {{under the command of}} Sir William Winter. Having exhorted the Earl of Desmond and the Earl of Kildare, as Geraldine leaders, to fight the heretics, FitzMaurice left the fort to await the arrival of Stukley (who, unknown to him, had been killed at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in the previous year, during a campaign by King Sebastian of Portugal).|$|E

60|$|At {{once the}} signal was hoisted {{for all the}} vessels in a {{condition}} to sail to take on board water and provisions, and to prepare to sail for Cyprus; {{and the next morning}} at daybreak the fleet sailed out, and made their way toward that island, <b>casting</b> <b>anchor</b> off the harbor of Famagosta.|$|R

25|$|On 31 August Senyavin's {{squadron}} embarked from Portugal for Portsmouth. On 27 September the Admiralty {{was informed}} that enemy vessels <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in the British harbour, with their flags streaming, as if in times of peace. The Lord Mayor of London declared the convention disreputable for Britain's prestige and many in the Admiralty shared his opinion. The Russian fleet was therefore detained in Portsmouth under various pretexts until winter weather made their return to the Baltic impossible. The British insisted that Senyavin's squadron should sail to Arkhangelsk, else they would be intercepted by the Swedish men-of-war. In 1809, the departure was further delayed by the disastrous British expedition to Flushing. At long last, on 5 August, the nearly-starved Russian fleet was allowed to leave Portsmouth for Riga, where they arrived on 9 September 1809.|$|E
25|$|On {{attempting}} its entrance {{he discovered}} three ships {{up the river}} and {{at the point of}} the land two companies of infantry, who brought their artillery to bear upon him. So he gave up trying to capture the entrance and made for St. Augustine. The three Spanish vessels which took the southerly course in pursuit of the remaining French ship continued the chase all night. Menéndez had ordered them to rejoin him {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged to <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea. One of the three broke away, and while in this peril a French ship was sighted, but it did not attack them, although it hove to within a league of their own ship.|$|E

30|$|A {{second level}} of “resistance” is {{constituted}} by {{the plan and}} project as resistance to oblivion and as strategy structuring the elements of permanency in an ever-changing world, as resistance to uncertain, fleeting situations that indeed do not enable an experience to be had of stability.

60|$|Smeaton, {{agreeing with}} them, lay-to {{the whole of}} the 24th, and then, <b>casting</b> <b>anchor,</b> debated whether it were better to make for the coast of France or try to reach the Scilly Islands. Fortunately a change of wind on the 25th enabled them to weigh anchor and run back to Plymouth rejoicing; and vowing, as John Bowden said, never more to venture out to sea in a Buss! They reached the harbour at six in the morning, to the intense relief of their friends, who had given them up for lost.|$|R
25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E
2500|$|On the 14 July, five leagues from St. John River, D'Iberville <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in the fog.

60|$|Lapham drove {{there with}} his wife after he had set Bartley Hubbard down at the Events office, {{but on this day}} {{something}} happened that interfered with the solid pleasure they usually took in going over the house. As the Colonel turned from <b>casting</b> <b>anchor</b> at the mare's head with the hitching-weight, after helping his wife to alight, he encountered a man to whom he could not help speaking, though the man seemed to share his hesitation if not his reluctance at the necessity. He was a tallish, thin man, with a dust-coloured face, and a dead, clerical air, which somehow suggested at once feebleness and tenacity.|$|R

50|$|All {{support systems}} {{have to be}} height {{adjustable}} to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to <b>cast</b> <b>anchors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The French sailed on to Mobile Point (located at {{the western}} extreme of the {{peninsula}} that extends across much of Mobile Bay's mouth) and <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> on January 31 at the [...] "mouth of La Mobilla". The group scouted a large island that, due to finding a group of 60 corpses on the island, Iberville named [...] "Massacre Island" [...] (later renamed [...] "Dauphin Island"). From the top of an oak tree, Iberville could observe brackish water flowing from a river into the bay. [...] He did not, however, detect the harbor on the northeast side of the island. After determining that the bay was too shallow, the party sailed onward.|$|E
2500|$|On {{nearing the}} Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Slocum noted [...] "I didn't touch the helm, for {{with the current}} and heave of the sea the sloop found herself {{at the end of}} the run {{absolutely}} in the fairway of the channel. ... Then I trimmed her sails by the wind, took the helm, and flogged her up the couple of miles or so abreast the harbour landing, where I <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> at 3.30 pm, July 17, 1897, twenty-three days from Thursday Island. The distance run was twenty-seven hundred miles as the crow flies. ... During those twenty-three days I had not spent altogether more than three hours at the helm, including the time occupied in beating into Keeling harbour. I just lashed the helm and let her go; whether the wind was abeam or dead aft, it was all the same: she always stayed on her course." ...|$|E
2500|$|En {{route in}} the English channel, they {{captured}} two English vessels {{and arrived at}} Dingle harbour (part of the area now known as County Kerry) on 16 July. [...] On the 18th they <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in the nearby small Smerwick harbour (now known as Ard na Caithne), where they established a defensive garrison at Dún an Óir (Fort of Gold, Spanish:Fuerte del Oro), an Iron Age promontory fort nearby. [...] Nicholas Sanders paraded the Papal banner with some ceremony at Dingle and Fitzmaurice proclaimed Holy War sanctioned by letters from Pope Gregory. This was a very serious matter in 16th century thinking, as it released the Catholic subjects of Elizabeth I from their duty of obedience to her, {{on the grounds that}} she was a heretic (the Pope had excommunicated her in 1570). The fact that Fitzmaurice had openly challenged the legitimacy of the Tudor dynasty to rule Ireland meant that, unlike the first Desmond rebellion of 1569–73, this one would be very unlikely to end with a negotiated peace.|$|E
6000|$|Turning southward, {{rounding}} the cape of Delaware, the Revenge {{ran up the}} bay, seeking some spot where she might take in water, <b>casting</b> <b>anchor</b> before a little town {{on the coast of}} New Jersey. Here, while some of the men were taking in water, others of the crew were allowed to go on shore, their captain swearing to them that if they were guilty of any disorder they should suffer for it.

50|$|A {{visit of}} Rahmi Koç to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, United States {{inspired}} him to create this museum. The Koç Foundation bought the first museum building in 1991, which was left derelict and seriously damaged after a roof fire in 1984. This building (in Turkish: Lengerhane), was initially used for <b>casting</b> <b>anchors</b> and chains for the Ottoman navy, during the rule of Ahmet III (1703-1730). It was restored {{during the reign of}} Selim III (1789-1807) before passing into the ownership of Ministry of Finance in the Ottoman Empire. During the Republican era, the State Monopoly and Tobacco Co. then used the building as a warehouse until 1951.
