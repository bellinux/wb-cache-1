40|$|The aza-Michael {{reaction}} of amino-functionalized polymers with acrylate and acrylamide <b>crosslinkers</b> {{for the formation}} of hydrogels is investigated. It is studied how far the reaction conditions (pH value, chemical structures of the compounds involved) influence the crosslinking and degradation rate of the gels. When crosslinking the polymer poly(1 -glycidylpiperazine), high pH values lead to fast crosslinking. Fast degradation of -aminoester crosslinks is observed when acrylate <b>crosslinkers</b> are used due to a neighboring group effect. With acrylamide <b>crosslinkers,</b> hydrolytically stable gels are formed, in which the shear moduli and swelling ratio can be adjusted and in which the extracts show no toxic effect on primary human fibroblasts, making them a promising material for biotechnological applications...|$|R

Crosslinkers are designed to covalently interact with molecules of interest, resulting in conjugation.

40|$|We {{describe}} the large-scale collective behavior of solutions of polar biofilaments and both stationary and mobile <b>crosslinkers.</b> Both mobile and stationary <b>crosslinkers</b> induce filament alignment promoting either polar or nematic order. In addition, mobile <b>crosslinkers,</b> such as clusters of motor proteins, exchange forces and torques among the filaments and render the homogeneous states unstable via filament bundling. We start from a Smoluchowski equation for rigid filaments in solutions, where pairwise crosslink-mediated interactions among the filaments yield translational and rotational currents. The large-scale {{properties of the}} system are {{described in terms of}} continuum equations for filament and motor densities, polarization and alignment tensor obtained by coarse-graining the Smoluchovski equation. The possible homogeneous and inhomogeneous states of the systems are obtained as stable solutions of the dynamical equations and are characterized in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We make contact with work by other authors and show that our model allows for an estimate of the various parameters in the hydrodynamic equations in terms of physical properties of the <b>crosslinkers.</b> Comment: 47 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} {{of living}} cells contains {{many types of}} <b>crosslinkers.</b> Some <b>crosslinkers</b> allow energy-free rotations between filaments and others do not. The mechanical interplay between these different <b>crosslinkers</b> is an open issue in cytoskeletal mechanics. Therefore, we develop a theoretical framework based on rigidity percolation to study a generic filamentous system containing both stretching and bond-bending forces to address this issue. The framework involves both analytical calculations via effective medium theory and numerical simulations on a percolating triangular lattice with very good agreement between both. We find that the introduction of angle-constraining <b>crosslinkers</b> to a semiflexible filamentous network with freely rotating crosslinks can cooperatively lower the onset of rigidity to the connectivity percolation threshold-a result argued for years but never before obtained via effective medium theory. This allows the system to ultimately attain rigidity at the lowest concentration of material possible. We further demonstrate that introducing angle-constraining crosslinks results in mechanical behaviour similar to just freely rotating crosslinked semflexible filaments, indicating redundancy and universality. Our results also impact upon collagen and fibrin networks in biological and bio-engineered tissues...|$|R

Unsaturations in the oils were used to introduce epoxides by epoxidation with in situ generated peroxyacetic acid. The epoxidized oils, showing high percentages of oxirane oxygen (9. 4, 10. 0 and 10. 7 %, were applied as <b>crosslinkers</b> in powder-coating formulations. The major advantage of these types of <b>crosslinkers</b> is that they are neither toxic nor mutagenic, in contrast with the widely applied synthetic triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) <b>crosslinkers.</b> However, two potential problems exist when aliphatic oxiranes are compared with conventional TGIC systems. A decrease in glass transition temperature (T(g)) of the powder formulation and a higher degree of yellowing of the coating are often observed.
