5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of <b>cyclin</b> A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of <b>cyclin</b> degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR {{activity}} can prevent cells progressing into S phase through a checkpoint known in humans as the restriction point. At {{the very start}} of G1 phase, a protein called retinoblastoma (Rb) exists in an un-phosphorylated state. In this state, Rb binds to a protein transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F from activating transcription of proteins essential for S-phase. During a normal cell cycle, as G1 progresses, Rb will become phosphorylated in {{a specific set of}} sequential steps by proteins called <b>cyclin</b> dependent kinases (cdks) bound to <b>cyclin</b> proteins. The specific complexes that phosphorylate Rb are <b>cyclin</b> D-cdk4 and <b>cyclin</b> E-cdk2.|$|E
25|$|When it is {{time for}} a cell to enter S phase, {{complexes}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. <b>cyclin</b> E and <b>cyclin</b> A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair by helping to attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by <b>Cyclin</b> D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by <b>Cyclin</b> E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclins,</b> when {{bound with}} the {{dependent}} kinases, {{such as the}} p34/cdc2/cdk1 protein, form the maturation-promoting factor. MPFs activate other proteins through phosphorylation. These phosphorylated proteins, in turn, are responsible for specific events during cycle division such as microtubule formation and chromatin remodeling. <b>Cyclins</b> {{can be divided into}} four classes based on their behavior in the cell cycle of vertebrate somatic cells and yeast cells: G1 <b>cyclins,</b> G1/S <b>cyclins,</b> S <b>cyclins,</b> and M <b>cyclins.</b> This division is useful when talking about most cell cycles, but it is not universal as some <b>cyclins</b> have different functions or timing in different cell types.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cyclins</b> are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} that activate kinases involved in cell division. The degradation of <b>cyclins</b> is the key step that governs the exit from mitosis and progress into the next cell cycle. <b>Cyclins</b> accumulate in the course the cell cycle, then abruptly disappear just before the anaphase of mitosis. The <b>cyclins</b> are removed via a ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway.|$|R
50|$|G1 <b>cyclins</b> do not {{behave like}} the other <b>cyclins,</b> in that the {{concentrations}} increase gradually (with no oscillation), throughout the cell cycle based on cell growth and the external growth-regulatory signals. The presence of G <b>cyclins</b> coordinate cell growth with the entry to a new cell cycle.|$|R
25|$|Also {{involved}} in the phosphorylation and regulation of the RPB1 CTD is <b>cyclin</b> T1 (CCNT1). <b>Cyclin</b> T1 tightly associates and forms a complex with CDK9 kinase, {{both of which are}} {{involved in}} the phosphorylation and regulation.|$|E
25|$|P-TEFb was {{identified}} and purified {{as a factor}} needed for the generation of long run-off transcripts using an in vitro transcription system derived from Drosophila cells. It is a <b>cyclin</b> dependent kinase containing the catalytic subunit, Cdk9, and a regulatory subunit, <b>cyclin</b> T in Drosophila. In humans there are multiple forms of P-TEFb which contain Cdk9 and one of several <b>cyclin</b> subunits, <b>cyclin</b> T1, T2, and K. P-TEFb associates with other factors including the bromodomain protein BRD4, and is found associated with a large complex of proteins called the super elongation complex. Importantly, for the AIDS virus, HIV, P-TEFb is targeted by the HIV Tat protein which bypasses normal cellular P-TEFb control and directly brings P-TEFb to the promoter proximal paused polymerase in the HIV genome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclin</b> {{expression}} levels control progression {{through the}} eukaryotic cell cycle.|$|E
50|$|The G1 <b>cyclins</b> CLN1 and CLN2, upon {{transcriptional}} activation by Cln3 in mid-G1, bind Cdk1 (Cdc28) to complete progression through Start. These <b>cyclins</b> oscillate during the cell cycle - rise in late G1 {{and fall in}} early S phase. The primary function of G1/S cyclin-Cdk complexes is to trigger progression through Start and initiate the processes leading to DNA replication, principally by shutting down the various braking systems that suppress S-phase Cdk activity in G1. G1/S <b>cyclins</b> also initiate other early cell-cycles events such as duplication of the spindle pole body in yeast. The rise of G1/S <b>cyclins</b> is accompanied {{by the appearance of}} the S <b>cyclins</b> (Clb5 and Clb6 in budding yeast), which form S cyclin-Cdk complexes that are directly responsible for stimulating DNA replication.|$|R
50|$|A {{simplification}} in yeast is {{that all}} <b>cyclins</b> bind to the same Cdc subunit, the Cdc28. <b>Cyclins</b> in yeast are controlled by expression, inhibition via CKIs like Far1, and degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.|$|R
50|$|Cdc20-homologue 1 (Cdh1) plays a {{complementary}} role to Cdc20 in cell cycle progression. During {{the time of}} APC/CCdc20 activity, Cdh1 is phosphorylated and cannot bind to the APC/C. After metaphase, however, S/M-Cdks are inactivated by APC/CCdc20, and Cdh1 can exist in a non-phosphorylated state and bind the APC/C. This enables the APC/C to continue to degrade S/M <b>cyclins</b> (and thus S/M Cdks) until they are needed again in the next S-phase.How can S/M <b>cyclins</b> reappear to shepherd the cell into mitosis? The APC/CCdc20 does not recognize G1/S <b>cyclins.</b> Their concentration rises during G1, activating G1/S Cdks, which in turn phosphorylate Cdh1 and gradually relieve the inhibition on S/M <b>cyclins.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{structures}} of human P-TEFb containing Cdk9 and <b>cyclin</b> T1 and the HIV Tat•P-TEFb complex have been solved using X-ray crystallography. The first structure solved {{demonstrated that the}} two subunits were arranged as {{has been found in}} other <b>cyclin</b> dependent kinases. Three amino acid substitutions were inadvertently introduced in the subunits used for the original structure and a subsequent structure determination using the correct sequences demonstrated the same overall structure except for a few significant changes around the active site. The structure of HIV Tat bound to P-TEFb demonstrated that the viral protein forms extensive contacts with the <b>cyclin</b> T1 subunit (Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|When expressed, TIGAR {{decreases}} cellular ATP levels {{through its}} phosphatase activity. Less ATP {{is available for}} Rb phosphorylation, so Rb remains un-phosphorylated and bound to E2F, which cannot activate S phase genes. Expression of <b>cyclin</b> D, ckd4, <b>cyclin</b> E and cdk2 decreases when TIGAR is active, {{due to a lack}} of ATP essential for their transcription and translation. This TIGAR activity serves to arrest cells in G1.|$|E
25|$|Cyclins {{form the}} {{regulatory}} subunits and CDKs the catalytic subunits of an activated heterodimer; cyclins have no catalytic activity and CDKs are inactive {{in the absence}} of a partner <b>cyclin.</b> When activated by a bound <b>cyclin,</b> CDKs perform a common biochemical reaction called phosphorylation that activates or inactivates target proteins to orchestrate coordinated entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Different cyclin-CDK combinations determine the downstream proteins targeted. CDKs are constitutively expressed in cells whereas cyclins are synthesised at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to various molecular signals.|$|E
5000|$|G2/M <b>cyclins</b> - {{essential}} for {{the control of the}} cell cycle at the G2/M transition (mitosis). G2/M <b>cyclins</b> accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase).|$|R
50|$|S <b>cyclins</b> bind to Cdk and {{the complex}} {{directly}} induces DNA replication. The levels of S <b>cyclins</b> remain high, not only throughout S phase, but through G2 and early mitosis {{as well to}} promote early events in mitosis.|$|R
50|$|Clb6 is encoded by 380 {{amino acids}} (44.1kDa), and is 49.7% {{identical}} to Clb5. Clb5 is 435 amino acids (50.4 kDa). The hydrophobic box motif is {{found on the}} C terminus of both <b>cyclins,</b> and includes the conserved FLRRISK sequence characterizing B-type <b>cyclins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Angiogenic Factors (angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2), Cyclins (<b>cyclin</b> D1 and B1), anti-apoptotic genes and a decrease in apoptotic genes (Fas).|$|E
25|$|CDK8 and <b>cyclin</b> C (CCNC) are {{components}} of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme that phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). CDK8 regulates transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH), thereby providing {{a link between the}} mediator and the basal transcription machinery.|$|E
25|$|During oocyte development, high {{metaphase}} promoting factor (MPF) activity causes mammalian oocytes {{to arrest}} at the metaphase II stage until fertilization by a sperm. The fertilization event causes intracellular calcium oscillations, and targeted degradation of <b>cyclin</b> B, a regulatory subunit of MPF, thus permitting the MII-arrested oocyte to proceed through meiosis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Insulin-like {{growth factor}}- 1 (IGF- 1), {{transforming}} growth factor β (TGFβ) and <b>cyclins</b> {{are thought to}} play a role in myocardial hypertrophic response to insults. We investigated these signaling pathways in canine models of ischemic or overpacing-induced cardiomyopathy. Methods Echocardiographic recordings and myocardial sampling for measurements of gene expressions of IGF- 1, its receptor (IGF- 1 R), TGFβ and of <b>cyclins</b> A, B, D 1, D 2, D 3 and E, were obtained in 8 dogs with a healed myocardial infarction, 8 dogs after 7 weeks of overpacing and in 7 healthy control dogs. Results Ischemic cardiomyopathy was characterized by moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction and eccentric hypertrophy, with increased expressions of IGF- 1, IGF- 1 R and <b>cyclins</b> B, D 1, D 3 and E. Tachycardiomyopathy was characterized by severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilation with no identifiable hypertrophic response. In the latter model, only IGF- 1 was overexpressed while IGF- 1 R, <b>cyclins</b> B, D 1, D 3 and E stayed unchanged as compared to controls. The expressions of TGFβ, <b>cyclins</b> A and D 2 were comparable in the 3 groups. The expression of IGF- 1 R was correlated with the thickness of the interventricular septum, in systole and diastole, and to <b>cyclins</b> B, D 1, D 3 and E expression. Conclusion These results agree with the notion that IGF- 1 /IGF- 1 R and <b>cyclins</b> are involved in the hypertrophic response observed in cardiomyopathies. </p...|$|R
50|$|Cln1,2 and/or Clb5,6-Cdk1 complex {{activity}} {{leads to}} a sudden drop in Sic1 levels, allowing for coherent S phase entry. Finally, phosphorylation by M <b>cyclins</b> (e.g., Clb1, 2, 3 and 4) in complex with Cdk1 leads to spindle assembly and sister chromatid alignment. Cdk1 phosphorylation also leads to the activation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase APCCdc20, an activation which allows for chromatid segregation and, furthermore, degradation of M-phase <b>cyclins.</b> This destruction of M <b>cyclins</b> leads to the final events of mitosis (e.g., spindle disassembly, mitotic exit).|$|R

25|$|The {{transcription}} factor TFIIH {{is involved in}} transcription initiation and DNA repair. MAT1 (for 'ménage à trois-1') {{is involved in the}} assembly of the CAK complex. CAK is a multisubunit protein that includes CDK7, <b>cyclin</b> H (CCNH), and MAT1. CAK is an essential component of the {{transcription factor}} TFIIH that is involved in transcription initiation and DNA repair.|$|E
25|$|Co-chaperones bind to HSPs and {{influence}} their activity, substrate (client) specificity and interaction with other HSPs. For example, the co-chaperone CDC37 (cell division cycle 37) stabilizes the cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4 (<b>cyclin</b> dependent kinase 4) and Cdk6. Hop (HSP organizing protein) mediates {{the interaction between}} different HSPs, forming HSP70–HSP90 complexes. TOM70 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane of ~70 kDa) mediates translocation of client proteins through the import pore into the mitochondrial matrix.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{a tightly}} orchestrated {{process that is}} controlled {{within the context of}} the cell cycle. Progress through the cell cycle and in turn DNA replication is tightly regulated by the formation and activation of pre-replicative complexs (pre-RCs) which is achieved through the activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks, CDKs). Specifically it is the interactions of cyclins and <b>cyclin</b> dependent kinases that are responsible for the transition from G1 into S-phase.|$|E
40|$|Periodic {{accumulation}} {{and destruction}} of mitotic <b>cyclins</b> are important for the initiation and termination of M phase. It is known that both APCCdc 20 and APCHct 1 collaborate to destroy mitotic <b>cyclins</b> during M phase. Here we show that this relationship between anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and Clb proteins is reversed in S phase such that the early Clb kinases (Clb 3, Clb 4, and Clb 5 kinases) inactivate APCHct 1 to allow Clb 2 accumulation. This alternating antagonism between APC and Clb proteins during S and M phases constitutes an oscillatory system that generates undulations in the levels of mitotic <b>cyclins...</b>|$|R

50|$|There are “subtle {{and poorly}} understood” {{functional}} {{differences between these}} two <b>cyclins.</b> Clb5 activates early and late phase origins of replication, whereas Clb6 only activates late phase origins. Functionally, Clb5 also has a mitotic destruction box that has been implicated in various proteolytic functions. Clb5 {{has also been shown}} to rescue Cln1-3 triple mutants, which is unique among B-type yeast <b>cyclins.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>cyclin</b> dependent kinases {{a new round}} of replication is thought to be prevented through the downregulation of Cdt1. This is achieved via degradation of Cdt1 as well as through the inhibitory actions of a protein known as geminin. Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1 and is thought to be the major inhibitor of re-replication. Geminin first appears in S-phase and is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition, possibly through ubiquination by anaphase promoting complex (APC).|$|E
25|$|Like other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating {{regulatory}} protein (Tat), which {{is essential for}} efficient transcription of the viral genome. Tat acts by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response element (TAR), found at the 5′ ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts. In binding to TAR, Tat alters {{the properties of the}} transcription complex, recruits the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) of cellular CDK9 and <b>cyclin</b> T1, and hence increases the production of full-length viral RNA.|$|E
25|$|The best {{understood}} galectin {{in terms of}} cancer is galectin-3. Evidence suggests that galectin-3 plays a considerable part in processes linked to tumorigenesis, including transformation to a malignant form, metastasis and increased invasive properties of tumour cells. There is some significant evidence that galectin-3 is involved in cancer since it interacts with oncogenes such as Ras and activates downstream signalling that promotes proliferation. It can also regulate some of the proteins of the cell cycle, such as <b>cyclin</b> E and c-myc, which may give it additional tumorigenic properties.|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of the cdc}} 2 {{protein kinase}} at {{different}} stages of the cell cycle is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with <b>cyclins.</b> We show that in vitro translated human cdc 2 binds very poorly to A and B <b>cyclins,</b> unless it has been preincubated with a Xenopus egg extract. This results in the phosphorylation of cdc 2 which allows binding to <b>cyclins.</b> The replacement of Thr 161, a residue conserved and phosphorylated in other protein kinases, with valine inhibits cdc 2 association with A and B <b>cyclins.</b> In addition, mutations in the amino-terminus of cdc 2 and within the conserved 'PSTAIR' region strongly inhibit binding. The Thr 161 Val mutation causes a lethal phenotype in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, while replacement of Thr 161 with glutamic acid, potentially mimicking phosphorylation, causes uncoordination of mitosis and multiple cytokinesis. These results suggest that a threonine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle is involved in regulating cdc 2 function...|$|R
