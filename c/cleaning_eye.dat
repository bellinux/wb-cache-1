40|$|Objectives: To study {{bacteria}} from eye lids and {{conjunctival sac}} of patients undergoing cataract surgery {{before and after}} the application of antiseptics. Material and Method: Patients undergoing elective cataract extraction in one university hospital were randomly enrolled. Cultures for bacteria and candida were done by swabbing the eye lids before and after cleaning with 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate. Subsequently 7 % povidone iodine was applied on eye lids and conjunctival sacs. Cultures of specimens from eye lids and conjunctival sac were taken after the application of 7 % povidone iodine {{and at the end of}} the operation. Results: Fifty-one patients were enrolled. Positive cultures were found in 90. 2 % and 82. 4 % before and after cleaning the face with 4 % chlorhexidine. After topical application of 10 % povidone iodine, only 19. 6 % had positive cultures from eye lids and conjunctival sac; a significant reduction (p= 0. 001). At the end of the operation, positive cultures were found from eye lids in 10 patients and from the conjunctival sac in 4 patients. Isolates were skin flora and candida species in 2 patients. None of the patients had endophthalmitis. Conclusion: <b>Cleaning</b> <b>eye</b> lids with 4 % chlorhexidine followed by applying 10 % povidone iodine was effective in decreasing skin flora in cataract surgery. The organisms were not completely eliminated. Post-operative follow-up to detect infectious complications is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from prothoracic neurones of crickets which were free to move in a quite normal way. During the head roll component of <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning,</b> the motoneurones (MNs) to the driving muscles, dorso-ventral neck muscles 55, 56 and 60, received excitatory and/or inhibitory input from several spiking neurones. The discharge patterns of these MNs were basically identical to those in intact animals. Lesion of connectives showed that the motor pattern of <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning</b> is generated by a complex neural network in the prothoracic and the suboesophageal ganglia, in which both neck connectives are involved. Single electric shocks to the axons of the interommatidial mechanoreceptors through which <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning</b> is elicited evoked an EPSP followed by an IPSP with a latency of about 10 ms in all MNs of the three muscles on both sides. During repeated stimulation of the receptors this input is predominantly inhibitory...|$|R

The Brazilian Behavioral Pain Scale version (previously translated and culturally adapted) and the recording of physiological parameters were performed by two investigators simultaneously during rest, during <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning</b> (non-painful stimulus) and during endotracheal suctioning (painful stimulus). ResultsHigh values of responsiveness coefficient (coefficient= 3. 22) were observed. The Cronbach's alpha of total Behavioral Pain Scale score at <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning</b> and endotracheal suctioning was 0. 8. The intraclass correlation coefficient of total Behavioral Pain Scale score was ≥ 0. 8 at <b>eye</b> <b>cleaning</b> and endotracheal suctioning.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} use of {{multipurpose}} lens care products via an online survey conducted among soft contact lens (SCL) wearers in Japan. Methods: The subjects were 1000 men and women aged 15 – 44 years who reported that they cleaned their SCL by using multipurpose solution {{at least twice a}} week. Via the internet, they were asked questions about SCL care, {{the use of}} a rubbing step when cleaning SCL, cleaning and replacing lens cases, and recommended SCL care methods. Results: Of the 1000 SCL wearers enrolled, 94. 3 % performed lens care every day lenses were worn, 64. 2 % reported rubbing the lenses every time, 57. 9 % rubbed the lenses for at least 10 seconds per side, and 64. 7 % reported they rubbed the lenses on both sides. Further, 61. 2 % reported that they had been given an explanation of SCL <b>cleaning</b> at an <b>eye</b> clinic or contact lens store. Only 49. 8 % of subjects reported that they cleaned the lens case every time and 61. 7 % replaced the case within 3 months. Only 19. 5 % had been given an explanation about lens case care.

40|$|Purpose: Meibomian-derived lipid {{secretions}} {{are well}} characterised but their subsequent fate in the ocular environment is less well understood. Phospholipids {{are thought to}} facilitate the interface between aqueous and lipid layers of the tear film and {{to be involved in}} ocular lubrication processes. We have extended our previous studies on phospholipid levels in the tear film to encompass the fate of polar and non-polar lipids in progressive accumulation and aging processes on both conventional and silicone-modified hydrogel lenses. This is an important aspect of the developing understanding of the role of lipids in the clinical performance of silicone hydrogels. Method: Several techniques were used to identify lipids in the tear film. Mass-spectrometric methods included Agilent 1100 -based liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) and Perkin Elmer gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used for separation of lipids on the basis of increasing solvent polarity. Routine assay of lipid extractions from patient-worn lenses was carried out using a Hewlett Packard 1090 liquid chromatograph coupled to both uv and Agilent 1100 fluorescence detection. A range of histological together with optical, and electron microscope techniques was used in deposit analysis. Results: Progressive lipid uptake was assessed in various ways, including: composition changes with wear time, differential lipid penetrate into the lens matrix and, particularly, the extent to which lipids become unextractable as a function of wear time. Solvent-based separation and HPLC gave consistent results indicating that the polarity of lipid classes decreased as follows: phospholipids/fatty acids > triglycerides > cholesterol/cholesteryl esters. Tear lipids were found to show autofluorescence—which underpinned the value of fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence detection coupled with HPLC separation. The most fluorescent lipids were found to be cholesteryl esters; histological techniques coupled with fluorescence microscopy indicated that white spots (’’jelly bumps’’) formed on silicone hydrogel lenses contain a high proportion of cholesteryl esters. Lipid profiles averaged for 30 symptomatic and 30 asymptomatic contact lens wearers were compiled. Peak classes were split into: cholesterol (C), cholesteryl esters (CE), glycerides (G), polar fatty acids/phospholipids (PL). The lipid ratio for ymptomatic/symptomatic was 0. 6 ± 0. 1 for all classes except one—the cholesterol ratio was 0. 2 ± 0. 05. Significantly the PL ratio was no different from that of any other class except cholesterol. Chromatography indicated that: lipid polarity decreased with depth of penetration and that lipid extractability decreased with wear time. Conclusions: Meibomian lipid composition differs from that in the tear film and on worn lenses. Although the same broad lipid classes were obtained by extraction from all lenses and all patients studied, quantities vary with wear and material. Lipid extractability diminishes with wear time regardless of the use of <b>cleaning</b> regimes. Dry <b>eye</b> symptoms in contact lens wear are frequently linked to lipid layer behaviour but seem to relate more to total lipid than to specific composition. Understanding the detail of lipid related processes is an important element of improving the clinical performance of materials and care solutions...|$|R
