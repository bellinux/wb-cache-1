40|$|An {{economical}} multilevel groundwater {{monitoring system}} has been developed that can be rapidly installed with a direct-push machine, yet is suitable for sampling across large permeability contrasts. This sealed multiport sampling (SMPS) system consists of up to five lengths of PVC tubing (12 mm OD), each with a screen at a specific depth created by drilling 2. 5 -mm holes. Above and below each screen, round elastomer pieces, with peripheral holes (to clip in the sampling tubes) and a central hole (to hold a discontinuous piece of central tubing {{at the height of}} the screen), are emplaced. Cement-bentonite grout is injected via a tremie tube inserted through the discontinuous <b>centre</b> <b>tube</b> into each interval between the sampling screens. The elastomer pieces and central tube prevent grout from reaching the screened interval. A textile wrapped around the system holds the arrangement in place and at the same time serves to filter the groundwater at the level of the sampling screens. The SMPS system was tested at a tetrachloroethene (PCE) contaminated site. The seals effectively separated the sampling intervals even in heterogeneous formations. Furthermore, concentration profiles agreed well with a reference system. The system should be suitable for a wide range of hydrogeological conditions...|$|E
40|$|There exists many {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of pressure drop inside smooth tubes; however, there is a research gap where this flow is in the transitional flow regime. All work in the transitional flow regime thus far has been concerned with a single tube and in limited cases the effect of different types of inlets were investigated. Many heat exchangers such as shell-and-tube heat exchangers consist of a number of closely packed tubes leading from a common header and in some cases may operate in or close to the transitional flow regime. However, it is not known what effect adjacent tubes will have on pressure drop and the flow distribution in the transitional flow regime. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate the effect that the presence of adjacent tubes will have on the pressure drop in the transitional flow regime. The study is limited to smooth and circular, horizontal tubes in the fully developed, transitional flow regime and adiabatic pressure drops. The transition effects were investigated experimentally by developing and building an experimental set-up on which, firstly, the pressure drops could be measured of one tube to be used as a reference and then secondly, the pressure drop of three tubes in parallel, equally spaced, 1. 4 diameters apart. The internal tube diameters of all tubes were 3. 97 mm and the tube lengths were 6 m. The pressure drops were measured over a length of 1. 97 m, at the end of the tubes where the flow was fully developed. The pressure drops were measured with pressure transducers while the inlet and outlet temperatures of the water were measured with PT 100 probes. All the tubes were connected to a calming section to ensure a square-edge inlet. Experiments were conducted with water at Reynolds numbers from 700 to 5 100 to ensure that the pressure drops and thus friction factors could be determined for fully developed flow throughout the laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The uncertainty of the friction factors were all less than 1 %. It was found that the <b>centre</b> <b>tube</b> experienced an earlier onset of transition than that previously seen in single tube tests, at a Reynolds number of 1 840. In the outer tubes, transitional flow was delayed well beyond that previously seen in literature. The flow in all three tubes underwent transition into fully developed turbulent flow by the maximum Reynolds number of 3 340. The effect of having multiple, adjacent inlets caused a maldistribution in the mass flow rate, with a 5. 8 % difference in the flow rates of the outer tubes in the transitional flow regime. New correlations were developed to predict the friction factor for transitional flow in each of three adjacent tubes at an inlet pitch distance of 1. 4 times the inner tube diameter. Overall, it can be concluded that multiple tube entrances have an effect on the transitional flow in all of the tubes and should be further investigated for other pitch distance and tube arrangements.

40|$|We study kink {{oscillations}} of thin magnetic tubes. We {{assume that}} the density {{inside and outside the}} tube (and possibly also the cross-section radius) can vary along the tube. This variation is assumed to be of such a form that the kink speed is symmetric with respect to the <b>tube</b> <b>centre</b> and varies monotonically from the tube ends to the <b>tube</b> <b>centre.</b> Then we prove a theorem stating that the ratio of periods of the fundamental mode and first overtone is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of the kink speed at the <b>tube</b> <b>centre</b> and the <b>tube</b> ends. In particular, it follows from this theorem that the period ratio is lower than two when the kink speed increases from the tube ends to its centre, while it is higher than two when the kink speed decreases from the tube ends to its centre. The first case is typical for non-expanding coronal magnetic loops, and the second for prominence threads. We apply the general results to particular problems. First we consider kink oscillations of coronal magnetic loops. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the ratio of the fundamental period to the first overtone is lower than two and decreases when the loop size increases. The second problem concerns kink oscillations of prominence threads. We consider three internal density profiles: generalised parabolic, Gaussian, and Lorentzian. Each of these profiles contain the parameter (Formula presented.) that is responsible for its sharpness. We calculate the dependence of the period ratio on the ratio of the mean to the maximum density. For all considered values of (Formula presented.) we find that a formula relating the period ratio and the ratio of the mean and maximum density suggested by Soler, Goossens, and Ballester (Astron. Astrophys. 575, A 123, 2015) gives a sufficiently good approximation to the exact dependence...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} carried out on the calix [4] tube, created from two calix [4] arenes joined at their lower rims, with a series of different metal ions. The simulations show that for potassium, for which the tube is highly selective, the ion enters the tube at the upper rim of one calix [4] arene and forms an intermediate complex interacting with the aromatic rings and then proceeds to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>tube,</b> concomitant with a conformational change in the calix [4] tube, where it forms bonds to the 8 oxygen atoms. Simulations {{have been carried}} out with six other ions. For ions smaller than potassium, e. g. silver, sodium and lithium, the ion proceeds more readily to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>tube</b> while for ions larger than potassium, e. g. thallium, rubidium and caesium, the ion remains in the intermediate position close to the aromatic rings and does not proceed to the centre unless the temperature is raised significantly. However even at 1000 K, the large caesium ion does not proceed to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>tube.</b> Simulations also show how different alkyl substituents at the upper rim of the calix [4] arenes affect the movement of the ions.

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the nitrogen gas phase in a graphite tube furnace for atomic absorption spectrometry has been determined using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). Subtle details of the temperature evolution at various locations in the tube have been identified. Under steady-state conditions, the temperatures of the tube wall and of the gas phase near the <b>tube</b> <b>centre</b> are essentially identical. The longitudinal gradient of the gas phase temperature between the <b>tube</b> <b>centre</b> (heated to 2700 K) andthetube ends is around 1200 K. This is less than that predicted by model calculations. During rapid heating, typically used for atomization of the analyte, the gas follows the wall temperature very closely and with essentially the same heating rate. Irregularities in this heating pattern, such as an intermediate slowing of the heating rate 0. 3 s after start of heating, are most probably caused by gas expansion {{during the period of}} rapid tube heating. A pronounced radial temperature gradient was observed in the gas phase of tubes with inserted platform during the rapid heating phase, but not in tubes without a platform. The gradient in the gas phase disappears within about 0. 5 s after the tube wall has reached the preset temperature. When the platform technique is used and the temperature program selected with care, volatilization of the analyte can be delayed until the tube wall and the gas phase have almost reached their final temperatures and are close to thermal equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe study {{inertial}} {{effects in the}} displacement of a fluid in a capillary by a more viscous fluid, using a numerical method. A level-set approach is employed to track the meniscus, and a Navier slip boundary condition is imposed in order to alleviate a stress singularity at the moving contact line. Various flow regimes are identified with a Reynolds number and a capillary number as the main parameters. At relatively low Reynolds number, the meniscus forms a steady shape, and the interfacial curvature at the <b>tube</b> <b>centre</b> can change from being concave to convex upon increasing the Reynolds number if the displacing fluid is wetting to the tube surface. For wetting displacing fluids, beyond a critical Reynolds number, a quasi-steady solution is no longer found: instead, the interface undergoes non-dampened periodic oscillations and, at even larger values of the Reynolds number, quasi-periodically, and the interface evolves from simple wavy shapes to complex shapes with multiple wavy units. This oscillating state is observed for sufficiently small contact angle values defined from the displacing fluid (< 80 °). Beyond a second critical Reynolds number, the displacing fluid forms a jet and the meniscus advances with a nearly constant speed which decreases with Re. This is also observed at large contact angle values. In a developing jet, however, the interface shape remains partially quasi-steady, near the contact line region and the <b>tube</b> <b>centre.</b> The flow behaviour is shown to be robust over a range of other governing parameters, including the capillary number and the slip length.
