5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} <b>capitalistic,</b> free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E

Parker & Co. bought the rights to the Ives games. The republication claimed The Mansion of Happiness was the first board game published in the United States of America; today, however, the distinction is awarded to Lockwood's Traveller's Tour games of 1822. The popularity of The Mansion of Happiness and similar moralistic board games was challenged in the last decades of the 19th century when the focus of games became materialistic and competitive <b>capitalistic</b> behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of Kenyatta's succession {{had been an}} issue of debate in Kenya ever since independence, and he had not unreservedly nominated a successor. However, the transition of power proved smooth, something which surprised many international commentators. As Vice President, Moi {{was sworn in as}} Acting President for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta—"I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him"—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, land grabbing, and <b>capitalistic</b> ethos that had characterised Kenyatta's period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasising a closer link to the poor. In 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a de jure one-party state.|$|E

25|$|As Habermas argues, in due course, this {{sphere of}} {{rational}} and universalistic politics, free {{from both the}} economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of <b>capitalistic</b> economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern <b>capitalistic</b> forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.|$|E
25|$|Antislavery {{movements}} in the North gained momentum in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of rapid transformation of Northern society that inspired a social and political reformism. Many of the reformers of the period, including abolitionists, attempted {{in one way or}} another to transform the lifestyle and work habits of labor, helping workers respond to the new demands of an industrializing, <b>capitalistic</b> society.|$|E
25|$|Political individualism: Only when {{individuals}} are given full economic freedom {{will it be}} possible to secure political and moral freedom. Restrictions on economic freedom lead, sooner or later, to an extension of the coercive activities of the state into the political domain, undermining and eventually destroying the essential individual liberties which the <b>capitalistic</b> societies were able to attain in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} a {{periphery}} country to industrialize, it must first undergo proto-industrialization. In this stage, a market-based economy begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more <b>capitalistic.</b> Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.|$|E

The witnesses for the prosecution also testified that Bimba urged them to organize for the revolutionary overthrow of the <b>capitalistic</b> American government.|$|E

Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits.|$|E
25|$|Since 1965, {{the use of}} high-yielding {{varieties}} of seeds, increased fertilisers and improved irrigation facilities collectively contributed to the Green Revolution in India, which improved the condition of agriculture by increasing crop productivity, improving crop patterns and strengthening forward and backward linkages between agriculture and industry. However, {{it has also been}} criticised as an unsustainable effort, resulting in the growth of <b>capitalistic</b> farming, ignoring institutional reforms and widening income disparities.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{reached the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century, {{primarily}} through merchants trading with the Ottomans. The first coffee shops opened a century later.

Consumption of coffee has grown since the transformation of Poland into a democratic, <b>capitalistic</b> country in 1989, though it still remains lower per capita than in most West European countries.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaner {{nationalism}} and Nazism had common roots in religio-{{nationalism and}} Pan Germanism {{and therefore the}} racist elements of the former were easily assimilated into the earlier. For example, Afrikaner criticism of the <b>capitalistic</b> system inter-war period was quite anti-Semitic. Many Afrikaner nationalists also viewed a Nazi German style strong government as necessary to protect the volk. Just before, and during World WarII, these sentiments led to {{the appearance of a}} number of pro-Nazi Afrikaner nationalistic organisations, such as the Ossewabrandwag and its paramilitary wing Stormjaers.|$|E
25|$|With time, {{the kibbutz}} members' sense of {{identification}} with the kibbutz and its goals decreased. This process originated both from personal frustrations among the kibbutz members {{as a result of}} internal processes and from the growing stratification and inequality due to the growth of <b>capitalistic</b> practices. Over the years, some kibbutz members established professional careers outside the kibbutz, accumulating power, privileges and prestige. The balance between individual values and values of the kibbutz began to tip, and work motivation was affected. An emphasis was placed on social compensation to encourage productivity. These processes occurred in parallel with a severe economic crisis.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the Statutes of Labourers was {{repealed}} as increasingly <b>capitalistic</b> England embraced laissez-faire policies which disfavored regulations of wages (whether upper or lower limits). The subsequent 19th century saw significant labor unrest affect many industrial nations. As trade unions were decriminalized during the century, {{attempts to control}} wages through collective agreement were made. However, this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible. In Principles of Political Economy in 1848, John Stuart Mill argued {{that because of the}} collective action problems that workers faced in organisation, it was a justified departure from laissez-faire policies (or freedom of contract) to regulate people's wages and hours by law.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Prodi {{joined the}} Christian Democracy party.

Prodi {{has also been a}} visiting professor at Harvard University and a researcher at the Stanford Research Institute.

He is also interested in industrial districts, anti-monopoly policies, relations between states and markets, and the dynamics of the different <b>capitalistic</b> models.|$|E
25|$|Rao and Singh thus {{implemented}} {{policies to}} open up the economy and change India's socialist economy to a more <b>capitalistic</b> one, in the process dismantling the Licence Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles {{standing in the way of}} Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and initiated the process of the privatisation of public sector companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. In praise of Singh's work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister P. Chidambaram has referred to Singh as the Deng Xiaoping of India.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} of horses, newly nomadic First Nations groups could now lance or shoot bison, speeding up {{the rate of the}} bison hunt. The bison hunt became highly commercialized and <b>capitalistic,</b> valuing quick profits over long-term sustainability. Isenberg argues that cultural and ecological interactions between Native Americans and Euroamericans in the Great Plains were responsible for the near-extinction of the bison. Cultural and ecological interactions created new forms of bison hunters: mounted Indian nomads and Euroamerican industrial hideman. These hunters, combined with environmental pressures, nearly extinguished the bison. Isenberg also explains that {{the introduction}} of horses facilitated bison hunting and competed with bison for scarce water and forage. Industrialization also played a role, with the expansion of railroads, commercial hunting, and the fur trade market.|$|E
25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If <b>capitalistic</b> technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.|$|E
25|$|Jazz {{originally}} {{surfaced in}} the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, but quickly faded. After World War II, jazz began to reemerge, but was condemned by Andrei Zhdanov. He considered jazz as corrupt and <b>capitalistic</b> {{due to the fact}} that it grew out of the United States during a time of political unrest. During the 1950s to 1960s, the Civil Rights movement, the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and the cultural and political rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union created the need for cultural exchange. As a result, the United States government sent a jazz band composed of African American musicians abroad to tour places, including the Middle East and Africa, with the goal of the black musicians establishing connections with their African heritage.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a lengthy}} debate {{among the members}} of Politburo over the course of {{economic}} development, by 1928–1929, upon gaining control of the country, Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. Preparation for war {{was one of the main}} driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside <b>capitalistic</b> world. As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II. During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|By the 1500s, the Indian subcontinent {{benefited from}} {{extensive}} {{external and internal}} trade. Its agriculture was highly efficient {{as well as its}} industry. For economic historian Irfan Habib, however, this was not sufficient to later lead to an important <b>capitalistic</b> development. Unlike China, Japan and western and central Europe, India did not experience extensive deforestation until the 19th and 20th centuries. It thus had no pressure to move to coal as a source of energy. From the 17th century, cotton textiles from Mughal India became popular in Europe, with some governments banning them to protect their wool industries. In the 18th century, India were the most important manufacturers in world trade, producing about 25% of the world's industrial output in 1750, with Mughal Bengal in particular being globally dominant in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} Western {{capitalist}} systems {{of development and}} culture makes flexibility in gender and labor roles more difficult than the indigenous cultures historical way of living off of the land. “Indigenous women’s entry into the money economy has been analyzed as making their domestic and subsistence work evermore dispensable to the reproduction {{of the labor force}} and thus reducing women’s power within the family. Indigenous men have been 	forced by the need to help provide for the family in the globalized capitalist economic system that favors paid economic labor while depending on female subordination and unpaid subsistence labor. These ideals are internalized by many workers and imported back into the communities.” This <b>capitalistic</b> infiltration harmed Gender role, they were becoming more and more restrictive and polarized with the ever-growing imposition of external factors on indigenous communities. Ever since the arrival of the Europeans and their clear distinction in the views of “home/work, domestic/productive, (soon to become the public and the private” separations and distinctions began to be made, and value began being placed in different forms.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{insurance}} has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been {{the development of the}} medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques {{of insurance}} markets being conducted under a <b>capitalistic,</b> free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.|$|E
500|$|In 1917 the U.S. entered World War I and Congress {{enacted the}} Selective Service Act, which {{required}} all men {{between the ages}} of 21 and 30 to register for military conscription. Berkman moved back to New York, where he and Goldman organized the No Conscription League of New York, which proclaimed: [...] "We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, anti-militarists, and opposed to all wars waged by <b>capitalistic</b> governments."

When police began raiding the group's public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, however, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other written work. In the midst of the nation's patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League's efforts. The Women's Peace Party, for example, ceased its opposition to the war once the US entered it. The Socialist Party of America took an official stance against US involvement, but supported Wilson in most of his activities.|$|E
500|$|... "Ow'st" [...] in line ten {{can also}} carry two {{meanings}} equally common at the time: [...] "ownest" [...] and [...] "owest". [...] Many readers interpret it as [...] "ownest", {{as do many}} Shakespearean glosses ("owe" [...] in Shakespeare's day, was sometimes used as a synonym for [...] "own"). [...] However, [...] "owest" [...] delivers an interesting view on the text. [...] It conveys the idea that beauty is something borrowed from nature—that it must be paid back as time progresses. [...] In this interpretation, [...] "fair" [...] can be a pun on [...] "fare", or the fare required by nature for life's journey. Other scholars {{have pointed out that}} this borrowing and lending theme within the poem is true of both nature and humanity. Summer, for example, is said to have a [...] "lease" [...] with [...] "all too short a date."

500|$|Embracing this attitude, various {{books have}} been {{published}} espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses. During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them IBM, AT, and General Motors—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force, although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health. However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining profit has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement, with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and Matthew Fox criticising {{what they see as}} trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience. In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, [...] "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and <b>capitalistic</b> private enterprise".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the First World and the Third World {{is characterized by the}} very definition of the Third World. Because countries of the Third World were noncommittal and non-aligned with both the First World and the Second World, they were targets for recruitment. In the quest for expanding their sphere of influence, the United States [...] (core of the First World) tried to establish pro US regimes in the Third World. In addition, because the Soviet Union [...] (core of the Second World) also wanted to expand, the Third World often became a site for conflict. Some examples include Vietnam and Korea. Success lay with the First World if {{at the end of the}} war, the country became <b>capitalistic</b> and democratic, and with the Second World, if the country became communist. While Vietnam as a whole was eventually communized, only the northern half of Korea remained communist. The Domino Theory largely governed United States policy regarding the Third World and their rivalry with the Second World.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Aflaq and al-Bitar gave free lessons on Ba'athist thought, and in 1948 they {{established}} the newspaper al-Ba'ath (English: rebirth/resurrection). Aflaq tested the Ba'ath Party's strength during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War after early Syrian defeats – he led several demonstrations {{against the government}} led by President Shukri al-Quwatli. He personally led demonstrations, and claimed that al-Quwatli, a landowner, was a corrupt and <b>capitalistic</b> politician, who was {{to blame for the}} Syrians army's defeat. Aflaq called for al-Quwatli's resignation, and wrote several al-Ba'ath articles criticising his presidency and his prime minister, Jamil Mardam Bey. Aflaq was later arrested on the orders of al-Quwatli's prime minister Bey. Al-Quwali's government was brought down in a coup d'état led by military officer Husni al-Za'im. Al-Za'im banned all parties, claiming that Syria was not ready to establish a liberal democracy yet. Aflaq, who had been set free, was rearrested during al-Zai'm's presidency and sent to the notorious Mezzeh Prison. Al-Za'im's rule did not last for long, and in August 1949, he was toppled, and Hashim al-Atassi, who was democratically elected, took his place. Al-Atassi established a national unity government, and Aflaq was appointed to the post of Minister of Education, the only government post he would ever hold; he held it from August to December 1949. [...] Al-Attasi's presidency did not last for very long either, and in 1951 Adib Shishakli took power in a military coup.|$|E
500|$|According to {{academic}} Brigid Cherry, nostalgia [...] "is a strong element of {{certain kinds of}} cult appeal." [...] When Veoh added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity. Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as [...] "New Hollywood in extremis" [...] and a form of nostalgia for that period. [...] Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia {{as a form of}} resistance against progress and <b>capitalistic</b> ideas of a time-based economy. [...] By virtue of the time travel plot, Back to the Future permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s. [...] Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period. [...] Similarly, films directed by John Hughes have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism. [...] Mathijs and Sexton describe Grease (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following. [...] Other cult films, such as Streets of Fire (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past. [...] Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as The Big Lebowski, which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow. [...] Author China Miéville praises the use of satire in Donnie Darko for its avoidance of falling into facile and comforting nostalgia, but Nathan Lee of the New York Sun identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.|$|E
