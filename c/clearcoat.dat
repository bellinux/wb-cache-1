500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the <b>clearcoat,</b> which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E

50|$|According to the 2000 Cobra brochure, if the 2000 Cobra {{had been}} produced, {{it would have}} been {{available}} in six exterior paint colors: Crystal White <b>Clearcoat,</b> Ebony (Black) <b>Clearcoat,</b> Laser Red Tinted <b>Clearcoat,</b> Medium Atlantic Blue <b>Clearcoat</b> Metallic, Silver <b>Clearcoat</b> Metallic, and (most notable) Mystic Gold. Apparently, Mystic Gold was supposed to be available in limited numbers late in the model year. After the 1996 Mystic Cobra, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra would have been the second time that a color-shifting paint was used on the Cobra. It was said that the Mystic Gold paint had a color shift from burnt orange to gold to yellow to pale green. Unfortunately, Ford made some changes to the painting process for the 2001 model year, and the Mystic Gold paint was incompatible with the new process. Thus, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra never saw the light of day, but a photograph of a prototype painted Mystic Gold will forever be memorialized in the 2000 Cobra brochure.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{postcure}} high energy (gamma), ultraviolet (UV) and thermal treatment on {{the properties of}} polyester-melamine <b>clearcoats</b> {{of a range of}} compositions has been investigated. Two initial cure conditions were used, of which one was 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 optimally 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cured and the other undercured.

The results were interpreted in terms of the effect of the treatments on the structure of the crosslinked matrices. The study suggests the possibility of the development of a dual-cure process for polyester-melamines, whereby cure optimization and property improvement can be achieved.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the reactions of glycidyl ether, glycidyl ester and other oxirane functional resins with carboxyl or anhydride functional compounds and polymers {{in the presence of}} a wide range of amine, phosphonium and metal catalysts. We confirmed that both amine and phosphonium compounds can catalyze the reaction of epoxy groups with carboxyl and anhydride groups. There are certain deficiencies with these catalysts, such as a tendency to yellow and a reduction in stability at ambient or elevated temperatures. We also observed that many of the known amine catalysts contribute to poorer humidity resistance and exterior durability. Several metal salts were found to be effective catalysts, but they also contributed to a reduction in chemical resistance or they led to paint instability. We have discovered a group of metal chelates that overcome these problems and provide stable formulations in a single package that do not yellow during cure and that give improved resistance properties.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method to}} simulate reactions in a cross-linked polymer is developed {{and applied to}} the photodegradation process of polyester-urethane <b>clearcoats</b> during artificial exposure in a Weather-Ometer. This coarse-grained simulation method, {{which is based on}} a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme, is verified with experimental data on the depth-resolved changes in optical properties and chemical composition that have been previously determined. By modelling the depth-dependency of physical processes that occur in the coating, such as the absorption of photons and the diffusion of oxygen, the experimentally observed evolution of depth gradients in chemical composition can be well described by the simulation. A sensitivity analysis of individual simulation input parameters with respect to a set of resulting observables is performed and the results provide insight into the influence of specific reaction mechanisms on the overall degradation process and help to distinguish essential from less important processes. The values of input parameters that result in the most accurate simulation of the experimental data are determined with an optimisation procedure. In this way, the numerical values of several kinetic and physical parameters that are difficult to determine directly in an experimental way, such as various reaction rate constants, can be obtained from the simulations...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in perfluoropolyether (PFPE) resin technology for high solids, weather resistant polyurethanes for automotive (OEM) and heavy duty coatings are presented. In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed hexamethylene diisocyanate/isophorone diisocyanate (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. <b>Clearcoats</b> were applied over conventional OEM basecoats (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and mar resistance and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent stain release properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE. White pigmented, high gloss finishes were also prepared and evaluated as protective barrier coating for heavy duty paints working in highly corrosive environments...|$|R

Dielectric spectroscopy was done at 25 unique samples, consisting of various plastic substrates, primers, basecoats and <b>clearcoats</b> with the Free-spaced method in the 60 - 90 GHz region. The plastic substrate consisted of Polypropylene-blend with different fillers such as talc, carbon black and metal flakes. The basecoats analyzed were 2 solid factory coatings (one black and one white), 5 factory coating containing different effect pigments such as metal flakes, Xiralic, and Mica, 1 factory PVD coating and 2 aftermarket basecoats. All samples were provided by a Volvo Cars’ supplier, however, some samples were repainted with the aftermarket coatings. The complex permittivites were calculated for each PP-blend and coating from the curve fitting of the measured S-parameters from the Free-spaced method. Material analysis such as thickness measurements of the plastic substrate and coatings, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, TGA and DSC were done at all plastic substrates. The plastic substrates and the coating were also observed in optical microscope and in SEM. The calculated permittivities were compared with the results from the material analysis and correlations between increased metal content in the basecoat and higher real permittivity were found. Some relationship between the size of the metal flakes and the radar transparency could also be observed. Further, correlations between higher real permittivity with higher concentration of talc and carbon black were detected. MATLAB was used to provide an example for optimization of the plastic thickness for a given basecoat in order to have minimal reflection at 77 GHz...|$|R

40|$|B-stage {{processing}} is a {{term used}} for one-pot thermosetting formulations that can be partially cured or pre-dried, after being applied to a substrate and then cured under heat and pressure. B-staging has processing advantages that can be exploited in assembly processes, especially the possibility of splitting the different steps of a process in a production line, {{in terms of time}} and location, thus helping to prevent manufacturing bottlenecks. However, in B-stage processing the pre-drying process has usually tight time and temperature constraints that make necessary a careful control to avoid over-drying leading to loss of properties such as adhesion and material waste. Alternative dual-curing procedures aim at eliminating the above drawbacks while keeping and even enhancing their processing advantages [1 - 3]. Further advantage comes from the possibility of tailoring the material structure and properties between both curing stages by changing the formulation composition. This represents a significant advantage over conventional B-stage, in which the material properties in the intermediate stage are kinetically controlled, depending on temperature/time and vitrification. This approach opens a new way for flexible processing, not just in terms of curing stageability but also in terms of the intermediate material characteristics (adhesion, flowing ability, rigidity,…). In addition, the latent character of the second curing stage ensures good storage stability between both curing stages. In this work, the sequential UV/thermal processing of acrylate-epoxy <b>clearcoats</b> is studied. Mixtures of methacrylates/acrylates with different side chain and functionality, {{at least one of them}} bearing an epoxy group, are photocured to obtain a linear or cross-linked polymer that is subsequently post-cured at elevated temperatures to obtain the final cross-linked material. A combination of a radical photoinitiator and a cationic thermal latent initiator is used in order to permit sequential controlled curing. Different formulation compositions are examined in order to analyze the possibility of custom-tailoring the structure and properties between both curing stages and at the end of the process. The sequential UV-curing and thermal curing processes are studied with photoDSC, FTIR/ATR and DSC. The thermal-mechanical properties of the materials in the intermediate and final states are assessed with DMA, DSC and TGA. The potential application of this curing process is also illustrated.

5000|$|Usually sprayed {{on top of}} {{a colored}} basecoat, <b>clearcoat</b> is a glossy and {{transparent}} coating that forms the final interface with the environment. For this reason, <b>clearcoat</b> must be durable enough to resist abrasion and chemically stable enough to withstand UV light. <b>Clearcoat</b> can be either solvent or water-borne. One part and two part formulations are often referred to as 1k and 2k respectively.OEM (original equipment manufacture) clear coats applied to the metal bodies of cars are normally 1K systems since they can be heated to around 140 deg C to effect cure.
