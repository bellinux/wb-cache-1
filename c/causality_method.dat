40|$|The European Cosmetics Regulation {{requires}} a post-marketing system for detection of undesirable effects {{on human health}} of cosmetic products. Colipa, the European Cosmetic, toiletry and perfumery association, provided guidelines for causality assessment of these effects. In addition another <b>causality</b> <b>method</b> originally designed for causality rating in Post Launch Monitoring (PLM) of novel foods has been employed to assess causality of cosmetic products. In this study these two causality schemes for consumer cosmetic products were validated against clinical assessment, using the method of global introspection (GI) in 100 reported cases. Causality assessments were performed by three experienced assessors in pharmacovigilance. In the event of discordance between the assessors, an adapted Delphi method was used. The overall Spearman correlation coefficient was 0. 74 for comparison of Colipa versus GI, whereas this was 0. 50 for PLM versus GI. According to current guidelines, the sensitivity was 0. 95 for both the Colipa and PLM method, specificity was 0. 84 for Colipa and 0. 40 for PLM. From these results {{it can be concluded}} the performance of the Colipa <b>causality</b> <b>method</b> yielded better correlation to GI than PLM <b>causality</b> <b>method.</b> The factor identified from comparison of these two schemes as having greatest impact was the course of the reaction...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze reasons of {{unemployment}} and the validity of sectoral shift hypothesis developed by Lilien for the Turkish economy between years 2005 and 2014. The causal linkage between variables is analyzed by Toda–Yamamoto Granger causality, frequency domain causality and asymmetric <b>causality</b> test <b>methods.</b> The results obtained from all tests show that the main reasons of unemployment in the Turkish economy are the cyclical factors. It is not possible to speak about validity of sectoral shifts hypothesis in the economy. The intensity and direction of interactions between macroeconomic variables may differ due to time frequencies. The existence of causality may disappear in the long run while it exists in the short run. Also conventional <b>causality</b> analysis <b>methods</b> do not decompose the causality into positive and/or negative shocks and so they could not explain the direction of causality. In order to test causation linkage between variables and to find direction of causality in different shock types we employ recently developed <b>causality</b> analysis <b>methods</b> which would increase the quality of the study. </p...|$|R

The results of the homogenous and instantaneous causality tests {{suggest that there is}} a bi-directional causal relationship between the variables. However, this causality is not homogenous for the group of countries. Indeed, heterogeneous causality procedures indicate that there exists a bi-directional causal relationship for only a small set of countries. For the most part, the causal relationship runs from FDI to tourism, implying that FDI provides much needed capacity for SIDS and therefore allows these countries to expand their tourism product. ...|$|R

Overall, all studied bivariate <b>causality</b> <b>methods</b> provided reproducible estimates of climate causality networks, with the linear approximation showing higher reliability than the investigated nonlinear methods.
