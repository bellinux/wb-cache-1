40|$|Plant {{diseases}} {{influence the}} quantity and quality of groundnut and sorghum <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> <b>used</b> as fodder for ruminants. The present socio-economic study assessed farmers' perceptions, their awareness, and the relative importance and impact of plant diseases in farmers' livelihood systems. Case studies were carried out in four villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan Plateau with the help of participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques. The results from PRAs suggest that sorghum and groundnut crop residues constitute a major source of fodder, and predominantly provide 'feed security' to the ruminants during summer, as few alternatives are available to farmers in dryland areas. The problem of foliar diseases cannot be viewed in isolation, as farmers' concerns are more on the cumulative effects of pests and diseases. Farmers believe that diseases reduce the quality of crop residues that leads to feed refusal by, and poor health of ruminants. The effects on the quality of crop residues are more seriously perceived in groundnut as farmers report 50...|$|E

Germany-grown cup-plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.), sunflower (Helianthusannuus L.) and topinambour (Helianthus tuberosus L.) were used as raw materials for particleboards produced at a conventional density of 600 kg/m 3. Particleboards were glued with two different adhesives, with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as well and urea formaldehyde (UF) resins. The physical and mechanical properties of prepared panels were measured according to standards. The raw materials were analyzed for their chemical composition; particle geometry was carefully monitored. It is shown that the obtained particleboards have acceptable performances, though properties were below those obtained from conventional spruce particleboards. Modulus of rupture of the alternative material particleboards {{were found to be}} lower than the spruce particleboards. Likewise, thickness swelling and water absorption of the agricultural residues made particleboards were higher than the compared spruce-made particleboards.

40|$|Groundnut haulms {{along with}} cowpea hay are major <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> <b>used</b> for animal {{fattening}} in the West African Sahel. In traditional sheep fattening, feeds are always provided ad-hoc {{and in an}} unregulated fashion, which is rather wasteful. As a preliminary study to establish the optimal feeding levels of groundnut haulms for profitable sheep fattening, a feeding trial was conducted for 70 days with four levels of groundnut haulms (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/day) and a basal diet of bush hay. The effects of supplementation with groundnut haulms on feed intake, water consumption, live weight changes and economic return were determined. Twenty-four Peuhl Oudah rams with average initial weight of 28. 6 kg (SD = 1. 4) were randomly allocated to four treatments defined by the four levels of groundnut haulms in the diet.

40|$|Open Access JournalThe study compares and {{contrasts}} <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> <b>uses</b> in 3 {{case study}} sites along an agricultural intensification gradient in the Sahel-Sudano zone of Niger and Nigeria. It draws on {{data collected from}} 24 vii/ages involving 480 households and employs a Tobit model to analyse the determinants of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> <b>uses</b> for cereals and legumes. The study uses an innovative classification of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> <b>uses</b> as an internal and external service to the farming system. Survey results indicate that internal service as livestock feed constituted the largest share across sites and crop types. Sale of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> is the largest external use identified for legumes. The {{study found that the}} internal <b>use</b> of cereal <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> decreases along an intensification gradient. However, legume biomass redistribution within the system (internal service) did not follow a clear intensification gradient. The result of Tobit analyses indicates internal service use was positively influenced by livestock ownership (p<O. Ol), age (p<O. l), education (p<O. Ol), training by extension agent on crop-livestock interaction (p< 0. 05) and <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management (p<O. Ol). However, as household size (p<O. Ol) increased theÂ· probability of enhancing internal services to agricultural systems declined. This suggests that larger households with more pressing demands for cash tend to sell their <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> at the expense of more sustainable uses such as mulching.

However, calculating accurate WFs of short-season vegetable crops such as carrots, cabbage, beetroot, broccoli and lettuce presented some challenges.

To overcome this, using the nutritional value of crops as a functional unit can connect water use more directly to potential benefits derived from different crops and allow more straightforward comparisons. Grey WFs based on nitrogen only disregards water pollution caused by phosphates, pesticides and salinization.

40|$|Severe land {{degradation}} affects the livelihood of many {{farmers in the}} highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Various {{soil and water conservation}} practices have been proposed to reduce {{land degradation}} and {{to improve the quality of}} the natural resource base but quantitative information on their agro-ecological effects is often lacking. In this study, effects of three soil and water conservation practices are assessed using a crop growth simulation model (WOFOST), a nutrient monitoring model (NUTMON) and a hydrological erosion model (LISEM), which are applied at field, farm and regional scale, respectively. Evaluated soil and C water conservation practices include (i) bunds along field contours to improve water availability for crop production, (ii) mulching of crop residues to improve soil nitrogen stocks and (iii) reforestation to reduce erosion. Data from the watershed Gobo Deguat in northeastern Tigray have been used as a case-study. Bunds slightly increased crop productivity at sowing dates when water-limited yields were low, while productivity decreased at more favorable sowing dates due to the reduction in cropped area required for the construction of bunds. <b>Crop</b> <b>residues</b> <b>used</b> as mulch hardly contributed to lower soil nitrogen depletion at farm level as the total amount of nitrogen in crop residues was limited, while part of the crop residue nitrogen returned to the soil anyway in the form of manure and compost. Reforestation reduced erosion up to 14 % but this is insignificant compared to the sacrifice in cultivated land which needs to be reforested. Applied tools allow rapid ex-ante evaluation of soil and water conservation practices and may contribute to improved cost-benefit analysis of proposed measures, and identification of more appropriate means to combat land degradation. The analyses show important trade-offs and the effects of the assessed soil and water conservation practices may partially explain their low rate of adoption in Tigray. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Ongoing land {{degradation}} in Tigray (Ethiopia) requires urgent action {{at different levels}} of society. Soil and water conservation activities are now widespread, integrating local knowledge, farmers' initiatives and introduced technologies. Hengsdijk et al. [Hengsdijk, H., Meijerink, G., Mosugu, M., 2005. Modelling the effect of three soil and water conservation practices in Tigray, Ethiopia. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 105, 29 - 40. ] evaluate this through the application of a suite of models, the results of which show that after stone bund building, productivity would decrease. Furthermore, their simulations suggest that <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> <b>used</b> as mulch would hardly contribute to lower soil nitrogen depletion at farm level. Nearly complete forestation of the catchment would reduce erosion by only 14 %, which is deemed insignificant compared to the sacrifice in cultivated land that needs to be forested. Overall, the results of the model simulations lead Hengsdijk et al. to suggest that conservation efforts in Tigray are inefficient and absorbing a disproportionate amount of resources, which could have been spent differently and more efficiently if model simulations would have been used as an ex-ante evaluation. Here, we compare the results of the model simulations by Hengsdijk et al. with field data that we collected over the last decade in the Tigray area. Based on the results of this comparison, we question the validity of the conclusions by Hengsdijk et al. regarding the efficiency of soil conservation measures in Tigray. We believe this discussion illustrates, at a more general level, the difficulties in transposing environmental models from one region to another. Extensive fieldwork remains necessary for site-specific calibration and validation. Neglecting to do so may result in improper understanding of the issues at hand and consequently in ill-targeted and costly remediation schemes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

The majority of Ugandaâs pig farmers are smallholders (1. 2 million households raise pigs), practicing low input/ low output systems. In the three districts of Kamuli, Masaka and Mukono, where the study was carried out, results of focus group discussions conducted in 35 villages showed that regardless of the setting, whether rural or peri-urban, the smallholder pig production systems are typical crop-livestock system, with high dependence on crop residues, i. e. sweet potato vines, cassava leaves, yam leaves, and Amaranth spp. for pig feeding. However, the relative contribution of those crop residues is strongly affected by rainfall seasonality, which in turn influences crop production. The bulk (> 95 %) of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> <b>used</b> for feeding pigs is produced on farm.

The main feeding constraints identified by farmers are: dry season fodder shortages (crop residues and forages); risk of parasite infestation through forages, either grazed or cut and carried. In the case of concentrates, constraints include high cost of commercial feeds, price fluctuation of feed ingredients, and poor quality of purchased feeds.

About 738. 8 ÃÂ tons of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> are produced in this village each year. In 2005, only two cattle were fed in this village and 1. 1 % of the <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were <b>used</b> as forage. About 38. 5 % <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were <b>used</b> for livelihood energy, 24. 5 % were discarded and 29. 7 % were directly burned in the field. Not more than three biogas digesters were built and merely 2250 ÃÂ m 3 biogas was produced a year relative to saving 1. 6 ÃÂ tons standard coal and equivalent to reducing 4. 3 ÃÂ tons CO 2 emission. A total of US$ 4491 profits were obtained from cattle benefit, reducing fossil energies/chemical fertilizer application and increasing crop yield. After 5 years experiment, cattle capita had raised gradually up to 146 and some 62. 3 % <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were <b>used</b> as forage. The percentages used as livelihood energy, discarded and burned in the field decreased to 16. 3 %, 9. 2 % and 9. 8 %, respectively. Biogas digesters increased to 123 and 92, 250 ÃÂ m 3 biogas was fermented equal to saving 65. 9 ÃÂ tons standard coal and reducing 177. 9 ÃÂ tons CO 2 emission. In total US$ 60, 710 profits were obtained in 2009. In addition, about 989. 9 ÃÂ tons green fertilizers were produced from biogas digesters and applied in croplands. The results suggested that livestock and biogas projects were promising strategies to consume the redundant agricultural residues, offer livelihood energy and increase the villagers' incomes. Biogas production and utilization could effectively alleviate energy crisis and CO 2 emission, which might be a great contribution to reach the affirmatory carbon emission goal of the Chinese government on Climate Conference in Copenhagen in 2009.

40|$|Impacts of biochar {{application}} at laboratory {{scales are}} routinely studied, but impacts of biochar application on decomposition of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> at field scales {{have not been}} widely addressed. The priming or hindrance of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> decomposition could have a cascading impact on soil processes, particularly those influencing nutrient availability. Our objectives were to evaluate biochar effects on field decomposition of <b>crop</b> <b>residue,</b> <b>using</b> plots that were amended with biochars made from different plant-based feedstocks and pyrolysis platforms {{in the fall of}} 2008. Litterbags containing wheat straw material were buried in July of 2011 below the soil surface in a continuous-corn cropped field in plots that had received one of seven different biochar amendments or a uncharred wood-pellet amendment 2. 5 yr prior to start of this study. Litterbags were collected over the course of 14 weeks. Microbial biomass was assessed in treatment plots the previous fall. Though first-order decomposition rate constants were positively correlated to microbial biomass, neither parameter was statistically affected by biochar or wood-pellet treatments. The findings indicated only a residual of potentially positive and negative initial impacts of biochars on residue decomposition, which fit in line with established feedstock and pyrolysis influences. Overall, these findings indicate that no significant alteration in the microbial dynamics of the soil decomposer communities occurred {{as a consequence of the}} application of plant-based biochars evaluated here...|$|R

30|$|The {{results in}} TableÂ  1 showed that 48 % of the {{households}} were food secure while 52 % were food insecure given the {{two thirds of}} the average of all households is 1660 ETB. Feleke et al. (2005) documented about 40 % incidence of food insecurity in Ethiopia. Regarding the scarcity indicator, we know that grazing land and water resources are challenging to value because they are not traded and have no market price. Their prices are a shadow price (Magnan et al. 2012) since shadow prices are assumed to reflect better the economic scarcity of environmental goods to a household (Cooke 1998). For this reason, as a proxy indicator for scarcity, first, we use walking distance for a single trip to measure grazing, water, and <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> <b>using</b> similar approach used by Palmer and MacGregor (2009). On average, the households spend 1.25 Â h/day to reach a water source for animal and 1.5 Â h/day to search for communal grazing land, maximum time reaching up to 6 Â h for water site and 8 Â h for grazing land in the data. Besides, the average time spent on collecting <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> by the household is 9.6 Â h per a single trip on foot.|$|R
40|$|Resource-conserving {{agriculture}} (RCA) aims {{at improving}} soil quality and crop yield whilst maintaining or improving soil health by minimizing soil disturbance, retaining <b>crop</b> <b>residue,</b> <b>using</b> <b>crop</b> rotations and adding in situ {{soil and water}} conservation tillage practices (terwah and derdero) in crop fields. In Ethiopia, intensive mining of soil resources using repeated tillage, complete <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> removal at harvesting, overgrazing and biomass burning in croplands have aggravated soil degradation. We studied the impact of two RCA (derdero+ (DER+) and terwah+ (TER+) on long-term soil quality and crop productivity in permanently kept plots in northern Ethiopia 7 years after its inception. The two RCA practices: (i) DER+ is a bed and furrow planting system, where beds remain unploughed, furrows are tilled once at planting time and 30 % of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> is retained. (ii) TER+ is ploughed once at planting, furrows are made at 1. 5 m intervals, creating fresh broad beds, and 30 % <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> is retained. These RCA practices were compared against conventional tillage (CT) characterized by a minimum of three tillage operations and complete removal of <b>crop</b> <b>residues.</b> Among the several assessed soil properties, soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, available P, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), time of ponding, aggregate stability index (SI), consistency index (CI), cone index, air capacity and macroporosity were shown to increase significantly in soils subjected to DER+ planting system compared to CT. On average, crop yields under DER+ and TER+ increased by 30 % and 16 %, respectively, as compared to CT. Thus, from an agro-ecological point of view, adopting improved local practices such as DER+ and TER+ planting systems that employ conservation agriculture principles proved to be sustainable, resource conserving alternatives and incentives should be provided to facilitate larger adoption by farmers in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Following {{mineralization}} of N-rich <b>crop</b> <b>residues,</b> {{large amounts}} of mineral N can be released into the soil. Manipulating N mineralization of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> may be an option to reduce NO 3 - in soil. The potential to manipulate the N release from vegetable <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> by <b>using</b> organic wastes was tested under field conditions. At {{the start of the}} experiment, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis L.) residues (similar to 73 Mg fresh matter ha(- 1)) together with an immobilizer waste (similar to 5 Mg C ha(- 1) of straw, green waste compost, sawdust, or paper sludge) were incorporated into a silt loam soil. After 154 d, a remineralizing waste (similar to 1 Mg C ha 1 of vinasse or dairy sludge) was incorporated. During the field experiment, the mineral N content in the soil was measured at regular time intervals, and net N release, NO 3 - leaching, and denitrification were simulated using a N mineralization-immobilization model coupled to a NO 3 - leaching model. Straw, green waste compost, and sawdust were able to immobilize between 54 and 68 % of the N released by the cauliflower residues and reduced NO 3 - leaching by 56 to 68 %. Paper sludge released an extra amount of N due to its low C/N ratio. No consistent remineralization of N could be found in any of the treatments, probably due to an unsuitable composition of the remineralizer wastes. Manipulating N release of N-rich <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> by <b>using</b> organic wastes may be a suitable method to reduce NO 3 - leaching; however, stimulating remineralization of immobilized N by the start of the following spring may not be easy to achieve...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of land surface {{conditions such as}} senescent plant materials, soils, green vegetation, and water bodies is essential information for understanding global change. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) provides more detailed information about materials having specific narrow absorption features and possibilities for detecting very subtle variations than {{can be obtained from}} the broad bands of current sensors systems. This research was designed to assess the potential use of hyperspectral remote sensing data for characterizing soil surface conditions, particularly for <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and soils. Analytical tools used included the linear mixture model, block kriging, fuzzy c-means clustering, fractal analysis, and the adjustment for atmospheric effects with the ATmosphere REMoval (ATREM) program. To achieve this primary objective, several models and techniques were used for analyzing hyperspectral data to improve the capability to detect and classify <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and quantity and quality of variability in soil patterns. Several simulation studies were also implemented to test the procedures used for this study. The results from this study illustrate the usefulness of hyperspectral data for the classification of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> <b>using</b> the near infrared bands. Results also show the need for improvement of radiometric resolution of the system. The linear mixture model can be used for reducing the dimensionality and noise effects for the analysis of hyperspectral data. Detailed soil patterns derived from the hyperspectral imagery were well represented using the block kriging interpolation and fuzzy c-means clustering analyses. Fractal analysis indicates that the spatial resolution of AVIRIS is not sufficient for representing the surface roughness of <b>crop</b> <b>residue.</b> Consequently, the future of hyperspectral remote sensing may be very promising for deriving important information about land surface conditions with improved radiometric and spatial resolution. ...|$|R
