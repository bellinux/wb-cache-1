5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was growing rapidly with the influx of around 50,000 people a year, creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since it could not be extended, it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> second administration building was required.|$|E
5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after {{a short period of}} time mutinied when it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} from Tiberius was not forthcoming. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample {{would be if the}} / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|When first planned, the {{landings}} were to {{take place}} simultaneouslyOverlord in Normandy and Anvil {{in the south of}} France. It soon became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dual landing was impossible to conduct with the available forces. The expansion of Overlord from a three- to a five-division front required many additional LSTs, which would have been needed for Anvil. At the same time, another Allied amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio had gone badly. All of these resulted in the postponing of Anvil by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} special session, it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E

5|$|Other Marines {{who have}} also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another {{extraction}} point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard {{makes it to the}} Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen {{in the final stages of}} Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a series}} of pinball machine-like environments in which the player {{controls}} Sonic the Hedgehog, who acts as a pinball {{for the majority of the}} game. Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball was commissioned by Sega when it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new Sonic the Hedgehog game could not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season, as the majority of staff were occupied with developing Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The game was hastily developed, with most work taking place over 61 days. It received mixed reviews upon release, with most critics praising the game's novelty and graphics, although its control scheme was considered a negative factor. A second pinball game, Sonic Pinball Party, was released in 2003, and a spinning rollercoaster of the same name opened in Alton Towers theme park in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|By 11 a.m., it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and {{the advances}} by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received {{a message from}} McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly {{under the impression that}} McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them."—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E
5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ISMB conference lie in a {{workshop}} for artificial intelligence researchers {{with an interest in}} molecular biology held in November 1991. The workshop was organised by American researcher Lawrence Hunter, then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Maryland. A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the National Science Foundation, made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence. Having successfully applied for grants from AAAI, NIH and the Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research, the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, David Searls (research associate professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and Jude Shavlik (assistant professor of computer science at University of Wisconsin–Madison) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries, submitting 69 scientific papers.|$|E
