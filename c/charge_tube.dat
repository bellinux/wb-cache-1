40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary {{design of a}} Ludwieg tube for the experimental verification {{of the existence of}} nonclassical rarefaction shock waves in dense vapors. Nonclassical phenomena can manifest in flows of vapors of complex molecules, such as siloxanes or perfluorocarbons, near the liquid-vapor saturation curve and close to the liquid-vapor critical point. The Flexible Asymmetric Shock Tube (FAST) setup is composed of a <b>charge</b> <b>tube</b> that can be maintained at high temperature and pressure in accurately controlled conditions. The <b>charge</b> <b>tube</b> is separated from the discharge vessel by a special fast opening valve. A nozzle is interposed between the valve and the <b>charge</b> <b>tube</b> to prevent disturbances from the discharge vessel to propagate into the tube. If the rarefaction wave that is generated by opening the valve is a nonclassical rarefaction shock, then it moves with supersonic speed. The supersonic character of the rarefaction wave is to be demonstrated by computing the wave speed from dynamic pressure measurements at two different locations, to be compared to the local sound speed, which can be measured in the same device. An estimate of the valve opening time is computed and it is found to be within technological limits. Siloxane fluid D 6 (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane) is provisionally selected as the working fluid and the choice is thoroughly analyzed...|$|E

For the calculation of the gas exchange rates a computer code was developed, which takes into account all mechanisms influencing the exchange rate in the experiment. The calculated values were in good agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the commissioning of the flexible asymmetric shock tube (FAST), a novel Ludwieg tube-type facility {{designed and built}} at Delft University of Technology, together {{with the results of}} preliminary experiments. The FAST is conceived to measure the velocity of waves propagating in dense vapours of organic fluids, in the so-called non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD) regime, and can operate at pressures and temperatures as high as 21 bar and 400 ?C, respectively. The set-up is equipped with a special fast-opening valve, separating the high-pressure <b>charge</b> <b>tube</b> from the low-pressure plenum. When the valve is opened, a wave propagates into the <b>charge</b> <b>tube.</b> The wave speed is measured using a time-of-flight technique employing four pressure transducers placed at known distances from each other. The first tests led to the following results: (1) the leakage rate of 5 × 10 ? 4 mbarl s? 1 for subatmospheric and 5 × 10 ? 2 mbarl s? 1 for a superatmospheric pressure is compatible with the purpose of the conceived experiments, (2) the process start-up time of the valve {{has been found to be}} between 2. 1 and 9. 0 ms, (3) preliminary rarefaction wave experiments in the dense vapour of siloxane D 6 (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, an organic fluid) were successfully accomplished up to temperatures of 300 ?C, and (4) a method for the estimation of the speed of sound from wave propagation experiments is proposed. Results are found to be within 2. 1 % of accurate model predictions for various gases. The method is then applied to estimate the speed of sound of D 6 in the NICFD regime.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the influence of tagged material on the minimal radiation dose needed to detect colorectal polyps at CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first, three experienced observers determined the visibility of sessile polyps (6 mm) at five contrast levels (300, 490, 790, and 1, 040 HU and air) and five <b>tube</b> <b>charge</b> levels (10, 14, 20, 28, and 40 mAs) in an anthropomorphic phantom. Each polyp was present in one of eight possible locations. The mean <b>tube</b> <b>charge</b> threshold for 90 % correct responses was determined for each contrast level. Blinded observers performed independent 2 D readings. In the second phase of the study, three 150 -cm virtual colons were evaluated at two contrast levels (300 and 480 HU) and at five <b>tube</b> <b>charge</b> levels between 20 and 80 mAs. The three colons contained 18 randomly located polyps. The mean <b>tube</b> <b>charge</b> threshold for 90 % sensitivity was determined for each contrast level. RESULTS. In the first phase of the study, the estimated <b>tube</b> <b>charge</b> thresholds for 300, 480, and 790 HU were 24. 0, 16. 3, and 6. 2 mAs.

The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} Ludwieg tube experiment for the verification {{of the existence of}} nonclassical rarefaction shock waves in dense vapors is here critically analyzed by means of real gas numerical simulations of the experimental setup.

40|$|Electrostatic {{separation}} {{has been}} recently proposed {{as a novel method}} to fractionate wheat bran into valuable ingredient fractions. However, systematic study into {{the influence of}} parameters on electrostatic separation was lacking. Therefore, this study aimed at a more detailed evaluation of electrostatic separation for enriching arabinoxylans (AX) from wheat bran. The influence of wheat bran particle size, carrier gas velocity and <b>charging</b> <b>tube</b> length were investigated with a lab-scale electrostatic separator. A combination of larger particle size (D[4, 3] of 210 µm compared to 110 µm), higher gas velocity (> 28 m/s) and shorter <b>charging</b> <b>tube</b> (125 mm compared to 225 mm) can sufficiently charge the particles, and at the mean time avoid agglomeration by oppositely charged particles. With the optimal settings, single step electrostatic separation of wheat bran could increase the AX content from 23 % dm to 30 % dm, which is similar as can be obtained by sieving. However, in comparison to sieving, the yield of the enriched fraction from electrostatic separation is lower due to the horizontal design of the setup. Improvement of the yield is expected when adjusting the system design from horizontal to vertical. A sieving step added after the electrostatic separation could effectively remove starch and protein and resulted in a fraction with an AX content of 43 % dm, which is around the theoretical maximum value that can be reached by dry fractionation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Tribocharged mixed {{granular}} {{materials are}} commonly separated in the electrostatic field generated between two vertical plate electrodes. However, the existing technologies are {{not appropriate for}} sorting coarse granules (size> 2 mm) for which the effect of gravity is stronger than the Coulomb forces. The aim of the experiments reported in this paper was to show that particle sorting is more efficient when done in a roll-type electrostatic separator. The granular materials to be separated, a mixture of 50 % low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and 50 % high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were charged by particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall collisions taking place inside the rotating tube of a custom-designed tribocharging device. The study was performed with <b>charging</b> <b>tubes</b> made of four different materials: steel, aluminium, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene.

40|$|Spin {{unrestricted}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} used to investigate the molecular and dissociative adsorption of O 2 on achiral substitutional nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWNTs) with and without additional charges. Adsorption (dissociation) of O 2 on the <b>charged</b> <b>tubes</b> is quite complex. The N-SWNTs with an additional electron with different orientations exhibit different behaviors. The armchair N-SWNTs carrying an extra electron have lower chemisorption (up to 0. 6 eV) and reaction (up to 1. 2 eV) energies for O 2 compared to the corresponding neutral N-SWNTs. For (10, 10) N-SWNTs, the dissociation barrier decreases from 1. 36 eV (in neutral) to 0. 76 eV (in negatively charged). The reactivity of the armchair N-SWNTs with low nitrogen content can be increased by adding extra electrons. For the metallic zigzag N-SWNTs, an additional electron affects the O 2 adsorption and dissociation marginally. However, negatively charged zigzag N-SWNTs, which are semiconducting when un-doped, have significantly lower O 2 adsorption, reaction and dissociation barrier energies than the neutral N-SWNTs. We also studied the molecular and dissociative adsorption of O 2 on (10, 10) single-walled nanotubes doped with two substitutional nitrogen atoms (N 2 -SWNTs), as a function of extra charge. The chemisorption and reaction energies decrease linearly with the increasing number of extra electrons. The barrier for O 2 dissociation on N 2 -SWNTs is found to increase with the increasing number of additional electrons. Our results point out that the dissociative adsorption of an oxygen molecule on N-SWNTs depends on many parameters: curvature, chirality, and charge. The effect of additional charge on the reactivity of the N-doped SWNTs is rather independent of the tube diameter, but depends on the tube orientation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
