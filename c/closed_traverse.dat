Traverse {{is a method}} of surveying in which a sequence of lengths and directions of lines between points on the Earth are measured and used in determining positions of the points.

Coordinate readings were collected continuously both at the survey posts and between posts. Both the system’s location accuracy and its potential for developing terrain profiles were evaluated. The system’s average real-time position accuracy was 2. 3 ft (1. 6 ft Stdev., 7. 0 ft max.) and average post-processed accuracy was 1. 4 ft (0. 9 ft Stdev., 4. 0 ft max.), measured at each survey stake.

40|$|The great barn at Harmondsworth near London Heathrow airport, United Kingdom (UK), {{was built}} in 1426 – 7 for the Bishop of Winchester. At 58 metres long and 11. 4 metres wide, {{it is one of}} the largest ever known to have been built in the UK, and the largest intact medieval timber-framed barn in England. The barn is built almost entirely of oak, {{although}} the walls rest on a low masonry sill-wall. Internally the space is divided into a central "nave" with a lower aisle to each side, and is divided along its length into 12 bays. There are three doorways on the east side. For an entirely timber-framed barn, the fabric is exceptionally well preserved. Even the external weatherboarding may be partly original. Following years of neglect, however, there are a number of on-going structural and conservation problems, so in 2011 the barn was bought by English Heritage in order to allow these needs to be addressed. English Heritage is the government agency responsible for the historic sites and buildings in the care of the state of England and is also the UK government's lead advisor on the built heritage. As one of the first steps in the conservation process the English Heritage Geospatial Imaging and Imaging & Visualisation teams undertook a four-day campaign of survey data collection. This took the form of laser scanning of the interior and exterior of the barn plus the acquisition of photography of the exterior elevations to be used with structure from motion (SFM) software. A comparison of the results of these complimentary yet potentially competing technologies will be given, as well as an evaluation of when they can be successfully used together. This paper will describe the procedures and problems involved with collecting the survey data and its subsequent analysis. The laser scanning was undertaken using a FARO Focus 3 D phase based instrument. Approximately 60 scans were acquired in order to provide as comprehensive as possible coverage given the site circumstances. A repeat visit following the clearance of artefacts and with the benefit of access equipment was required to obtain complete coverage, especially for the top surfaces of the timber frame elements. Initial results from the laser scanning were extremely promising, with some historical events (e. g. a major fire at one end of the structure) dramatically shown in the intensity data. Comprehensive photographic coverage of the exterior of the barn including the roof was obtained using a Nikon D 3 X mounted on both a 6 m telescopic pole and a conventional tripod. A repeat visit was required to address some exposure problems in shadow areas. A unified control network for both sets of data was obtained through the use of a total station theodolite (TST) with reflectorless electromagnetic distance measurement (REDM), incorporating a <b>closed</b> <b>traverse</b> as well as the acquisition of scanner and photogrammetric targets. The control network therefore permits the direct comparison of the results from both survey methods (allowing for systematic errors). A point cloud generated from the photography, using Agisoft Photoscan structure from motion software, was compared with the registered laser scan points with a view to determining any systematic differences, although these were to a large extent ameliorated by the use of the dense control network. The resultant data also has potential downstream use within English Heritage for improving our understanding of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as applied to heritage structures rather than new build, and thereby contributing to the formulation of elements of a BIM strategy for English Heritage. There are also a number of hand-measured survey drawings of the barn in existence. A quantitative as well as a qualitative comparison was made with drawings generated from the laser scan data. In general the later drawings were more metrically accurate but exhibited less understanding of the construction techniques employed. A discussion of the reasons for this is also presented...|$|E

While the survey was successful In obtaining reliable and accurate results, as evident by observing single points from multiple stations, the accuracies reached were not at the sub cm level, as per the client’s request. As a Total Station has precision quoted at the mm level, a further survey with a different control network {{was carried out}} on the vessel Falcon Spirit {{in an attempt to}} identify the errors.

40|$|Two {{triangulation}} {{methods for}} measuring perceived egocentric distance were examined. In the triangulation-by-pointing procedure, the observer views a target at some distance and, with eyes closed, attempts to point continuously {{at the target}} while traversing a path that passes by it. In the triangulation-by-walking procedure, the observer views a target and, with eyes <b>closed,</b> <b>traverses</b> a path that is oblique to the target; on command from the experimenter, the observer turns and walks toward the target. Two experiments using pointing and 3 using walking showed that perceived distance, averaged over observers, was accurate out to 15 m under full-cue conditions. For target distances between 15 and 25 m, the evidence indicates slight perceptual underestimation. Results also show that observers, on average, were accu-rate in imaginally updating the locations of previously viewed targets. The term visual space (or visually perceived space) refers to a perceptual representation of the immediate physical environment that exists independently {{of any of the}} partic-ular spatial behaviors it helps to control. Much vision re-search has been devoted to establishing the functional prop-erties of visual space and the mechanisms that underlie it. A major goal of such research has been to characterize the mapping from physical to visual space under different con-ditions of information availability, but ultimately the goal must be to predict visual space solely in terms of its sensory inputs and internal determinants (e. g., intrinsic noise, ob-server assumptions, etc.). Because visual direction is perceived accurately, most space perception research has examined the perception of egocentric distance (i-e., the distance from the object to the observer) and the perception of exocentric distance (i. e., the distance between two targets lying in the same visual direc-tion or, more generally, the distance between any two loca-tions).
