25|$|Stephen Baskerville is an {{associate}} professor of political science, president of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children and fathers' rights advocate and defines court-determined custody as not a right to parent one's children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody. Baskerville states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially when children are involved. He also states that divorce provides advantages for women such as automatic <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> and financial benefits in the form of child support payments. Members of the FR movement also state that family courts are slow to help fathers enforce their parental rights, and are expensive and time-consuming.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, some househusbands say their wives lost respect for them, divorced them, then won <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

500|$|A {{court may}} thus award sole legal <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{to one of}} the parents, but with joint {{physical}} custody to both parents. In many states, a parent with sole physical custody {{is referred to as the}} custodial parent, and the other parent is referred to as the non-custodial parent. With joint physical custody, a court's use of terms such as [...] "primary custodial parent" [...] and [...] "primary residence" [...] may not have much significance beyond being part of the court's division of child tax exemptions between the parents, as both parents are custodial parents.|$|E

Farrar later said that he had [...] "backed down" [...] in the face of his ongoing worries about the state of his marriage and the couple's debt load.|$|E
