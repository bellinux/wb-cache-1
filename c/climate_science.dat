5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on <b>climate</b> <b>science</b> entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of <b>climate</b> <b>science</b> through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of <b>climate</b> <b>science</b> and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable data and information as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so forces them to align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent of Republican politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 percent of Republican senators deny the scientific facts and the occurrence of climate change.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli {{claimed that}} leading climate {{scientist}} Michael E. Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing {{any evidence of}} wrongdoing, filed the Attorney General of Virginia's <b>climate</b> <b>science</b> investigation as a civil demand that the University of Virginia provide {{a wide range of}} records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have a chilling effect on future research. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation. Cuccinelli issued a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court which ruled in March 2012 that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.|$|E
25|$|The {{sponsorship}} of AGU by ExxonMobil became {{a source of}} concern for many members after evidence surfaced that ExxonMobil had known about climate change for decades but had actively worked to undermine <b>climate</b> <b>science.</b> On February 22, 2016, a letter signed by 100 scientists was delivered to the AGU, requesting that they cut all ties with ExxonMobil and other companies that foster climate misinformation. The AGU Board of Directors met on 22 April 2016 and voted to continue accepting sponsorship from ExxonMobil, arguing {{that there was not}} unequivocal evidence that ExxonMobil continues to participate in climate misinformation. Instead of making a short-term political statement, the Board wished to engage with the energy industry over the long term. In response, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Ted Lieu sent a critical letter saying that ExxonMobil continues to fund climate denial and is misleading the AGU. The Union of Concerned Scientists also sent a letter urging them to reconsider. However, in a meeting on 23 September 2016, the Board upheld its previous decision.|$|E

25|$|His {{controversial}} {{reassessment of}} global warming theory in 2009 outlined his concern that the remedies for climate change might prove more damaging to the environment than the ailment itself. Taylor argued that his work with the CRI {{had given him a}} deeper insight into the impacts associated with powering a modern economy from renewable sources. Despite an endorsement by the drafting author of the Kyoto Protocol – Professor Jackson Davis, with whom he worked at the UN and who had played a role in setting up the Framework Climate Convention, the book received little publicity at first – but in the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, his views were widely publicized. However, Taylor is critical of how the environmental movement and left-liberal press have ignored the book - it was not reviewed in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, nor in New Scientist, all of which had previously covered his work. He has become a target of ad hominem attacks focussed either on whether he is adequately qualified to review <b>climate</b> <b>science</b> or on his embrace of mystical philosophy and shamanism.|$|E
