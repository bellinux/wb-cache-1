The synthesis of novel hepta-alkylated tribenzo-imidazolo[4, 5]porphyrazines as metal-free derivatives by <b>cross-condensation</b> of 3, 6 -dialkylphthalonitrile and 1 -alkyl- 4, 5 -dicyanoimidazole is described. The compounds show Q band absorption at 701 and 660 nm. The Q band is thus hypsochromically shifted relative to the Q band absorption of the corresponding metal-free octa-alkylphthalocyanines and the metal-free hexa-alkylated derivatives of tribenzo-pyridino[3, 4]-porphyrazines, tribenzo-thispheno[2, 3]porphyrazines and tribenzo-thiopheno[3, 4]porphyrazines.

40|$|A {{mixture of}} acetic and 2 -methylpropanoic (isobutyric) acids {{representing}} non-branched and branched acids, respectively, was catalytically {{converted to a}} mixture of ketones {{in a set of}} statistically designed experiments (DOE). The selectivity toward the cross-ketonization product was analyzed depending on (a) temperature within 300 – 450 °C range, (b) molar fraction of each acid in the mixture, from 10 % to 90 %, and (c) liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) within 2 – 12 h− 1, and compared against the selectivity toward two symmetrical ketones. Six metal oxide catalysts were tested and ranked on their ability to yield the cross-product as opposed to the self-condensation product. The catalysts were based on either the anatase form of titania or monoclinic form of zirconia and treated with either KOH or K 2 HPO 4. The titania catalyst treated by KOH outperformed all other catalysts by providing the cross-selectivity above the statistically expected binomial distribution. The criterion for having a high cross-selectivity in the decarboxylative ketonization is formulated mathematically as the separation of roles of two acids, one being a more active enolic component, and the other being the preferred carbonyl component. According to the suggested criterion, the less branched acetic acid reacts as both the preferred carbonyl and enolic component with untreated catalysts. Therefore, untreated catalysts promote selective formation of the symmetrical ketone, acetone, thereby decreasing the selectivity to the cross-ketone. After alkaline treatment, both the anatase form of titania and monoclinic form of zirconia increase the isobutyric acid participation as the carbonyl component. Acetic acid remains as the preferred enolic component with all treated catalysts, thus increasing the selectivity toward the cross-product in the ketonization of a mixture of carboxylic acids. The condition for achieving a high cross-selectivity by polarizing roles of the two reactants can be extended to other types of <b>cross-condensations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceCatalytic {{hydrogenation}} of cinnamaldehyde (CNA) {{was investigated}} over oxidic materials {{obtained by the}} calcination of Cu-Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. A series of precursors with different Cu/Mg ratios (with a constant M 2 +/Al 3 + ratio) were prepared by coprecipitation (under low supersaturation) and heated under reductive atmosphere until 623 K {{in order to avoid}} the formation of Cu-based spinels and to reduce the copper cations. The presence of Mg noticeably enhanced the selectivity of Cu-based catalysts with respect to the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group relative to the favoured hydrogenation of the C=C bond. Moreover, the self-condensation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCNA) and the <b>cross-condensation</b> of hydrocinnamaldehyde with cinnamaldehyde were also observed especially when the basic sites of LDH structures are preponderant over hydrogenation species. Finally, all that reaction from CNA are of great interest for getting information about: (i) basic sites involved in condensation of CNA and HCNA; and (ii) active species for selective hydrogenation of CNA to cinnamyl alcohol (CNOL) which seem in strong interaction with the first ones. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|For aldol {{condensation}} reactions, {{the balance between}} acid and basic sites has {{a significant impact on}} selectivites. In particular, {{it has been reported that}} for mixed {{aldol condensation}}s, the fine tuning of the acid- base properties allowed to improve the desired crosscondensation with respect to the unwanted self-condensation of the reactants. On the other hand, it has been previously shown that the progressive nitridation of oxide, namely the progressive substitution of oxygen by nitrogen, induces a decrease of surface acid properties and an increase of the catalysts basicity. We report here the liquid phase aldol condensation of benzaldehyde with heptanal over "AlGaPON" and "ZrPON" oxynitrides (precursors and nitrides samples). The main products are jasminaldehyde (fine chemical) (through <b>cross-condensation)</b> and 2 -pentyl- 2 -nonenal (via self-condensation), indicating that aldol processes effectively take place over such catalysts. Starting with a benzaldehyde / heptanal molar ratio equal to 5, the selectivity of jasminaldehyde increases and the selectivity of 2 -pentyl- 2 -nonenal decreases versus reaction time. We compare the activities of phosphate precursors and of several nitride phosphates and discuss the influence of nitridation on the initial activities and on the selectivities obtained at iso-conversion, in relation to the changes in the oxynitride acid-base properties induced by the substitution of oxygen by nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme 4 -oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4 -OT) from Pseudomonas putida mt- 2 takes {{part in a}} {{catabolic pathway}} for {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons, where it catalyzes the conversion of 2 hydroxyhexa- 2, 4 -dienedioate into 2 -oxohexa- 3 -enedioate. This tautomerase can also promiscuously catalyze carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, including various types of aldol reactions, by using its amino-terminal proline as a key catalytic residue. Here, we used systematic mutagenesis to identify two hotspots in 4 -OT (Met 45 and Phe 50) at which single mutations give marked improvements in aldolase activity for the self-condensation of propanal. Activity screening of a focused library in which these two hotspots were varied led {{to the discovery of}} a 4 -OT variant (M 45 Y/F 50 V) with strongly enhanced aldolase activity in the self-condensation of linear aliphatic aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde, propanal, and butanal, to yield α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. With both propanal and benzaldehyde, this double mutant, unlike the previously constructed single mutant F 50 A, mainly catalyzes the self-condensation of propanal rather than the <b>cross-condensation</b> of propanal and benzaldehyde, thus indicating that it indeed has altered substrate specificity. This variant could serve as a template to create new biocatalysts that lack dehydration activity and possess further enhanced aldolase activity, thus enabling the efficient enzymatic self-coupling of aliphatic aldehydes...|$|E
40|$|Synthesizing {{complex and}} large {{molecules}} out of small molecules derived by fermentation processes {{is a key}} factor for future processes based on renewable resources. Promising steps are the self-condensation of alcohols and the <b>cross-condensation</b> of alcohols with acetone. The presented continuous heterogeneous-catalytic gas-phase process {{makes it possible to}} condense small alcohols and ketones to larger hydrocarbon molecules containing only one atom of oxygen per molecule. After an optional oxygen-removing step such as hydrotreatment, fuel-identical hydrocarbons including jet fuel can be obtained. A tailor-made carbon chain distribution and additionally carbon-chain branching can be achieved. The choice of raw materials, the process conditions and the recycling of intermediate products are tuning factors. The crude or partially distilled product can be used neat as drop-in fuel for diesel. The intermediates – longer ketones, primary and secondary alcohols – also serve as value-added raw materials and intermediates for many chemical applications, i. e. plasticizers, surfactants, alkenes, solvents, fatty alcohols, and lubricants. The presented process offers an attractive alternative to other competing processes producing long-chain hydrocarbons, like Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreatment of fats and oils. Being based on inexpensive, long-term stable and commercially available catalysts and designed {{for a wide range of}} possible raw materials optionally stemming from residues, the suggested route is ready for scale-up.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this work}} is to design an {{alternative}} metal pre-treatment with improved corrosion resistance and low environmental impact. Hybrid silane pre-treatments with nano-additives and corrosion inhibitors as fillers for corrosion protection of low carbon steels using sol-gel processing technique were developed. Multifunctional silane molecules used to design the hybrid silane films were based on <b>cross-condensation</b> between an epoxy-silane, 3 -glycidoxy-propyl-trimethoxy-silane (GPTMS) and methyl-triethoxy-silane (MTES) in acid catalysis condition. The silane films thus developed on low carbon steel surface also showed good adhesion, verified by Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR). The corrosion resistance of the silane films modified with impregnation of corrosion inhibitors (i. e. rare earth salts) and/or silica nanoparticles was evaluated by electrochemical measurements using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corrosion studies were complimented by investigation of surface topography and wetting properties using scanning electron microscopy coupled with {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (SEM-EDX) and contact angle measurements, respectively. This work aided the identification of the synergistic effects of both additives in efficient retardation of corrosion kinetics of the low carbon steel. The direct addition of active lanthanum triflate species, was found to have detrimental effects effect on corrosion resistance of the steel. The investigation also included cerium and yttrium triflates, for activation of silica nanoparticles within hybrid silane network for corrosion protection of low carbon steel. The electrochemical investigations elucidate the superior corrosion resistance of cerium activated systems on low carbon steel, as compared to lanthanum and yttrium triflates. It is proposed that the cerium triflates within the silane films on coated steels, forms cerium oxides or hydroxides on cathodic and anodic regions as a result of increase in pH during corrosion, thus hindering further progression of the corrosion onset. Optimum concentration of the cerium activated systems for the best corrosion resistance of low carbon steel was also established in this study...|$|E

With the aim to find renewable materials easy to transform into acrolein, minimizing the investment on the existing plants, the oxidation of biosourced alcohols has been recently proposed. In this process, the oxidation of methanol and ethanol to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and the aldol-condensation and dehydration of the two aldehydes to acrolein, are carried out simultaneously, contrarily to most of research works published up to now. The acid-base properties of the solid catalysts play a key-role in the aldol condensation reactions. Basic sites are essential to increase the activity and selectivity of aldolisation reactions, but their strength plays also {{an important role in}} side reactions. The quantification of the acid/base sites concentration and strength on the surface of oxide catalysts is even more crucial when the reaction is carried out in presence of oxygen, thus leading to over-oxidation reactions.

Later, another synthetic ways based on propylene oxidation was applied and largely studied. More recently, due to the willing of diversifying the raw materials, the need to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions, {{and in order to}} optimize the supply of the reactants; new synthetic processes starting from renewable feedstock have been considered [1, 2]. With the aim to find renewable materials easy to transform into acrolein, minimizing the investment on the existing plants, the oxidation of biosourced alcohols is a promising way. In this process, the oxidation of methanol and ethanol to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and the aldol-condensation and dehydration of the two aldehydes to acrolein, are carried out simultaneously, contrarily to most of research works published up to now.

Finally, the catalytic reaction has been performed in presence of oxygen with the aim to verify how in oxidizing conditions the acid/base properties can impact the activity and selectivity towards acrolein. Mg-Si presented the best results (at 320 °C and 5000 h- 1 GHSV) with 29 % and 38 % of acrolein yield and selectivity, respectively, at a CO+CO 2 yield of 7 % (in the Figure). Good performances were obtained also for Na-Si catalyst with 25 % acrolein yield and 10 % CO+CO 2 yield. K-Si and Ca-Si showed the lower acrolein production; they promoted side oxidation reactions that transform acrolein (or reactants) into CO and CO 2, due to the presence of oxygen. At 5000 h- 1 GHSV and a temperature of 280 °C for K-Si and of 320 °C for Ca-Si, the CO+CO 2 yields were already higher than 10 mol%, thus limiting the possibility to further increase the reaction temperature to enhance acetaldehyde conversion and acrolein selectivity.
