5000|$|CAMRA takes makers like Brothers to task, {{defining}} {{perry and}} <b>pear</b> <b>cider</b> as quite different drinks, stating that [...] "pear cider" [...] as {{made by the}} large industrial cidermakers is merely a pear-flavoured drink, or more specifically a cider-style drink flavoured with pear concentrate, whereas [...] "perry" [...] should be made by traditional methods from perry pears only. (Brothers, Bulmers and other <b>pear</b> <b>ciders</b> are made from pear concentrate, often imported.) Others, including the industry trade National Association of Cider Makers, maintain that the terms perry and <b>pear</b> <b>cider</b> are interchangeable. Its own rules specify that perry or <b>pear</b> <b>cider</b> may contain no more than 25% apple juice.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{there were}} twelve gristmills and {{fourteen}} sawmills on Mahantango Creek and its tributaries.

5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "pear cider", instead of perry, {{is one of the reasons}} for a new {{commercial}} lease of life to a drink that was in decline; in two years sales of the drink increased from £3.4 million to £46 million. The brewers Brothers, Gaymers and Bulmers/Magners now all have their own brands of <b>pear</b> <b>cider,</b> and Tesco and other major supermarkets have increased the number of <b>pear</b> <b>ciders</b> that they sell. The term [...] "pear cider" [...] is seen by the manufacturers as being more marketeable to the younger 18-34 demographic and by differentiating their products from previous brands associated with the word perry, such as Babycham and Lambrini that are either associated with the female market or deemed out of fashion by the younger demographic.|$|R
50|$|Pears are {{consumed}} fresh, canned, as juice, and dried. The juice {{can also be}} used in jellies and jams, usually in combination with other fruits, including berries.

5000|$|During spring 2006, {{the company}} relaunched Bulmers Original in the UK, {{aimed at the}} [...] "served over ice" [...] market, which had grown in {{popularity}} {{over the past few}} years.

50|$|Most of the 2 Towns {{product line}} are {{varieties}} of traditional fermented apple cider, generally with an alcohol content between 6 and 7 percent.

50|$|As with <b>cider</b> apples, special <b>pear</b> cultivars {{are used}} to make Perry. Perry pears {{are thought to be}} descended from wild hybrids, known as wildings, between the {{cultivated}} pear Pyrus communis subsp. communis, brought to northern Europe by the Romans, and the now-rare wild pear Pyrus communis subsp. pyraster. Perry pears are higher in tannin and acid than eating or cooking pears, and are generally smaller.|$|R
50|$|A certain race of pears, {{with white}} {{down on the}} {{undersurface}} of their leaves, {{is supposed to have}} originated from P. nivalis, and their fruit is chiefly used in France in the manufacture of perry (see also <b>cider).</b> Other small-fruited <b>pears,</b> distinguished by their early ripening and apple-like fruit, may be referred to as P. cordata, a species found wild in western France and southwestern England. Pears have been cultivated in China for approximately 3000 years.|$|R
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{commercial}} perry {{has also been}} referred to as [...] "pear cider", but some organisations (such as CAMRA) do not accept this as a name for the traditional drink. The National Association of Cider Makers, on the other hand, disagrees, insisting that the terms perry and <b>pear</b> <b>cider</b> are interchangeable. [...] An over twenty-fold increase of sales of industrially manufactured [...] "pear cider" [...] produced from often imported concentrate makes the matter especially contentious.|$|R
50|$|Traditional perry {{making is}} broadly similar to {{traditional}} cider making, {{in that the}} fruit is picked, crushed, and pressed to extract the juice, which is then fermented using the wild yeasts found on the fruit's skin. The principal differences between perry and <b>cider</b> are that <b>pears</b> must be left for a critical period to mature after picking, and the pomace must be left to stand after initial crushing to lose tannins, a process analogous to wine maceration. After initial fermentation, the drink undergoes a secondary malolactic fermentation while maturing.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the spring}} of 2006 the company relaunched Bulmers Original in the UK, a premium {{packaged}} cider aimed at the [...] "served over ice" [...] market, which grew in popularity. Bulmers Original is a 4.5% ABV cider sold primarily in pint (568 ml) bottles, but also on draught, in 1 litre bottles and in a 500 ml can. In November 2007,the Bulmers range was joined by Bulmers <b>Pear</b> <b>cider,</b> and in Spring 2008 by Bulmers Light, with the same ABV as the Original but with 30% fewer calories. However, this was delisted a year later.|$|R
50|$|With hard cider sales on the {{increase}} in the American alcoholic beverage market, the production of perry has increased alongside, with many craft cideries making perries (typically called <b>pear</b> <b>cider</b> in the United States) alongside their apple ciders. As the craft beer and cider industries took off in the United States in the 1990s, a few players experimented with perries. One of the first commercially available domestic perries in the US was Ace Cider's Perry Cider, introduced in 1996. Today, even mass market brands, such as MillerCoors' Crispin Hard Cider Company and Boston Beer Company's Angry Orchard, are producing perries.|$|R
