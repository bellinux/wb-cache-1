40|$|Log-linear {{models are}} useful for {{analyzing}} <b>cross-classifications</b> of counts arising in sociology, {{but it has been}} argued that in some cases, an alternative approach for formulating models—one based on simultaneously modeling univariate marginal logits and marginal associations—can lead to models that are more directly relevant for addressing the kinds of questions arising in those cases. In this article, the authors explore some of the similarities and differences between the log-linear models approach to modeling categorical data and a marginal modeling appraoch. It has been noted in past literature that the model of statistical independence is conveniently represented within both approaches to specifying models for <b>cross-classifications</b> of counts. The authors examine further the extent to which the two families of models overlap, as well as some important differences. The authors do not present a complete characterization of the conditions describing the intersection of the two families of models but cover many of the models for bivariate contingency tables and for three-way contingency tables that are routinely used in sociological research...|$|R

40|$|Modern Business {{statistics}} often {{faces the}} difficulty that an increasing demand {{of information on}} sub-levels defined by regions or <b>cross-classifications</b> of variables such as industry classes and business size can be observed, eg for measures of competit-iveness by policy makers. In order to enable data producers to provide estimates on those sub-levels, sophisticated stratifications are implemented in the sampling design. These detailed stratifications may produce two difficulties. First, many strata con-tain only very few elements and, hence, {{make it difficult to}} derive optimal sample sizes. Second, statistical model building may suffer from the survey weights derived under these constraints. Additionally, optimization of sampling designs may have a strong impact on the accuracy of different estimation strategies. The aim of the pa-per is to evaluate different sampling designs in the context of estimation on sub-levels by regions and <b>cross-classifications</b> and their impact on these domain estimates. As estimators of interest, the Horvitz-Thompson- and generalized regression estimator as design-based methods as well as the Battese-Harter-Fuller-, the You-Rao-, and the augmented estimators are considered.

40|$|Wood, 1996) is {{a method}} that allows {{researchers}} to identify patterns (configurations) of variable categories that occur more often or less often than expected based on some chance model. In the years since 1995, CFA has developed at a rapid rate. Existing pro-grams, for instance the program published by Krauth (1993), even the recently pub-lished SAS CFA macro by Dunkl (1999), have not reflected these developments.

To briefly review CFA, consider a <b>cross-classification</b> of t variables. Each cell in this <b>cross-classification</b> is described by a profile of variable categories.

Also the approximate confidence interval for the proposed measure is given. Results: The proposed measure was applied and analyzed (1) for a 3 × 4 × 4 <b>cross-classification</b> data of dumping severity, hospital and operation which treat duodenal ulcer patients corresponding to removal of various amounts of the stomach and (2) for a 2 × 3 × 4 <b>cross-classification</b> data of experiment of animals (mouse and rat) on cancer (the tumor of leukemia and lymphoma) and tolazamide.

40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} {{of being able to}} classify records according to disclosure risk is well understood; Skinner and Holmes (1998), Fienberg and Makov (1998). One concept for so classifying records is called special uniqueness; see Elliot (2000), Elliot et al (2002), Manning and Haglin (2005). This paper describes SUDA (Special Uniques Detection Algorithm) which is both a set of computer science algorithms and indeed a fully functioning software system for detecting and grading special uniques. Section 1 describes the basic design principles behind the sequential SUDA algorithm. Section 2 describes the software (now in use at the UK Office for National Statistics and Australian Bureau of Statistics). Section 3 describes recent advances (i) in parallelising SUDA and improving the algorithm so that <b>cross-classifications</b> of up to 60 variables can be comprehensively analysed (ii) in developing a version of SUDA for Grid computing. ...|$|R
