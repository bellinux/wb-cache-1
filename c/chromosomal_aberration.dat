40|$|Abstract: Background. Frequent b-catenin {{mutations}} {{have been}} detected in juvenile angiofibromas, but the tumor pathoge-nesis remains unknown. Methods. Metaphase-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to identify <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> in 29 tu-mor specimens. Two tumors were investigated using genome DNA microarrays. Results. Three hundred eleven chromosomal gains and losses were detected by metaphase-CGH. Frequent chromo-somal gains were detected at 4 q, 6, 12, and X, while frequent chromosomal losses affected regions of chromosomes 8, 16, 17, 22, and Y. Genome DNA microarray analysis in 2 tumors of the series confirmed <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations,</b> detected by metaphase-CGH, and indicated genes such as AURKA (20 q 13. 2) not being recognized by metaphase-CGH.

50|$|Veldman et al. (2002) {{discussed}} the differentiation between Fryns syndrome and Pallister-Killian syndrome, noting that differentiation {{is important to}} genetic counseling because Fryns syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder and Pallister-Killian syndrome is usually a sporadic <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration.</b> However, discrimination may be difficult due to the phenotypic similarity. In fact, in some infants with 'coarse face,' acral hypoplasia, and internal anomalies, the initial diagnosis of Fryns syndrome had to be changed because mosaicism of isochromosome 12p was detected in fibroblast cultures or kidney tissue. Although congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a common finding in both syndromes, bilateral congenital diaphragmatic hernia had been reported only in patients with Fryns syndrome until {{the report of the}} patient with Pallister-Killian syndrome by Veldman et al.

5000|$|Chromosome 15q partial {{deletion}} {{is a rare}} human genetic disorder, {{caused by}} a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> in which the long ("q") arm of one copy of chromosome 15 is deleted, or partially deleted. Like other chromosomal disorders, this {{increases the risk of}} birth defects, developmental delay and learning difficulties, however, the problems that can develop depend very much on what genetic material is missing. If the mother's copy of the chromosomal region 15q11-13 is deleted, Angelman syndrome (AS) can results. The sister syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) can result if the father's copy of the chromosomal region 15q11-13 is deleted. [...] The smallest observed region that can result in these syndromes when deleted is therefore called the PWS/AS critical region. In addition to deletions, uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 also gives rise to the same genetic disorders, indicating that genomic imprinting must occur in this region.|$|E
50|$|A {{micronucleus}} is the erratic (third) nucleus that {{is formed}} during the anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Micronuclei (the name means 'small nucleus') are cytoplasmic bodies having {{a portion of}} acentric chromosome or whole chromosome which was not carried to the opposite poles during the anaphase. Their formation results in the daughter cell lacking a part or all of a chromosome. These chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes normally develop nuclear membranes and form as micronuclei as a third nucleus. After cytokinesis, one daughter cell ends up with one nucleus and the other ends up with one large and one small nucleus, i.e., micronuclei. There is a chance {{of more than one}} micronucleus forming when more genetic damage has happened.The micronucleus test is used as a tool for genotoxicity assessment of various chemicals. It is easier to conduct than the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> test in terms of procedures and evaluation. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes targeted to the centromere region, it can be determined if a whole chromosome, or only a fragment is lost.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> {{frequency}} in peripheral lymphocytes of healthy individuals {{has been found}} to be pre-dictive of future cancer risk. The variability of chromosomal aberrations over time, which is largely unknown, should be clarified to interpret the strength of this association and to determine its use in cancer prediction. Intra- and interindividual variability in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency was therefore determined. From a pooled database comprising 11 national cohorts (1965 – 2002), the authors included 9, 433 blood samples from 3, 550 subjects with at least one repeated <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> measurement. The generalized concordance correlation coefficient of 0. 19 was low, indicating high intraindividual variability compared with interindividual variability, resulting in a high likelihood of misclassification. The relation between <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency and future cancer risk has probably been underestimated in previous studies. A single <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> measurement seems not to be representative of the whole lifespan level of chromosome instability and greatly limits the use of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency—as measured with Giemsa staining—for individual risk assessment. chromosome aberrations; neoplasms; repeated measurements; risk assessment; variability Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; qCCC, generalized concordance correlation coefficient. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>aberration</b> {{frequency in}} peripheral lym-phocytes (shown by Giemsa staining and scored accordin...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{effects of}} microwave and chromium trioxide (CrO 3) on Vicia faba root tip were studied.

Purpose: To quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the changes in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> during early cleavage in mouse embryos derived from γ-irradiated spermatozoa. Materials and methods: Mature males were exposed to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy of ^ Cs γ-rays, and their spermatozoa were used to produce embryos via in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The metaphase chromosomes were prepared from one-cell, two-cell, and four-cell embryos. In the chromosome preparations from two-cell and four-cell embryos, the separation of the sister blastomeres was precluded by treatment of the embryos with concanavalin A. The incidence of embryos with structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations,</b> aneuploidy, or mosaicism was estimated. The fates of the different types of γ-ray-induced structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> were also investigated in those embryos. Results: The exposure of spermatozoa to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy γ-rays caused structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> in 25. 9 % and 35. 7 % of the resultant one-cell embryos, respectively. At two-cell embryonic stage, the incidence of structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> was 17. 4 % in the 2 [*]Gy group and 27. 1 % in the 4 [*]Gy group. At the four-cell embryonic stage, although the incidence of control embryos with structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> was considerably high, the net incidence of embryos with radiation-induced structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> was similar to that at the one-cell stage. The incidence of aneuploidy was high in two-cell and four-cell embryos after both doses of γ-rays. The incidence of mosaicism increased significantly in dose- and embryonic-stage-dependent manners. Anaphase lag, and the degeneration and non-disjunction of the aberrant chromosomes were frequently observed in aneuploid and mosaic embryos. Conclusions: Mouse sperm DNA is highly vulnerable to γ-rays. The structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>aberrations</b> of sperm origin are unstable in their behaviour and structure during cleavage, and therefore cause secondary aneuploidy and mosaicism in the early cleavage embryos...|$|R
