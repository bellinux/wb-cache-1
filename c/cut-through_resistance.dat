40|$|Fiber Tape {{has been}} {{designed}} to provide increased tissue <b>cut-through</b> <b>resistance</b> to prevent cuff repair failure. We hypothesize that this increased friction results in the FiberTape dragging the tendon laterally and adversely affecting tendon-footprint contact. Our aim was to compare our standard FiberTape repairs with a modified technique. In 5 cadavers, supraspinatus repairs using our standard technique was compared with a modification where the tendon was cinched down. The FiberTape tendon interface on the bursal side was marked and length of redundant FiberTape that was pulled through from the undersurface of the repair measured. The length of redundant Fiber-Tape pulled through from the medial row for each suture after cinching was on average 6. 1 mm (range, 3 to 10 mm). We also observed better approximation of cuff to footprint using our modified technique by comparing the undersurface of the repair in 2 specimens. Redundant suture material on the undersurface of medial row equates to poorer tendon to bone contact and the presence of fluid in the healing zone. Optimal contact area and pressures are necessary to maximize tendon healing. Improved tendon to bone contact can be achieved by cinching the medial row when FiberTape is used in a suture bridge technique. 5 page(s...|$|E
