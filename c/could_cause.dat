5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E

Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> only momentary disturbances in the area.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E
5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across as less than a neutral presentation.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution. The argument was reinforced by Germanophile explorer Sven Hedin in Berlin two weeks later. General Staff memoranda in the last weeks of August confirmed the perceived feasibility of the plan, predicting that an invasion by Afghanistan <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> a revolution in India.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative <b>could</b> <b>cause</b> or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link.
