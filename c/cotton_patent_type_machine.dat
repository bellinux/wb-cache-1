5000|$|The {{technology}} {{involved in}} this case concerned the manufacture of glass containers—notably, the [...] "gob feeder" [...] machinery for manufacturing jars, bottles, and other glass containers. The gob feed <b>type</b> of <b>machine</b> automatically makes glass containers by dropping a gob of molten glass through a hole into molds in a forming machine, {{the size and shape of}} the glass delivered being controlled by a mechanism known as a feeder machine; the feeder and the forming machine together constitute one fully automatic unit. At the time of the suit, Hartford-Empire Company owned or controlled all of the gob feeding patents in the glass container industry, and its business was the exploitation of these <b>patents.</b> Another <b>type</b> of <b>machine</b> is known as the [...] "suction" [...] machine, and it automatically sucks molten glass into a mold for blowing bottles.|$|R

Using a proxy for inventive step as the predictor of the correct decision, {{we estimate}} that 6. 1 and 9. 8 per cent of patents are, respectively, incorrectly rejected and incorrectly granted. We find evidence that patent offices {{are less likely to}} make Type I and Type II errors the longer the duration of examination and the greater is the applicant’s experience with submitting applications...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} {{the level of}} inflammation markers and their relation to endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in <b>patents</b> with <b>type</b> 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular form of diabetic autonomous neuropathy. Materials and methods. A total of 87 patients aged 45 - 66 years were examined for blood insulin level, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), CRP, and anti-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL- 1 -beta, IL- 6) levels. Endothelial dysfunction was estimated based on quantitative Willebrand factor assay. Vegetative disorders were detected from reflex cardiovascular ECG data. Results. The development of cardiovascular form of diabetic autonomous neuropathy in <b>patents</b> with <b>type</b> 2 diabetes depended on diabetes duration, quality of carbohydrate metabolism compensation, levels of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Mean levels of Willebrand factors and inflammation markers in <b>patents</b> with <b>type</b> 2 diabetes and overt vegetative dysfunction {{were significantly higher than}} in diabetic patients without autonomous neuropathy. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation of CRP and IL- 6 levels with results of standard ECG tests. Conclusion. Results of the study demonstrate chronic inflammation in <b>patents</b> with <b>type</b> 2 diabetes and cardiovascular form of diabetic autonomous neuropathy. Increased level of inflammation markers and its relation to severity of vegetative disorders and endothelial dysfunction confirm the role of inflammation in pathogenesis of nervous co-morbidity in <b>patents</b> with <b>type</b> 2 diabetes...|$|R
