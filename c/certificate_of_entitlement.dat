25|$|As Singapore is a {{small island}} with a high {{population}} density, the number of private {{cars on the road}} is restricted so as to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle's market value, and bid for a Singaporean <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade.

25|$|Several steps {{have to be}} {{completed}} before a car-owner can drive a vehicle in Singapore. A <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> (COE) is required, costing more than S$80,000 to successful bidders. This permits ownership of the vehicle {{for a period of}} 10 years after which the vehicle must be scrapped or another COE paid for allowing an additional 5 or 10 years of usage. COE is technically a lease at an inflated cost. Only ten-year COEs may be further renewed to another 7-10 years and no extension of the car is given. Historic vehicles are exempted from these requirements.|$|E

The <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> (COEs) necessary to purchase new cars were initially transferable for all quota categories.

50|$|In {{corporate}} law, a {{stock certificate}} (also known as <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> stock or share certificate) {{is a legal}} document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect {{the transfer of the}} shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a stock exchange. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share <b>certificate</b> as proof <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and the <b>certificate</b> is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue <b>of</b> paper stock <b>certificates</b> may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a holding statement in lieu <b>of</b> a share <b>certificate</b> for each parcel of shares owned.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conception of}} “sites of entitlement” {{as a basis for}} better understanding how infrastructure and services are perceived and experienced in informal settlements. While legal and policy frameworks are often viewed as the source <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> to infrastructure and services, the complexity of provision, access and negotiation in informal settlements demands a conception <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> that exceeds those domains. Based on ethnographic research on sanitation and water in informal settlements in Mumbai, we focus on the ways in which people’s everyday experiences, interactions and practices constitute sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> These sites are unevenly produced, contested, often in flux and ambivalent, sometimes made through collective struggle and at other times through quiet individual practice, and always constituted by social relations. Sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> emerge in close relation to moral economies, and are characterized by often profound and – for research, policy and practice – challenging levels of spatial and temporal variation. We argue that sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are vital for thinking through the possibilities of realizing the universal right to sanitation and wate...|$|R
40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} {{the concept of an}} inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> the modern term for a concept that {{can be traced back to}} Plato in 360 BCE (Before Christian Era). Although the concept is advanced and examined in philosophical terms, Plato’s work is also considered to be one of the first and most comprehensive psychological theories of human motivation. A sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is frequently referred to in contemporary literature, and yet there has been a lack of investigations into the nature <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and how it operates in violent men. This investigation set out to rectify the deficiency by examining the concept through four studies. The global purpose of this thesis is to determine if an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related to both violent offending and self-harming behaviour. The first study was designed to refine a definition of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for violent offenders and to determine if there was a qualitative difference in this characteristic between violent offenders and male members of the general public. The study examined twelve domains used to describe an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> It also identified two main themes which were an action theme and an experiential theme. The action theme included actions that were likely to be elicited when an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated. These actions were assault, confrontation and rejection of others. This was particularly so when the domains of anger, respect, power, obedience from subordinates and obedience from family and friends were violated. The experiential theme included emotions and cognition and whether these were expressed in an outward direction towards others or inwardly towards the self. The second study was conducted on archival material from a prison database. It examined the self-harming behaviour of offenders currently incarcerated in Western Australia (WA). This study was conducted to test the assumption that violent offenders are more likely to self-harm than non-violent offenders, using a current cohort. It was revealed that violent offenders self-harm at a far higher rate than incarcerated nonviolent offenders. Of the self-harming offenders, nine out of ten were violent offenders. It was also found that violent offenders were far less likely to have warnings of potential self-harm on the prison database than non-violent offenders. The third study involved the construction and validation of the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) on a student population. The purpose of this study was to enable the measurement of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men. The action themes and the domains from the first study formed the basis of the questions. This scale had sound psychometric properties and revealed two statistical factors indicating both attitude and behaviour subscales. Further investigations found differences in levels of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in terms <b>of</b> age and sex. The fourth study was the administration of the SOEQ to violent and non-violent, as well as self-harming and non-self harming, incarcerated offenders. This was to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men as well as to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in self-harming offenders. It was found that violent men have an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in both attitude and behaviour. If their inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated then violence was most likely their first choice. This was particularly likely when the respect, power, forgiveness and anger domains were involved. When examining self-harming behaviour and entitlement, this study found a difference in attitude only. This body of work demonstrated that an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related both to violent offending and self-harming behaviour. Through these investigations different aspects of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> were identified, which included a strong desire for respect, power, admiration and status, as well as a profound aversion to feelings of shame, disrespect and humiliation. A violation of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has the capacity to end in violent behaviour towards others and harm towards the self. These findings show how an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> meets two <b>of</b> the three criteria required to qualify as a criminogenic need: that is, that the characteristic has the ability to distinguish non-criminal from criminal behaviour and has the ability to be measured. This opens the way for further research to investigate the third criterion required to qualify for a criminogenic need, which is whether an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can be changed...|$|R
