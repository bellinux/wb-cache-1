5000|$|On May 22, 1854, the Portland {{city council}} passed an {{ordinance}} establishing the Portland Fire Department. [...] H. W. Davis was elected {{as the first}} [...] "chief engineer" [...] (or chief) and was reelected to the position in 1855 and 1856. [...] In 1857, businessman S. J. McCormick was elected chief. A reorganization of the department in 1857 brought the Willamette Company no. 1, the Multnomah Engine Company no. 2 (which had been formed in 1856) and Vigilance Hook and Ladder Company no. 1 into the Portland Fire Department, which thereupon had a total of 157 members (volunteer firefighters). [...] Another reorganization in 1859 added the <b>Columbia</b> <b>Engine</b> Company no. 3 to the department; {{it was the first}} engine company in Portland to use horses. [...] As the city's population grew, additional fire companies were organized, including the Protection Engine Company no. 4, in 1862; the Tiger Company no. 5, in 1873; and the Couch Engine Company no. 6, in 1880.|$|E

5000|$|A {{train wreck}} {{occurred}} on the Ken Lockwood Gorge trestle on April 18, 1885. An iron ore train led by the coincidentally named <b>Columbia</b> <b>Engine</b> derailed on the trestle and crashed into the river below. Iron Mine Railroads of Northern New Jersey, by Larry Lowenthal, indicates this was engine 112 and does not indicate it had a name. A contemporary account of the wreck in the Iron Era newspaper [...] does not cite a name, only the engine number. If the locomotive had a name it's probable {{it would have been}} mentioned in those days. The trail is, instead, most likely named for the Columbia Gas Pipeline. [...] Minutes of meetings in Hunterdon Parks indicate that Hunterdon suggested the name [...] "Columbia Trail", much to the satisfaction of the gas company. Recent oppositions to gas utilities, and their relationship to hydraulic fracturing (aka [...] "Fracking") have spurred public outcry to rename the route [...] "High Bridge Branch Trail", a more historically accurate and less controversial tag. Furthermore, it may be considered a conflict of interest for a government agency to promote a private industry such as Columbia Gas in name and associated publications (tax payer funded maps, guides, interpretive signage, etc.).|$|E

Ground testing at both rated and full power levels involving four engines and eight certification test cycles totalling more than 40, 000 seconds of hot-fire testing, which qualified both <b>Columbia's</b> and Challenger's <b>engines</b> for flight, are discussed. Ground checkout and flight performance of <b>Columbia's</b> and Challenger's <b>engines</b> are revealed. Future plans for the Space Shuttle Main Engine are outlined including flight certification testing to verify a life of 40 flights and 20, 000 seconds operation before overhaul...|$|R

5000|$|The {{construction}} of Bradwood Landing would require disruption of important salmon habitat, {{and is in}} an area where the Chinook salmon and Coho salmon populations have been designated as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The project calls for dredging of 700,000 cubic yards of material from the <b>Columbia</b> River [...] <b>Engines</b> expelling hot water are another issue as cold water is crucial to the salmon. Natural gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but much of that benefit is lost when the gas in imported. LNG has as much as 30 percent higher greenhouse gas impact than domestic natural gas [...] The State of Oregon’s analysis found imported LNG to be equivalent to coal for greenhouse gas emissions. The {{construction of}} an affiliated 220 mi natural gas pipeline raises additional environmental concerns.|$|R
40|$|A Space Shuttle <b>Columbia</b> main <b>engine</b> {{controller}} 14 AWG wire {{short circuited}} during {{the launch of}} STS- 93. Post-flight examination divulged that the wire had electrically arced against {{the head of a}} nearby bolt. More extensive inspection revealed additional damage to the subject wire, and to other wires as well from the mid-body of Columbia. The shorted wire was to have been constructed from nickel-plated copper conductors surrounded by the polyimide insulation Kapton, top-coated with an aromatic polyimide resin. The wires were analyzed via scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on the polyimide. Exemplar testing under laboratory conditions was performed to replicate the mechanical damage characteristics evident on the failed wires. The exemplar testing included a step test, where, as the name implies, a person stepped on a simulated wire bundle that rested upon a bolt head. Likewise, a shear test that forced a bolt head and a torque tip against a wire was performed to attempt to damage the insulation and conductor. Additionally, a vibration test was performed to determine if a wire bundle would abrade when vibrated against the head of a bolt. Also, an abrasion test was undertaken to determine if the polyimide of the wire could be damaged by rubbing against convolex helical tubing. Finally, an impact test was performed to ascertain if the use of the tubing would protect the wire from the strike of a foreign object...|$|R
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} Columbia in 1975 at Rockwell International's (formerly North American Aviation/North American Rockwell) {{principal}} assembly facility in Palmdale, California, {{a suburb of}} Los Angeles. Columbia was named after the American sloop Columbia Rediviva which, from 1787 to 1793, {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Gray, explored the US Pacific Northwest and became the first American vessel to circumnavigate the globe. It is also named after the Command Module of Apollo 11, the first manned landing on another celestial body. Columbia was also the female symbol of the United States. [...] After construction, the orbiter arrived at Kennedy Space Center on March 25, 1979, to prepare for its first launch. [...] Columbia was originally scheduled to lift off in late 1979, however the launch date was delayed by problems with both the SSME components, as well as the thermal protection system (TPS). [...] On March 19, 1981, during preparations for a ground test, workers were asphyxiated while working in <b>Columbia's</b> nitrogen-purged aft <b>engine</b> compartment, resulting in (variously reported) two or three fatalities.|$|R
50|$|The last flying {{example of}} a C.IV is a C.IVa with a Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine, {{preserved}} at the Owls Head Transportation Museum in Owls Head, Maine. It was used in a trans-Pacific attempt in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Pilots Bob Wark and Eddie Brown took out {{the seats in the}} passenger compartment and installed a large fuel tank. They also put a small cockpit {{just in front of the}} vertical stabilizer with a hand-powered fuel pump inside. In flight, the crew member sitting there would transfer fuel to the main tank in the wing, where it would be fed by gravity into the engine. In this trans-Pacific attempt they planned not to go straight across the Pacific but up the West Coast of North America to Alaska and down the chain of Aleutian Islands, proceeding down the Chinese coast to Tokyo. They took off from Tacoma, Washington and started to head north, but made it only about 100 miles of the way to Vancouver, British <b>Columbia</b> when the <b>engine</b> vapor locked and forced a landing in a field. They had to dump most of their fuel to bring down the weight in order to take off from the field. When they got back in the air, they started heading for nearby Ladner Field, Vancouver to top off the tanks, but they crashed upon landing and decided to give up. They loaded the C.IV onto a Ford AA flatbed truck and brought it back to Washington State. It ended up in Ephrata, Washington, where it was kept outdoors and was eventually badly burned in a grass fire. It sat until 1970, when one of the museum's trustees found it and restored it and donated it to the museum. It flies to this very day.|$|R
