25|$|In its May 1971 issue, Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{published a}} comparison road test {{that included a}} Caprice Coupe and a Cadillac Sedan de Ville. The tested Caprice was powered by the 454 V8 and loaded with virtually all available options. Though testers noted that the Cadillac had {{a higher level of}} quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was upholstered in leather while the Caprice had the standard <b>cloth</b> <b>trim),</b> the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac's $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest quality addition and a few more luxury features.|$|E

Total production of 3,508 cars ended in July 1976 with a Medium Saddle Metallic model delivered to a Cleveland, Ohio dealer. 190,321 Vega hatchback coupes were produced in the same period.|$|E

She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect." ...|$|R

The lion consists of a head which is traditionally constructed using papier-mâché over a bamboo frame covered with gauze, then painted and decorated, and a body made of durable layered <b>cloth</b> <b>trimmed</b> with fur. Newer lions however may be made with modern materials such as aluminium instead of bamboo and are lighter. Newer versions may also apply shinier modern material over the traditional lacquer such as sequin or laser sticker but they do not last as long as those with semi-dull lacquer.|$|R

60|$|In {{spite of}} all such cautions, she was too happy {{to take in the}} notion of anxiety. She rose early in the morning, caring {{for the first time to}} array herself in the {{insignia}} of her new rank. Knowing that the bridle-path lay through parks, woodlands and heaths, so that there was no fear of dust, she put on a dainty habit of white <b>cloth,</b> <b>trimmed</b> and faced with blue velvet, and a low-crowned hat with a white feather. On her pretty grey horse, the young Madam Belamour was a fair and gracious sight, as she rode into the yard of the Red Lion at Brentford. Harriet was at the window watching for her, and Mr. Arden received her as she sprang off her steed, then led her up to the parlour, where breakfast was spread awaiting her.|$|R
50|$|The 1976 Cougar entered {{its last}} year largely {{unchanged}} from 1975. Minor trim pieces served to differentiate {{this year from}} last. Engines continued unchanged, as well.

50|$|In 1408, {{the town}} was granted Magdeburg Rights by Vytautas the Great and became a centre of Kaunas Powiat in Trakai Voivodeship in 1413. Vytautas ceded Kaunas the right to own the scales used for {{weighing}} the goods brought to the city or packed on site, wax processing, and woolen <b>cloth</b> <b>trimming</b> facilities. The power of the self-governing Kaunas was shared by three interrelated major institutions: vaitas (the Mayor), the Magistrate (12 lay judges and 4 burgomasters) and the so-called Benchers' Court (12 persons). Kaunas then began to gain prominence, since it was at an intersection of trade routes and a river port. In 1441 Kaunas joined the Hanseatic League, and Hansa merchant office Kontor was opened — {{the only one in}} the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the 16th century, Kaunas also had a public school and a hospital and was one of the best-formed towns in the whole country.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was an air}} {{of culture}} about his room that always cowed me, {{and that made me}} {{constrained}} even on this occasion. The table under the window was littered with photographic material and the later albums of his continental souvenirs, and on the American <b>cloth</b> <b>trimmed</b> shelves that filled the recesses {{on either side of the}} fireplace were what I used to think in those days a quite incredible number of books--perhaps eight hundred altogether, including the reverend gentleman's photograph albums and college and school text-books. This suggestion of learning was enforced by the little wooden shield bearing a college coat-of-arms that hung over the looking-glass, and by a photograph of Mr. Gabbitas in cap and gown in an Oxford frame that adorned the opposite wall. And in the middle of that wall stood his writing-desk, which I knew to have pigeon-holes when it was open, and which made him seem not merely cultured but literary. At that he wrote sermons, composing them himself! ...|$|R
50|$|According to the May 1984 brochure, the coupe added: alloy wheels, mudflaps, {{electric}} windows/mirrors/antenna, a six speaker {{sound system}} (over four), time delay interior lighting, variable intermittent wipers, an armrest, carpet kickpads, and <b>cloth</b> headlining/sunvisors/door <b>trims</b> (over vinyl). An option pack for the coupe added air conditioning, power steering, and power sunroof. The hatchback's option pack added air conditioning, power steering, and power sunroof.|$|R
50|$|VJ Charger Sportsman (option A23)In August 1974, {{a limited}} edition Charger Sportsman was released, {{based upon the}} Charger XL.

60|$|Among these merry folk {{might have}} been seen a young lady {{of two or three}} and twenty years of age, dressed in a coat of dark green <b>cloth</b> <b>trimmed</b> with fur, and {{close-fitting}} at the waist. This coat opened in front, showing a broidered woollen skirt, but over the bust it was tightly buttoned and surmounted by a stiff ruff of Brussels lace. Upon her head she wore a high-crowned beaver hat, to which the nodding ostrich feather was fastened by a jewelled ornament of sufficient value to show that she was a person of some means. In fact, this lady was the only child of a sea captain and shipowner named Carolus van Hout, who, whilst still a middle-aged man, had died about a year before, leaving her heiress to a very considerable fortune. This circumstance, with the added advantages of a very pretty face, in which were set two deep and thoughtful grey eyes, and a figure more graceful than was common among the Netherlander women, caused Lysbeth van Hout to be much sought after and admired, especially by the marriageable bachelors of Leyden.|$|R

Our fatigue dress consists of a dark green <b>cloth</b> jacket, <b>trimmed</b> with gold lace, green cap and black pants." ...|$|R
