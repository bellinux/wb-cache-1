The ability of the Pilates device to restrict movement in adverse directions and thereby, reduce potential injuries during exercise was also assessed. The results of the experiments showed that Pilates, while good for endurance training, resulted in only minimal muscle activity in core muscles (abdominal and paraspinal muscles) compared to exercise on <b>commercial</b> <b>weight</b> lifting equipment.

The theoretical part is focused on problems of weight reduction methods. This is further divided into weight reduction in training and using <b>commercial</b> <b>weight</b> reduction fabrics. Weight reduction trainings are organized by many companies all over the Czech Republic. Training leading specialists arrange them as individual or collective according to customers needs. The actual content of the trainings is always dependent on lector leading the training. <b>Commercial</b> <b>weight</b> reduction fabrics can be divided into three groups: tee, pills and drinks. All these fabrics are declared to have weight reduction effects by their producer. The next part of the work is focused on obesity as it is and on bariatrics. Obesity therapy includes low energetic diet with food fat restriction, motion activity (with prevailing aerobic character), cognitive [...] behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy or surgical intervention in individual cases. The methodology part contains evaluation of a series of surveys. Their Data were collected by a standardized questionnaire for two groups of respondents.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{management}} of accountability and identity in an online <b>commercial</b> <b>weight</b> loss group. The <b>commercial</b> <b>weight</b> loss context is socially significant {{because it is a}} space which foregrounds women's efforts to control their bodies and behaviour in order to conform to culturally prescribed norms of 'femininity' through continued selfsurveillance and restriction of consumption. The analysis examines 2219 individual posts in 422 message threads over a 24 hour period on a message board on the Weight Watchers website. The site explicitly promotes itself as a space in which members can obtain advice and emotional support from fellow dieters in an encouraging and egalitarian environment, and is therefore intended to be used as an aid to becoming a more successful 'weight watcher' (and consequently a 'better woman'). Using a feminist hybrid discourse analytic method, and drawing on Coffman's notion of 'face', the empirical chapters explore the interactional management of progress reports by group members. The <b>commercial</b> <b>weight</b> loss group provides a space in which the confession of transgression is encouraged, and analysis of the message threads reveals that members of the message board community are accountable to both societal gender norms and to their fellow weight watchers. In these confessional exchanges group members realign themselves with social norms of 'femininity', and renew their commitment to the body modification project. Group members employ face-protective mitigation strategies in their delivery of confessions, and responses to confessional posts orient to group norms of solidarity and support while rehabilitating the transgressing members back into the eating regime. The analysis also explores the use of humour {{in the construction of the}} confessional message which, despite its potential to undermine the regime, appears to perform a face-management function, and is used to display 'expertise' about the regime while fostering group solidarity. In message threads where group members report 'inexplicable' failure to lose weight, the group work to maintain commitment to the regime by explaining lack of success in ways which are protective of the reputation of the regime as an effective means of losing weight, thus ensuring continued dedication to the body modification project. The community offers solutions which provide the member with new 'expertise', helping her to become a 'better weight watcher'...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Internet {{provides}} a widely accessible platform {{for weight loss}} interventions. Automated tools can allow self-guided monitoring of food intake and other target behaviours that are established correlates of weight change. Many programmes also offer social support from the virtual community.

Methods This paper describes a retrospective analysis of weight change among 3621 subscribers to a <b>commercial</b> Internet-based <b>weight</b> loss programme. Participants were all subscribers (2979 women; 642 men) joining the programme between July 2005 and November 2008 with two or more recorded weights spanning at least 28 days of participation in the programme. Engagement was indexed with frequency of using online diet and exercise diaries and with use of the social support forums. Results Programme engagement was associated with weight loss in both men and women after controlling for initial BMI and duration of participation.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>weights,</b> which {{developed}} {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century (Hultsch 1862; Pernice 1894), is most of the time not taken in account in economic archaeology, although recent research has shown that these instrumenta are fundamental to understanding the functioning of both Classical and Hellenistic economies. 20 th century archaeological excavations have brought to light many weights, which have been more or less comprehensively published, but which have rarely been studied as a series—with some exceptions, such as the weights from the Athenian Agora (Lang 1964) or from Olympia (Hitzl 1996). Nowadays, more than 2, 000 weights are registered in Greece and around 7, 500 in Turkey, half of them from public and private collections, half of them from archaeological excavations; many weights remain unpublished. Dispersed objects, disparate information and imprecise data together constitute a major obstacle to a comprehensive approach. The creation of an open access database is intended to fill a gap in the collection, standardization, and processing of these archaeological data. The MySQL tool ([URL] makes it possible to encode precise data in a dozen complex fields (denomination, place of origin, place of provenance, place of conservation, dating, archaeological description, inscriptions, metrological analysis, bibliography, and photography), to search for information in various ways, and finally to create distribution graphs and maps.
