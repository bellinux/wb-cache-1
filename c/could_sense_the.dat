500|$|Ken Williams {{had wanted}} Roberta {{to work on}} a Phantasmagoria sequel {{immediately}} after the success of the first game, but she could not do so due to her obligations to King's Quest VIII. Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because gamers <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> absence of Roberta's style. [...] "It's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten. Within a few pages, the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed, regardless {{of the quality of the}} work." [...] Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after A Puzzle of Flesh because of issues after Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996. Distribution was handled by Davidson & Associates, another CUC company, which primarily sold educational software. Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in Phantasmagoria and did not attempt sell the sequel aggressively as Sierra would have. He also claimed Jan Davidson, the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson, personally did not like the game and [...] "wanted it shut down". Due to these sales challenges, Williams said [...] "there was no reason to make a third Phantasmagoria".|$|E
60|$|He chewed his lip. One <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> {{struggle}} {{going on}} within. And then suddenly {{a sort of}} glow came into his face. The old martyrs probably used to look like that.|$|E
60|$|Hard {{times were}} already in the neighborhood, where lived the {{families}} of the shopmen who had gone out on strike. Among the small storekeepers, Saxon, {{in the course of the}} daily marketing, <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> air of despondency. Light and geniality seemed to have vanished. Gloom pervaded everywhere. The mothers of the children that played in the streets showed the gloom plainly in their faces. When they gossiped in the evenings, over front gates and on door stoops, their voices were subdued and less of laughter rang out.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual {{keyboard}} sensors: {{by attaching}} miniature remotes on each fingernail, accelerometers <b>could</b> then <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> orientation and motion of each fingertip, and communicate this data {{to a computer}} in a wristwatch.|$|R

5000|$|Vyking had {{the ability}} to redirect/reroute energy attacks, albeit he never perfected this skill. He could also detect other lifeforms and their {{specific}} states, a process he called [...] "imaging". Initially, he <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> only those who had undergone the Morituri process. However, later he <b>could</b> also <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> Hordians, possibly because he had been familiarized with them after fighting them repeatedly and/or because of the natural development of his abilities. As a by-product of the Morituri process, like all Morituri, he also possessed enhanced strength and resilience.|$|R
60|$|After {{that they}} went more cautiously, and {{when they reached the}} part of the trail where the sentry might be {{expected}} to be found, Barbara warned Billy of the fact. Like two thieves they crept along {{in the shadow of the}} canyon wall. Inwardly Billy cursed the darkness of the night which hid from view everything more than a few paces from them; yet it may have been this very darkness which saved them, since it hid them as effectually from an enemy as it hid the enemy from them. They had reached the point where Barbara was positive the sentry should be. The girl was clinging tightly to Billy's left arm. He could feel the pressure of her fingers as they sunk into his muscles, sending little tremors and thrills through his giant frame. Even in the face of death Billy Byrne <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> ecstasies of personal contact with this girl--the only woman he ever had loved or ever would.|$|E
6000|$|As Jean rose to {{his knee}} and {{carefully}} lifted his rifle round to avoid the twigs of a juniper he suddenly experienced another emotion besides the one of grim, hard wrath at the Jorths. It was an emotion that sickened him, made him weak internally, a cold, shaking, ungovernable sensation. Suppose this man was Ellen Jorth's father! Jean lowered the rifle. He felt it shake over his knee. He was trembling all over. The astounding discovery {{that he did not}} want to kill Ellen's father--that he could not do it--awakened Jean to the despairing nature of his love for her. In this grim moment of indecision, when he knew his Indian subtlety and ability gave him a great advantage over the Jorths, he fully realized his strange, hopeless, and irresistible love for the girl. He made no attempt to deny it any longer. Like the night and the lonely wilderness around him, like the inevitableness of this Jorth-Isbel feud, this love of his was a thing, a fact, a reality. He breathed to his own inward ear, to his soul--he could not kill Ellen Jorth's father. Feud or no feud, Isbel or not, he could not deliberately do it. And why not? There was no answer. Was he not faithless to his father? He had no hope of ever winning Ellen Jorth. He did not want the love of a girl of her character. But he loved her. And his struggle must be against the insidious and mysterious growth of that passion. It swayed him already. It made him a coward. Through his mind and heart swept the memory of Ellen Jorth, her beauty and charm, her boldness and pathos, her shame and her degradation. And the sweetness of her outweighed the boldness. And the mystery of her arrayed itself in unquenchable protest against her acknowledged shame. Jean lifted his face to the heavens, to the pitiless white stars, to the infinite depths of the dark-blue sky. He <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> fact of his being an atom in the universe of nature. What was he, what was his revengeful father, what were hate and passion and strife in comparison to the nameless something, immense and everlasting, that he sensed in this dark moment? ...|$|E

5000|$|For {{the title}} character, Ploy, Pen-Ek chose Apinya Sakulcharoensuk, who was 16 {{years old at}} the time of shooting. [...] "She's a godsend," [...] the {{director}} said of the actress. [...] "It's as if I <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> that <b>the</b> Ploy character is out there somewhere in the real world, and then she materializes in the form of this girl. Apinya was born to be Ploy." ...|$|R

But I speak not of these; these will neither be ruled by grace nor reason.

50|$|Like 'maladministration', 'injustice' {{was left}} {{undefined}} in the Act.

50|$|While the {{appearance}} of the armor changed only slightly, over the years its technology improved by leaps and bounds, resulting in vastly increased strength, speed, and firepower. Control of the armor was slowly shifted from motion feedback and internal buttons to cybernetic controls, which <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> and interpret <b>the</b> wearer's own brainwaves and respond accordingly. The pacemaker function of the chestplate was also eventually abandoned, as Stark's heart was repaired using artificial tissue.|$|R
5000|$|Gervase Davis {{believed}} {{the house was}} haunted. He claimed to have felt various presences from time to time, and a lady in white has been seen occasionally.

Francesca Davis believed that cats <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> presence of spirits and her hackles would rise when such a presence came into the room.|$|E
50|$|Agatha {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{as one of}} the original witches from the Salem witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts. She somehow survived and later became a significant figure in Marvel continuity, protecting Franklin Richards as his nanny and notably mentoring Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch) in real magic. Agatha was eventually killed by Wanda, who went insane. She also had a familiar named Ebony, a weird cat-like creature that <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> presence of mystical beings.|$|E
50|$|Miguel, {{a former}} senior at Sam Houston (Houston, Texas), {{grew up in the}} gym {{watching}} his brother train. He <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> respect others had for Ben’s dedication to boxing, and Miguel soon craved exactly the same thing. His older brother, Benjamin Flores, was a former Super Bantamweight boxer. During a bout he was critically hurt and required paramedic attention and was rushed to nearby Parkland Hospital to undergo emergency surgery to relieve swelling on his brain. He died five days later, on May 5, 2009, from brain injuries suffered in the ring.|$|E
30|$|Opponent color theory, on {{the other}} hand, states that human eyes could {{perceive}} light in three opposing components, i.e., light vs. dark, red vs. green, and blue vs. yellow. One <b>could</b> not <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> mixtures of red and green, or blue and yellow. Therefore, in reality, {{there is no such}} a color perceivable by human that is reddish green, or bluish yellow. Opposing colors can create maximum contrast and stability of an image. Photos or images with opposing colors are more appealing than those without. In addition, complementary colors occurring simultaneously in a photo can also enhance the foreground saliency.|$|R
30|$|For the {{discovery}} process, a device could advertise its available capacities, or it <b>could</b> be <b>sensed</b> by <b>the</b> management entity. However, {{it is worth}} noticing that in a highly dynamic scenario (unlike the Cloud), this information might vary rapidly [57]. Thus, the time frame on which the information must be updated becomes a critical factor to guarantee {{the accuracy of the}} information reported.|$|R
50|$|Full Spectral Imaging, {{along with}} Empirical {{reflectance}} retrieval and Autonomous Remote <b>Sensing</b> are <b>the</b> {{components of the}} New System for Remote <b>Sensing.</b> <b>The</b> New System for Remote <b>Sensing</b> <b>could</b> be <b>the</b> successor to the Landsat series of satellites of the Landsat program. The concepts mentioned above have been developed in collaboration with many experts, {{most of whom have}} little to nothing to do with traditional remote sensing.

5000|$|Gaffney is {{just being}} honest with his {{self-evaluation}} when he underscores himself. He isn't {{taking into account}} the fact he was able to [...] "pull a foot" [...] and spur a bull [...] "the size and caliber" [...] of Little Yellow Jacket. [...] "I felt it," [...] said Gaffney, when asked if he <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere in the arena. It seems right that he faced Little Yellow Jacket again later that year in his final outing of his career in the eighth round of the PBR World Finals and scored 93.75 points.|$|E
50|$|Thus, with {{three-quarters of}} the season gone, Prost was a full 28 points ahead and <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> championship, having 81 points to Senna's 53. Hill was third with 48, Schumacher was fourth with 42, Patrese was fifth with 18, Brundle was sixth with 11, Herbert was seventh with 11 and Blundell was eighth with 10. In the Constructors Championship, Williams were World Champions with 129 points ahead of Benetton who were second with 60, McLaren close behind in third with 56 and Ligier a {{surprising}} fourth with 21 - their best performance in some years.|$|E
50|$|Dagerman's horizons were greatly {{expanded}} by his marriage in 1943 to Annemarie Götze, an eighteen-year-old German refugee. Her parents, Ferdinand and Elly, were prominent Anarcho-Syndicalists, {{and the family}} escaped Nazi Germany {{to be at the}} center of the movement in Barcelona. When Spanish fascists brutally crushed the Anarcho-Syndicalist social experiment there, the Götzes fled through France and Norway, with Hitler's army at their heels, to a neutral Sweden. Dagerman and his young wife lived with his in-laws, and it was through this family, and the steady stream of refugees that passed through their home, that Dagerman felt he <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> pulse of Europe.|$|E
60|$|In {{another couple}} of minutes the two lads were sitting, as agreed, upon the step of a door close to the cafe. They could not hear all that was said; but <b>could</b> catch <b>the</b> <b>sense,</b> as <b>the</b> German officers--as is their custom--spoke in a very loud voice. They belonged to the infantry; and were, it appeared, in ignorance of the reason of their sudden move to Saverne.|$|R
50|$|When Red Rock was {{two years}} old, Mert Hunking from Sisters, Oregon, bought him. Mert was an amateur local stock {{contractor}} {{in the area and}} he bucked Red Rock in the rodeos in the vicinity. Mert ran a local stock contractor company called Sombrero Rodeo Company. Mert could see that Red Rock was different than other bulls, that he was smarter. Red Rock <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> what <b>the</b> rider was about to do and would turn the opposite way, which would result in throwing the rider off, usually on the first turn out of the chute. Also, Red Rock wasn't mean like other bulls, he wouldn't go after them, but just headed for the stripping chute. Red Rock spent his time bucking all of the riders off.|$|R
40|$|Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2. 3. 1. 9), {{commonly}} named thiolase II, condenses two {{molecules of}} acetyl-CoA to give acetoacetyl-CoA and CoA. This enzyme acts in anabolic processes {{as the first}} step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and polyhydroxybutyrate in eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively. We have recently reported the evolutionary and functional equivalence of these enzymes, suggesting that thiolase II could be the rate limiting enzyme in these pathways and presented evidence indicating that this enzyme modulates the availability of reducing equivalents during abiotic stress adaptation in bacteria and plants. However, these results are not sufficient to clarify why thiolase II was evolutionary selected as a critical enzyme in the production of antioxidant compounds. Regarding this intriguing topic, we propose that thiolase II <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> changes in <b>the</b> acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio induced by the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle under abiotic stress. Thus, the high level of evolutionary and functional constraint of thiolase II may be due to the connection of this enzyme with an ancient and conserved metabolic route. •We have reported the evolutionary and functional equivalence of thiolases II. •We propose that thiolase II <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> changes in <b>the</b> acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio. •Thiolase II is probably an ancestral enzyme involved in abiotic stress adaptation...|$|R
50|$|ATTESA E-TS Pro {{differs from}} the {{standard}} ATTESA E-TS in a few ways. Where ATTESA E-TS controls the front to rear torque-split, the Pro system is also capable of left-and-right torque split to the rear wheels. This is done via an active rear LSD. Additionally, ATTESA E-TS Pro was marketed as controlling the ABS system to each wheel independently, while the previous ABS computer <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> speed of each wheel its ABS pump is only 3-channel (both rear brakes are linked as a pair). Although this {{is not part of}} the AWD system, the computer makes use of the same sensors to determine wheel slip and traction.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Kwannon was an 'intuitive empath' who <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> {{emotional}} state of others. It is unknown if her original abilities {{are the result}} of mutation. Upon inhabiting Psylocke's body she gained half of Psylocke's original telepathic potential, including the power to generate a psionic blade like Psylocke's psychic knife, but larger and more ornate. Her psi-katana was capable of disrupting a person's neural functions on contact, generally rendering them unconscious. The appearance of the katana varied; on at least one occasion Revanche was shown to generate a small psychic dagger instead of a full blade. Using her psi-blade, Revanche could force her way into another telepath's mind.|$|E
5000|$|In the finals, {{it was a}} {{slow pace}} at the beginning. Absurdly, the {{organizers}} placed a water station in lane 9, instead of lane 3 where it was located during the 10,000. At 1200 metres, with the pace dawdling, Farah alone chose {{to take advantage of}} the water stop, having to run all the way across the track in both directions, but still maintaining contact with the back of the field. At the front of the pack, by default, was a British uniform, but not Farah, it was Tom Farrell with eyes wandering to the TV monitors. You <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> <b>the</b> entire field was wanting to use a rear view mirror. What is Farah doing back there? ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, in {{quantizing}} gravity there are, in perturbation theory, infinitely many independent parameters (counterterm coefficients) needed {{to define the}} theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one <b>could</b> make <b>sense</b> of <b>the</b> theory, but since it's impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, {{it has been argued}} that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory: ...|$|R
30|$|Although a {{base station}} <b>could</b> {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> window lengths that minimize function (11) and send these optimal values to each secondary user, {{in this article}} we rely on the secondary users themselves to determine their individual best sensing window length. This decentralized allocation avoids the introduction of signaling overhead in the system.|$|R
40|$|Lactose is {{commonly}} used as a carrier for inhaled drugs.
