500|$|The {{financial}} operations made in dollars {{were subject to}} a strong <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> to pesos, the [...] "pesification". There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution, as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy. The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100,000 dollars. Another conflict was the corralito, imposed by De la Rúa, which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the withdrawal of money from bank accounts. Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that [...] "The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars". The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out {{that that would be}} impossible, as the amount of dollars required was higher than even the foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank. Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken. The bank accounts in dollars would be [...] "pesified" [...] at a 1.4 exchange rate, and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations. The taxes of public services were [...] "pesified" [...] and fixed at their current values. Most industries benefited from the [...] "pesification" [...] and the devaluation, as they could now export at higher prices, and the economy started to improve. The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial. The devaluation also increased the price of imported products, which allowed import substitution industrialization. As the local prices became cheap in dollars, international tourism to the country was increased. The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as alternative currency, on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds.|$|E

This analysis reveals the main factors standing behind the structure of deposits held with banks (demand or time deposits), as well as the determinants of the trade-off between cash and demand deposits in Central and Eastern European Countries and in Former Soviet Union countries. We show that the strong preference for cash, which appears in transition countries, is related to the extent of the informal sector, to the low efficiency of the banking sector {{as well as to the}} massive <b>currency</b> <b>substitutions.</b> The relatively high share of time deposits compared to demand deposits is due to the inefficiency of the banking system and to the low level of development of alternative financial markets. transition economics; money demand; cash deposit ratio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{is dealing}} with the {{development}} of the central banking on the basis of experience from the last decade. Hypothesis is the statement, whether the central banks of the developed economies are increasingly less capable of the effective reactions on the accelerating development of the global economy and their position in the money emission and regulation of the banking sector is and will be more and more weakened by the alternative banking and monetary systems. This hypothesis is successfully disproved because of the behavior of the four chosen central banks which are CNB, FED, ECB and BoJ. The main reason was an increase in their activities and interventions causing among others multiplication of their balance sheets. On the other hand the alternative in the free banking is further from the reality than before.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the article is twofold. Firstly, it aims at proposing a Post-Keynesian {{interpretation}} of hyperinflation. The theoretical building includes elements suggested by Post-Keynesians {{as well as by}} structuralists. The accent is put on the role played by a foreign currency in domestic comportments during high inflation periods. Besides, a definition of hyperinflation is suggested: hyperinflation could be seen as a substitution by a foreign currency of a domestic <b>currency.</b> This <b>substitution,</b> violent in its final step, is built gradually. Hyperinflation is caused by a violent distributive conflict which generates a strong inflation, by indexation, by an external indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency and by self-fulfilling prophecies. Secondly, this theoretical framework is confronted to economic facts observed in Argentina from the 1970 ’s to the 1989 hyper-inflationist spurt. The historical political economy analysis allows the spotting of the following sequence: the distributive conflict is highly violent, reshaped several times from the 1970 ’s onwards. It provokes the development of institutional arrangements (indexation), while the dollar becomes more and more important within the economy. This phenomenon is encouraged by the implementation of an original exchange rate regime {{at the end of the}} 1970 ’s, in a context of liberalization of the economy. The impossibility to stabilize the exchange rate during the 1980 ’s in a context of external indebtedness makes possible the arising of hyperinflation. It is finally activated by speculation on the exchange rate level and a run on the foreign reserves...|$|R

50|$|However, <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{eliminates}} {{the probability of}} a currency crisis that negatively affects the banking system through the balance sheet channel. <b>Currency</b> <b>substitution</b> may reduce the possibility of systematic liquidity shortages and the optimal reserves in the banking system.

5000|$|Official <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{helps to}} promote fiscal and {{monetary}} discipline and thus greater macroeconomic stability and lower inflation rates, to lower real exchange rate volatility, and possibly to deepen the financial system. Firstly, <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> helps developing countries, providing a firm commitment to stable monetary and exchange rate policies by forcing a passive monetary policy. Adopting a strong foreign currency as legal tender {{will help to}} [...] "eliminate the inflation-bias problem of discretionary monetary policy". Secondly, official <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> imposes stronger financial constraint on the government by eliminating deficit financing by issuing money. An empirical finding suggests that inflation has been significantly lower in economies with full <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> than nations with domestic currencies. The expected benefit of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> is {{the elimination of the}} risk of exchange rate fluctuations and a possible reduction in the country's international exposure. <b>Currency</b> <b>substitution</b> cannot eliminate the risk of an external crisis but provides steadier markets as a result of eliminating fluctuations in exchange rates.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few cases}} of full <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> prior to 1999 {{had been the}} {{consequence}} of political and historical factors.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{decision}} making under conflict situation with multi-criteria uncertainty was considered. We proposed combining the usual way of finding a solution for a complex system that used the utility theory with the game approach under conditions of a reflexive interaction. Reflexive behavior modeling provides the ability to analyze a situation where decisions are different from ones for non-reflexive rational behavior, explore and reveal the internal reasons for this behavior. This problem solution {{is based on the}} use of the concept of local currency, proposed by V. A. Lefebvre. His original formulation of the problem has been rethought with the aim to take into account an ambiguity of interests of players. On the basis of this concept extension, a procedure was created to determine the local currency for resolving the conflict in terms of the multi-criteria choice. To calculate an accurate assessment of the opponent's local currency based on nominally known criteria, the interactive method of Geoffrion-Dyer-Feinberg was used. Its usage allowed to find the gradient vector of the local <b>currency</b> with local <b>substitution</b> rates, which were determined by the expert procedure, and determine the efficient reflexive strategy for a player. ??????????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ????????? ? ?????????????????? ????????????????. ??????? ????????????? ? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????? ? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????????? ??????????????. ????????????? ????????????? ????????? ???? ??????????? ????????????? ????????, ????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??????????????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????. ??????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????, ????????????? ?. ?. ????????. ???????????? ?? ?????????? ?????? ???? ????????????? ? ????? ????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????. ?? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ??? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????????????? ??????. ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????? ??????????-??????-?????????. ??? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????, ? ??? ?????????, ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????...|$|R

50|$|Countries {{with full}} <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> can invoke greater {{confidence}} among international investors, inducing increased investments and growth.

50|$|Official <b>{{currency}}</b> <b>substitution</b> or full <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{happens when}} a country adopts a foreign currency as its sole legal tender, and ceases to issue the domestic currency. Another effect of a country adopting a foreign currency as its own is that the country gives up all power to vary its exchange rate. There are {{a small number of}} countries adopting a foreign currency as legal tender.|$|E
50|$|<b>Currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{can be used}} semiofficially (or officially bimonetary systems), {{where the}} foreign {{currency}} is legal tender alongside the domestic currency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Currency</b> <b>substitution</b> or {{dollarization}} {{occurs when}} the inhabitants of a country use a foreign currency in parallel to or instead of the domestic currency.|$|E
50|$|In {{an economy}} with full <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> {{monetary}} authorities cannot act as lender {{of last resort}} to commercial banks by printing money. The alternatives to lending to the bank system may include taxation and issuing government debt. The loss of the lender of last resort is considered a cost of full <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> This cost depends on the initial level of unofficial <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> before moving to a full currency substituted economy. This relation is negative because in a heavily currency substituted economy, the central bank already fears difficulties in providing liquidity assurance to the banking system. However, literature points out the existence of alternative mechanisms to provide liquidity insurance to banks, such as a scheme by which the international financial community charges an insurance fee {{in exchange for a}} commitment to lend to a domestic bank.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight from}} {{domestic}} money {{depends on a}} country's institutional factors. The first factor {{is the level of}} development of the domestic financial market. An economy with a well-developed financial market can offer a set of alternative financial instruments denominated in domestic currency, reducing the role of foreign currency as an inflation hedge. The pattern of the <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> process also varies across countries with different foreign exchange and capital controls. In a country with strict foreign exchange regulations, the demand for foreign currency will be satisfied in the holding of foreign currency assets abroad and outside the domestic banking system. This demand often puts pressure on the parallel market of foreign currency and on the country's international reserves. Evidence for this pattern is given in the absence of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> during the pre-reform period in most transition economies, because of constricted controls on foreign exchange and the banking system. In contrary, by facilitating the domestic holding of foreign currency, a country might mitigate the shift of assets abroad and strengthen its external reserves in exchange for a <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> process. However, the effect of this regulation on the pattern of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> depends on the public's expectations of macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of the foreign exchange regime.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dollarization", when {{referring}} to <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> does not necessarily involve use of the United States dollar. The major currencies used as substitutes are the US dollar and the euro.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{leads to the}} loss of {{seigniorage}} revenue, the loss of monetary policy autonomy, and the loss of the exchange rate instruments. Seigniorage revenues are the profits generated when monetary authorities issue currency. When adopting a foreign currency as legal tender, a monetary authority needs to withdraw the domestic currency and give up future seigniorage revenue. The country loses the rights to its autonomous monetary and exchange rate policies, even in times of financial emergency. For example, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan has stated that the central bank considers the effects of its decisions only on the US economy. In a full currency substituted economy, exchange rates are indeterminate and monetary authorities cannot devalue the currency. In an economy with high <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> devaluation policy is less effective in changing the real exchange rate because of significant pass-through effects to domestic prices. However, the cost of losing an independent monetary policy exists when domestic monetary authorities can commit an effective counter-cyclical monetary policy, stabilizing the business cycle. This cost depends adversely on the correlation between the business cycle of the client country (the economy with <b>currency</b> <b>substitution)</b> and the business cycle of the anchor country. In addition, monetary authorities in economies with <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> diminish the liquidity assurance to their banking system.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{economic}} issue was the currency {{that would be}} used by an independent Scotland. The principal options were to establish an independent Scottish currency, join the euro, or retain the pound sterling (a form of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution).</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{indicators}} of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> The first measure is {{the share of}} foreign currency deposits (FCD) in the domestic banking system in the broad money including FCD. The second is the share of all foreign currency deposits held by domestic residents {{at home and abroad}} in their total monetary assets.|$|E
50|$|Partial <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> {{occurs when}} {{residents}} of a country choose to hold a significant share of their financial assets denominated in foreign currency. It can also occur as a gradual conversion to full currency substitution: examples are Argentina and Peru, which were both {{in the process of}} converting to the U.S. dollar during the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Before Kosovo {{declared}} {{independence in}} 2008, Kosovo's economy {{had undergone a}} <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> with the Deutsche Mark being the most used currency. As a result, like Germany, Kosovo (which was then a United Nations mandate) switched to the euro on 1 January 2002. The change to the euro was achieved {{in cooperation with the}} European Central Bank, and several national banks in the Eurozone. Kosovo does not mint any coins of its own.|$|E
50|$|A {{currency}} board (also known as 'linked exchange rate system") effectively replaces {{the central bank}} through a legislation to fix the currency to that of another country. The domestic currency remains perpetually exchangeable for the reserve currency at the fixed exchange rate. As the anchor currency is now the basis for movements of the domestic currency, the interest rates and inflation in the domestic economy would be greatly influenced by those of the foreign economy to which the domestic currency is tied. The {{currency board}} needs to ensure the maintenance of adequate reserves of the anchor currency. It is {{a step away from}} officially adopting the anchor currency (termed as <b>currency</b> <b>substitution).</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{the gold}} {{standard}} was abandoned at the outbreak of World War I and the Bretton Woods Conference following World War II, some countries sought exchange rate regimes to promote global economic stability, and hence their own prosperity. Countries usually peg their currency to a major convertible currency. [...] "Hard pegs" [...] are exchange rate regimes that demonstrate a stronger commitment to a fixed parity (i.e. currency boards) or relinquish {{control over their own}} currency (such as currency unions) while [...] "soft pegs" [...] are more flexible and floating exchange rate regimes. The collapse of [...] "soft" [...] pegs in Southeast Asia and Latin America in the late 1990s led to <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> becoming a serious policy issue.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of adopting a strong foreign currency as sole legal tender {{is to reduce the}} transaction costs of trade among countries using the same currency. There are at least two ways to infer this impact from data. The first is the significantly negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade in most cases, and the second is an association between transaction costs and the need to operate with multiple currencies. Economic integration {{with the rest of the}} world becomes easier as a result of lowered transaction costs and stabler prices. Rose (2000) applied the gravity model of trade and provided empirical evidence that countries sharing a common currency engage in significantly increased trade among them, and that the benefits of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> for trade may be large.|$|E
5000|$|High and unanticipated {{inflation}} rates {{decrease the}} demand for domestic money and raise {{the demand for}} alternative assets, including foreign currency and assets dominated by foreign currency. This phenomenon is called the [...] "flight from domestic money". It results in a rapid and sizable process of <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> In countries with high inflation rates, the domestic currency tends to be gradually displaced by a stable currency. At {{the beginning of this}} process, the store-of-value function of the domestic currency is replaced by the foreign currency. Then, the unit-of-account function of the domestic currency is displaced when many prices are quoted in a foreign currency. A prolonged period of high inflation will induce the domestic currency to lose its function as medium of exchange when the public carries out many transactions in foreign currency.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money—gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards (Thiers' Law). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at cheap prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments who do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) which threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero. The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in Zimbabwe {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.|$|E
