50|$|A {{mechanical}} direct evaporative <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> uses a fan to draw {{air through}} a wetted membrane, or pad, {{which provides a}} large surface area for the evaporation of water into the air. Water is sprayed {{at the top of}} the pad so it can drip down into the membrane and continually keep the membrane saturated. Any excess water that drips out from the bottom of the membrane is collected in a pan and recirculated to the top. Single stage direct evaporative coolers are typically small in size as it only consists of the membrane, water pump, and centrifugal fan. The mineral content of the municipal water supply will cause scaling on the membrane, which will lead to clogging over the life of the membrane. Depending on this mineral content and the evaporation rate, regular cleaning and maintenance is required to ensure optimal performance. Generally, supply air from the single-stage evaporative cooler will need to be exhausted directly (one-through flow) because the high humidity of the supply air. Few design solutions have been conceived to utilize the energy in the air like directing the exhaust air through two sheets of double glazed windows, thus reducing the solar energy absorbed through the glazing. Compared to energy required to achieve the equivalent cooling load with a compressor, single stage evaporative coolers consume less energy.|$|E

40|$|Development of new {{technology}} {{has always been an}} important activity for the oil and gas in- dustry. New technologies can streamline the production, improve the recovery rate and provide economic benefits. The implementation cost may be regarded as high, but the end result may totally easily turn out to have great economical advantages. The challenge is that {{new technology}} usually involves potential threats with high uncer- tainty. These factors must be managed prior to implementation. This is achieved through tech- nology qualification. The aim of technology qualification, is to provide sufficient evidence that the technology is fit for purpose. The master thesis begins to describe relevant key terms, qualification, verification and vali- dation. Each of these are discussed and compared which increases the understanding of quali- fication. In addition, different qualification methods are introduce and discussed. The methods describe how the qualification evidence is provided, through physical testing, analytical evalu- ation, or a combination as integrated qualification. An in-depth literature survey is introduced, where relevant qualification standards, recom- mendations and other governing documents are presented. General qualification documents provide guidance of how a general qualification should be executed in a project. Business- specific documents illustrate how the general documents are implemented into the business- specific procedures, as well as own guidance. Guidance for qualification of safety instrumented systems, and supplementary qualification documents are also mentioned. Some of the documents introduce technology qualification program and technology qualifi- cation process. A technology qualification program is the framework of how a technology qual- ification process should be executed. The process deals with a structured set off steps, intended to reduce threats, predict future outcomes, and provide evidence in order to determine whether the qualification requirements are met or not. A more detailed description of the qualification process presented by DNV-RP-A 203 is provided. This process represents the recent and most up to date version of qualification, and is today considered as state of the art by the oil industry. The process includes six steps, that are, technology qualification basis, technology assessment, threat assessment, technology qualification plan, execution of the plan, and performance assessment. Companies that develop technology, needs guidelines for qualification. The thesis describes how and which documents that should be followed through the qualification, and identifies possible challenges, in more specific Aker Solutions and Statoil procedures. At the end of the thesis, a extensive qualification case study is documented based on the technology qualification process provided in DNV-RP-A 203. A passive subsea inlet <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> is selected as case equipment. Such subsea technology are adopted from existing topside solu- tions, but modified to withstand other hostile operational and environmental conditions. Quali- fication requirements for the inlet <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> are identified in the technology qualification basis. The maturity of the unit is defined in the technology assessment, and critical failures found in the threat assessment. A qualification plan is developed with four different activities intended to reduce the critical failures. The plan is executed, and the performance assessment consid- ers to what extent the qualification requirements are met. Due to insufficient material, the last process step is inadequately reached. In addition, an extension of the case study is carried out in terms of a productions assur- ance analysis. The analysis is conducted using MIRIAM Regina, where a model is modulated with respect to failure modes identified in the threat assessment. Each failure mode is assigned different parameters, like failure rates and restoration time. The model is validated by com- petent staff at Aker Solutions. The simulation is carrier out with 25 -year perspective, through 1000 replications. The simulated results shows that the average technical availability for the in- let <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> is 98, 93 %. Due to no availability requirement stated for the inlet <b>cooler</b> <b>unit,</b> the thesis does not draw any qualification conclusions. However, it indicates that, if this simulated value is higher than required availability, and additional requirements are met, then the inlet <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> is considered as qualified. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} into a practical cooling issue on a type of fan-forced finned-tube heat exchangers used in Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s coal seam gas (CSG) industry. CSG compression facilities in some production sites suffered underproduction in recent summers because of frequent automatic engine shutdowns. The problem is not expected by the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, it is suspected of being related to the control systems on the compression facilities triggering the overheating-protection shutdowns due to possible deficiencies in one or some water/gas cooling loops in the facilities’ air-cooled heat exchangers. Therefore, to understand which heat exchangers and what exact reasons cause the unexpected cooling issue, {{an investigation}} {{has been carried out}} on the cooler units of the gas compression facilities. A field instrumentation measurement on one operating <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> has been done, followed by an analysis using a one-dimensional analytical model and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model. The experimental results are used to validate both the models. Then the cooling performance of the <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> under the summer peak condition is predicted by the verified models. The prediction suggests that the water inlet temperature in one particular cooler section is higher than its upper limit defined by the manufacturer, due to poor cooling at high ambient temperatures. The lower cooling performance is caused by large reductions in the cooler air speed and total heat transfer coefficient, which are related to less efficiency of the cooler fans, more airflow resistance, and fouling {{on both sides of the}} finned tubes...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{costs are}} {{increasing}} rapidly. Energy efficiency strategies {{are required to}} reduce electricity consumption for energy intensive operations. Cooling systems of deep level mines consume approximately 25 % of their total electricity consumption. Cold water supplied by these systems is reticulated throughout the mine. Water reticulation can account for a further 42 % of the total electricity consumption of a typical deep level mine. Underground working areas in deep level mines must be cooled to account for temperatures of up to 60 °C. Mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are often used to cool underground working areas. These units require significant amounts of chilled water. Adequate supply of chilled water to these units is crucial to comply with health and safety regulations. It is often found that the water supply to mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> is not properly managed. Energy savings can be achieved on the cooling systems {{as well as the}} reticulation systems by reducing the water consumption of mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> Various valves were identified as possible equipment to be used to manage water consumption on mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> A case study proved that flow reductions on the mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are possible.

A model of the cooler system was constructed, incorporating aspects of compressible flow, multimode heat transfer, fouling, and changes in geometry. This indicated that deposition could be very rapid. The effect of deposit layer buildup required measurement of the thermal conductivity of the porous layer; this was achieved using a novel testing device similar to that reported by Tan et al. (2006), for measuring the thermal conductivity of surface coatings. Active mitigation techniques are employed to reduce the effect of rapid fouling. The effectiveness of adding an erodent, in this case sand, to the flow was appraised by studying the breakup of deposit layers by impinging particles. The experimental conditions (high-temperature chlorine gas, high flow velocities) were simulated in cold experiments by matching the inertia and size of test particles {{to those of the}} sand. These studies showed that sand at the feed size would detach deposits, but could result in breakage of the sand particles. Mitigation efficiency is then determined by sand distribution and redistribution. Funding for VYL from Huntsman is gratefully acknowledged...|$|E

The emulsion tem-peratures studied were 40, 45, and 50 °C, with other parameters such as emulsion flow rates, tube cooler temperature, and pin rotor speed kept constant. The SFC developed during process-ing and storage at 28 °C was measured to evaluate the quality of margarine. The emulsion contained no SFC at any emulsion temperature studied.

The softening point of this sample was moderately high and closely related to the type of crystal developed, which was a mixture of β ′ and β crystals. Emulsion at 45 °C gave the most stable margarine consistency and SFC with crystal in the β ′ form even after the fourth week.

Dates (kalas variety) at a tamr stage, collected from Alhasa area, were stored in all storages for six months. Experiments were performed during the period from November 2005 to April 2006. Results showed that air temperature inside the evaporatively cooled storages were found very close to each other, and their values were determined primarily by the temperature and relative humidity of the incoming air. Air temperature inside the first storage was low and can be maintained at the desired level. It appeared that outside conditions were identical with those of the naturally ventilated storage. Low levels of relative humidity were observed inside the naturally ventilated storage, while the levels of relative humidity were high inside the cold storages. The highest level of moisture content were observed in the evaporatively cooled storages, while moisture content levels inside the mechanically-cooled storage were close to those at ambient. Results showed that the utilization of automatic control reduces the amount of water consumed for evaporative cooling. The total amounts of cooling water consumption for the second and third storages were 7. 7 nr' and 13. 1 nr', respectively. Also, there were variations of the water consumption throughout the experimental period. The monthly cooling water consumption for the second storage varied between 0. 505 m 3 during January and 2. 37 m 3 during November.

The aim of this report is to study the use of CO 2 in a one-stage and two-stage heat pump cycle for transportation purposes using an existing HCFC-based heat pump modified to work with CO 2. Tests were conducted on this existing experimental CO 2 heat pump setup at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden in Borås, Sweden.

Overall, the measurement and model results showed that the gas <b>cooler</b> <b>unit</b> is over-dimensioned and modifications in future systems could be considered. It was found that the air side within each heat exchanger limits the heat transfer in the existing setup due to the ratio of outside to inside surface area and the low air heat transfer coefficient. Measurements results also indicate that there is significant uneven distribution {{at the entrance to the}} evaporator unit. This creates uncertainty when modelling as it is too complicated with the existing measurements and equipment to model anything other than perfect distribution at the inlet to the evaporator unit. Results also indicate that the 2 nd stage compressor operates at a much lower efficiency than expected by manufacturer and theoretical data.

So more compact <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> for high power control panel compared with air-forced aluminum fin is desired. We have been developing the new counter flow type Compact <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> having inclined radiation fin. In this paper, we have established the simple method for calculation of cooling performance of heat exchanger by using radiation fin modeled by pressure {{resistance in the}} flow field, and by using NTU method in the temperature field...|$|R
