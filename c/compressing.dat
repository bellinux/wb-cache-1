5|$|Boron {{is similar}} to carbon in its {{capability}} to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000°C. It forms four major polymorphs: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but {{is very difficult to}} produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs. It can be produced by <b>compressing</b> other boron phases to 12–20GPa and heating to 1500–1800°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable. <b>Compressing</b> boron above 160GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K. Borospherene (fullerene-like B40) molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) have been described in 2014.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. What kind of {{operations}} can we perform effectively (without full unpacking) with <b>compressed</b> texts? In this paper we consider three fundamental problems: (1) check {{the equality of}} two <b>compressed</b> texts, (2) check whether one <b>compressed</b> text is a substring of another <b>compressed</b> text, and (3) compute the number of different symbols (Hamming distance) between two <b>compressed</b> texts of the same length. We present an algorithm that solves the first problem in O(n 3) time and the second problem in O(n 2 m) time. Here n {{is the size of}} <b>compressed</b> representation (we consider representations by straight-line programs) of the text and m is the size of <b>compressed</b> representation of the pattern. Next, we prove that the third problem is actually #P-complete. Thus, we indicate a pair of similar problems (equivalence checking, Hamming distance computation) that have radically different complexity on <b>compressed</b> texts. Our algorithmic technique used for problems (1) and (2) helps for computing minimal periods and covers of <b>compressed</b> texts. ...|$|R
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, <b>compressing</b> the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E

Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, <b>compressing</b> the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is <b>compressing</b> the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is <b>compressing</b> the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by <b>compressing</b> and cooling it.

5|$|Named for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918–1996) {{who first}} {{described}} the procedure in 1961, {{the goal of}} cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.

The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule. Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally instead of <b>compressing</b> it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.|$|E
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in <b>compressing</b> these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice.

5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time.
