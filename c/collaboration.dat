30|$|International <b>collaborations</b> in ITS {{research}} has increased significantly, {{and there are}} successful <b>collaborations</b> that already exist. However, <b>collaborations</b> across borders often face serious challenges {{that need to be}} resolved {{to pave the way for}} successful <b>collaborations.</b> Barriers of culture, governance, power differentials, legal and regulatory regimes, differences in policies, protocols and practices must be addressed before collaborative arrangements are established. Top down policy interventions in facilitating international <b>collaborations</b> are critical not only to address those maco-level barriers, but to provide access to resources and networks that enables bottom up <b>collaborations.</b>|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{object-oriented}} applications using <b>collaborations</b> {{and roles}} is well accepted. Collaboration-based or role-based designs decompose an application into tasks {{performed by a}} subset of the applications' classes. <b>Collaborations</b> provide a larger unit of understanding and reuse than classes, and can be an important aid in the maintenance and evolution of the software. The extraction of roles and <b>collaborations</b> is therefore an important issue in design recovery. <b>Collaborations</b> and roles are, however, not explicitly supported at source code level. Furthermore, in dynamically typed object-oriented languages, the absence of types makes the extraction of roles from the source code difficult. In this paper we present a simple approach to support the recovery of roles and <b>collaborations.</b> We have developed a tool which uses an execution trace of a program to find meaningful <b>collaborations</b> and to identify the roles that classes play in these <b>collaborations...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we present a model that can capture diverse types of structured <b>collaborations.</b> The model combines both efficiency and power via a hierarchy of three abstractions, at the lowest level of which are streams for media communication modulated by access rights of participants within <b>collaborations.</b> The higher two levels of abstractions are sessions, which represent collections of semantically related media streams, and conferences, which represent temporally related sequences of sessions. Using these abstractions, the model supports unification of both synchronous and asynchronous <b>collaborations,</b> sophisticated access control, and intra-group and inter-group <b>collaborations,</b> yielding a powerful set of building blocks for constructing multimedia applications and a rich environment for carrying out structured multimedia <b>collaborations.</b> KEYWORDS [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} elicit new {{explanations}} into {{the geography of}} <b>collaborations</b> between science and industry by focusing on how they are initially set up. Two determining factors could influence this: constraints linked {{to the search for}} complementary resources and possibilities to connect with partners. An empirical study on <b>collaborations</b> established by several laboratories of the University of Poitiers with companies confirms this hypothesis. Searching for specific resources means fewer potential partners are available and explains the small number of local <b>collaborations</b> and the high number of partnerships with certain regions. However, these constraints alone do not suffice to determine the spatial scale of such <b>collaborations.</b> Analysing how connections are established particularly reveals that partners generally prefer to renew <b>collaborations</b> rather than initiate new ones. This leads to the existing geography of partnerships being reinforced. <b>Collaborations,</b> geography, social networks, institutions, resources,...|$|R
