5|$|After Coates left, the {{orchestra}} reverted to its preferred practice of engaging numerous guest conductors {{rather than a}} single principal conductor. Among the guests were Elgar, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin. Revenues were substantial, and {{the orchestra}} seemed to many to be entering into a golden age. In fact, for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s, the LSO allowed its standards of playing to slip. In 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic, under Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London. Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways. In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. The prospect of joining a permanent, salaried orchestra was attractive enough to induce some LSO players to defect. The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the severe press criticisms of the LSO's playing. According to the critic W J Turner the LSO's problem was not that its playing had deteriorated, but that it had failed {{to keep up with}} the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} essays advocating a blinded {{approach}} to experiments in general came from Claude Bernard {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a naive (and preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.|$|E
500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the tone of his work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the director's childhood in the [...] Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E

25|$|The {{documentary}} photography of Martin Parr <b>contrasts</b> <b>starkly</b> {{with that}} of Sebastiao Salgado: Parr's overtly humorous photographs document contemporary society, warts and all. Parr (born 1952, British) waxes satirically on contemporary society.|$|R

500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had been born with [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". Film critic Greg Olson, in his book David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, posits that this time <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the director's childhood in the Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
500|$|One of {{his first}} actions as {{president}} was to meet directly with the company's 40department heads and 150other employees. This <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with Yamauchi's practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single, annual speech. Shigeru Miyamoto described the previous business atmosphere as [...] "stuffy" [...] and stated Iwata [...] "improved the ventilation." [...] Iwata was acutely aware that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level. If employees disagreed with his view, Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own, stating [...] "creators only improve themselves by taking risks." [...] Alongside the increased level of interaction, Iwata also brought more data and science into the business aspect of the company. Whereas Yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience, Iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position. Iwata also promoted Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, Yoshihiro Mori, and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company's board of directors, equaling his own position.|$|E
500|$|This policy became {{immediately}} {{evident in}} the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal, the Tulunids: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and a further 200,000 dinars in arrears, {{as well as the}} return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar. To seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a [...] "wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history" [...] (Thierry Bianquis). Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the impoverished caliphal court. According to a story, after a thorough search, al-Mu'tadid's chief eunuch could only find five ornate silver-and-gold candlesticks to decorate the palace, while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick. Thereupon al-Mu'tadid is said to have remarked [...] "come let us go and hide ourselves, lest we be seen in our poverty".|$|E

2500|$|Kienholz {{occasionally}} incorporated defunct or operating radios or televisions {{into their}} works, sometimes adding sound and moving images {{to the overall}} effect. [...] Live animals were selectively included as crucial elements in some installations, providing motion and sound that <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with frozen tableaus of decay and degradation. [...] For example, The Wait, a dismal scene of a lonely skeletal woman surrounded by memories and waiting for death, incorporates a cage with a live parakeet cheerfully chirping and hopping about. [...] The bird is considered {{an integral part of}} the installation, but requires special attention to insure that it remains healthy and active, as described in the Whitney Museum's online catalog and video. Another well-known work, The State Hospital, incorporates a pair of black goldfish swimming in each of two glass goldfish bowls representing the head of an inmate suffering with mental illness.|$|E
50|$|Conceptismo <b>contrasts</b> <b>starkly</b> with culteranismo, another {{movement}} of the Baroque period, which is characterized by ostentatious vocabulary, complex syntactical order, multiple, complicated metaphors, but highly conventional content. The best-known representative of Spanish culteranismo, Luis de Góngora, had an ongoing feud with Francisco de Quevedo in which they each criticized the other’s writing and personal life.|$|R

2500|$|The {{accession}} of al-Mu'tadid in 892 {{brought a}} warming {{of relations with}} the Baghdad court; recognizing {{that he could not}} defeat the Tulunids, the new Caliph instead opted to conciliate them: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous governor over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and further 200,000 dinars in arrears, as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar. In addition, the prestigious tiraz factories in Alexandria and Fustat, which produced government banners and robes, remained under caliphal control. In order to seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which <b>contrasted</b> <b>starkly</b> with the impoverished caliphal court. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a [...] "wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history" [...] (Th.

Hindenburg and his supporters sought to shift Germany's main effort to the eastern front in hopes of knocking Russia out of the war. Falkenhayn resisted this, believing that France and Great Britain were the true opponents and that a decisive victory against the Russians was impossible.|$|E
