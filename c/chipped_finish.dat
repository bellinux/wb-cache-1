Gosport would {{feature in the}} first round of the FA Cup for the first time in their 70-year history, with the tie set to be played on 9 November at Gosport's Privett Park. Gavin Massey opened the scoring from close range after 14 minutes, before Sanchez Watt doubled the lead seven minutes later with a volley from a Freddie Sears cross. Sears then {{effectively}} sealed victory, scoring the U's third of the match with a spot kick on 26 minutes. Justin Bennett pulled a goal back for Gosport on 39 minutes, but the U's struck back with Alex Gilbey's second goal of the season prior to half time, producing a deflected finish following a run from his own half. Gosport once again reduced the deficit to 4-2, with Bennett grabbing his second goal of the game. Freddie Sears also grabbed his second of the game when he tapped into an empty net on 78 minutes. The scoring wasn't complete until stoppage time when both teams scored. Sammie Szmodics scored his first professional goal with a fine <b>chipped</b> <b>finish</b> over the Gosport goalkeeper, before Lee Wort rounded the game off shortly after, hitting a goal on the rebound to finalise the 6-3 scoreline.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the direct}} {{conversion}} of AA 6060 aluminum alloy machining <b>chips</b> into <b>finished</b> products by hot extrusion with subsequent cold extrusion is investigated. For hot extrusion, {{two different types}} of extrusion dies, a conventional flat-face die and an experimental die, are used. The experimental die combines the process of equal channel angular pressing with the process of hot extrusion in a single die, which increases the strain and pressure affecting the chips during extrusion, both critical factors for achieving sound chip bonding. Subsequently, the chip-based extrudates are machined to fabricate chip-based preforms for the cold extrusion experiments. In order to investigate different processing routes, forward rod extrusion and backward can extrusion trials were conducted. In all steps, cast material was processed similar to the chips as a reference. The results showed that the quality of the chip-based finished parts strongly depends on the bonding quality between the individual chips, determined during the hot extrusion process...|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of Pong, Bushnell pushed his {{employees}} to create new products. In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype.
