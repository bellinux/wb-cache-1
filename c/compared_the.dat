5|$|After its premiere, Eaten Alive {{was widely}} criticized for false advertising. One critic <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> special to The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults—a {{television}} event {{that ended with}} a similarly disappointing outcome that did not meet promoted expectations.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive, praising the band's musicianship. Critics <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> band's sound to Porcupine Tree.

5|$|Deathrow {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to toss a disc through a hoop while {{avoiding}} full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, Blades of Steel, and Speedball, and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> film to other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E
5|$|Gō Itō, a {{professor}} in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> series' development to the manga of Dragon Ball, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well.

5|$|Homology was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he systematically <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> skeletons {{of birds and}} humans.

5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and steel market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio {{iron and steel industry}} workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for iron and steel industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E

5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme.
