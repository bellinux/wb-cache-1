40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the <b>conoscopic</b> <b>observation</b> of a molecular reconstruction occurring across a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) medium {{in the presence}} of an external electric field. Conoscopy is an optical interferometric method, employed to determine the orientation of an optic axis in uniaxial crystals. Here a planar aligned NLC medium is used, and the topological changes with respect to various applied voltages are monitored simultaneously. Homogenous planar alignment is obtained by providing suitable surface treatments to the ITO coated cell walls. The variation in the conoscopic interferometric patterns clearly demonstrates the transition from planar to homeotropic state through various intermediate states. Full Tex...|$|E

5000|$|A conoscope is an {{apparatus}} {{to carry out}} <b>conoscopic</b> <b>observations</b> and measurements, often realized by a microscope with a Bertrand lens for observation of the direction's image. The earliest reference {{to the use of}} conoscopy (i.e., observation in convergent light with a polarization microscope with a Bertrand lens) for evaluation of the optical properties of liquid crystalline phases (i.e., orientation of the optical axes) is in 1911 when it was used by Mauging to investigate the alignment of nematic and chiral-nematic phases.|$|R
40|$|Series {{of novel}} thermotropic metallomesogenic {{complexes}} have been synthesised and their liquid crystalline phases characterised. Anomalous in-plane packing of the molecules in all phases, namely two diffuse in-layer features, is observed by x-ray scattering. The first, at 16 A, compares to a molecular width of SA and shows that molecules are crystallographically unequal to their neighbours. The second, at 5 A, {{corresponds to a}} side-by-side separation of molecules and coupled with <b>conoscopic</b> <b>observations</b> from the (usually uniaxial) nematic and smectic A phases indicates a degree of biaxiality within these phases. Furthermore, the tilt angle measured by x-rays within the smectic C phase decreases with chain length. A model is proposed for packing the molecules to account for both the scattering and the <b>conoscopic</b> <b>observations.</b> It combines attractive interactions between molecules which slows rotation of the molecules about the long axis, and steric effects both from the core and the terminal chain. Infrared studies, computational analysis and initial powder diffraction of the three different complex types support the model. Given the proposed packing arrangement within the mesophases it is perhaps more appropriate to denote the SmA phases the more esoteric biaxial smectic A (SmAt,) phase. The nematic phases of the alkoxy- complexes also demonstrate biaxiality. These systems provide a very rare example of biaxiality in calamitic molecules. Mixtures of the complexes and commercially available nematogens were made up to evaluate any potential for device application. Of the characteristics studied, the response sharpness and the light transmission through the cell were able to be improved, however the threshold voltage at which the device switched increased in every case. The inclusion of metallomesogenic complexes to the nematogens thus increased the degree of ordering within the system. Binary mixtures of the liquid crystalline materials were made up {{in an attempt to}} reduce the transition temperatures of the systems. A relatively straightforward method of predicting both the transition temperatures and eutectic compositions was used and agreed well with experimentally observed transition temperatures. As a first step towards lowering the melting points significantly this proved successful...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} {{the existence of}} the SmC*(alpha) phase in the so-called Tokyo mixture, which has been used for studying V-shape switching by a number of research groups. <b>Conoscopic</b> <b>observations,</b> birefringence measurements using a set-up that employs a photo elastic modulator (PEM) and dielectric measurement were used for studying the behavior of the SmC*(alpha) phase. In particular, a conoscopic method using tilted cells was used to observe the conoscopy of the large tilt angle phase. We found that the tilted conoscopic method is very useful for analyzing large tilt smectic phases. The SmC alpha* phase was observed in a narrow temperature range from 63. 0 degrees C to 63. 4 degrees C. This is the first report of an observation of this phase in the Tokyo Mixture. It showed uniaxiality at low voltage but changed to biaxiality parallel to the electric field at high voltage in the conoscopic experiment. The absolute value of the biaxiality was quite high, up to 0. 003, which means that the unwinding process of SmC*(alpha) is different from that of SmC*. This high parallel biaxiality implies the emergence of ferri-like structure, that is, co-existence of synclinic order and anticlinic order, during the field induced unwinding process...|$|R
40|$|A {{possibility}} of a single crystal growth of anthracene on the amorphous coverglass substrate is investigated. The evaporation of anthracene assemblies has been performed on a room temperature substrate in vacuums of [...] 10 ^ Torr. It is found that they form island stracture and exhibit several types, i. e., single crystal, polycrystal or amorphous, depending on the experimental conditions. Such a finding of a single crystal growth is confirmed by its orthoscopic and <b>conoscopic</b> figure <b>observations</b> from crystallographic points of view. The anthracene single crystal obtaineb has a hexagonal structure with about 170 x 144 x 0. 6 Î¼m^ 3 in size...|$|R
5000|$|This way of {{representing}} the variation of {{a quantity of}} a display with direction of observation originates from an optical technique called conoscopy.
