While the first guns were based on elliptic cavity geometries, Quarter Wave Resonator (QWR) option is gaining popularity. QWRs are especially well suited for producing beams with high charge per bunch. In this talk we will describe recent progress in developing both types of SRF guns. SRF guns made excellent progress {{in the last two}} years. Several guns generated beams and one, at HZDR, injected beam into an accelerator.

Based on stochastic switching control of on-board chargers, this strategy ensures high-efficiency charging, reduces load variations to the grid during charging periods, achieves charge completion with high probability, and accomplishes approximate “valley-filling”.

40|$|In {{electric}} vehicles and plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}}, the utility grid charges the vehicle battery through a battery charger. Different solutions {{have been proposed}} {{to reduce the size}} and cost of the charger. One solution to achieve this is to include the devices used in the traction circuit in the charger circuit; this is called an integrated motor drive and battery charger. A split-phase PM motor, a motor with double set of windings, gives the opportunity to implement different winding configurations to keep the motor at stand-still when it is connected to the grid. The motor will act as inductors in the charging process. This is an advantageous chance in order to use the motor in an integrated battery charger. In the current thesis, a non-isolated battery charger based on some of these special configurations is tested. Two different PM motors are utilized in proposed chargers.

40|$|Free {{electron}} lasers (FEL) need a {{very bright}} electron beam in three dimensions and a high peak charge density. In order to compress an initially longer electron bunch generated from the photoinjector, magnetic bunch compression systems are widely employed. In this paper, first harmonic RF linearization and its associated requirements are reviewed. Meanwhile it is also briefly discussed what is the relation between a proper initial bunch length and main RF frequency, when a harmonic RF linearization is included. Then given a reasonable bunch compression ratio, a proper initial bunch length {{as a function of}} the main RF frequency and RF phase is estimated analytically by several approaches, assuming that no harmonic RF section is needed to linearize the energy modulation introduced during main RF acceleration, and at the same time still linearly compress the bunch length. Next the upper limit of the bunch compression ratio in a single stage is evaluated analytically. The analytical relations derived on choosing a proper initial bunch length as a function of main RF frequency are confirmed by numerical simulation. These simple limit provide rough estimations and may be beneficial for choosing bunch compression ratios in different stages of an FEL driver, especially in a first stage bunch compression where there is usually a harmonic RF linearization applied. It may also be useful in evaluating the possibility of low <b>charge</b> <b>operation</b> mode without any harmonic RF linearization, where a shorter initial bunch length can be achieved from the photoinjector. ...|$|E
40|$|Innovative {{technologies}} {{are required to}} meet ongoing challenges to reduce the CO 2 emissions from passenger cars and their fuel consumption. Such {{technologies are}} usually complex and require detailed analyses to deliver efficient, reliable systems. One proposed approach {{to meet these challenges}} is to use Direct Injection Stratified Charge (DISC) combustion systems, which consequently have received great interest, especially in Europe and Japan. A key component for realizing stable, lean operation in a DISC engine is the fuel injector. In this type of engine, the time available for fuel atomization and mixture preparation is significantly shorter than in conventional port fuel injected engines. Furthermore, the position of the spray and structure of the fuel cloud generated by the injector must remain stable, regardless of the speed and load, and must not be sensitive to in-cylinder cycle-to-cycle variations. The objectives of the work presented in this thesis were to investigate the spray formation, fuel distribution and combustion of sprays generated by the most common types of fuel injectors used for spray-guided DISC engines and thus {{gain a better understanding of}} the physical properties and parameters governing the mixture formation and combustion processes. The presented results were obtained from both spray chamber and single cylinder engine tests, using advanced laser-based measuring methods and high speed video photography in conjunction with measurements of emissions and standard engine operating parameters, such as pressure, temperature and heat release. In the investigations the main focus was on the stratified charge operating mode, due to its great potential to improve fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in parts of the speed-load operating range in which the efficiency is normally very low for conventional gasoline engines. The results show that two types of injectors (multi-hole and outward-opening A-nozzle injectors) can be used for spray-guided systems. The flexibility in terms of spray shape offered by multi-hole nozzles can be very advantageous, but the sprays they deliver have tendencies to over-penetrate and to create steep fuel concentration gradients near the spark plug. Furthermore, careful optimization of the multi-hole injector geometry is necessary to ensure misfire-free combustion in stratified <b>charge</b> <b>operation.</b> A-nozzles provide additional means to control the mixture formation since their needles are directly actuated by a piezo crystal, enabling multiple injections and variation of the fuel flow. The results show that this can help reduce the spray penetration and provide means to extend the operational window of misfire-free, stable stratified charge combustion in terms of both ignition and injection timing parameters. Furthermore, tests performed in an optical single-cylinder engine have shown that a DISC combustion system fitted with a piezo-actuated A-nozzle has the potential to lower the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by over 40 % at low load and speed when operated in stratified charge mode compared to homogenous <b>charge</b> <b>operation.</b> A further investigation showed that a dual-fluid air-assisted injector which uses compressed air to internally atomize the fuel displays favorable atomization properties, but limitations in possible injection timings due to high cylinder back-pressures and low fuel injection pressure severely limit the scope for using it when the engine is operated in stratified charge mode...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of consumers’ choices into the {{integration}} of mobility and power systems. It {{will contribute to the}} wider literature of electric vehicles-power systems integration by explicitly accounting for consumers’ preferences in shaping charging demand. This objective is achieved by developing a methodology to investigate electric vehicles (EV) charging choices in technological scenarios that enable smart <b>charging</b> <b>operations.</b> A modelling framework for the joint analysis of EV charging and activity-travel behaviour is introduced. This is based on an extension of traditional activity scheduling models that embeds the charging choice dimensions: namely the available energy after charging (that is related to the driving range) and the charging duration (defined here as the time elapsed from arrival at a charging facility until the desired battery level is achieved). This framework accommodates the interaction between charging behaviour and travel/activity behaviour, and allows us to capture the potential effects of charging service pricing and charging demand management policies on charging choices as well as along the timing dimension of travel/activity choices. A stated response survey instrument for estimating a tour-based operational version of the model is developed. Results from this empirical study provide insights into the value placed by individuals on the main attributes of the charging choice. The trade-offs between target battery levels and schedule delays potentially induced by long durations of the <b>charging</b> <b>operation</b> are also analysed.
