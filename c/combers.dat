5|$|The most {{significant}} predator of S.latus is the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus, although {{a number of}} other fish species have also been reported to prey on S.latus, including dusky groupers (Epinephelus guaza), <b>combers</b> (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), red groupers (Epinephelus morio) and gag groupers (Mycteroperca microlepis).

The painting has since been lost, but the instruments which he used to make it still survive, giving insights into mapmaking techniques of the day. The Peruzzi family, a big banking family and precursor to the Medici family went bankrupt in 1345, and in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool <b>combers</b> (ciompi). A few decades later they would rise in a full-scale revolt. In Verona, Mastino II della Scala began the construction of his Scaliger Tomb, an architectural structure still standing today.|$|E

[...] The tug had struck bottom at about 11:00a.m., and several huge <b>combers</b> broke over the vessel, aground on the south spit, soon thereafter, but after that the sea became calmer. [...] Vosburg cut loose the Nahelem, which drifted into calmer waters.|$|E
