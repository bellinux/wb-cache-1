Their sensing properties were tested at different temperatures (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 degrees C) {{when exposed to}} various oxygen concentrations. The as-prepared TNTA are amorphous and exhibit much higher carrier concentration than that of annealed TNTA. Such amorphous TNTA show much higher sensitivity than that of annealed TNTA, SrTiO 3 and Ga 2 O 3 sensors. This sample demonstrates the lowest detectable oxygen concentration of 200 ppm, excellent recovery and good linear correlation at 100 degrees C. These results indicate that TNTA are indeed very attractive oxygen-sensing materials...|$|R

40|$|Magnetron-sputtered iron {{films were}} potentiodynamically {{anodized}} at two different sweep rates to 50 V in an ethylene glycol electrolyte <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and water. At a high sweep rate of 1. 0 V s(- 1), a barrier-type anodic film was formed {{even though the}} current efficiency was as low as similar to 50 %.

The {{main part of the}} anodic films consists of iron (III) hydroxyfluoride with a thin inner layer composed of FeF 3. The inner fluoride layer is formed owing to the faster inward migration of fluoride ions compared to that of the oxygen species. During immersion or re-anodizing of the iron specimen with an approximately 100 -nm-thick, barrier-type anodic film at and below 15 V, thinning of the anodic film proceeded uniformly and film dissolution was enhanced by applying an electric field.

40|$|In this study, a {{solution}} <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (NH 4 F) and nitric acid (HNO 3) {{was used as}} an alternative to the conventional highly toxic pickling solution HF/HNO 3 for pickling weldments of selected stainless steels including Type 316 stainless steel (UNS S 31600), duplex stainless steel 2205 (UNS S 32205), and super duplex stainless steel 2507 (UNS S 32750). Electrochemical and surface analytical methods were used to understand the effects of pickling on the stainless steel weldments. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) test results indicated that the restoration of passivity of stainless steel weldments could be achieved by pickling the weldments in both HF/HNO 3 solution and NH 4 F/HNO 3 solutions. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the UNS S 32750 weldment surface revealed that both the HF/HNO 3 solution and the NH 4 F/HNO 3 solution could remove the heat tint on the weldment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that treatment in these two pickling solutions produced passive films with similar characteristics. Thus, this work suggests that the NH 4 F/HNO 3 solution is a promising alternative to HF/HNO 3 solution for the pickling of stainless steel weldments, and that the CPP test approach can be used in conjunction with surface analytical methods for further development of safer and environmentally friendly picklingsolutions...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{removal from}} both air {{emissions}} and industrial wastewater are key {{targets for the}} environmental sustainability strategy to ensure a healthy environment for future generation. The formation of self-organized titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanotubes without bundling is essential for high efficiency in mercury removal. Thus, this research aims to study {{on the development of}} an efficient WO 3 -loaded TiO 2 nanotubes catalyst for the removal of mercury ions. WO 3 -loaded TiO 2 nanotubes were synthesized through single step electrochemical anodization technique by using tungsten as the cathodic material instead of the conventionally used platinum electrode. As compared with platinum, tungsten (W) metal has lower chemical stability, forming dissolved ions (W 6 +) in the electrolyte. The W 6 + ions then moved towards the titanium foil and formed a coherent deposit on titanium foil. In fact, coupling TiO 2 with W 6 + species will lead to an additional electronic state in the band-gap, which in turn affect a change in the electronic and functionality of TiO 2 itself. Comprehensive investigations on different parameters, such as composition of electrolyte, anodization time, and anodization voltage were conducted in order to control the specific architecture of nanotubes. Highly ordered WO 3 -loaded TiO 2 nanotube films (0. 22 to 3. 29 at% of W) were successfully synthesized through anodization of titanium (Ti) foil in ethylene glycol <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (NH 4 F). It was found that this resultant WO 3 -loaded TiO 2 nanotubes demonstrated a maximum mercury removal rate of 91 % in 120 minutes. This performance was approximately 1. 4 times higher than the pure TiO 2 nanotubes. The presence of W element in TiO 2 showed an improvement of mercury removal efficiency because it acted as an effective mediator to trap the photo-induced electrons and minimize the recombination of charge carriers...|$|R
30|$|Vertically aligned {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO 2) nanotubes were synthesized by electrochemical anodic oxidation in an electrolyte solution <b>containing</b> 0.45  wt% <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (NH 4 F) and 2  vol% deionized water at constant potential (70  V) for various anodization {{time at the}} room temperature. The influence of the anodization time on the morphology and optical properties of the anodic TiO 2 nanotubes have been studied. Field emission scanning electron microscopy results revealed that the anodic TiO 2 nanotube morphology extremely depends on the anodization time. It was observed that by increasing anodization time, length of the anodic TiO 2 nanotubes increased and nanotubes destroyed {{at the top of}} the tubes. After a long time of anodization process (9  h), nanotubes completely destroyed. Photoluminescence measurements showed that the anodic TiO 2 nanotube band gap energy depends on the anodic TiO 2 nanotube morphology. The anodic TiO 2 nanotubes without any damage had a minimum band gap energy (2.9 eV).|$|R
40|$|Despite the predictions, {{the true}} {{potential}} of Nb 2 O 5 for electrochromic applications {{has yet to}} be fully realized. In this work, three-dimensional (3 D) compact and well-ordered nanoporous Nb 2 O 5 films are synthesized by the electrochemical anodization of niobium thin films. These films are formed using RF sputtering and then anodized in an electrolyte <b>containing</b> ethylene glycol, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> and small water content (4 %) at 50 °C which resulted in low embedded impurities within the structure. Characterization of the anodized films shows that a highly crystalline orthorhombic phase of Nb 2 O 5 is obtained after annealing at 450 °C. The 3 D structure provides a template consisting of a large concentration of active sites for ion intercalation, while also ensuring low scattering directional paths for electrons. These features enhance the coloration efficiency to 47. 0 cm 2 C - 1 (at 550 nm) for a 500 nm thick film upon Li + ion intercalation. Additionally, the Nb 2 O 5 electrochromic device shows a high bleached state transparency and large optical modulation...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{possibility}} of obtaining iron and titanium-vanadium concentrates with highest contents of iron and titanium, respectively, through hydrometallurgical processing of the titanomagnetite ores of the Chineisk deposit. We varied two key parameters to determine {{the efficiency of the}} process: (a) concentration of leaching solution (ammonium fluoride); and (b) acidity of solution. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration was varied from 0. 08 mol/L to 4. 2 mol/L with the other fixed parameters. It was shown that optimum <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration for leaching the ore is 0. 42 mol/L; at these concentrations iron and titanium contents are about 62. 8 wt % and 3. 5 wt % in solid phase, respectively. The acidity of solution was changed by adding of hydrofluoric acid with varied concentration (from 0. 86 mol/L to 4. 07 mol/L) to <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution with fixed concentration of 0. 42 mol/L. The best results (degree of titanium extraction = 63. 7 %) were obtained when using a solution of hydrofluoric acid with concentration 4. 07 mol/L.

Method. Nitrate of strontium, neodymium nitrate hexahydrate, with the content equal to 99. 99 % of the basic substance and <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> were used {{as the source of}} substances. Activated powders of strontium fluoride were obtained by the method of deposition from aqueous solutions by washing the precipitate with a solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> taken over 114 - 120 % from stoichiometry. The washed precipitate was centrifuged for 5 - 7 min, dried in the air at 30 - 350 C. Heat treatment of the dried precipitate was carried out in two stages: the first stage at the temperature of 200 - 2500 C for 0. 5 - 1 hour, the second one at 550 - 6000 C for 2 - 3 hours. X-ray analysis of the synthesized samples was carried out on a Bruker D 8 Advance diffractometer, radiation Cu K. The size and shape measuring of the particles of activated strontium fluoride was carried out by means of electron microscope Carl Zeiss NVision 40. The content of neodymium in activated powders of strontium fluoride was determined by the method of spectral emission analysis on the device LEA - S 500. Chemical analysis for determination of ammonium ion (NH 4 +) content in the obtained samples was performed by the method of Kjeldahl. Calculations of lattice parameters, size of coherent scattering regions and the values of micro-deformations were carried out by TOPAS program. Main Results.
