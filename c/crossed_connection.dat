40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{implementation}} of an asynchronous arbiter for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which can reduce failures caused by metastability of RS flip-flop (RSFF). We adopt a binary tree structure of 2 -input arbiters, {{which is called}} a tree arbiter. The tree arbiter has hierarchical structure of 2 -input arbiters, in which each 2 -input arbiter selects {{one of the two}} requests progressively. The tree arbiter can prevent increase of latency and has also an advantage in throughput. The 2 -input arbiter has glitch killer circuits in order to prevent the failures caused by metastability of RSFF. However, it is impossible to implement the glitch killer circuits into FPGA. Therefore, we propose a method for preventing such failures applicable to FPGA. We also analyze the metastability of RSFF implemented with a <b>crossed</b> <b>connection</b> of logic blocks. Finally we generate a circuit model from implemented FPGA in order to take place an analysis by SPICE. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>connection</b> {{control and}} {{backflow}} prevention {{are not a}} new concern. All states {{have some type of}} law or regulation for the control of <b>cross</b> <b>connections</b> and/or backflow prevention. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) held stakeholder meetings in 2003, where the possibility of a national regulation requiring water systems to have a <b>cross</b> <b>connection</b> control program was discussed. A national regulation for <b>cross</b> <b>connection</b> control will impact the 49, 497 Community Water Systems (CWS) and 19, 668 Nontransient and Noncommunity Water Systems (NTNCWS) in the U. S. that serve 10, 000 or fewer persons (USEPA 2003). This report presents a methodology to estimate the national cost for a <b>cross</b> <b>connection</b> control program for these water systems. The accuracy of any cost estimating model is determined by the quality of data available to develop the model. Unfortunately, very little reliable data is available for estimating the cost of cross-connection control programs in small water system. Because the existing underlying data are not strong, only an “order of magnitude ” level estimate can be developed at this time. Project Approach. In this study, the total national water system cost is estimated b...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel neural network {{structure}} called CrossNets, which considers architectures on directed acyclic graphs.

The addition of <b>cross</b> <b>connections</b> among the network increases information flow {{across the whole}} network, leading to better training and testing performances. The superior performance of the network is tested against four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CIFAR- 100, and SVHN.
