40|$|Abstract—TV {{sets and}} {{companion}} devices (Smartphones, Tablets, etc.) have outgrown their original purpose {{and are now}} playing together {{an important role to}} offer the best user experience on multiple screens. However, the collaboration be-tween TV and <b>companion</b> <b>applications</b> faces challenges that go beyond traditional single screen applications. These range from discovery, wake-up and pairing of devices, to application launch, communication, synchronization and adaptation to target device and screen size. In this position paper, we will limit ourselves to the Remote Launch aspect and introduce an idea for a new mechanism for launching <b>companion</b> <b>applications</b> using iBeacon technology...|$|R

40|$|Television viewers {{interacting}} with second screens {{has become a}} common sight in the modern living room. Such activities are a mixture of related, semi-related, and non-related browsing of content. This growing trend is revolutionising the way that broadcasters think about their content. Through the envisioned connected home, driven by end-to-end IP connected networks, television content creators and app developers are now considering the design space for multi-device, interactive experiences. In this review paper, we consider the pre-digital beginnings of such scenarios, and progress to discuss how the introduction of mobile devices has affected the TV viewing experience. We discuss dual-screen usage over a variety of contexts in the connected home, {{with a focus on}} ‘designed’ dual-screen experiences such as <b>companion</b> <b>applications.</b> We conclude with reflections on the future of this area so that app developers, broadcasters, and academics may push further the space and improve future dual- and multi-screen experiences...|$|R

5000|$|Jaybird's fitness tracker, [...] "Reign", {{released}} in 2014, {{was met with}} mixed reviews. Many reviewers praised its ability to determine the optimal time for a user to exercise by tracking their heart rate variability, but criticized its <b>companion</b> mobile <b>application.</b> Slashgear reviewer Nate Swanner wrote, [...] "Reign is {{just as good as}} anything else out there, and much better for workout enthusiasts than many. Start comparing platforms, though, and Reign has a lot of work ahead of it." [...] In her critical review for PC Magazine, author Jill Duffy surmised: [...] "The Jaybird Reign puts unique functionality into an all-day activity tracker and mobile app, but it ignores basic features that make fitness gadgets truly usable." ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} rise in {{popularity}} of wearable personal health monitoring devices, {{a number of}} concerns regarding user privacy are raised, specifically with regard to how the providers of these devices {{make use of the}} data obtained from these devices, and the protections that user data enjoys. With waterproof monitors intended to be worn 24 hours per day, and <b>companion</b> smartphone <b>applications</b> able to offer analysis and sharing of activity data, we investigate and compare the privacy policies of four services, {{and the extent to which}} these services protect user privacy, as we find these services do not fall within the scope of existing legislation regarding the privacy of health data. We then present a set of criteria which would preserve user privacy, and avoid the concerns identified within the policies of the services investigated...|$|R

40|$|Inimex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is {{a privately}} held {{biopharmaceutical}} company {{dedicated to the}} discovery, development and commercialization of new human medicines based on the selective modulation of the innate immune response. Since Inimex&# 146;s background is in human drug development, no formal animal health activities {{have been a part}} of Inimex operations. This initial analysis shows that Inimex has opportunity in the animal health market. Inimex is in a good place to evaluate a potential revenue-generating growth opportunity that could also develop in-house capabilities and positively increase Inimex&# 146;s public profile for future investors. The primary recommendation is the strong encouragement for Inimex to pursue the development of a medicine for <b>companion</b> animal <b>application.</b> For maximum short term revenue, Inimex should bring the medicine into INADA trials then negotiate a deal before entering more resource intensive clinical field trials...|$|R
5000|$|Firefox Home was a <b>companion</b> <b>application</b> for the iPhone and iPod Touch {{based on}} the Firefox Sync technology.

The company subsequently released the source code of Firefox Home's underlying synchronization software.|$|E
50|$|The Pressy team {{initiated}} a design {{change to the}} Pressy key-chain holder after the project was funded, which evoked mixed response among the backers. On June 4, 2014, a customer service representative for Pressy posted on the company's Facebook page that the <b>companion</b> <b>application</b> would not be offered through the Google Play store and {{would need to be}} sideloaded. The news contradicted prior promises made to Kickstarter Backers that the application would be available through the Google Play store, and backers voiced their concern on Pressy's social media outlets. Pressy would later state that the representative made an error, and stated that the application would be offered through the Google Play Store as previously reported, attaching photos of pre-printed packages containing the Google Play logo as a proof.|$|E

40|$|Smart mobile {{devices are}} {{becoming}} increasingly essential daily <b>companions.</b> <b>Applications</b> (apps) are the interface through which the consumer can leverage unique capabilities of smart mobile devices to interact with people, other devices and firms via the supporting mobile ecosystem. Smart mobile devices and apps are influencing how competition is defined and changing how firms do business by improving internal processes and increasing flexibility and convenience for customers. Mobile apps and devices enable users to move from a portable and mobile communication and computing environment {{to that of a}} ubiquitous communication and computing environment [u-space]. Discussion in terms of ‘mobile marketing’ is therefore too limiting, our understanding should be ‘ubiquitous marketing’. Six papers explore ubiquitous marketing further. The retail sector provides a contextual setting for paper one and finds that mobile marketing increases value for retailers and consumers. Integration of all retailer / consumer interfaces with mobile marketing to maximise exposure and connectivity between both parties is recommended. Paper two investigates the sources for mobile app ideas in companies and finds that apps developed externally or within the firm with some outside help, were perceived to be more effective. Apps that leverage the mobile devices unique features is central to the methodology proposed for developing an app in paper three. The next three papers examine the impact that mobile apps and devices have on business activities and customer relationships. Paper four finds increased operational efficiency in a Dental  Practice, while paper five identified the opportunity for increased firm-customer interaction in a medical context. Paper six determines that rather than five dimensions of SERVQUAL, financial service quality of apps consists of three dimensions: Reliability, personal and visibles; and that service success can be derived from providing less service. This thesis contributes to a fuller understanding of U-commerce theory. It advances understanding in how apps are making significant changes in how information technology is managed and controlled from an organisational perspective, and how these technology advances can influence consumer interaction.   QC 20160516 </p...|$|R
