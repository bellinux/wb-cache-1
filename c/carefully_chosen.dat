5|$|Transgenic crops {{have been}} made to express dsRNA, <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> to silence crucial genes in target pests. These dsRNAs are {{designed}} to affect only insects that express specific gene sequences. As a proof of principle, in 2009 a study showed RNAs that could kill any one of four fruit fly species while not harming the other three.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, Arnold {{drew the}} British fleet to a {{position}} he had <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> to limit their advantages. In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed. That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, {{and more of the}} fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point. Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort's buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

5|$|The United States Senate {{inquiry into}} {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and {{continued}} there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C.. John Jacob Astor IV {{was one of the people}} who perished on its ill-fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith (Republican, Michigan) as chair, Jonathan Bourne (Republican, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (Republican, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (Democrat, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (Republican, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (Democrat, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> to represent the conservative, moderate and liberal wings of the two parties.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E

25|$|Each filter uses {{a pair of}} solutions, {{comprising}} specific {{amounts of}} distilled water, copper sulfate, mannite, pyridine, sulfuric acid, cobalt, and ammonium sulfate. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white.|$|E
25|$|This {{solution}} {{has many}} unusual properties—in particular, {{the existence of}} closed timelike curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in {{that the value of}} the cosmological constant must be <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> to match the density of the dust grains, but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example.|$|E

Samenthai consolidated the gains of his father, and fought back Lanna in Chiang Saen during the 1390s. In 1402 he received formal recognition for Lan Xang from the Ming Empire in China.|$|E

25|$|A low total IgE {{level is}} not {{adequate}} {{to rule out}} sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens. Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios {{have been used to}} examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other. These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with allergy tests for specific IgE antibodies for a <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> of allergens is often warranted.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{complete}} set of forbidden minors remaining unknown, {{it is possible to}} test whether a given graph is an apex graph, and if so, to find an apex for the graph, in linear time. More generally, for any fixed constant k, it is possible to recognize in linear time the k-apex graphs, the graphs in which the removal of some <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> set of at most k vertices leads to a planar graph. If k is variable, however, the problem is NP-complete.|$|E

25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed in 1893, the WFM shared the AFL's conservatism. But its experiences {{going up against}} Mine Owners' Associations and their allies convinced the WFM that acting in a non-threatening manner wasn't going to accomplish anything worthwhile. Many union members had begun to reconsider their conservative assumptions about confrontation and violence. By the late 1890s, the WFM believed {{that it would have}} to go toe to toe with mine owners and other employers. The WFM even considered creating rifle clubs for <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> members.|$|E
25|$|Editor John Shaftesley's <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> words, while clearly {{articulating}} Anglo-Jewry's abhorrence, {{can also}} {{be interpreted as a}} plea to British society not to blame Anglo-Jewry for the 'cold-blooded murder of the two British sergeants,' or to seek revenge against the community. Shaftesley's plea was ignored by some, and during the bank holiday weekend, which began on August 1, 1947, and throughout the following week, British Jews across the country felt the powerful impact of the Irgun murders, facing a sharp rise in hatred, abuse and ultimately rioting.|$|E
25|$|The tracker {{needs to}} record {{particle}} paths accurately yet be lightweight {{so as to}} disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10µm, {{a fraction of the}} width of a human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore <b>carefully</b> <b>chosen</b> to resist radiation.|$|E
