5|$|Berhtwald (died 731) was {{the ninth}} Archbishop of Canterbury in England. Documentary {{evidence}} names Berhtwald as abbot at Reculver before his election as archbishop. Berhtwald begins the first <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of native-born Archbishops of Canterbury, although {{there had been}} previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops, they had not succeeded each other until Berhtwald's reign.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls, {{sometimes}} called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe, are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they {{are some of the}} earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> like the English.|$|E

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E
5|$|The {{example of}} the royal exchequer's records {{eventually}} influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls {{are those of the}} Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.|$|E

5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back – in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
25|$|An early {{model for}} {{fractional}} crystallization, which explained why {{certain types of}} mineral tend to be found together in igneous rocks, was Bowen's reaction series, formulated in 1922. He found that, as magma crystallizes, it separates into two series: a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of minerals that continuously adjusts their composition through interactions with the melt, and a discontinuous series of minerals that remain fixed in composition as they cool. Thus, the type of mineral indicates the temperature at which it was formed.|$|E
40|$|We study {{non-parametric}} {{measures for}} the problem of comparing distributions, which arise in anomaly detection for <b>continuous</b> time <b>series.</b> Non-parametric measures take two distributions as input and produce two numbers as output: {{the difference between the}} input distributions and the statistical significance of this difference. Some of these measures, such as Kullback-Leibler measure, are defined for comparing probability distribution functions (PDFs) and some others, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov measure, are for cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). We first show how to adapt the PDF based measures to compare CDFs, resulting in a total of 23 CDF based measures. We then provide a unified functional form that subsumes all these measures. We present our methodology to determine the significance (of the measures) by simulations only. Finally, we evaluate these measures for the anomaly detection in <b>continuous</b> time <b>series.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting future {{electricity}} load {{represents one of}} the most prominent areas of electrical engineering, in which artificial neural networks (NN) are routinely applied in practice. The common approach to overcome the complexity of building NNs for high-frequency load data is to segment the time series into simpler and more homogeneous subseries, e. g. seven subseries of hourly loads of only Mondays, Tuesdays etc. These are forecasted independently, using a separate NN model, and then recombined to provide a complete trace forecast for the next days ahead. Despite the empirical importance of load forecasting, and the high operational cost associated with forecast errors, the potential benefits of segmenting time series into subseries have not been evaluated in an empirical comparison. This paper assesses the accuracy of segmenting <b>continuous</b> time <b>series</b> into daily subseries, versus forecasting the original, <b>continuous</b> time <b>series</b> with NNs. Accuracy on hourly UK load data is provided in a valid experimental design, using multiple rolling time origins and robust error metrics in comparison to statistical benchmark algorithms. Results indicate the superior performance of NN on <b>continuous,</b> non-segmented time <b>series,</b> in contrast to best practices in research, practice and software implementations...|$|R

25|$|Whymper was {{convinced}} that the Matterhorn's precipitous appearance when viewed from Zermatt was an optical illusion, and that the dip of the strata, which on the Italian side formed a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> of overhangs, should make the opposite side a natural staircase. This party of four was joined by Hudson and Croz, and the inexperienced Douglas Hadow. Their attempt by what is now the normal route, the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party. On the descent, Hadow slipped and fell onto Croz, dislodging him and dragging Douglas and Hudson to their deaths; the rope parted, saving the other three.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distortions of}} the rhombicub{{octahedron}} that, {{while some of}} the faces are not regular polygons, are still vertex-uniform. Some of these can be made by taking a cube or octahedron and cutting off the edges, then trimming the corners, so the resulting polyhedron has six square and twelve rectangular faces. These have octahedral symmetry and form a <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> between the cube and the octahedron, analogous to the distortions of the rhombicosidodecahedron or the tetrahedral distortions of the cuboctahedron. However, the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set of distortions with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces, which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather Th symmetry, so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections.|$|E
25|$|While its {{rivalry with}} the University of Michigan is its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both Big Ten Conference rivals, those of Indiana and Illinois. The series versus Indiana {{began as a}} non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4–0–1. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 70-8-4 through the 2014 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0–1–1) but became the longest <b>continuous</b> <b>series</b> in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th {{consecutive}} year (that record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2014 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 66-30–4. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat {{of the regular season}} by the Illini.|$|E

This cold and salty source water is oxygen-poor, yet above the hypoxic threshold, dissolved oxygen < 1. 4 ml l⁻¹. Once on the shelf, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of upwelled near-bottom waters are modified by physical and biological shelf processes, such as advection, mixing and microbial respiration. The influences of shelf processes on near-bottom DO concentrations on tidal, event and seasonal time scales are investigated using moored <b>continuous</b> time <b>series</b> and underwater glider cross-shelf transects over the Heceta and Stonewall Bank complex (HSBC) off central Oregon.

[...] Prior to the last ice age, Kitchen Creek and Phillips Creek to the east had drainage basins of similar area and slope, and both watersheds were confined to the Allegheny Front. This changed when receding glaciers formed temporary dams on two of Kitchen Creek's neighboring streams on the Allegheny Plateau, South Branch Bowman Creek to the northeast and Big Run, a tributary of Fishing Creek to the northwest. The headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek were very close to those for the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek, and the headwaters for Big Run were very close to those for the Ganoga Glen branch.|$|E
