5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises <b>Cupressaceae</b> such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|E
25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the <b>Cupressaceae</b> {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of <b>Cupressaceae</b> and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and leafless through the winter. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the <b>Cupressaceae,</b> and Pinus in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E
25|$|In the {{families}} Podocarpaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Taxaceae, and one <b>Cupressaceae</b> genus (Juniperus), the scales are soft, fleshy, sweet and brightly colored, and are eaten by fruit-eating birds, which then pass the seeds in their droppings. These fleshy scales are (except in Juniperus) known as arils. In {{some of these}} conifers (e.g. most Podocarpaceae), the cone consists of several fused scales, while in others (e.g. Taxaceae), the cone is reduced to just one seed scale or (e.g. Cephalotaxaceae) the several scales of a cone develop into individual arils, giving {{the appearance of a}} cluster of berries.|$|E
25|$|Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia; {{also known}} as giant redwood, Sierra redwood, Sierran redwood, Wellingtonia or simply Big Treea {{nickname}} used by John Muir) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods, classified in the family <b>Cupressaceae</b> in the subfamily Sequoioideae, together with Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood). The common use of the name sequoia generally refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.|$|E
25|$|The {{conifers}} are now {{accepted as}} comprising seven families, {{with a total}} of 65–70 genera and 600–630 species (696 accepted names). The seven most distinct families are linked in the box above right and phylogenetic diagram left. In other interpretations, the Cephalotaxaceae may be better included within the Taxaceae, and some authors additionally recognize Phyllocladaceae as distinct from Podocarpaceae (in which it is included here). The family Taxodiaceae is here included in family <b>Cupressaceae,</b> but was widely recognized in the past and can still be found in many field guides. A new classification and linear sequence based on molecular data can be found in an article by Christenhusz etal.|$|E
25|$|In Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, Sciadopityaceae {{and most}} <b>Cupressaceae,</b> the cones are woody, and when mature the scales usually spread open {{allowing}} the seeds {{to fall out}} and be dispersed by the wind. In some (e.g. firs and cedars), the cones disintegrate to release the seeds, and in others (e.g. the pines that produce pine nuts) the nut-like seeds are dispersed by birds (mainly nutcrackers, and jays), which break up the specially adapted softer cones. Ripe cones may remain on the plant for a varied amount of time before falling to the ground; in some fire-adapted pines, the seeds may be stored in closed cones for up to 60–80 years, being released only when a fire kills the parent tree.|$|E
25|$|The {{woody plants}} of the Antarctic Floristic Kingdom include {{conifers}} in the families Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae and the subfamily Callitroideae of <b>Cupressaceae,</b> and angiosperms {{such as the}} families Proteaceae, Griseliniaceae, Cunoniaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Winteraceae, and genera like southern beech (Nothofagus) and fuchsia (Fuchsia). Many other families of flowering plants and ferns, including the tree fern Dicksonia, are characteristic of the Antarctic flora. In the past Tasmania was omitted since its plant species are {{more closely related to}} those found in the Australian Floristic Kingdom. Good noted, as had Joseph Dalton Hooker much earlier, that many plant species of Antarctica, temperate South America and New Zealand were very closely related, despite their disjunction by the vast Southern Ocean. Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct in Australia mainland.|$|E
500|$|The basin for The Big Cypress {{receives}} {{on average}} [...] {{of water in}} the rainy season. Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thin layer of limestone that contains quartz, creating a sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation. The majority of trees are bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and not true cypresses (<b>Cupressaceae).</b> Cypresses are conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called [...] "knees".|$|E
500|$|The amber {{specimen}} [...] "AMNH NJ-90", which {{preserved the}} two holotypes, also preserved {{a number of}} other inclusions that give indications as to what the ecology of Archaeomarasmius may have been. [...] Of the approximately forty insect inclusions present, flies in the families Ceratopogonidae and Chironomidae, together with caddisflies of the order Trichoptera, suggest that the mushroom was growing near fresh water. Beetles from the family Elateridae, a termite and a pseudoscorpion, in addition to the mushroom, are indicators of rotting wood, probably from a tree in the <b>Cupressaceae</b> family. [...] Modern Marasmiaceae members are saprobic—obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter—and specimens included with Archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for the mushroom.|$|E
2500|$|A. mirabilis {{is found}} in {{association}} with other conifers, including Pararaucaria patagonica (not {{to be confused with}} the synonym Proaraucaria patagonica of A. mirabilis), and Araucarites sanctaecrucis. P. patagonica is also known from cones. It has no living descendants and its closest living relatives appear to be members of the modern family <b>Cupressaceae</b> (cypresses). [...] A. sanctaecrucis fossils consist of foliage and branches.|$|E
2500|$|The female seed cones of some {{conifers}} have fleshy and merged scales, {{giving them}} a berry-like appearance. Juniper [...] "berries" [...] (family <b>Cupressaceae),</b> in particular those of Juniperus communis, are used to flavour gin. The seed cones of species in the Podocarpaceae and Taxaceae families have a bright colour when fully developed, increasing the resemblance to true berries. The [...] "berries" [...] of yews (Taxus species) consist of a female seed cone with which develops a fleshy red aril partially enclosing the poisonous seed.|$|E
2500|$|One year {{reproductive}} cycle:The genera includes Abies, Picea, Cedrus, Pseudotsuga, Tsuga, Keteleeria (Pinaceae) and Cupressus, Thuja, Cryptomeria, Cunninghamia and Sequoia (<b>Cupressaceae).</b> Female strobili are {{initiated in}} late summer or fall in a year, then they overwinter. Female strobili emerge followed by pollination in the following spring [...] Fertilization takes place in summer of the following year, only 3–4 months after pollination. Cones mature and seeds are then shed {{by the end of}} that same year. Pollination and fertilization occurs in a single growing season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of described fossils {{have been found}} and described from Burmese amber. The Asian specimens were recovered from unspecified deposits in the Hukawng Valley of Kachin State, Myanmar. [...] Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U-Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 99 million years old, close to {{the boundary between the}} Aptian and Cenomanian. [...] The amber is suggested to have formed in a tropical environment around 5° north latitude and the resin to have been produced by either an Araucariaceae or <b>Cupressaceae</b> species tree.|$|E
2500|$|Two-year {{reproductive}} cycle:The genera includes [...] Widdringtonia, Sequoiadendron (<b>Cupressaceae)</b> {{and most}} species of Pinus. Female strobilus initials are formed {{in late summer}} or fall [...] then overwinter. It emerges and receives pollen {{in the first year}} spring and become conelets. The conelet goes through another winter rest and in the spring of the 2nd year. The [...] Archegonia form in the conelet and fertilization of the archegonia occurs by early summer of the 2nd year, so the pollination-fertilization interval exceeds a year. After fertilization, the conelet is considered an immature cone. Maturation occurs by autumn of the 2nd year, at which time seeds are shed. [...] In summary, the 1-year and the 2-year cycles differ mainly in the duration of the pollination- fertilization interval.|$|E
2500|$|Sequoia sempervirens [...] is {{the sole}} living species of the genus Sequoia in the cypress family <b>Cupressaceae</b> (formerly treated in Taxodiaceae). Common names include coast redwood, coastal redwood and California redwood. It is an evergreen, long-lived, {{monoecious}} tree living 1,200–1,800 years or more. This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to [...] in height (without the roots) and up to [...] in diameter at breast height (dbh). These trees are also among the oldest living things on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated [...] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.|$|E
