40|$|The flag-transitive {{automorphism}} {{groups of}} the Tits generalized quadrangle T 2 (O 4) are classified up to conjugacy in Aut(T 2 (O 4)). Basing on the classification, it is shown {{that there is no}} flag-transitive <b>circular</b> <b>extension</b> of T 2 (O 4) or of its dual other than those constructed in [6]. This result completes the classification of flag-transitive extensions of T 2 (O 4) and its dual. 1. Introduction In this paper, the complete classification is given for the flag-transitive <b>circular</b> <b>extensions</b> of the Tits generalized quadrangle T 2 (O 4) as well as its dual for a hyperoval O 4 in PG(2; 4). See corollary 4. 5 for the precise statement. Such geometries are classified in [6] under two assumptions; a restriction on the structure of automorphism groups and the so called (LL) property. The latter turns out to be superfluous. In this paper, we remove the former assumption by giving a complete classification of flag-transitive automorphism groups of T 2 (O 4). [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} China&rsquo;s Agricultural Technology Extension (ATE) System {{since its inception in}} 1920 s. China&rsquo;s ATE system has gone through 5 stages before the current system was formed. It evolved from basic-level <b>extension</b> <b>network</b> in 1950 s, mid-level extension organizations in 1960 s，gradually into nation-wide extension system in 1980 s. The participative <b>extension</b> <b>network</b> was reconstructed during &ldquo;the Cultural Revolution&rdquo; period. The reform of extension system of China has been intensified since 1992 and the five-level Agricultural Technology Extension organizations were basically established. Compared with those previous ones, the current extension system is much better in its setting hierarchy, functions and extension efficiency. However, at present, China&rsquo;s ATE system is also facing such problems as investment deficiency, low-quality and redundant extension team, failure to meet the market needs and government domination, etc. Based on these problems, some reform directions and measures to perfect China&rsquo;s ATE system are proposed.

A broadly circular definition has a larger circle of words.
