Assuming a shape for the natural distribution of the ambient plasma and employing the scalar approximation, the on-board moments can be represented as non-linear integral functions of the underlying distribution. We have implemented an algorithm which inverts this system successfully over a wide range of parameters for an assumed underlying drifting Maxwellian distribution. The outputs of the solver are the corrected electron plasma temperature Te, density Ne and velocity vector Ve. We also make an estimation of the temperature anisotropy A of the distribution. We present <b>corrected</b> <b>moment</b> data from Cluster's PEACE experiment for a range of plasma environments and make comparisons with electron and ion data from other Cluster instruments, as well as the equivalent ground-based calculations using full 3 -D distribution PEACE telemetry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractParasites are {{typically}} aggregated within their host populations. The most heavily infected hosts are frequently cited as targets for optimal disease control. Yet a heavily infected individual {{is not necessarily}} highly infective and does not automatically contribute {{a higher proportion of}} infective parasitic stages than a host with fewer parasites. Here, Pseudamphistomum truncatum (Opisthorchiida) parasitic infection within the definitive otter host (Lutra lutra) is used as a model system. The hypothesis tested is that variation in parasite abundance, aggregation and egg production (fecundity, as a proxy of host infectivity) can be explained by abiotic (season and region) or biotic (host age, sex and body condition) factors. Parasite abundance was affected most strongly by the biotic factors of age and body condition, such that adults and otters with a higher condition index had heavier infections than sub-adults or those with a lower condition index, whilst {{there were no significant differences}} in parasite abundance among the seasons, regions (ecological regions defined by river catchment boundaries) or host sexes. Conversely, parasite aggregation was affected most strongly by the abiotic factors of season and region, which were supported by four different measures of parasite aggregation (the <b>corrected</b> <b>moment</b> estimate k, Taylor’s Power Law, the Index of Discrepancy D, and Boulinier’s J). Pseudamphistomum truncatum was highly aggregated within otters, with aggregation stronger in the Midlands (England) and Wales than in the southwestern region of the United Kingdom. Overall, more parasites were found in fewer hosts during the summer, which coincides with the summer peak in parasite fecundity. Combined, these data suggest that (i) few otters carry the majority of P. truncatum parasites and that there are more infective stages (eggs) produced during summer; and (ii) abiotic factors are most influential when describing parasite aggregation whilst biotic factors have a greater role in defining parasite abundance. Together, parasite abundance, aggregation and fecundity can help predict which hosts make the largest contribution to the spread of infectious diseases...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{likelihood}} is a {{very popular}} method and has been widely used {{in the fields of}} artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining as tablets and mobile application and social media dominate the technology landscape. This paper proposes an empirical likelihood shrinkage method to efficiently estimate unknown parameters and select <b>correct</b> <b>moment</b> conditions simultaneously, when the model is defined by moment restrictions in which some are possibly misspecified. We show that our method enjoys oracle-like properties; that is, it consistently selects the <b>correct</b> <b>moment</b> conditions {{and at the same time}} its estimator is as efficient as the empirical likelihood estimator obtained by all <b>correct</b> <b>moment</b> conditions. Moreover, unlike the GMM, our proposed method allows us to carry out confidence regions for the parameters included in the model without estimating the covariances of the estimators. For empirical implementation, we provide some data-driven procedures for selecting the tuning parameter of the penalty function. The simulation results show that the method works remarkably well in terms of <b>correct</b> <b>moment</b> selection and the finite sample properties of the estimators. Also, a real-life example is carried out to illustrate the new methodology...|$|R

40|$|Identifying the {{relativistic}} multipole {{moments of}} a spacetime of an astrophysical object {{that has been}} constructed numerically is of major interest, both because the multipole moments are intimately related to the internal structure of the object, and because {{the construction of a}} suitable analytic metric that mimics a numerical metric should be based on the multipole moments of the latter one, in order to yield a reliable representation.
