An additional file is provided that deals with the estimation of the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the two events (see Additional file 1).

Given the similar <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the two events, the stress drop for the 2004 event is expected to be much larger because the seismic moment of the 2004 event is larger by a factor of about 12 than that for the 2016 event (Brune 1970, 1971). Stress drop may be considered as one of the parameters that control {{the strength}} of high-frequency radiation (Boore 1983). In fact, as mentioned above, the observed PGAs were clearly underestimated by the GMPEs for the 2004 event, while the prediction was reasonable for the 2016 event. Together, these observations may indicate that the 2004 event was a higher stress drop event.|$|R
