We propose the explanation of this oscillation. Preliminary analysis indicates that the cylinder could oscillate incessantly by initial positional perturbation or incoming flow fluctuation. It is the unbalance force acting on the cylinder’s side faces that causes such movement. On one side, the flow will be flow-past-flat-plate like, whereas the other side will be flow-past-sharp-edge like. Due to the unbalanced pressure exerting on the two sides, the cylinder rotates. When the cylinder moves, these mechanisms switch side interchangeably, and bring the cylinder to <b>continuous</b> <b>oscillation...</b>|$|E

40|$|For many {{electronic}} devices where air cooling is the norm, heat loads {{continue to increase}} and are projected to soon require a transition to liquid cooling, where more efficient thermal energy transport is achievable due to better fluid properties. In most scenarios, a liquid cooled solution entails a bulk fluid motion traveling past a heated surface, but flows that oscillate back and forth also show promise. However, before this is realized, some fundamental performance models must be extended. This paper focuses on characterizing {{the dynamics of the}} flow inside a U-tube manometer under <b>continuous</b> <b>oscillation.</b> For oscillating flow, the dimensionless parameter of interest is the Womersley number (W_ 0) or the Valensi number (V_a) (one can simply be expressed in terms of the other), and can be used to predict velocity profiles of oscillating flow. In this study, an air blower is utilized to force the fluid to move inside a U-tube manometer by providing an oscillating pressure signal. The dynamic response is the key metric of interest in this work, and is characterized by experimentally measuring the resonance frequency (ω_n) and the damping ratio (ζ), the latter of which is dependent on frictional losses. When the working fluid is under <b>continuous</b> <b>oscillation,</b> additional sources of frictional losses exist, and a non-standard analysis is needed to adequately predict the damping. The dynamic response is measured for different amounts of fluid in a range of tube sizes and empirical correlations are developed to better predict the observed data. Results suggest that the velocity profiles under <b>continuous</b> <b>oscillation</b> are not parabolic and hence quantifying the damping based on the theoretical damped oscillation analysis is not applicable. The results of this study are conceptually applied to a microchannel heat sink, where oscillating flows show promise in handling large heat fluxes...|$|E

Validation of the model is carried out from the experimental data of an aerovalved Helmholtz type pulse combustor, where a sinusoidal air inlet mass flow coupled with pressure oscillations within the combustor is needed to model the instabilities of combustion oscillations correctly. The model is used to investigate the influence of different boundary conditions on combustion oscillations and soot production in the pulse combustor. The results identify the operating conditions for which <b>continuous</b> <b>oscillations,</b> steady flames and flame extinction occur.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) understand the phenomenon of <b>continuous</b> free <b>oscillations</b> of the Earth and (2) examine the idea of using this phenomenon for planetary seismology. We first describe the results on (1) and present our evaluations of the idea (2) in the final section. In 1997, after almost forty years since the initial attempt by Benioff et al, <b>continuous</b> free <b>oscillations</b> of the Earth were discovered. Spheroidal fundamental modes between 2 and 7 millihertz are excited continuously with acceleration amplitudes of about 0. 3 - 0. 5 nanogals. The signal is now commonly found in virtually all data recorded by STS- 1 type broadband seismometers at quiet sites. Seasonal variation in amplitude and the existence of two coupled modes between the atmosphere and the solid Earth support that these oscillations are excited by the atmosphere. Stochastic excitation due to atmospheric turbulence is a favored mechanism, providing a good match between theory and data. The atmosphere has ample energy to support this theory because excitation of these modes require only 500 - 10000 W whereas the atmosphere contains about 117 W of kinetic energy. An application of this phenomenon includes planetary seismology, because other planets may be oscillating due to atmospheric excitation. The interior structure of planets could be learned by determining the eigenfrequencies in the <b>continuous</b> free <b>oscillations.</b> It is especially attractive to pursue this idea for tectonically quiet planets, since quakes may be too infrequent to be recorded by seismic instruments...|$|R
