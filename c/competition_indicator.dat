In addition, markets that faced competition reductions represent the large majority of sales, gross value added and employment in the Portuguese economy. The non-tradable sector shows lower competition intensity than the tradable sector. Moreover, reductions in competition are relatively widespread across markets in both sectors, but in terms of sales, gross value added and employment these reductions are more substantial in the non-tradable sector.

To answer these questions, we exploit an innovative measure of competition [Boone, J., A {{new way to}} measure competition, EconJnl, Vol. 118, pp. 1245 - 1261] that captures the reallocation of profits from inefficient banks to their efficient counterparts. Based on two complementary datasets for Europe and the U.

Second, we verify that competition increases efficiency. Third, we present novel evidence that efficiency is the conduit through which competition contributes to bank soundness. In a final examination of banks’ heterogeneous responses to competition, we find that smaller banks’ soundness measures respond more strongly to competition than larger banks’ soundness measures, and two-stage quantile regressions indicate that the soundness-enhancing effect of competition is larger in magnitude for sound banks than for fragile banks. ...|$|E

30|$|The BEEPS dataset {{allows us}} to link such {{developments}} in employment with information about the business environment perceptions that are available at a 2 -digit industry level of aggregation. The BEEPS database is collected by the World Bank and reports detailed survey information on firms located all over the world. The average business barriers index is based on questions regarding perceived barriers for {{doing business in the}} categories institutional regulations, access to finance, crime, corruption, taxation, labor regulations, infrastructure and law. The specific questions used for the construction are reported in the Additional file 1 and the answers to each question range from 0 (no obstacle) to 4 (very severe obstacle). For the construction of the overall business barriers index we first average the replies to all questions for each firm and, subsequently, construct the industry index by averaging all averages within each 2 -digit industries. This approach is necessary because the firms surveyed in the BEEPS dataset cannot be directly linked with the firms collected in the Amadeus database. In contrast to other data sources, such as the World Economic Outlook (WEO) data provided by the IMF, the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators and OECD’s product market <b>competition</b> <b>indicators,</b> the BEEPS data have some advantages for the aim of this paper. First, the Doing Business indicators and the WEO data are only available at the country level and do not allow to link within-country variation in intensive margin employment growth to differences in institutional barriers for doing business. The OECD’s product market <b>competition</b> <b>indicators</b> are collected at the sectorial level but are only available for very few industries such as professional services, retail trade and energy, transport and communications. A drawback of the product market <b>competition</b> <b>indicators</b> as well as the BEEPS data is that the surveys are not conducted every year. In our case, the BEEPS data are only available for the years 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2009 and not all included firms are surveyed in all four waves of the questionnaire. In our econometric approach, discussed in Sections 3 and 4, we take this data limitation into account.|$|R

Measuring competition by the price cost margin and by the Boone <b>competition</b> <b>indicator</b> shows that competition in the Finnish private service sectors is roughly equal to competition in other EU and OECD countries analysed in the study. The impact of foreign competition on private services is analysed by an econometric model based on the theory of imperfect competition. International competition is fairly severe in the Finnish water transport and air transport sectors in the sense that foreign competitors unit costs influence domestic output prices in these sectors more strongly in Finland than in most other OECD countries. The high consumer price level in Finland cannot be explained by the lack of competition in the Finnish service sectors. To some extent it can be explained by the lack of competitiveness in the service sectors.

However, empirical studies offer mixed results. Some studies find that higher concentration is associated with higher credit availability consistent with the information hypothesis that less competitive banks have more incentive to invest in soft information. Other empirical studies, however, find support for the market power hypothesis that credit rationing is higher in less competitive bank markets. This study tests these two competing hypotheses by employing {{for the first time}} a <b>competition</b> <b>indicator</b> from the Industrial Organization literature – the Lerner index – as an alternative to traditional measures of concentration.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to find out whether the management behavior in Indonesian banking industry is efficient or in the collusive condition. Meanwhile, the minor {{objective of this}} research is to find out the factors affecting the dynamics of profitability in Indonesian banking during 2001 - 2014. The research background is based on the observation of real phenomena occurred in Indonesian banking industry both in microeconomics and macroeconomics point of view. The report from the high class international surveys such as Asia Pacific Equity Research Financials (2014), Status Report on the Philippine Financial System (2013), Standard and Poor Rating System (2013), and World Bank (2001 - 2014) stated that return on total assets (ROTA) of Indonesian banking had the highest position in ASEAN and Asia-Pasific ranking in the period of 2001 - 2014. The profitability of Indonesian banking industry was relatively high because the assets, credits, and deposits also remained high. This is an interesting phenomenon because the profitability increment occurred in the tighter competition of banking industry. The tighter <b>competition</b> <b>indicator</b> is shown by decline of the number of bank which is 145 banks (in 2001) to 119 banks (in 2014). Meanwhile, the number of branch offices strangely increased from 6, 765 units (2001) to 19, 307 units (2014). Based on aggregate economic system point of view, the banking profitability is related to the basic conditions of the economy, market structure, and behavior of bank management. The important thing is Indonesian economy was affected by financial crisis (2008 - 2010), while Bank Indonesia (BI) imposed API (Architect Banking Indonesia) regulation during 2004 - 2012. The crisis and the new regulation surely will affect Indonesian profitability during the research period (2001 - 2014) 	 Therefore, the research questions arose from the real phenomenon are stated below: 1) 	Does Indonesian banking profitability is related to conduct, structure, and economy basic condition? 2) 	What are the factors affecting profitability based on internal and external factors? To answer the questions, this study uses SCP theory (structure conduct performance) as a grand theory. The advantages of SCP theory is it can simplify the analysis and research synthesis because SCP theory contains about the relationship between structure, conduct, and performance of an industry. Several previous studies that included SCP theory on their researches are Bhatti and Hussain (2010) in Pakistan banking; Gajurel and Pradhan (2011) in Nepalese banking. To solidify basic theory as a basic premise {{in the process of developing}} hypotheses and, this research includes ALMA (assets, liability, management) du Pont model as the supporting theory. This study uses purposive sampling technique which results 97 banks during 2001 - 2014 as the sample. This study also uses dynamic panel data, Regression-Arelanno Bond GMM, as the regression technique. There are three main results regarding the main significant factors affecting profitability in Indonesian banking industry: 1) Profitability of prior year (ROTA- lag 1 and ROE-lag 1) 2) Market concentration index of HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) 3) Efficiency of operational expense management The prior year profitability (ROTA- lag 1 and ROE-lag 1) has positive and significant effect on current year profitability, which means Indonsian banking market is increasingly competitive. Meanwhile the positive influence of the concentration index HHI on profitability and the positive influence of the market share shows the condition of the banking market is still indicated collusion, yet efficient in managing market share through product differentiation (Smirlock, 1985). Based on per variable, the research results are stated below: 1) 	The significant factors increasing profitability are prior year profitability, index of the use of ICT- Internet, money supply, exchange rate of Rp/USD, concentration index of deposit and credit, profit structure or the ratio of NII/OC, interest income and non-interest income, LAR (loan to asset ratio), and TETA (equity to assets). 2) 	The significant factors decreasing profitability are economic growth, market share of deposits and loans, interaction between market concentration and firm size, interest expense and overhead), a minimum requirement ratio and loan to deposit ratio, debt to asses ratio, sensitivity, duus (dummy Islamic business units) The implications of the research results are stated below: 1) 	NII (net interest income) can be increased by raising the credits volume 2) 	OC (overhead cost) can be increased by cutting the prodigality and the mistakes of working operational system 3) 	FBI (fee based income) can be increased by raising banking product variances using the competitive price 4) 	The low cost funds in financial structure should be increased in order to suppress cost of funds 5) 	Doing assets and credit portfolio optimization to improve the quality of the assets to achieve optimal return 6) 	In the future, the internal factors will be the determinant of market structure which is conduct and performance 7) 	AEC (ASEAN Economics Society) will make the competition of banking industry tighter 8) 	The local or international banks should make a strategy to increase the customers 9) 	The efficiency is the main key of banking industry management.

Competition changes have been rather small in many industries competition, but {{a considerable number of}} industries experienced a sharp rise or strong fall in competition. These findings are puzzling in light of regulatory reforms that have been implemented in the period observed. Yet, econometric analysis suggests that regulatory reforms could have intensified competition. However, strong growth of market demand has weakened competition and it counterbalanced to some extent the impact of regulatory reforms. If demand grows more rapidly than supply, then incumbent firms compete less aggressively. This should attract new competitors if entry barriers are low. Although entry has a positive effect on competition, its contribution has been negligible or even slightly negative.

40|$|This paper investigates {{to which}} extent tough {{competition}} {{impacts on the}} macroeconomic performance of countries. The relation between competition and innovation has been investigated intensely in industrial economics. It started with Schumpeter's hypothesis that monopoly profits were necessary for innovation, leading then to U-curve relationships where innovation was highest for medium-range competition, but lower for very tough competition {{as well as for}} a very lax competitive regime. Empirical studies on the growth differences between countries increasingly stress – apart from the usual suspects like investment, R&D, human capital – the role of institutions. They include indicators on regulation, government size, corruption and rule of law, but usually not the degree of competition. Conventional growth theory did not model the impact of competition, but assumed perfect competition. In New Growth Theory, economic growth depends on purposeful and maximising innovation activities, where market structure plays an important role. But this did not result in the inclusion of competition variables into empirical growth equations. We have attempted to narrow this gap by relating 13 indicators of the toughness of competition to macroeconomic performance. We then added these <b>competition</b> <b>indicators</b> to an equation relating macro performance to the standard explanatory variables for economic growth (like investment and R&D). The results indicate that competition plus innovation is a good recipe at the macro level too, probably with similar tensions and non-linearity as at the company level.

Profit margins and concentration ratios are notably high in communications, finance, housing, and miscellaneous goods and services. Manufacturing achieves, on average, lower profit margins and concentration ratios than other sectors. Over time, profit margins have increased in most sectors as a result of the rapid catching-up process in the CESEE region, while concentration ratios have declined, suggesting that the region is still in a phase of rapid market expansion. We observe some indication of an increase in competition in only a handful of sectors, e. g. housing and utilities, passenger transport, and information services.

40|$|International audienceThe lack of {{available}} {{prices in the}} Dutch life insurance industry makes competition an elusive concept that defies direct observation. Therefore, this article investigates competition by analysing several factors which may affect the competitive nature of a market and various indirect measurement approaches. After discussing various supply and demand factors which may constitute a so-called tight oligopoly, we establish the existence of scale economies {{and the importance of}} cost X-inefficiency, since severe competition would force firms to exploit available scale economies and to reduce X-inefficiencies. Both scale economies and X-inefficiencies turn out to be substantial, although more or less comparable to those found for insurers in other countries and to other financial institutions. Further, we apply the Boone indicator, a novel approach to measuring the effects of <b>competition.</b> This <b>indicator</b> points to limited competition in comparison to other sectors in the Netherlands. Further investigations of submarkets should reveal where policy measures in order to promote competition might be appropriate...|$|R
40|$|In a {{competition}} period were studied the indexes of general and special physical preparedness of young footballers aged 14 - 16 years old. On {{the basis of}} research of electrocardiograms dependence of indexes of physical preparedness of young footballers is presented on functional possibilities of the cardiovascular system. It is set that the dynamics of development of physical qualities of young footballers has heterochronic character. The level of physical preparedness of sportsmen is recommended to check on such by tests: at run on distance 15, 30, 60 meters from a place and 15 meters with to motion (for the estimation of speed motive qualities), at run on 400 meters (estimation anaerobic - to glicolic endurance); broad jump from a place, triple and upwards (estimation of dynamic force), at run on 3000 meters or during 12 minutes (estimation of aerobic endurance). The integral criterion of the special preparedness of footballers are <b>competition</b> performance <b>indicators</b> during a season (16 matches) ...|$|R
