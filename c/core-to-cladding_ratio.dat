40|$|Core-diameter adjustment, in {{analogy to}} doping management, is {{proposed}} {{in this letter}} for balancing thermal load and nonlinear effects. In this scheme, the <b>core-to-cladding</b> <b>ratio</b> increases with increasing core diameter along the direction of signal and pump propagation. An all-fiber-integrated Yb-doped master oscillator power amplification (MOPA) is successfully demonstrated. Two segments of fiber with different core diameters but same inner-cladding diameters and doping levels are spliced together and used as gain fibers in the last stage. A maximum average output power of 200 W at an overall slope efficiency of 71 % is achieved from the MOPA with a pulse energy of 2 mJ and peak power as high as 80 kW...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the effct of pump wavelength on the modal instabilities (MI) in high power linearly-polarized Yb-doped fiber amplifiers. We built a novel semi-analytical model {{to determine the}} frequency coupling characteristics and power threshold of MI, which indicates promising MI suppression through pumping at an appropriate wavelength. By pumping at 915 nm, the threshold can be enhanced {{by a factor of}} 2. 36 as compared to that pumped at 976 nm. Based on a high power linearly-polarized fiber amplifier platform, we studied the influence of pump wavelength experimentally. The threshold has been increased by a factor of 2 at 915 nm, which agrees with the theoretical calculation and verified our theoretical model. Furthermore, we show that MI suppression by detuning the pump wavelength is weakened for fiber with large <b>core-to-cladding</b> <b>ratio.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} fiber-optic stand magnifiers {{specifically designed}} for use as low-vision reading aids. Application of this technology results in better optical and ergonomic properties. The fiber-optic magnifiers (tapers) provide bright, uniformly illuminated, distortion-free images. The reading material can be scanned without the userâ€™s having to bend directly over the magnifier. One can further increase the scanning field by slanting the taper to tilt the image toward the observer. Tilting the upper face of the taper by cutting the smaller lower face on a bias is shown to increase the scanning range substantially and to provide better control of illumination. The scanning range of such tilted tapers is approximately double that of the equivalent lens magnifiers. To increase the contrast transfer through the magnifiers, we have developed lower-resolution tapers with an increased <b>core-to-cladding</b> <b>ratio.</b> The increase in contrast transfer is reported for representative tapers. The lower-resolution design is also helpful in reducing the manufacturing cost of taper magnifiers. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{past few}} years, the optical fibre {{dosimetry}} has been started to significantly grow in different ionising radiation applications {{due to their}} inherent advantages in terms of dosimeter characteristics and capability are used as both real-time or off-line monitoring. Several case-studies reported characteristics of optical fibres under the different dosimeter aspects instant various radiation sources and wide ranges of doses. However, in most cases, commercial available optical fibres have been used, which provided lots of ambiguous in terms of dosimeter characteristics regarding to various fabrication process, materials doped and element concentrations used by different manufacturers. This study demonstrates characterisation of different home-made optical fibres where their fabrication parameters, doping elements and concentrations, and physical characteristics are varied in classical approaches to carefully address the main sources and factors that influence the sensitivity and characteristics of optical fibre dosimeters. For fair and consistency in analysis, a set of relatively fixed characterisation methods are adapted based on the availability and accessibility of resources; for instance, the study is performed based on thermoluminescence (TL) dosimeter with the main irradiation of MeV electron/photon within 0. 5 - 10 Gy of applied dose. The study is benchmarked {{with a couple of}} commercial available standard single mode fibres and conventional used lithium-fluoride dosimeter family, i. e., TLD- 100. The main effect of fibre structure/shape on performance of dosimeter is investigated by fabricating different types of undoped and doped optical fibres including capillary optical fibre, conventional cylindrical fibre, flat fibre (FF) and photonic crystal fibre (PCF). Performance of undoped fibres are compared with doped fibres; all items have been fabricated from the same Ge-doped preform. The TL response of capillary fibre can be significantly improved with our novel proposed FF, especially, if some dopant element exists in the collapsing region of FF. The effect of cylindrical and flat fibre size on TL response is thoroughly investigated by fabricating several different sizes of fibres with fixed and varying coreiii to-cladding ratios. For FFs, this is performed by considering different collapsing methods during fabrication process. It is shown that the effect of fibre size with fixed <b>core-to-cladding</b> <b>ratio</b> on TL response is insignificant for cylindrical fibre, but it is significant for FFs. The effect of Ge concentration on TL response of optical fibres is also investigated by fabricating ten fibre preforms with different concentrations. Furthermore, performance of the other rare elements doped in optical fibres are demonstrated. The study is furnished by providing discussion on structural defects with the aid of computational glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) analysis almost for every different optical fibres used...|$|E
