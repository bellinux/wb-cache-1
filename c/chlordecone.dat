Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning.

40|$|International audienceCONTEXT: <b>Chlordecone,</b> an {{environmentally}} persistent organochlorine insecticide used intensively in banana {{culture in the}} French West Indies until 1993, has permanently polluted soils and contaminated foodstuffs. Consumption of contaminated food is {{the main source of}} exposure nowadays. We sought to identify main contributors to blood <b>chlordecone</b> concentration (BCC) and to validate an exposure indicator based on food intakes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) completed by a sample of 194 pregnant women to estimate their dietary exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> and compared it to blood levels. In a first approach, <b>chlordecone</b> daily intake was estimated as the product of daily eaten quantity of 214 foodstuffs, multiplied by their <b>chlordecone</b> content, and summed over all items. We then predicted individual blood <b>chlordecone</b> concentration with empirical weight regression models based on frequency of food consumption, and without contamination data. RESULTS: Among the 191 subjects who had BCC determination, 146 (76 %) had detectable values and mean BCC was 0. 86 ng/mL (range < LOD- 13. 2). Mean per capita dietary intake of <b>chlordecone</b> was estimated at 3. 3 microg/day (range: 0. 1 - 22. 2). Blood <b>chlordecone</b> levels were significantly correlated with food exposure predicted from the empirical weight models (r= 0. 47, p< 0. 0001) and, to a lesser extent, with <b>chlordecone</b> intake estimated from food consumption and food contamination data (r= 0. 20, p= 0. 007). Main contributors to <b>chlordecone</b> exposure included seafood, root vegetables, and Cucurbitaceous. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Timoun FFQ provides valid estimates of <b>chlordecone</b> exposure.

40|$|International audienceBackground <b>Chlordecone</b> is a {{persistent}} organochlorine insecticide with well-defined estrogenic properties. It was intensively {{used in the}} French West Indies until 1993 to control the banana root borer. Because of the long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is currently exposed to <b>chlordecone</b> through food consumption. <b>Chlordecone</b> {{has been found in}} the blood of pregnant women and in cord blood. It {{has been shown to be}} an endocrine-disrupting chemical and exposure during pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> and fetal growth based on the TIMOUN birth cohort conducted in Guadeloupe, with a focus on the potential modification of this relationship by maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods <b>Chlordecone</b> was determined in cord plasma at birth in 593 babies. Birth weight was the indicator of fetal growth. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were determined. Adherence to GWG recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine based on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was assessed. Birth weight was analyzed relative to cord blood <b>chlordecone</b> levels using linear and non-linear regression models. Results Overall <b>chlordecone</b> in cord blood was not associated with birth weight, but we found an interaction between <b>chlordecone</b> exposure with GWG and adherence to GWG recommendations. After stratification by GWG, we found a significant U-shaped association between birth weight and <b>chlordecone</b> exposure, within the upper quartiles of GWG or excessive GWG.

40|$|<b>Chlordecone</b> (CHLD), a {{soil and}} {{foodstuff}} pollutant, {{as well as}} an environmentally persistent organochlorine insecticide, was used intensively in banana fields. The <b>chlordecone</b> uptake of three crops was measured for two types of polluted soils: allophanic and non-allophanic. The uptake is lower for allophanic soils even if their <b>chlordecone</b> content is higher than with non-allophanic soils. The fractal structure of the allophane aggregates was characterized at the nanoscale by small angle X-rays scattering, pore size distribution and transmission electron microscopy. We showed that clay microstructures should be an important physico-chemical factor governing the fate of <b>chlordecone</b> in the environment. Allophanic clays result in two counterintuitive findings: higher contaminant trappings yet lower contaminant availability. We propose that this specific, tortuous structure, along with its associated low accessibility, partly explains the low availability of <b>chlordecone</b> confined in allophanic soils. Capsule The fractal and tortuous microstructure of allophane clay favours the <b>chlordecone</b> retention in soils and disfavours the crop uptake. Highlights ? Allophanic soils are highly polluted but less contaminant for cultivated vegetables. ? SAXS and TEM show the fractal structure of allophane aggregates at the nanoscale. ?

Our results indicated that i) all tubers were contaminated in accordance with the <b>chlordecone</b> content of the soils; ii) the plant contamination capacity of the Nitisol was greater than that of the Andosol; and iii) whatever the soil type, tuber contamination was related to the soil volumetric content of dissolved <b>chlordecone.</b> Nevertheless, no tubers showed sufficient <b>chlordecone</b> uptake for efficient soil decontamination by means of plant extraction. Soil contact accounted for most of the root crop contamination, which was inversely proportional to the tuber size. Internal transfer might also increase root crop contamination when the root central cylinder contained raw sap flow, {{as in the case of}} turnip or radish.

Thus, further research is needed to explore the pattern of both below- and aboveground plant <b>chlordecone</b> contamination and assess the hypothesis of its correlation with sap flow.

40|$|<b>Chlordecone</b> is an {{organochlorine}} pesticide whose use is now forbidden but which persists in soils. It {{was used as}} an insecticide against the banana weevil from the 1970 s to the early 1990 s in the French West Indies. Late contamination of root vegetables (RVs) was revealed in 2002. In our work, we studied the mode of transfer of <b>chlordecone</b> from different types of tropical soil (Andosol, Ferralsol and Nitisol) to different RVs (dasheen, yam, sweet potato, turnip and radish) to explore plant sensitivity to contamination. We conducted complementary experiments: surveys, field trials, and mesocosm trials to link soil <b>chlordecone</b> content with plant <b>chlordecone</b> contamination. In all those experiments, RVs contamination was heterogeneous as soil pollution was heterogeneous, but dispersion of the <b>chlordecone</b> molecule was the same for each crop. Due to this dispersion, the soil type did not significantly affect contamination. Average contamination values measured in harvested organs were positively correlated to <b>chlordecone</b> soil content. Belowground organs themselves were contaminated heterogeneously depending on where there was direct contact between the organ and contaminated soil. The cortex was more highly contaminated than the pulp (up to ten times more). These two results thus support the hypothesis that contamination by direct contact between the <b>chlordecone</b> molecule and the plant organ is the most important mode of transfer in RVs. This has already been demonstrated in the yam Discorea cayenensis, whose tubers were <b>chlordecone</b> free even when the root system explored contaminated soil. <b>Chlordecone</b> diffusion into the plant was very weak suggesting that it is a passive process in RVs. A common model, based on morphology and duration of the soil/organ contact, accounted for the RVs contamination. We calculated an envelope curve of the relationship between soil <b>chlordecone</b> content and RVs contamination and the maximum transfer ratio observed was 1 / 5. This envelope curve which represents zero risk of contamination was calculated for crops on both Andosol and Ferralsol. This relationship is thus a decision tool {{to determine whether or not}} there is a risk involved in cultivating roots and tubers based on the result of soil analysis. With this tool, the risk of contamination can be foreseen at planting which is preferable to analyzing the product at the harvest stage. Further studies are in progress to determine the sensitivity of other mainly horticultural crops and fruits, and to analyze the contamination of aboveground organs.

This project relied on a multidisciplinary approach developed by a broad scientific consortium involving researchers from CEA, Ecole Centrale Lyon, INRA, Irstea, Strasbourg and Lyon Universities. This program was made of several approaches consisting in (i) in silico analyses aiming at (ia) classifying <b>chlordecone</b> and its known metabolites using the QSAR Typol in order to define hypotheses on possible degradation pathways (ib) searching for microbial genes coding deshalogenases in genomic databank {{that could be used}} to dechlorinate chlordecone; (ii) chemical analyses aiming at (iia) optimizing approaches to quantify <b>chlordecone</b> and its main metabolites in soils, (iib) identify chemical processes (photodegradation and photocatalysis) that can be used to transform chlordecone; (iii) search for microbes tolerant to <b>chlordecone</b> able to grow on it under aerobic or anaerobic conditions; (iv) characterize the impact of <b>chlordecone</b> on soil microbial communities using soil metagenomics.

We investigated the impact of prenatal exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> on the occurrence of GDM, GH and PE by studying 779 pregnant women enrolled in a prospective mother-child cohort (Timoun Study) in Guadeloupe between 2004 and 2007. <b>Chlordecone</b> exposure was determined by assaying maternal plasma and information about pregnancy complications was obtained from midwives, pediatricians and hospital medical records after delivery. The risks of GH (n= 65), PE (n= 31) and GDM (n= 71) were estimated by multiple logistic regression including potential confounders. Levels of <b>chlordecone</b> plasma concentration in the third (OR= 0. 2; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 1, 0. 5) and fourth quartiles (OR= 0. 3; 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 7) were associated with a statistically significant decrease {{in the risk of}} GH. A log 10 increase in <b>chlordecone</b> concentration was significantly associated with lower risk of GH (OR= 0. 4; 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 6). No significant associations were observed between the <b>chlordecone</b> exposure and the risk of PE or GDM. This study suggests an inverse association between <b>chlordecone</b> exposure during pregnancy and GH. Further studies are required to determine the underlying mechanism, or the potential unknown confounding factors, resulting in this association...|$|E

Although experimental evidences of biodegradation of this compound are scarce, several dechlorination products have been proposed by Dolfing et al. (2012) using Gibbs free energy calculations to explore different potential transformation routes. We here present {{the results of an}} in silico classification (TyPol similar to Typology of Pollutants) of <b>chlordecone</b> transformation products (TPs) based on statistical analyses combining several environmental endpoints and structural molecular descriptors. Starting from the list of putative <b>chlordecone</b> TPs and considering available data on degradation routes of other organochlorine compounds, we used different clustering strategies to explore the potential environmental behaviour of putative <b>chlordecone</b> TPs from the knowledge on their molecular descriptors. The method offers the possibility to focus on TPs present in different classes and to infer their environmental fate. Thus, we have deduced some hypothetical trends for the environmental behaviour of TPs of <b>chlordecone</b> assuming that TPs, which were clustered away from <b>chlordecone,</b> would have different environmental fate and ecotoxicological impact compared to <b>chlordecone.</b> Our findings suggest that mono- and di-hydrochlordecone, which are TPs of <b>chlordecone</b> often found in contaminated soils, may have similar environmental behaviour in terms of persistence.

40|$|<b>Chlordecone</b> is a {{persistent}} organochlorine insecticide that, even decades after its ban, {{poses a threat}} to the environment and human health. Nevertheless, its environmental fate in soils has scarcely been investigated, and elementary data on its degradation and behaviour in soil are lacking. The mineralisation and sorption of <b>chlordecone</b> and the formation of possible metabolites were evaluated in a tropical agricultural andosol. Soil microcosms with two different soil horizons (S-A and S-B) were incubated for 215 days with 14 C-chlordecone. At five different times (1, 33, 88, 150 and 215 days) the extractability of 14 C-chlordecone was analysed. Mineralisation was monitored using 14 CO 2 traps of NaOH. The appearance of metabolites was studied using thin layer and gas chromatography techniques. At the end of the experiment, the water soluble 14 C-activity was 2 % of the remaining 14 C-chlordecone for S-A and 8 % for S-B. Only 12 % of the remaining activity was non extractable and more than 80 % remained extractable with organic solvents. For the first time to our knowledge, a significant mineralisation of <b>chlordecone</b> was measured in a microcosm under aerobic conditions (4. 9 % for S-A and 3. 2 % for S-B of the initial 14 C-activity). The drastically lower emission of 14 CO 2 in sterilised microcosms indicated the biological origin of <b>chlordecone</b> mineralisation in the non-sterilised microcosms. No metabolites could be detected in the soil extracts. The mineralisation rate of <b>chlordecone</b> decreased by one order of magnitude throughout the incubation period. Thus, the <b>chlordecone</b> content in the soil remained large. This study confirms the existence of <b>chlordecone</b> degrading organisms in a tropical andosol. The reasons why their activity is restricted should be elucidated to allow the development of bioremediation approaches. Possible reasons are a heterogeneous distribution a <b>chlordecone</b> between sub-compartments with different microbial activities or a degradation of <b>chlordecone</b> by co-metabolic processes controlled by a limited supply of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlordecone,</b> an {{organochlorine}} insecticide, {{continues to}} pollute soils in the French West Indies. The {{main source of}} human exposure to this pollutant is food. Root vegetables, which are staple foods in tropical regions, can be highly contaminated and are thus a very effective lever for action to reduce consumer exposure. We analyzed <b>chlordecone</b> contamination in three root vegetables, yam, dasheen and sweet potato, which are among the main sources of <b>chlordecone</b> exposure in food in the French West Indies. All soil types {{do not have the}} same potential for the contamination of root vegetables, allophanic andosols being two to ten times less contaminating than non-allophanic nitisols and ferralsols. This difference was only partially explained by the higher OC content in allophanic soils. Dasheen corms were shown to accumulate more <b>chlordecone</b> than yam and sweet potato tubers.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackground The {{intensive}} use of <b>chlordecone</b> (an organochlorine insecticide) in the French West Indies until 1993 {{resulted in a}} long-term soil and water contamination. <b>Chlordecone</b> has known hormonal properties and exposure through contaminated food during critical periods of development (gestation and early infancy) may affect growth. Objectives We aimed {{to assess the impact}} of prenatal and postnatal exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> on the growth of children from the TIMOUN mother–child cohort. Methods <b>Chlordecone</b> was determined in cord plasma at birth (N= 222) and in breast milk samples (at 3 months). Dietary <b>chlordecone</b> intake was estimated at 7 and 18 months, with food-frequency questionnaires and food-specific contamination data. Anthropometric measurements were taken at the 3 -, 7 - and 18 -month visits and measurements reported in the infants' health records were noted. Structured Jenss–Bayley growth models were fitted to individual height and weight growth trajectories. The impact of exposure on growth curve parameters was estimated directly with adjusted mixed non-linear models. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI), and instantaneous height and weight growth velocities at specific ages were also analyzed relative to exposure. Results <b>Chlordecone</b> in cord blood was associated with a higher BMI in boys at 3 months, due to greater weight and lower height, and in girls at 8 and 18 months, mostly due to lower height. Postnatal exposure was associated with lower height, weight and BMI at 3, 8 and 18 months, particularly in girls. Conclusion <b>Chlordecone</b> exposure may affect growth trajectories in children aged 0 to 18 month...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePersistent organic {{pollutants}} {{have not been}} conclusively associated with length of gestation or with preterm birth. <b>Chlordecone</b> is an organochlorine pesticide that has been extensively used to control the banana root borer population in the French West Indies. Data from the Timoun Mother-Child Cohort Study conducted in Guadeloupe between 2004 and 2007 were {{used to examine the}} associations of <b>chlordecone</b> concentrations in maternal plasma with the length of gestation and the rate preterm birth in 818 pregnant women. Data were analyzed using multivariate linear regression for length of gestation and a Cox model for preterm birth. The median plasma <b>chlordecone</b> concentration was 0. 39 µg/L (interquartile range, 0. 18 - 0. 83). No correlation was observed with plasma concentrations of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (ρ = 0. 017) or polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (ρ = - 0. 016), the other main organochlorine compounds detected. A 1 -log 10 increase in <b>chlordecone</b> concentration was associated with a decreased length of gestation (- 0. 27 weeks; 95 % confidence interval: - 0. 50, - 0. 03) and an increased risk of preterm birth (60 %; 95 % confidence interval: 10, 130). These associations may result from the estrogen-like and progestin-like properties of <b>chlordecone.</b> These results are of public health relevance because of the prolonged persistence of <b>chlordecone</b> in the environment and the high background rate of preterm births in this population...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{insecticide}} <b>chlordecone</b> was extensively {{used in the}} French West Indies {{to control}} banana root borer. Its persistence in soils {{has led to the}} widespread pollution of the environment, and human beings are still exposed to this chemical. <b>Chlordecone</b> has been shown to impair neurological and behavioural functions in rodents when exposed gestationally or neonatally. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> on the cognitive, visual, and motor development of 7 -month-old infants from Guadeloupe. METHODS: Infants were tested at 7 months (n= 153). Visual recognition memory and processing speed were assessed with the Fagan Tests of Infant Intelligence (FTII), visual acuity with the Teller Acuity Card, and fine motor development with the Brunet-Lezine. Samples of cord blood and breast milk at 3 months (n= 88) were analyzed for <b>chlordecone</b> concentrations. Postnatal exposure was determined through breast feeding and frequency of contaminated food consumption by the infants. RESULTS: Cord <b>chlordecone</b> concentrations in tertiles were associated with reduced novelty preference on the FTII in the highly exposed group (β=- 0. 19, p= 0. 02). Postnatal exposure through contaminated food consumption was marginally related to reduced novelty preference (β=- 0. 14, p= 0. 07), and longer processing speed (β= 0. 16, p= 0. 07). Detectable levels of <b>chlordecone</b> in cord blood were associated with higher risk of obtaining low scores on the fine motor development scale (OR= 1. 25, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to <b>chlordecone</b> is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess the effect of <b>chlordecone</b> on the stimulation of oxidative stress in gill, liver and brain tissues of the cichlid fish, Pseudetroplus maculatus. Fishes were exposed to <b>chlordecone</b> at two sublethal concentrations, 3. 5 and 7 μg/L, for 24, 72 and 96 h, maintaining ten animals in each group. <b>Chlordecone</b> treatment did not alter the body weight of the animal. However, significant increase in the secretion of mucous and decrease in the weights of gill, brain and hepatosomatic index were observed at 7 μg/L of <b>chlordecone</b> treatment only after 96 h. Gill tissue showed significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase along with elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in concentration and timedependent manner. This could be the defensive mechanism of gill tissue to escape the toxic effects of <b>chlordecone.</b> In the liver tissue, superoxide dismutase activity was increased by 39 % at 3. 5 μg/L and by 73 % at 7 μg/L of <b>chlordecone</b> treatment. Activities of catalase and glutathione reductase were decreased 3 to 9 times at 3. 5 and 7 μg/L concentrations, respectively, with concomitant increase in hydrogen peroxide generation (17 to 28 times) and lipid peroxidation (3 to 7 times) at the end of 96 h, which reveals the failure of hepatic antioxidant system to prevent free radical generation owing to <b>chlordecone</b> exposure. Activities of all antioxidant enzymes in the brain were inhibited by 29 to 80 % along with the induction of hydrogen peroxide (13 to 20 times) and lipid peroxidation (6 to 11 times), thereby indicating imbalance in the antioxidant status. Activities of gill and liver marker enzyme - alkaline phosphatase - and acetylcholinesterase in brain were decreased. Therefore, imbalance in the antioxidant defence system as a result of <b>chlordecone</b> toxicity could lead to susceptible oxidative stress in various tissues of the fish...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Martinique is a French {{overseas}} department whose economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture. Organochlorine pesticides, mainly <b>chlordecone,</b> were used for banana cultivation to eradicate banana weevil {{over a period of}} 40 years. <b>Chlordecone</b> is chemically stable,and has a strong affinity for fatty tissues. It is therefore able to bioaccumulate in an-imals and thereby represent a threat to ecosystems and man. Soils from banana plantations in Martinique are heavily contaminated with <b>chlordecone.</b> Possible transfer of these molecules from agricultural watersheds to the aquatic en-vironment and the organisms that live in it is feared. The hypothesis that ecosystems of Martinique might be highly contaminated with this organochlorine pesticide was investigated. <b>Chlordecone</b> levels were measured in various fresh-water and marine species. Data show a heavy contamination of many carnivorous and detritivorous species (fish and prawns). Concentrations measured in wild or farmed tilapia are among the highest ever reported in the literature. Some coastal species (fish and lobster) were also found to be contaminated, although to a lesser extent. Given the biogeo-chemical behavior of <b>chlordecone,</b> the most likely route of contamination is food. Detected concentrations in marine organisms are below the tolerated limits established by authorities, however, the impact of other sources of exposure, namely, contaminated water and root vegetables, remains to be investigated...|$|E
