40|$|A <b>crutch</b> enabled to fold {{on itself}} so the <b>crutch</b> {{can be stored}} in small places or {{confined}} areas. The <b>crutch</b> attaches to the forearm of a user with a flexible cuff during use. After use, an upper section and lower section of the <b>crutch</b> rotate toward one another using a pivoting joint. Further, the lower section of the <b>crutch</b> has telescoping sections, allowing the <b>crutch</b> to use substantially less space during storage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the stability of the axillary pad in the axilla during single-crutch walking through kinematic analysis of the <b>crutch</b> position in the horizontal plane. [Subjects] The subjects were 19 healthy young males. [Methods] The subjects were instructed to walk 5 m in a straight line while using a single <b>crutch.</b> This was repeated 10 times. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey’s honest sig-nificance test were used to compare <b>crutch</b> angles across three time points during <b>crutch</b> stance (<b>crutch</b> contact, mid stance and <b>crutch</b> off) for each subject. [Results] A statistically significant effect of time was found in 17 of the 19 subjects. Sixteen of these 17 subjects rotated the <b>crutch</b> externally from <b>crutch</b> contact to <b>crutch</b> off. [Conclusion] External rotation of the <b>crutch</b> throughout the stance phase is important to enable the axillary pad to be held tightly against the chest wall. These results may lead to alterations of the instructions for <b>crutch</b> use and the prevention of falls...|$|R
40|$|The {{preferred}} clothing styles, {{and consideration}} factors of selected female underarm <b>crutch</b> users were investigated {{along with the}} comparison of body measurements between permanent and temporary <b>crutch</b> users. Results indicated permanent <b>crutch</b> users with strong function orientation preferred set-in sleeves, buttoned cuffs, enlarged jewel neckline, shawl collar and bloused silhouette. This {{was different from the}} temporary <b>crutch</b> users preference. The measurement difference of the same weight category showed that the proportion of permanent <b>crutch</b> users, with larger upper torso, was different to that of temporary <b>crutch</b> users. Factors for permanent <b>crutch</b> users selection of clothing included function, fit and fabric when evaluating illustrations, and comfort and esthetics were additional factors after trying on the prototypes of their choice. The prototype designs ameliorated the aspect of five subjects...|$|R

5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to <b>crutches</b> {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E

For the following three months he remained at Halton recuperating from his injuries, leaving on only one occasion to travel on <b>crutches</b> and in full uniform to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI presented him with his DSO, DFC and Bar. He was also Mentioned in Despatches in March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on <b>crutches,</b> provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E

5|$|Auriemma {{found himself}} in a {{national}} debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on <b>crutches,</b> score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without <b>crutches</b> or end up in wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E
50|$|A forearm <b>crutch</b> has a cuff {{at the top}} to {{go around}} the forearm, also known as the Lofstrand <b>crutch.</b> It is used by {{inserting}} the arm into a cuff and holding the grip. The cuff, typically made of plastic or metal, can be a half-circle or a full circle with a V-type opening in the front allowing the forearm to slip out in case of a fall.A forearm <b>crutch</b> {{are more likely to be}} used by patients who have permanent limitations and will always need <b>crutch</b> assistance for long-term ambulation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} an instrumented forearm <b>crutch</b> {{that has}} been developed to monitor a patient’s weight bearing over the full period of their recovery, and that can potentially {{be used in a}} home environment. The <b>crutch</b> measures the applied weight, <b>crutch</b> tilt, and hand position on the grip. Data are transmitted wirelessly to a remote computer, where they are processed and visualized in LabVIEW. The results obtained from a successful pilot study highlight both the need for such an instrumented <b>crutch</b> and its ability to measure the weight being applied through a patient’s lower limb...|$|R

During the production for Dude Ranch, the members of Blink-182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule: bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, co-vocalists for the band, were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with both heels broken, on <b>crutches.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing <b>crutches</b> for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} options {{available}} to prevent infestation. Many of the precursors drawing the flies initially are sanitary problems which is where control measures are directed. Drenching, shearing or <b>crutching</b> are some basic procedures that can be done. <b>Crutching</b> is the trimming of excess wool from the breech area, and the timing of both shearing and <b>crutching</b> is critical in {{reducing the amount of}} flystrike.|$|R
50|$|Docking (removing) sheep's tails {{has much}} the same {{benefits}} for the sheep as <b>crutching.</b> While this procedure reduces the care needed to keep wool clean, regular <b>crutching</b> is still required for the reasons outlined above.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crutching</b> is {{generally}} {{carried out in}} shearing sheds, using shearers and the same tools as for shearing the entire fleece, as <b>crutching</b> is simply shearing {{only a portion of}} the animal. Blade shears may be used, especially where an individual sheep is particularly dirty, or flystruck. Generally, whole flocks are treated together. A mechanical shearing handpiece is used, and the crutchers sit the sheep between their legs and shear the required portion of the sheep, leaving the main fleece to continue growing. There are also many varieties of <b>crutching</b> cradles which allow the sheep to be <b>crutched</b> with less physical strain to the operator.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on <b>crutches.</b> The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had been}} the {{agreement}} before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business. The War Office refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on <b>crutches</b> with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with <b>crutches.</b> Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
40|$|Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is a treatable {{autoimmune}} {{disorder that}} affects the neuromuscular junction. MG is characterised by fatigable muscle weakness of voluntary skeletal muscles with the most commonly affected muscles being the eye and facial muscles. Patients of African genetic ancestry, particularly juveniles, {{are more likely to}} develop ocular muscle complications of MG compared to their European counterparts. MG ophthalmoplegic complications include persistent difficulty with moving the eyes and blepharoptosis, despite treatment. Blepharoptosis, or ptosis, describes the condition of a lowered upper eyelid(s), beyond its normal anatomic position. Surgical correction of ptosis is often contraindicated in MG patients with severe weakness of the muscles involved in eye closure and in patients with active disease. In these cases, a non-surgical solution to elevating the ptotic eyelid above the visual axis is required. Objective: To design a patient specific, modular and low cost ptosis <b>crutch</b> to elevate the eyelid(s) of myasthenia gravis patients. The ptosis <b>crutch</b> should be low cost, modular and adjustable in nature. Method: 16 MG patients (42 ± 23 years) volunteered to participate in the pre-design phase of the project. Initial eye measurements of each participant were taken using photographic measurement. A bottomup approach was followed for the design of the ptosis <b>crutch.</b> 3 D CAD models of the modular ptosis <b>crutch</b> were created in SolidWorks, according to the measured dimensions and the predefined design parameters. The ptosis <b>crutch</b> was prototyped using 3 D printing. Eightyseven design failures were observed before the final design was realised. A design feedback loop lead to the discovery of a device that satisfied the specified requirements. The final ptosis <b>crutch</b> was tested, in the clinical setting, on 12 MG patients (43 ± 24 years). Results: The ptosis <b>crutch</b> was designed to fit onto the superior border of the spectacle frame. The ptosis <b>crutch</b> is adjustable along the x- axis to cater for the inter-individual variability of globe protrusion. The <b>crutch</b> bar is adjusted along the z-axis and elevated the ptotic eyelid by 1. 96 mm (± 1. 11 mm). All of the participants indicated that they would be interested in using the ptosis <b>crutch</b> on a long-term basis. Conclusion: The immediate feedback on the ptosis <b>crutch</b> from the MG patients has shown a positive outcome for the device. Future work will include obtaining long term feedback on the ptosis <b>crutch</b> from all of the users as well as investigating manufacturing methods using materials with increased durability...|$|R
