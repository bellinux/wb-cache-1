50|$|From the {{confluence}} of the Poppelbach and Kaltenbach, the Great Enz initially flows through a narrow wooded valley that, after a small <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient,</b> opens into the much broader valley of the Rombach, joining from the west. The valleys of the Enz, Rombach and other western tributaries of the upper reaches are characterised by glacial cirques from the last ice age. After the Enz valley widens at Enzklösterle it narrows again until it reaches the next glacial valley, the Kegeltal, at Sprollenhaus. Having hitherto flowed northeast, the Great Enz swings northwards and flows through a steep valley that cuts across the mostly wooded bunter sandstone plateaux of the northern Black Forest. From the well-known Old Württemberg resort of Wildbad, the valley is densely populated. At Calmbach, where the Little Enz empties into the main river, follow the settlements of Höfen an der Enz and Neuenbürg. Here the Enz makes a wide loop enclosing a mountain spur atop which is Neuenbürg Castle. The Black Forest valley of the Enz has, including the valley of the Great Enz from Gompelscheuer, a length of approximately 38 kilometres and ends as it enters the Kraichgau region at Birkenfeld above Pforzheim.|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal river profiles, where {{elevation}} {{of a river}} bed is plotted {{as a function of}} distance along the river bed, contain information about uplift rate. When a region adjacent to a reference level (e. g., sea level) is uplifted, a rapid <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> occurs near the river mouth. The erosional process causes this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> to migrate upstream. Thus a river profile is effectively a ‘tape recording’ of the uplift rate history, provided that the erosional process can be adequately parameterized. Here, we use a non-linear equation to relate the shape of a river profile, z(x), to uplift rate history, U(t). If erosion is assumed to be dominated by knickpoint retreat, an inverse model can be formulated and used to calculate uplift rate histories. Our model builds upon standard stream profile analysis, which focuses on the relationship between profile slope and drainage area. We have applied this analytical approach to river profiles from the Bié Dome, Angola. Calculated uplift rate histories agree with independent geologic estimates...|$|E

Through the modulation of the gradient coefficients, vortices are found to transform in a path of monoclinic M A →orthorhombic→monoclinic MC →tetragonal. Although the gradient coefficients vary significantly, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> energy is remarkably small. The simulation results show that the rotation and magnitude reduction in polarization dipoles increase the bulk energy, which induces the vortex transformation process in BTO nanoparticles.

40|$|Currently, {{the success}} of {{coronary}} angioplasty is defined by anatomic criteria. Because of the known limitations of coronary arteriography, the translesional pressure gradient and coronary vasodilatory reserve were studied in 15 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty {{with the intent of}} defining a physiologically successful result. Coronary vasodilatory reserve was measured by a digital radiographic technique that has been previously validated against directly measured coronary sinus flow (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 0001). A significant reduction in luminal stenosis from 71 ± 12 to 34 ± 11 % (p < 0. 001) was accompanied by a reduction <b>in</b> translesional <b>gradient</b> from 47 ± 19 to 21 ± 12 mm Hg (p < 0. 001) and an increase in coronary vasodilatory reserve from 1. 03 ± 0. 15 to 1. 29 ± 0. 13 (p < 0. 001). There was a significant correlation between <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> luminal stenosis and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> translesional <b>gradient</b> (r = 0. 61, p < 0. 05), although a change of 20 % or less in luminal diameter was accompanied by no <b>change</b> <b>in</b> pressure <b>gradient.</b> A more significant relation between <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> and <b>in</b> coronary hyperemic reserve existed (r = 0. 77, p < 0. 005). The relation was accurate even for small <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient.</b> Because saphenous vein bypass grafts have been shown to increase coronary vasodilatory reserve to at least 1. 20, it is proposed that this physiologic criterion be used to define {{the success of}} revascularization by angioplasty. In patients in whom this value was achieved, translesional gradient was invariably 25 % or less of ostial pressure and 20 mm Hg or less. Either coronary vasodilatory reserve or translesional gradient, which can be measured at the time of angioplasty, offers distinct advantages over previous arteriographic standards...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} external factors on sediment size and stream gradient in an ephemeral stream channel, the Arroyo Zarco at Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico (19 ˚ 30 ′N, 105 ˚ 3 ′W). The external factors that we examined were tributary streams, woody debris, and debris flows. We hypothesized that these factors would cause {{a reduction in the}} stream gradient, and an increase in sediment size. We surveyed the longitudinal gradient of a 600 -m reach of the Arroyo Zarco, surveyed channel cross-sections at noticeable transitions between sediment sizes, and measured average sediment size at each cross section. We calculated the average surface sediment size at each cross-sectional area using a step-randomization method. To determine change in stream gradient, we measured the change in elevation every 10 meters along the channel using a surveyor’s tape measure and leveling scope. Qualitative observations of sediment size, presence/absence of the listed external factors, and presence of bedrock were noted every 10 meters along the stream channel. The locations of all sites were documented with a Geographic Positional System (GPS) instrument for subsequent mapping of the channel changes. The sediment size was larger downstream of debris flows and tributary streams, as we predicted. In contrast, sediment size was smaller downstream of accumulations of large woody debris. A <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> was correlated with tributaries, debris flows, and woody debris, but not all <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> was due to these external influences.

40|$|Present-day low-latitude {{eastern and}} western Atlantic basins are geochemically {{distinct}} below the sill depth of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. While Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) circulates freely in the western Atlantic, flow into the eastern Atlantic is restricted below 4 km which results in filling the abyssal depths of this basin with water of geochemical similarity to nutrient depleted North Atlantic Deep Water. Using carbon isotopes and Cd/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera we reconstruct the geochemistry of these basins during the last glacial maximum. Results indicate that deep {{eastern and western}} Atlantic basins became geochemically identical during the last glacial. This was achieved by shoaling of the upper surface of AABW above the sill depth of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which allowed bottom waters in both basins {{to be filled with}} the same water mass. Although AABW became the dominant water mass in the deep eastern Atlantic basin during the glacial, Holocene-glacial delta 13 C-PO 4 shifts in this basin are in Redfield proportions, unlike the disproportionate Holocene-glacial delta 13 C-PO 4 shifts observed in the Southern Ocean. By examining the composition of deep and intermediate waters throughout the Atlantic, we show that this effect was induced by a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> of the delta 13 C-PO 4 deepwater mixing line during glacial times. Evidence from high-latitude planktonic data suggests that the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> of the deepwater mixing line was brought about through a significant reduction in the thermodynamic effect on Southern Ocean surface waters. By using coupled delta 13 C-PO 4 data to constrain the composition of end member water masses in the glacial Atlantic, we conclude that deep waters in the low-latitude glacial Atlantic were composed of a mixture of northern and southern source waters in a ratio of 1 : 3...|$|E

A hypothetical cyclist (body mass: 70 kg, bicycle mass: 10 kg) was studied using a mathematical model of cycling, which included the effects of acceleration. Performance was modelled over three hypothetical 40 -km courses, comprising repeated 2. 5 -km sections of uphill and downhill with gradients of 1 %, 3 %, and 6 %, respectively. Amplitude (5 – 15 %) and distance (0. 31 – 20. 00 km) of variation were modelled over a range of mean power outputs (200 – 600 W) and compared to sustaining a constant power. Power variation was typically detrimental to performance; these effects were augmented as the amplitude of variation and severity of gradient increased. Varying power every 1. 25 km was most detrimental to performance; at a mean power of 200 W, performance was impaired by 43. 90 s (± 15 % variation, 6 % gradient). However at the steepest gradients, the effect of power variation was relatively independent of the distance of variation. In contrast, varying power <b>in</b> parallel with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>gradient</b> improved performance by 188. 89 s (± 15 % variation, 6 % gradient) at 200 W.
