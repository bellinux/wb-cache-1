25|$|V. moorii is {{the only}} member of the Varibilichromis genus, as well as a member of the Lamprologini tribe. It had {{previously}} been in the Neolamprologus genus, but in 1985, <b>Colombé</b> & Allgayer created the new monotypic Variabilichromis genera in order to account for a more ancestral supra-orbital bone structure. This was rejected by Poll's (1986) classification, but supported by Stiassny (1997). Stiassny's classification kept the monotypic genera due to the aforementioned bone structure, as well as the existence of two other characteristics that are rare in the Lamprilogini tribe: their diet includes filamentous algae, and females have two working ovaries.|$|E
25|$|During a 1965 summer gala, {{added to}} the Enrico Macias concert by Raoul <b>Colombe</b> (her first manager), she met her future manager Johnny Stark. Mireille and her father both thought he was an American based on his name and manner, and nicknamed him l'Américain. Stark had worked with singers such as Yves Montand, and the {{relationship}} between him and Mathieu is often described as resembling that between Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley. Stark is credited with making her a star and the successor to Piaf. By 1968, under his careful management, she was France's most popular singer.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel {{used the}} Woolnough boiler {{on a number}} of their larger locomotives, instead of their usual small {{vertical}} boiler. These included railcars for the LNER and LMS. Sentinel's best-known use of the Woolnough was for the 'Colombian' articulated locomotives. These were a series of four, metre gauge locomotives of Co-Co wheel arrangement, built in 1934. They ran at the unusually high pressure of 550psi and each axle was driven by a separate steam motor, designed by Abner Doble. The first was supplied to Belgian Railways, the following three were built for the Société National des Chemins de Fer en <b>Colombe</b> of Colombia, but first shipped to Belgium for testing. Most photographs that exist of these locomotives were taken in Belgium. Little is known of their history after arrival in Colombia.|$|E

2500|$|Mid 20th century Picasso's lithograph, La <b>Colombe</b> (The Dove), a traditional, {{realistic}} {{picture of}} a pigeon, without an olive branch, {{was chosen as the}} emblem for the World Peace Congress in Paris in April 1949. [...] The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the Communist Party and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period. At the 1950 World Peace Congress in Sheffield, Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves, concluding, [...] "I stand for life against death; I stand for peace against war." [...] At the 1952 World Peace Congress in Berlin, Picasso's Dove was depicted in a banner above the stage. [...] The dove symbol was used extensively in the post-war peace movement. Anti-communists had their own take on the peace dove: the group Paix et Liberté distributed posters titled La <b>colombe</b> qui fait BOUM (the dove that goes BOOM), showing the peace dove metamorphosing into a Soviet tank.|$|E

2500|$|Her win {{was rewarded}} with a free trip to Paris, and a pre-audition for the {{televised}} talent show Jeu de la Chance (Game of Luck), where amateur singers competed for audience and telephone votes. Her participation and train fare were arranged by Raoul <b>Colombe,</b> the deputy mayor of Avignon. Accompanied by a pianist at the studio, and dressed in black like Piaf, she sang two Piaf songs to the audition judges and left dispirited. Non-French cannot hear it, but Parisians at the studio made fun of her Provençal accent, and her dyslexia scrambled words. For example, her sister and current manager Monique, is called [...] "Matite" [...] because Mireille couldn't pronounce [...] "petite" [...] as a child.|$|E

2500|$|He {{exchanged}} verses {{with his}} kinsman, the poet Charles of Orléans. René {{was also the}} author of two allegorical works: a devotional dialogue, Le Mortifiement de vaine plaisance (The Mortification of Vain Pleasure, 1455), and a love quest, Le Livre du Cuer d'amours espris (The Book of the Love-Smitten Heart, 1457). [...] The latter fuses the conventions of Arthurian romance with an allegory of love based on the Romance of the Rose. [...] Both works were exquisitely illustrated by his court painter, Barthélémy d'Eyck. [...] Le Mortifiement survives in eight illuminated manuscripts. Although Barthélémy's original is lost, the extant manuscripts include copies of his miniatures by Jean le Tavernier, Jean <b>Colombe,</b> and others. René is sometimes credited with the pastoral poem [...] "Regnault and Jeanneton", but this was more likely a gift to the king honoring his marriage to Jeanne de Laval.|$|E
2500|$|Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, {{which was}} {{published}} in 1632 to great popularity, was an account of conversations between a Copernican scientist, Salviati, an impartial and witty scholar named Sagredo, and a ponderous Aristotelian named Simplicio, who employed stock arguments in support of geocentricity, and was depicted in the book as being an intellectually inept fool. Simplicio's arguments are systematically refuted and ridiculed by the other two characters with what Youngson calls [...] "unassailable proof" [...] for the Copernican theory (at least versus the theory of Ptolemy—as Finocchiaro points out, [...] "the Copernican and Tychonic systems were observationally equivalent and the available evidence could be explained equally well by either"), which reduces Simplicio to baffled rage, and makes the author's position unambiguous. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name [...] "Simplicio" [...] in Italian also had the connotation of [...] "simpleton." [...] Although authors Langford and Stillman Drake assert that Simplicio was modeled on philosophers Lodovico delle <b>Colombe</b> and Cesare Cremonini, Pope Urban's demand for his own arguments {{to be included in the}} book resulted in Galileo putting them in the mouth of Simplicio. Some months after the book's publication, Pope Urban VIII banned its sale and had its text submitted for examination by a special commission.|$|E
