Investigating Kittel's disappearance, Mulder predicts that another seed will be found. They have Marcus Duff (Carl Lumbly), a social worker who is helping Aboah apply for citizenship, <b>cross-reference</b> the names from the flight with those applying for permanent residency or a work visa. This leads them to Aboah, who runs when they try to question him and is discovered after squeezing himself into a drainage pipe. Aboah appears to have no symptoms of disease when he is analyzed at a local medical center, but Scully plans to examine him more.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to <b>cross-reference</b> the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

25|$|Besides the forms, the <b>cross-reference</b> tables another useful supplement. They {{summarize}} the measures {{and most important}} threats for individual components. Measures, as well as threats, are cited with mnemonics. Measures are cited with a priority and a classification. The table contains correlations between measures and the threats they address. However, the <b>cross-reference</b> tables only cite the most important threats. If the measure cited for a given threat is not applicable for the individual IT system, it is not superfluous. Baseline protection can only be ensured if all measures are realized.|$|E

FSF has received a small amount of funding from UNESCO for this project. It is hoped that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future.|$|E
25|$|Objects may {{be either}} direct (embedded in another object) or indirect. Indirect objects are {{numbered}} with an object number and a generation number and defined between the obj and endobj keywords. An index table, {{also called the}} <b>cross-reference</b> table and marked with the xref keyword, follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object {{from the start of}} the file. This design allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (incremental update). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as object streams. This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for Tagged PDF.|$|E

500|$|Many {{languages}} use morphology to <b>cross-reference</b> words {{within a}} sentence. This {{is sometimes called}} agreement. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must <b>cross-reference</b> the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or [...] "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs <b>cross-reference</b> their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or [...] "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English [...] "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as [...] "see you-did-me" ...|$|E

David E. Evans is Professor of Mathematics at Cardiff University, and H. W.

[...] Frank Greenaway was Keeper of the Department of Chemistry at the Science Museum in London for over 20 years, and the physicist Chris Rapley was director of the museum 2007–10.
