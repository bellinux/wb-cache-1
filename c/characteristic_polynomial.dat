5|$|The {{polynomial}} pA in an indeterminate X {{given by}} evaluation the determinant det(XIn−A) {{is called the}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> of A. It is a monic polynomial of degree n. Therefore the polynomial equation pA(λ)=0 has at most n different solutions, that is, eigenvalues of the matrix. They may be complex even if the entries of A are real. According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, pA(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> yields the zero matrix.|$|E

Eigenvalues of min-plus matrices {{are known to}} be the minimum roots of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials</b> based on tropical determinants which are designed from emulating standard determinants. Moreover, minimum roots of <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials</b> have a close relationship to graphs associated with min-plus matrices consisting of vertices and directed edges with weights. The literature has yet to focus on the other roots of min-plus <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials.</b> Thus, here we consider how to relate the 2 nd, 3 rd, [...] . minimum roots of min-plus <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials</b> to graphical features. We then define new <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials</b> of min-plus matrices by considering an analogue of the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm that generates the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomials</b> of linear matrices.

25|$|The Newton identities now {{relate the}} traces of the powers A'k to the {{coefficients}} of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> of A.

25|$|The {{condition}} that γ'A(λ) ≤ μ'A(λ) can be proven by considering a particular eigenvalue ξ of A and diagonalizing the first γ'A(ξ) columns of A {{with respect to}} the eigenvectors of ξ, described in a later section. The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix ξI'γ'A(ξ). As a result, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> of B will have a factor of (ξ−λ)γ'A(ξ). The other factors of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial.</b>|$|E
