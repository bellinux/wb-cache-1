50|$|The term <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> used {{by analogy}} with {{other forms of}} {{economic}} capital, as social <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits.

30|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>is</b> {{the lifeblood}} of corporations, {{allowing}} organizations to maintain liquidity while investing and enlarging their operations. <b>Capital</b> <b>is</b> conventionally considered in terms of physical assets such as cash, real estate, and inventory, but in the modern information economies of the digital age intangible capital such as intellectual property and human <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> becoming increasingly critical to maintaining competitiveness {{in the global economy}} (Stewart 2007). In addition to its intrinsic value, human <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> reflected in product quality (Stokey 1991). However, unlike physical <b>capital,</b> which <b>is</b> easy to find on the balance sheet, the value of human <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> often assumed (Lev and Schwartz 1971).

The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their <b>capital</b> <b>was</b> Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala.

The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern Petén lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. The Yalain appear to {{have been one of the}} three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. In the 17th century the Yalain <b>capital</b> <b>was</b> located at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake Macanché. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups. In the late 17th century, Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including Zacpeten on Lake Macanché and Ixlu on Lake Salpetén. Other groups in Petén are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is no {{consensus}} on what social <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> {{because there is no}} widely accepted theory of values. <b>Capital</b> <b>is</b> a resource that helps individuals achieve some goal, so one needs to know what humans seek to achieve before one can define what <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> (social or otherwise). Evolutionary psychology is a strong contender for a general theory of values. From this perspective, social <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> any resource that inheres in relationships between individuals that help them attain reproductive success. An evolutionary psychological perspective on social capital can solve some empirical puzzles: Why women have more kin in their personal networks than men do; why black {{women are more likely to}} have children out of wedlock; why social capital often has opposite effects on status attainment of men and women; and why social <b>capital</b> appears to <b>be</b> declining in the US. An evolutionary psychological perspective can tell us what exactly social <b>capital</b> <b>is,</b> why humans are social and social <b>capital</b> <b>is</b> important to them, when and where humans maintain social relationships, and how to measure social capital precisely...|$|R
