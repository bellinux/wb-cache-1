40|$|This letter proposes {{the use of}} {{saddle point}} {{approximation}} (SPA) to evaluate the outage probability of wireless cellular networks. Unlike traditional numerical integration-based approaches, the SPA approach relies on <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> (CGFs) and {{eliminates the need for}} explicit numerical integration. The approach is generic and can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} distributions, given that their CGFs exist. We illustrate the usefulness of SPA on channel fading distributions such as Nakagami-$m$, Nakagami-$q$ (Hoyt), and Rician distributions. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the proposed SPA approach. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Wireless Communications Letter...|$|R

The behaviour of shape parameters, namely kurtosis and entropy, is investigated. In addition, Gram–Charlier-type (GCT) expansions, based on the aforementioned distributions and their orthogonal polynomials, are specified, and an operational criterion is provided to meet modelling requirements in a possibly severe kurtosis and skewness environment. The role played by entropy within the kurtosis ranges of GCT expansions is also examined...|$|R

Design of experiments is conducted {{to obtain the}} response values of interest, where Chebyshev nodes are applied to collect discrete samples. Then Chebyshev polynomials are applied to approximate the univariate functional relationship between each variable and the structural response. The univariate dimension reduction method and saddlepoint approximation with truncated <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> are employed to estimate the statistic cumulants, probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the response. The results of numerical examples indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate, convergent, and computationally efficient estimates of the probabilistic characteristics of random mathematical functions or the responses of structural systems...|$|R

In this paper we obtain a simple third order asymptotic correspondence between <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> and corresponding log density functions, leading to a correspondence between likelihood functions and distribution functions; a multivariate analog is also obtained. We use this correspondence to establish the third order accuracy ofthe invariant tail probability formula proposed by Fraser (1990) and of the conversion of conditional likelihood for an exponential model and marginal likelihood for a location model to tail probabilities for testing scalar parameters...|$|R
40|$|We use {{high-order}} cumulants {{to investigate}} the Lee-Yang zeros of <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> of dynamical observables in open quantum systems. At long times the <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> take on a large deviation form with singularities of the associated <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> - or dynamical free energies - signifying phase transitions in the ensemble of dynamical trajectories. We consider a driven three-level system {{as well as the}} dissipative Ising model. Both systems exhibit dynamical intermittency in the statistics of quantum jumps. From the short-time behavior of the dynamical Lee-Yang zeros we identify critical values of the counting field which we attribute to the observed intermittency and dynamical phase co-existence. Furthermore, for the dissipative Ising model we construct a trajectory phase diagram and estimate the value of the transverse field where the stationary state changes from being ferromagnetic (inactive) to being paramagnetic (active).

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze {{the problem of}} linear {{correction}} of the reliability metrics (L-values) in BICM receivers.

We provide a simple numerical example of transmission in the presence of interference where we demonstrate a notable improvement attainable with the proposed method. The proposed method is compared with the one based on the maximization of generalized mutual information. Comment: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communication...|$|R
