Aggregatum <b>group)</b> were performed to determine the chromosomal locations of the genes for flavonoid and anthocyanin production in leaf sheaths of A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group.</b> In HPLC profiles both at 360 and 520 nm, several peaks were observed in A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group</b> and AMAL with chromosome 5 A from A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group</b> but no peak was observed in A. fistulosum and other AMALs. Four of the compounds observed at 360 nm were identified as known flavonoids, i. e., apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin. Five out of the total 18 compounds at 520 nm were identified as known anthocyanins, i. e., cyanidin- 3 -glucoside, cyanidin- 3 -laminariobioside, peonidin- 3 -glucoside, cyanidin- 3 -malonylglucoside, and cyanidin- 3 -malonyllaminariobioside.

Identification of the extra chromosomes in the 16 plants by elaborate karyotype analyses indicate that a complete series (eight different types) of the alien monosomic addition lines was established in Allium {{for the first time}} in this study. Chromosomal locations of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) gene, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) gene and 5 S rDNA of A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group</b> were determined using the series; The gene locus Mdh- 1 was located on 4 A, Tpi- 1 on 3 A and a 5 S rDNA locus on 7 A.

40|$|First {{and second}} backcrosses of {{amphidiploid}} hybrids (2 n = 4 x = 32, genomes AAFF) between shallot (Allium <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group)</b> and A. fistulosum {{were conducted to}} produce A. cepa - A. fistulosum alien addition lines. When shallot (A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group)</b> {{was used as a}} pollinator, the amphidiploids and allotriploids set germinable BC 1 and BC 2 seeds, respectively. The 237 BC 1 plants mainly consisted of 170 allotriploids (2 n = 3 x = 24, AAF) and 42 hypo-allotriploids possessing 23 chromosomes, i. e., single-alien deletions (2 n = 3 x- 1 = 23, AAF-nF). The single-alien deletions in the BC 1 progeny showed dwarfing characteristics and were discriminated from the allotriploids (2 n = 24) and hyper-allotriploids (2 n = 25) by means of flow cytometric analysis. The chromosome numbers of 46 BC 2 seedlings varied from 16 to 24. Eight monosomic additions (2 n = 2 x+ 1 = 17, AA+nF) and 20 single-alien deletions were found in these BC 2 seedlings. Consequently, six kinds of A. cepa - A. fistulosum alien chromosome additions possessing different chromosome numbers (2 n = 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23) were recognized in the BC 1 and BC 2 populations. A total of 79 aneuploids, including 62 single-alien deletions, were analyzed by a chromosome 6 F-specific isozyme marker (Got- 2) in order to recognize its existence in their chromosome complements. This analysis revealed that two out of 62 single-alien deletions did not possess 6 F. One (AAF- 6 F) out of the possible eight single-alien deletions could be identified at first.

40|$|We used a {{complete}} set of Allium fistulosum - shallot (A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group)</b> monosomic addition lines (FF+ 1 A - FF+ 8 A) to identify shallot chromosomes affecting the production of sugars. In the alien addition lines grown over two years in an experimental field at Yamaguchi University (34 °N, 131 °E), shallot chromosomes 2 A and 8 A altered sugar contents in leaf-bunching onion (A. fistulosum). Except for FF+ 2 A, every monosomic addition accumulated non-reducing sugars in winter leaf blades. FF+ 8 A caused an increase in the amounts of non-reducing sugars in the winter. FF+ 2 A hardly produced non-reducing sugar throughout the two-year study. These results indicated that genes related to non-reducing sugar metabolism are located on the 2 A and 8 A chromosomes. The results of regression analyses using 2002 data on A. fistulosum and the monosomic addition set revealed a correlation (r = 0. 63 ± 0. 07; mean ± SE., n = 9) between reducing sugar and monosaccharide (Glc+Fru) contents but no correlation between non-reducing sugar and sucrose contents.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the pathogen that causes leaf blight and chlorosis based on the phenotypic characterization and gyrB gene sequences analysis. The research started from the isolation of pathogen, physiological and biochemical test, DNA extraction, and sequence analysis of gyrB using gyrB 01 -F and gyrB 02 -R primer. The results showed that the isolated bacterial pathogen have a yellow pigment, slimy colonies with regular borders, convex, gram-negative, non-spore, facultative anaerobic, motile, catalase production, indole production, and acid production from D-glucose, D-mannitol, sucrose, and lactose. From the pathogenicity test, it was found that the bacteria produced the typical symptom of leaf blight.

40|$|The genus Allium is a {{rich source}} of steroidal saponins, and its {{medicinal}} properties have been attributed to these bioactive compounds. The saponin compounds with diverse structures play a pivotal role in Allium's defense mechanism. Despite numerous studies on the occurrence and chemical structure of steroidal saponins, their biosynthetic pathway in Allium species is poorly understood. The monosomic addition lines (MALs) of the Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum, FF) with an extra chromosome from the shallot (A. <b>cepa</b> Aggregatum <b>group,</b> AA) are powerful genetic resources that enable us to understand many physiological traits of Allium. In the present study, we were able to isolate and identify Alliospiroside A saponin compound in A. fistulosum with extra chromosome 2 A from shallot (FF 2 A) and its role in the defense mechanism against Fusarium pathogens. Furthermore, to gain molecular insight into the Allium saponin biosynthesis pathway, high-throughput RNA-Seq of the root, bulb, and leaf of AA, MALs, and FF was carried out using Illumina's HiSeq 2500 platform. An open access Allium Transcript Database (Allium TDB, [URL] was generated based on RNA-Seq data. The resulting assembled transcripts were functionally annotated, revealing 50 unigenes involved in saponin biosynthesis. Differential gene expression (DGE) analyses of AA and MALs as compared with FF (as a control) revealed a strong up-regulation of the saponin downstream pathway, including cytochrome P 450, glycosyltransferase, and beta-glucosidase in chromosome 2 A. An understanding of the saponin compounds and biosynthesis-related genes would facilitate the development of plants with unique saponin content and, subsequently, improved disease resistance...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} disorder of carbohydrate metabolism whose prevalence is raising globally, especially the resource -starved {{countries such as}} Nigeria. Since antiquity, diabetes has been treated with plant medicines. Several investigations have confirmed the efficacy {{of many of these}} traditional preparations, some of which have proven efficacy. In the present study, the hypoglycemic, antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Allium cepa (A. cepa) aqueous extracts on alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits was investigated. Diabetes mellitus was induced in 15 adult male rabbits, using 200 mg kg - 1 of alloxan monohydrate as a single intraperitoneal injection. These alloxan -diabetic rabbits were then divided into three groups; one group was administered aqueous extract of A. cepa 100 mg Kg - 1 b. wt. orally daily for 30 days, another <b>group</b> received A. <b>Cepa</b> 300 mg kg - 1 b. wt. orally daily for 30 days and the last group of diabetic rabbits received peanut oil (the vehicle) instead of A. cepa to serve as the diabetic control. There were also five rabbits which received neither alloxan nor A. cepa (the negative control group). All the liver histological derangements caused by diabetes were attenuated in the A. <b>cepa</b> -treated <b>group.</b> Increasing dosages of A. cepa aqueous extract produced a dose-dependent significant reduction in the blood glucose levels. Additionally, A. cepa remarkably improved the reduction of antioxidant parameters-Superoxide dismutase, catalase (SOD), catalase (CAT) Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Reduced Glutathione (GSH) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation.

40|$|Lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS) catalyzes the {{formation}} of lachrymatory factor, {{one of the most}} distinctive traits of bulb onion (Allium cepa L.). Therefore, we used LFS as a model for a functional gene in a huge genome, and we examined the chromosomal organization of LFS in A. cepa by multiple approaches. The first-level analysis completed the chromosomal assignment of LFS gene to chromosome 5 of A. cepa via the use of a complete set of A. fistulosum–shallot (A. <b>cepa</b> L.

Subsequent use of an F 2 mapping population from the interspecific cross A. cepa × A. roylei confirmed the assignment of an LFS locus to this chromosome. Sequence comparison of two BAC clones bearing LFS genes, LFS amplicons from diverse germplasm, and expressed sequences from a doubled haploid line revealed variation consistent with duplicated LFS genes. Furthermore, the BAC-FISH study using the two BAC clones as a probe showed that LFS genes are localized in the proximal region of the long arm of the chromosome.

40|$|Agrobacterium-mediated genetic {{transformation}} {{was applied to}} produce beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua Hübner) resistant tropical shallots (Allium <b>cepa</b> L. <b>group</b> Aggregatum). A cry 1 Ca or a H 04 hybrid gene from Bacillus thuringiensis, driven by the chrysanthemum ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (Rubisco SSU) promoter, along with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter, was employed for {{genetic transformation}}. An average transformation frequency of 3. 68 % was obtained from two shallot cultivars, Tropix and Kuning. After transfer of the in vitro plants to the greenhouse 69 % of the cry 1 Ca and 39 % of the H 04 transgenic shallots survived the first half year. After one year of cultivation in the greenhouse the remaining cry 1 Ca and H 04 transgenic plants grew vigorously and had a normal bulb formation, although the cry 1 Ca transgenic plants (and controls) had darker green leaves compared to their H 04 counterparts. Standard PCR, adaptor ligation PCR and Southern analyses confirmed the integration of T-DNA into the shallot genome. Northern blot and ELISA analyses revealed expression of the cry 1 Ca or H 04 gene in the transgenic plants. The amount of Cry 1 Ca expressed in transgenic plants was higher than the expression levels of H 04 (0. 39 vs. 0. 16 % of the total soluble leaf proteins, respectively). There was a good correlation between protein expression and beet armyworm resistance. Cry 1 Ca or H 04 gene expression of at least 0. 22 or 0. 08 % of the total soluble protein in shallot leaves was sufficient to give a complete resistance against beet armyworm. This confirms earlier observations that the H 04 toxin is more toxic to S. exigua than the Cry 1 Ca toxin. The {{results from this study}} suggest that the cry 1 Ca and H 04 transgenic shallots developed could be used for introducing resistance to beet armyworm in (sub) tropical shallo...|$|R

Two complete sets of alien monosomic additions (2 n = 2 x + 1 = 17) were used for determining the chromosomal locations of several partial sequences of candidate genes, CHS, CHI, F 3 H, DFR, and ANS via analyses of PCR-based markers. The results of DNA marker analyses showed that the CHS-A, CHS-B, CHI, F 3 H, DFR, and ANS genes should be assigned to chromosomes 2 A, 4 A, 3 A, 3 A, 7 A, and 4 A, respectively. HPLC analyses of 14 A. fistulosum - shallot multiple alien additions (2 n = 2 x + 2 - 2 x + 7 = 18 - 23) were conducted to identify the anthocyanin compounds produced in the scaly leaves.

40|$|Integration of {{previously}} developed Allium cepa linkage maps requires {{the availability of}} anchor markers {{for each of the}} eight chromosomes of shallot (A. <b>cepa</b> L. common <b>group</b> Aggregatum). To this end, eight RAPD markers originating from our previous research were converted into SCAR markers via cloning and sequencing of RAPD amplicons and designing of 24 -mer oligonucleotide primers. Of the eight pairs of SCAR primers, seven resulted in the amplification of single bands of the original RAPDs, and the remaining primer set amplified an additional band. The results of Southern hybridization using RAPD amplicons from genomic DNA of Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum L.) ¿shallot monosomic addition lines indicated that five SCAR markers were single shallot chromosome-specific markers and were not detected in genomic DNA of A. fistulosum. The eight SCAR primer pairs were applied to other Allium species and exhibited three types of amplification profiles, namely RAPD amplicons observed only in shallot, in shallot and Allium vavilovii, and in several Allium species.

40|$|The beet {{armyworm}} (Spodoptera exigua Hübner) {{is the most}} important pest in tropical Allium cultivations. All shallot (Allium <b>cepa</b> L. <b>group</b> Aggregatum) cultivars are susceptible to this pest. Therefore accessions from three wild Allium species, namely A. galanthum Kar. et Kir., A. fistulosum L. and A. roylei Stearn, next to A. cepa L. were used to screen for resistance. First of all, a reliable bio-assay had to be developed. To this end transparent plastic cages with in total 5 plants of one accession per cage were placed on perlite in a heated greenhouse. Five 3 -day old larvae were inoculated on each plant. Eight days after inoculation the number of surviving larvae per cage and the mean fresh weight per larva was determined. The lowest larval survival (36 €was found on A. roylei. This was not, however, significantly different from other Allium accessions. Significant differences were found in the fresh weight per larva fed on different Allium accessions. The larvae survived on A. roylei had a very low fresh weight (10. 3 mg per larva), while those on an accession of A. fistulosum had the highest fresh weight (45. 1 mg per larva). The larval fresh weight on A. roylei was lower than all the other accessions except from the tropical shallot cultivar Bawang Bali. To check whether or not a toxic compound was involved in the resistance present in A. roylei, ten accessions from four Allium species were screened. Five 3 -day old larvae were inoculated on regularly replaced leaf material of each accession of Allium species. No significant differences were found in mean fresh weight per larva and mean survival of larvae among different accessions. There were also no significant differences in pupal weight and developmental time. All larvae became pupae 10 days after inoculation. The data indicate that there is no toxic compound present in A. roylei. These results are underlined by the observation in the greenhouse bio-assay that A. roylei plants were equally damaged by the {{beet armyworm}} compared to other Allium species. The results obtained so far therefore suggest that introduction of resistance to S. exigua via the exploitation of variation for resistance to the beet armyworm in A. roylei is unclear and that genetic engineering using Cry sequences could provide a way forward...|$|R
