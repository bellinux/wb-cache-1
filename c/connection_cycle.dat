40|$|For self-reconfiguring modular robots the {{function}} to autonomously form and break connections between neighboring modules is a defining trait. Connectors must be strong, reversible, transmit power and signal, consume little power, {{and should be}} small and light enough for several to fit into each robot module. To make the modular robot system as versatile as possible, the connector should also be genderless, rotation agnostic, and tolerant to misalignment and positioning errors. Traditionally, connectors add significant mechanical complexity to each module. This thesis introduces two hardware components that implement {{different aspects of the}} modular robot connection process in small lightweight packages that contain no moving parts: The thermorheological valve is a device for directing fluid flow in order to selectively attract robot modules in a stochastic fluidic self-assembly system. Suitable thermorheological fluids are identified, the mechanical and thermal design of the valve is optimized, and demonstrations of mesoscale thermorheological valves are presented. The soldering connector is a connection mechanism for modular self-reconfiguring robots that forms solder joints by heating a low melting point alloy. The connector is mechanically strong, reversible, electrically conductive, only requires power when connecting and disconnecting, and supports ten to hundreds of <b>connection</b> <b>cycles.</b> Compared to other connection methods for modular robots the soldering connector, which is contained on a single printed circuit board, is very low in complexity, weight, size, and cost. Several designs of the connector are presented and evaluated and general guide- lines for application specific connector designs are provided. The thermorheological valve and soldering connector are then applied in the design of two modular robotic systems. The first proposed application is a fluidic self-assembly system of one-inch-sized, cube shaped modules that rely on stochastic external actuation to form predefined target shapes. Module prototypes and proof-of-concept experiments for this system are presented. A second application implements a system of 40 cube shaped modules that uses the self-soldering connector for self-reconfiguration. Several demonstrations of interactions that mimic the flow of matter through an ecosystem are shown in experiments and simulation, including growth and self-refinement. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R

Mussato classicized Latin prose in his letters and plays, suggesting he rejected traditional medieval prose metric in favour of classical Latin. He was the first, besides Lovati, to use classicizing style in poetic letters, and in his use of classical Latin, displays a founding characteristic of later humanists in his rejection of the contemporary style of Latin in favour of classical Latin. As well as letters, emulation of classical authors and style also influenced Mussato in historical writing, as he acted as chronicler in works such as Historia Augusta which described events such as Henry IV's invasion of Brescia. Historia Augusta shows classical influence in Mussato’s use of classical Latin stylistically, but also conceptually, as he drew on ancients such as Sallust in the inclusion of documents in the text, and Seutonius in his characterization of individuals.

The film has been assigned a thermal expansion coecient that causes it to be compressed upon cooling. It has also been allowed to thicken at high temperature by oxidation of the substrate. It is shown that, in some circumstances, ratcheting occurs, wherein the undulation amplitude, a, increases with each thermal cycle. When such a response happens, undesirable cyclic failure modes are induced. The analysis reveals {{that there is a}} critical undulation amplitude, ac, below which ratcheting does not occur.

40|$|Normal {{forms for}} logic {{programs}} under stable/answer set semantics are introduced. We {{argue that these}} forms can simplify the study of program properties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the kernel of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, {{it is possible to}} check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called 3 -kernel. A 3 -kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Wellfounded semantics. Rules in 3 -kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a <b>connection</b> between <b>cycles.</b> 3 -kernel programs may have positive conditions.
