In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle.

5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E

25|$|When the {{glucose level}} <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin {{release from the}} β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|E

The Sc group is composed of the Sc manuscript itself, which probably dates from about 1225, and its copy, Hg, which was written about 1250. Sc is currently part of the Red Book of the Exchequer held by the Public Record Office. Hg is held by the British Library and is catalogued as Hargrave 313. It consists of folios 5 through 14a of the manuscript.|$|E

500|$|Accuracy of {{coupling}} factor {{depends on the}} dimensional tolerances for the spacing of the two coupled lines. For planar printed technologies this <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resolution of the printing process which determines the minimum track width that can be produced and also puts a limit on how close the lines can be placed to each other. [...] This becomes a problem when very tight coupling is required and [...] couplers often use a different design. [...] However, tightly coupled lines can be produced in air stripline which also permits manufacture by printed planar technology. [...] In this design the two lines are printed {{on opposite sides of}} the dielectric rather than side by side. [...] The coupling of the two lines across their width is much greater than the coupling when they are edge-on to each other.Matthaei et al., pp.585–588, 776–778 ...|$|E

From Waegwan a road runs north and south along the east bank of the Naktong, another northeast through the mountains toward Tabu-dong, and still another southeast toward Taegu. Hill 303 was a critical terrain feature in control of the main Pusan-Seoul railroad and highway crossing of the Naktong, as well as of Waegwan itself.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for the Gone to Coney Island were {{positive}} with two positive, but altogether undetailed reviews in The Moving Picture World. A detailed review in The Moving Picture News {{acknowledged that the}} film will have a lasting impact [...] "as {{it is one of}} a class of pictures which can almost be shown as a repeater without hurting the reputation of the theatre." [...] The reviewer praised the photography and found the acting adequate, but the decision to include the marriage scene was deemed peculiar. For Booming Business, The Moving Picture World gave it two sentences which said the film was funny beyond description, butThe New York Dramatic Mirror provides a more detailed and negative review of the film by stating, [...] "This 'comic' is not up to the usual Thanhouser standard. In fact, it is rather silly all through, the only laughs being brought about by blows, falls, and smashing furniture. The principal character <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera and indicates the things he intends doing all through the picture, robbing it of every element of reality. He has a small store and adopts various schemes to boom business, such as giving health treatment with a magnetic battery, teaching boxing, and so on. Everything turns out badly and ends in general confusion." [...] Bowers notes that The New York Dramatic Mirror was not an unbiased reviewer, for the publication was slanted to the favor the Licensed companies instead of the Independents. Another window into the film is provided by an advertisement by the Amuzu in The Twin-City Daily Sentinel which states the grocery-man attempts to spur business in a variety of comical ways.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

[...] He too was critical of the rate of resource acquisition; [...] "the main problem with the game doesn't lie in its lack of originality though - rather, it's the [...] pedestrian pace in which armies are mustered." [...] He also criticized the lack of strategy, and the similarity of the three campaigns, concluding [...] "It just <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Ancient Wars: Sparta doesn't have anything special in a genre filled with incredible game experiences right now." ...|$|E

[...] British GM Nigel Short called Judit [...] "one of the three or four greatest chess prodigies in history". The other great chess prodigies were Paul Morphy, José Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky. However, Kasparov expressed early doubts: [...] "She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. It all <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle." [...] Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar himself in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: [...] "The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude—an idea that many male players refused to accept until they had unceremoniously been crushed by a twelve-year-old with a ponytail." ...|$|E
