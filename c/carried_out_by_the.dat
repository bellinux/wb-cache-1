A descriptive qualitative research design {{was used in this}} study, and the data were collected through three times of non participant observation and once an interview method. The steps of collecting data included preliminary visit, contacting the headmaster, contacting the English teacher, giving some interview, and conducting classroom observation. The results of this study were six techniques found from observation and interview. There was discussion <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to make a debate in pro and contra aspect; storytelling was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to tell their story one by one in front of the class; interviews was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to play a role as interviewers and interviewees using Yes/No Question and W/H Question; describing picture was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to describe the pictures and to give comment about the picture; communication game was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to make a guessing game with particular topic provided; and prepared talk was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> asking <b>the</b> students to make a presentation by using media such as a projector and laptop as well as image and video. In the concluding chapter, it was noted that the study reported in this thesis has shortcomings. The techniques used were designed with joyful learning methods that engaged students. However, the researcher found there were not many techniques implemented yet in this study concerning the weaknesses of this study and English Language teacherÂ’s ability in designing techniques in teaching speaking. It is suggested that a future study should be conducted to investigate the teacherÂ’s capability to design techniques in teaching speaking as a measurement for teacherÂ’s success in classroom activity...|$|R
