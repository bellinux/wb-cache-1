5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. <b>Children</b> <b>must</b> learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
25|$|In Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), the Court {{rejected}} {{the claim that}} laws affecting <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be in their best interests.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>child</b> <b>must</b> {{be able to}} {{perceive}} meaning from utterances. That is, the <b>child</b> <b>must</b> associate utterances with, for example, objects and actions in the real world.|$|R
50|$|The {{text of the}} document, as {{published}} by the International Save the Children Union in Geneva on 23 February 1923, is as follows:#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succoured.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> {{be the first to}} receive relief in times of distress.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.|$|R
50|$|Her {{experiences}} {{there and}} later in Russia, led her {{to believe that the}} rights of a child needed be especially protected and enforced, and her stipulations consisted of the following criteria:#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be the first to receive relief in times of distress.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.|$|R
25|$|Kindergarten and {{kindergarten}} {{for children}} from 2 to 5 {{years old to}} form thinking for children. Create the habit, the day of this period (not all <b>children</b> <b>must</b> learn this level).|$|E
25|$|Children often {{figure out}} quickly {{frequent}} irregular verbs, such as go and buy {{rather than less}} common ones, such as win. This suggests that <b>children</b> <b>must</b> hear the word several hundred times before {{they are able to}} use it correctly.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, non-therapeutic {{circumcision}} of male {{children has}} long been assumed to be lawful in every jurisdiction provided that one parent grants surrogate informed consent. Adler (2013) has recently challenged the validity of this assumption. As with every country, doctors who circumcise <b>children</b> <b>must</b> take care that all applicable rules regarding informed consent and safety are satisfied.|$|E
5000|$|Laws {{regarding}} taxis vary {{by state}} for infants. For children up to seven, a <b>child</b> restraint <b>must</b> be used if available, otherwise the <b>child</b> <b>must</b> use a properly fastened and adjusted seat belt.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> wait a short {{lag time}} before {{employing}} task demands ...|$|R
5000|$|Goal Directed: Each <b>child</b> <b>must</b> have an individualised Education Program (IEP) {{that distinguishes}} his/her {{particular}} needs. The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> get {{the services that}} are designed for him/her. These services will allow him/her to reach his/her annual goals which will be assessed {{at the end of}} each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.|$|R
25|$|The {{right to}} {{petition}} for divorce belongs to both men and women, though procedures for reconciliation and mediation are encouraged. A man may not repudiate his wife without the permission of a judge, {{and she and her}} <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be accorded their full rights under the law. Divorce proceedings take place in a secular court, rather than before a religious official. (See Islamic marital jurisprudence).|$|E
25|$|Given that <b>children</b> <b>must</b> {{have many}} {{documented}} sore throats for tonsillectomy to be worthwhile there is surprisingly little published evidence {{about how many}} children who have their tonsils removed actually meet these criteria. One small study in the UK demonstrated that most children who had their tonsils removed did not meet these criteria, meaning that most children operated on did not really benefit from the procedure.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be aware of their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity {{that they are doing}} within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.|$|E
50|$|First we'll {{watch the}} evening's {{greeting}} before every <b>child</b> <b>must</b> go to bed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be {{the first}} to receive relief in times of distress.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> use a metacognitive {{strategy}} {{forcing the}} use of internal dialogue ...|$|R
25|$|It {{is crucial}} that {{children}} are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be {{in an environment that}} allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E
25|$|Students ages 5-12 {{will meet}} at the Education Campus at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens once a month. Students ages 13-18 will attend class once every other month at the Education Campus at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens. Enrollment is limited to home-schooled {{children}} ages 5-18. Children will be enrolled into the appropriate age class based on their age as of September 1, 2016. In accordance with Florida state law, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be 5 years old on or before September 1st to enroll.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute otitis media. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 <b>children</b> <b>must</b> be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash. If pain is present, treatment to reduce it should be initiated.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> employ motivational and {{emotional}} {{control in the}} service of ongoing activity ...|$|R
5000|$|The Act now {{requires}} that every <b>child</b> <b>must</b> possess {{his or her}} own passport.|$|R
50|$|Woman is a {{being who}} {{similar to a}} <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be educated by a man.|$|R
25|$|In the generational {{transmission}} of surnames, the paternal surname's precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames {{from the family}} lineage. Contemporary law allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, but most people observe the traditional paternal–maternal surname order. So the daughter and son of Ángela López Sáenz and Tomás Portillo Blanco are usually called Laura Portillo López and Pedro Portillo López, but also could be called Laura López Portillo and Pedro López Portillo. The two surnames of all of a couple's <b>children</b> <b>must</b> {{be in the same}} order when recorded in the Registro Civil.|$|E
25|$|Attitudes {{and laws}} {{regarding}} adoption vary greatly. Whereas all cultures make arrangements whereby children whose birth parents are unavailable to rear {{them can be}} brought up by others, not all cultures have the concept of adoption, that is treating unrelated children as equivalent to biological children of the adoptive parents. Under Islamic Law, for example, adopted <b>children</b> <b>must</b> keep their original surname {{to be identified with}} blood relations, and, traditionally, women wear a hijab in the presence of males in their adoptive households. In Egypt, these cultural distinctions have led to making adoption illegal.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the bride}} and groom have to declare at the wedding which name they will use; and they have to declare which family name their {{children}} will get (which can be changed until the birth of the first child). Children can get either parent's surname, if it is on the marriage certificate, but all <b>children</b> <b>must</b> have the same surname. Since 2004 they can also get a hyphenated name, but only if both parents kept their birth names at least as one part of their new name. Children usually get their father's surname, but hyphenated names are becoming more common.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{setting the}} fire, the <b>child</b> <b>must</b> have felt some {{feelings}} of tension or arousal.|$|R

60|$|The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> be cold. Nicholas fetched his fur-lined {{cloak and}} wrapped it about her.|$|R
25|$|In {{the model}} Piaget {{developed}} in stage three, {{he argued that}} intelligence develops {{in a series of}} stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which <b>children</b> <b>must</b> constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.|$|E
25|$|For {{the above}} {{algorithm}} to correctly re-heapify the array, the node at index i and its two direct <b>children</b> <b>must</b> violate the heap property. If they do not, the algorithm will fall through with no {{change to the}} array. The down-heap operation (without the preceding swap) {{can also be used}} to modify the value of the root, even when an element is not being deleted. In the pseudocode above, what starts with // is a comment. Note that A is an array (or list) that starts being indexed from 1 up to length(A), according to the pseudocode.|$|E
25|$|As street <b>children</b> <b>must</b> {{provide for}} themselves, {{work is a}} very {{important}} aspect of their lives. Unfortunately, working conditions for street children are often very poor because they are confined to working in the informal sector, which is unregulated by the government. In Bombay, 50,000 children are illegally employed by 11,750 hotels, restaurants, canteens, tea shops, and eating places. Because of street children's lack of protection from a family and the law, employers often exploit them, making them virtual prisoners, sometimes withholding pay, and abusing them. Employers that would not mistreat the children often will not hire them because they are seen as too great of a risk.|$|E
