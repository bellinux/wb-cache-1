This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of its dissipation, Emily spared {{neighboring}} Haiti from the devastation initially anticipated. At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, civil protection teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special sterilizers were distributed to sanitize possibly <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters.</b> A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after being hit by a fallen tree. High winds caused some property damage in Léogâne and Jacmel.|$|E
5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters.</b> Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.|$|E

25|$|According to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21March and mid-July around 27PBq of caesium-137 {{entered the}} ocean, about 82percent before 8April. This {{emission}} represents {{the most important}} individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast {{has one of the}} world's strongest currents (Kuroshio Current). It transported the <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters</b> far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast. Migratory pelagic species are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean. Elevated levels of caesium-134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.|$|E

25|$|Between 21March and mid-July, around 27PBq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) {{entered the}} ocean, with about 82percent having flowed {{into the sea}} before 8April. However, the Fukushima coast {{has some of the}} world's strongest {{currents}} and these transported the <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters</b> far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Organisms that filter water and fish {{at the top of the}} food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.|$|E

500|$|Crushed shells, {{available}} as a by-product of the seafood canning industry, {{can be used to}} remove pollutants from water. [...] It has been found that, as long as the water is maintained at an alkaline pH, crushed shells will remove cadmium, lead and other heavy metals from <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters</b> by swapping the calcium in their constituent aragonite for the heavy metal, and retaining these pollutants in a solid form. The rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) has been shown to reduce the levels of copper and cadmium in <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters</b> in the Persian Gulf. The live animals acted as biofilters, selectively removing these metals, and the dead shells also had the ability to reduce their concentration.|$|E

The shrimp industry lost 25% of its catch, partly due to <b>contaminated</b> <b>waters.</b> Crop damage in Belize was estimated at $103million, mostly from banana losses. Iris's strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest, with upwards of 40% of trees affected in some areas. This disrupted the habitats of several animals, {{and it is likely}} that many of the howler monkeys near Monkey River were killed. The storm's strong waves eroded the beach, although marine effects were much less than those of Hurricane Keith in the previous year. Nevertheless, there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm, possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.|$|E
