40|$|The subject {{developed}} in my thesis {{relates to the}} "Exclusions from prohibition of quantitative restrictions". The origin of these exclusions {{can be found in}} the internal market law and more precisely in the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which is based the internal market of the European Union. The free movement of goods is ensured by removing fiscal and non-fiscal barriers that hinder trade between Member States and which are prohibited between Member States. The fiscal barriers involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties, all <b>charges</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> and other fiscal barriers such as internal taxations. The non fiscal barriers involve direct quantitative restrictions which are quotas and bans, as well as measures <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> to quantitative restrictions (MEE). These non fiscal barriers are prohibited but they can be justified in some cases. Direct quantitative restrictions almost disappeared while measures <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> to quantitative restrictions may exist in various forms and variations. Measures <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> on imports are prohibited by the article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to assess the {{constitutional}} position as to economic integration within Canada. Following a short review of'the basic elements of economic integration, it proceeds to analyse the law and practice relating to the free circulation of goods, and the free movement of persons, services and capital in Canada. Since such questions are usually associated with the concept of common market, a brief comparison is made on these various points with the practice of the European Economic Community. As far as concerns the free circulation of goods, the study starts with the usual distinction between tariff and non-tariff barriers. If customs duties have long since disappeared between the provinces, the author finds that <b>charges</b> <b>having</b> an <b>effect</b> <b>equivalent</b> to customs duties are not totally precluded under Canadian constitutional law, and as a matter of fact are occasionally encountered in practice. The paper also shows that if non-tariff barriers to interprovincial trade are theoretically precluded under s.   91 (2) of the B. N. A.  Act, certain types of obstacles not only appear constitutionally acceptable, but also are largely used by governments in practice, such as preferential purchasing policies, subsidies, public enterprises, etc. In the end, when our constitutional rules pertaining to the free circulation of goods are compared with those in application within the European Economic Community, they appear less stringent, leaving greater room for intervention to the provinces. The situation, as far as concerns the free movement of persons, services and capital is quite different. As the study finds, there are no clearly articulated principles relating to these questions in the Canadian constitution. However, due to the existence of a common nationality and a common currency, the most serious difficulties in this respect have been avoided. From that point of view, Canada has benefited from a clear advantage over the European Economic Community. Yet, regarding the free movement of persons and services, the paper shows that whereas no progress appears to have been made on that score within the last decade in Canada, the E. E. C. is pushing forward with plans calling for the common recognition of diplomas, etc. And regarding the free movement of capital, it appears that if the E. E. C has not progressed much since the first years of the Treaty of Rome, Canada for its part appears at the moment to be heading for a period of greater restriction on the movement of capital within the country. In conclusion, the question is raised whether the material division of jurisdiction between the federal and provincial governments, as opposed to a functional division of jurisdiction as is to be found in the E. E. C, is not responsible for the centripetal kind of federalism that appears more and more in demand in Canada as far as concerns economic matters. Acting unilaterally on the basis of its exclusive powers, the federal government has adopted so-called common policies that appear to have met with a large measure of disapproval from the various provinces. But this is a different problem that requires a separate treatment...|$|R

30|$|The new {{classical}} economists {{oppose the}} misperception {{part of the}} theory and assert that such an assumption is inconsistent with the rational expectation theory. That is, the demand for goods is based on expected present value of the future taxes (Catao and Terrones 2001). Budget policy can influence the price level through aggregate demand changes; it should change the expected value of the future taxes, which occurs by altering the sounding. In this sense, budget deficits and taxation <b>have</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effects</b> on the economy hence the term the ‘Ricardian equivalence theorem’ (Catao and Terrones 2001). That is, there is no change in national saving, since an increase in private saving as faced by an equivalent decline in public saving.
