In order to discriminate between pathological and healthy fetuses, a database with normal values of the parameters describing the <b>cardiograms</b> are needed. Hence, a database is set up for parameters extracted from fetal MCG and ECG. These <b>cardiograms</b> were recorded in uncomplicated pregnancies, which means that no maternal or fetal complications were noticeable. The database is partly composed of data taken from the literature [1 - 7] and partly of data that is not published before and is contributed by collaborating centers. The database is a compilation of data measured at the various centers using different measurement grids, flux transformers, magnetic field components, signal processing techniques, or locations of the reference electrode.

The validity of large-scale ensemble averaging of ambulatory impedance <b>cardiograms</b> was evaluated for preejection period (PEP), interbeat interval, and dZ/dt((min)) amplitude. We tested whether the average of "classical" 60 -sec ensemble averages across periods with fixed activity, posture, physical load, social situation, and location could be accurately estimated from a single large-scale ensemble average spanning these entire periods. Impedance and electrocardiograms were recorded for about 24 -h from 21 subjects. Recordings were scored by seven raters, using both methods for each subject. Good agreement (average intraclass correlation coefficient was. 91) between both ensemble averaging methods was found for all three cardiac function measures. The results indicate that for unambiguous ambulatory impedance <b>cardiograms,</b> large-scale ensemble averaging is valid, which makes measuring prolonged changes in cardiac sympathetic activity by measuring ambulatory PEP feasible even in large epidemiological samples...|$|R

Without the help of appropriate computerized methods, physicians are not able to make a diagnosis based on this assumption.

The latter provides analysis and processing, which identifies and extracts the heartbeat intervals from the <b>cardiograms,</b> the variation of which is then examined through the application of the Discreet Wavelet Transform.

40|$|Electrocardiogram monitoring, {{a routine}} {{practice}} {{when a patient}} presents a cardiovascular disturbance, is problematic during a magnetic resonance imaging session because the metallic leads, used to acquire the signal, act like antennae picking up noise interference from the magnet thereby distorting the electrocardiogram. A method is required to suppress this radio frequency noise as well as compensate for any intramagnet physiological artifacts. This {{is especially important for}} investigations of cardiac abnormalities such as ischemia. We compare the frequency and distribution of novel events between (i) intramagnet and extramagnet electrocardiograms and (ii) intramagnet electrocardiograms that have been adjusted using a wavelet denoising method coupled with a centroid differencing strategy.

40|$|We {{construct}} complex networks from pseudoperiodic time series, {{with each}} cycle {{represented by a}} single node in the network. We investigate the statistical properties of these networks for various time series and find that time series with different dynamics exhibit distinct topological structures. Specifically, noisy periodic signals correspond to random networks, and chaotic time series generate networks that exhibit small world and scale free features. We show that this distinction in topological structure results from the hierarchy of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor. Standard measures of structure in complex networks can therefore be applied to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series. Application to human electrocardiograms shows that such statistical properties are able to differentiate between the sinus rhythm <b>cardiograms</b> of healthy volunteers and those of coronary care patients.

40|$|The first {{derivative}} thoracic impedance <b>cardiogram,</b> phonocardiogram, and electrocardiogram {{were recorded}} in three groups of 22 subjects each. In Group 1 (control), simultaneous impedance <b>cardiogram,</b> phonocardiogram, and aortic valve echocardiograms showed that the X point of the impedance <b>cardiogram</b> occurred synchronously with the aortic second heart sound and with echocardiographic aortic valve closure. In group 2 (clinical diagnosis of aortic regurgitation) the scalar magnitude of the impedance <b>cardiogram</b> O wave and the ratios of the impedance <b>cardiogram</b> wave form X/dz/dtmax and O/dz/dtmax were different from control. In addition, the early diastolic (X) and systolic portions (S) of the impedance <b>cardiogram</b> wave form of group 3 patients were planimetered and expressed as the ratio X/S, called the impedance cardiographic aortic regurgitant fraction (aortic RFI). The aortic RFI was increased by handgrip, a manoeuvre which acutely increases the magnitude of aortic regurgitation.

40|$|Mitral valvular {{regurgitation}} consistently {{modified the}} wave {{form of the}} first derivative of the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram.</b> The transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> was recorded in 23 control subjects (group 1), and 23 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation (group 2). Simultaneous transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram,</b> electrocardiogram, and mitral valve echocardiograms in group 1 showed that the primary diastolic wave ("O") of the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> occurred synchronously with the maximal opening of the mitral valve. In group 2, the primary systolic wave (dZ/dt max) was diminished, and the "O" of the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> was raised. The area under the systolic wave of the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> (S) and the area under the diastolic opening of the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> (D) were measured and the ratio D/(D + S) calculated. This ratio, called the mitral regurgitation fraction was (0. 50 +/- 0. 14) in group 2 which was higher than that found in group 1 control subjects (0. 11 +/- 0. 08). The mitral regurgitation fraction (15 to 77 %) determined by the impedance method was closely correlated with the mitral regurgitation fraction (20 to 74 %) obtained during cardiac catheterisation; it also increased during isometric handgrip and decreased during amyl nitrite inhalation. In three mitral regurgitation patients the transthoracic impedance <b>cardiogram</b> returned to normal configuration after surgical implantation of a prosthetic mitral valve.

The low frequency time constant in the systems varied between 1 - 9 and 4 - 6 s, depending on the amplifier setting used, which for sine curves of frequency 0 - 5 and 2 Hz means an apparent prematurity for their maxima and minima varying between 53 and 1 ms, this being larger with lower frequency time constants and lower frequency curves...|$|R
