5|$|The Art Deco Tropicana, once a {{very popular}} lido on the beach, has {{suffered}} years of neglect. It <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> in 2000, and despite a number of attempts to reopen it, permission was given to demolish it in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The caverns <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{due to the}} Lebanese {{civil war}} in 1978 both tunnels leading to the lower and upper {{galleries}} were used to store munitions, the outside buildings for military purposes. The caves reopened in 1995 and remain one of the country’s key natural attractions.|$|E
5|$|The {{site and}} the light are {{operated}} by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island {{can be reached by}} ferry service from Scarborough, though visiting requires a permit and a four-wheel drive is mandatory.

25|$|The pool, {{pavilion}} building, entrance {{building and}} both fountains were granted Grade II listed status in 1998. Despite the listing and <b>the</b> pool <b>closing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>the</b> buildings {{were subjected to}} heavy vandalism.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the abbey}} wall, but <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> is the abbey retreat house, {{which is now}} used by the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The Tudor Gothic house was built between 1829 and 1830 by John Buckler from the stones of the abbey ruins for John Fry Reeves. It was altered and {{extended}} between 1850 and 1860, with further alterations in 1957.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, the Ministry of Primary Industries ordered <b>the</b> zoo <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> until <b>the</b> {{enclosures}} were {{upgraded to}} meet containment requirements.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> circuit will <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{following}} <b>the</b> {{conclusion of}} the 2017 racing season due <b>to</b> Dekra purchasing <b>the</b> circuit <b>to</b> run it as a testing ground for road car innovations.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 {{there was}} an active {{discussion}} about whether the monument should be turned the way it would face the cathedral, as well as {{whether it should be}} placed <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> square situated nearby.|$|R
5|$|In 1902, the Weymouth Corporation {{purchased}} the castle {{for the town}} from the Department of Woods and Forests {{for a total of}} £150. During the Second World War the castle probably housed an anti-aircraft battery as part of the defences created around Portland Harbour. Despite the construction of the Portland breakwaters nearby, the unstable clay cliffs remained vulnerable to erosion; in 1930 the ruins were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> due to safety concerns and the remaining embrasure of the gun platform collapsed during in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center {{was founded}} {{with a goal}} of closing the Rocky Flats plant. The Center has since set goals of keeping the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> {{preventing}} construction of highways {{in or near the}} site of the former plant, and preventing new housing construction in the area. The Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation an, as of 2014, has one full-time employee.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled {{at a higher level}} to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{option is}} {{possible from the}} Mühlbach valley (Bramberg municipality) in <b>the</b> upper Pinzgau <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Here the way runs initially along a drivable forest track (<b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public)</b> through <b>the</b> Baumgartenalm almost {{as far as the}} Stangenjoch.|$|R
25|$|The Syrian {{government}} also ordered {{the closure of}} an American school and the American Cultural Center in Damascus. And a <b>public</b> spokesman for <b>the</b> US embassy in Damascus said on Wednesday that <b>the</b> Embassy may <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> for an unspecified period of time.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{architectural}} character in Toronto, Casa Loma {{has been a}} popular filming location for movies and television. It is a popular venue for wedding ceremonies.

5|$|The Naag temple is a Sikh temple {{built by}} Chand Kaur, {{the wife of}} Kharak Singh who {{was the son of}} the then ruling Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The temple is square in plan and built on a raised platform. Its {{exterior}} walls are covered with fresco paintings. The temple also has a water-melon shaped dome. The site is currently <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> in order to prevent further deterioration.|$|E
5|$|The {{light is}} {{operated}} by Roads and Maritime Services, while {{the site is}} managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} Tomaree National Park, in which it is located. Visiting the lighthouse is difficult. The point is connected to the mainland with a narrow tombolo, and is only accessible by foot at low tide. It is accessible by boat, and the grounds are open, though the tower is <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weston's first pier, Birnbeck Pier, {{standing}} on a small island {{to the north of}} the bay is currently <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> The current owners, Manchester-based company Urban Splash purchased the pier in 2006. A competition was held as a means to encourage redevelopment of the site for commercial use. To date, no firm plans are in place, and the future of Birnbeck Pier is uncertain. The pier houses Weston-super-Mare Lifeboat Station.|$|E

50|$|Desiring <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> museum <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>the</b> museum offers diversified {{educational}} activities and public programs, {{and opened the}} Discovery Room in 2010 for the educational benefit of school children between 7 and 15 years of age. The Discovery Room provides children an opportunity for their creativity, researching, communicating, presenting, reading and writing skills through activities such as making traditional palm-leaf conical hats or wearing traditional costumes of different ethnic groups.|$|R
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive {{rights to}} the {{painting}} were acquired by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation, and lithographic prints were published soon thereafter. The painting was owned by the French Gallery until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum has been <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating of the Bride, from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The Prospect Park Zoo <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> in June 1988. Over {{the next}} six months, new homes were found for the {{displaced}} animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were {{turned over to the}} NY Zoological Society in April 1993.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|The {{floors of}} the rooms on this level are made from lime-ash plaster pressed into a bedding of straw and oak laths, which would have offered some {{protection}} against the ever-present risk of fire. All the first-floor rooms in the east range and all except the Prayer Room in the west range are <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> some having been converted into accommodation for the National Trust staff who live on site. The Education Room in the east range, above what is today the restaurant, was in the mid-16th century a solar, and is now reserved for use by school groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E
