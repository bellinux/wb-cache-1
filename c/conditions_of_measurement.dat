5000|$|Resting {{metabolic}} rate (RMR) is whole-body mammal (and other vertebrate) metabolism {{during a time}} period of strict and steady resting conditions that are defined {{by a combination of}} assumptions of physiological homeostasis and biological equilibrium.

Therefore, BMR is measured in the elusive [...] "perfect" [...] steady state, whereas RMR measurement is more accessible and thus, represents most, if not all measurements or estimates of daily energy expenditure.|$|E
50|$|Correction terms {{should be}} {{included}} in the measurement model when the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> are not exactly as stipulated. These terms correspond to systematic errors. Given an estimate of a correction term, the relevant quantity should be corrected by this estimate. There will be an uncertainty associated with the estimate, even if the estimate is zero, as is often the case. Instances of systematic errors arise in height measurement, when the alignment of the measuring instrument is not perfectly vertical, and the ambient temperature is different from that prescribed. Neither the alignment of the instrument nor the ambient temperature is specified exactly, but information concerning these effects is available, for example the lack of alignment is at most 0.001° and the ambient temperature at the time of measurement differs from that stipulated by at most 2 °C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus of}} {{classical}} test theory (CTT) is on determining error of the measurement. Perhaps {{the most famous}} model of CTT is the equation , where X is the observed score, T is the true score, and e is the error involved in measurement. Although e could represent {{many different types of}} error, such as rater or instrument error, CTT only allows us to estimate one type of error at a time. Essentially it throws all sources of error into one error term. This may be suitable in the context of highly controlled laboratory conditions, but variance is a part of everyday life. In field research, for example, it is unrealistic to expect that the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> will remain constant. Generalizability theory acknowledges and allows for variability in assessment conditions that may affect measurements. The advantage of G theory {{lies in the fact that}} researchers can estimate what proportion of the total variance in the results is due to the individual factors that often vary in assessment, such as setting, time, items, and raters.|$|E

The equations for energy dependence and time evolution of scattered radiation are derived in detail {{in the case of}} the non-split nuclear levels. The effect of hyperfine splitting on time evolution is also discussed. The time evolution of the scattered radiation soon after the primary flash depends on the temporal properties of the monochromator and has a more complicated form than the exponential nuclear decay. Later, the monochromator does not influence the time evolution. The energy dependence of space-integrated nuclear inelastic scattering is analogous to that of nuclear inelastic absorption. 1...|$|R
