5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Total depravity (also called {{absolute}} inability {{and total}} corruption) is a theological doctrine that {{derives from the}} Augustinian concept of original sin. It is the teaching that, {{as a consequence of}} the fall of man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin and, apart from the efficacious or prevenient grace of God, is utterly unable to <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> God or choose to accept salvation as it is freely offered.|$|E
25|$|Although trial {{judges have}} always had the {{authority}} to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to Daubert, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides. Once certain evidence has been excluded by a Daubert motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a Daubert motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under Daubert would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Fermat's {{principle}} {{is the main}} principle of quantum electrodynamics which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths {{at the point of}} observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer. The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.|$|E

They find him in Snowbourn, where they hear troubling news from Harding, Aldor of the Northmarch - no word has come from Wildermore, in remote corner of the Wold, for weeks. Wildermore is where Gléowine spend his youth {{and a chance to}} revisit those lands gives him a new purpose. He joins the player's companions as they travel to the Wold and then to Wildermore. The find the land engulfed in snow, highly unnatural for those lands, and terrorized by a stone giant named Nurzum. A foul product of Saruman experiments, he had his strength augmented with remains of an ancient Huorn, making him nigh invulnerable, and a relic of Morgoth from Thangorodrim fused to his back, causing unnatural cold, snow storms and ice to follow him whenever he goes. Widfara, one of Harding's men from the Wold, is a sole survivor of his attack, and believes everyone else, including Harding's son Leodwig, killed.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{the story}} splits off in {{numerous}} possibilities, {{based on the}} player's choices. The narrator continues the story, but when the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action, forcing the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors, with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door; the player can <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which makes the narrator annoyed and causes him to pressure the player {{to return to the}} 'proper' path. Because of this, much of the story is considered thought-provoking about the nature of choice and decisions. The narration also breaks the fourth wall on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the curious}} is a {{chemistry}} student named Brooke Logan, {{who comes from}} a working-class family and who lives with her single mother Beth, and her siblings Storm, Donna and Katie in a typical American home in the San Fernando Valley {{in the city of}} Los Angeles. In an ironic twist of fate, Beth was Eric's college girlfriend before he married Stephanie. Brooke's life soon becomes a key element in the series. Originally from a middle-class background, her love affair with Ridge sets up much of the story-line, beginning in the first year. Every so often, Ridge and Brooke reunite only to break up due to various circumstances, and Ridge invariably finds comfort (in most cases, this would lead to marriage) with another love of his life Dr. Taylor Hayes. In addition, the rivalry between Ridge's mother Stephanie and Brooke {{plays a key role in}} the drama. Following one of her breakups with Ridge, Brooke marries his father Eric, who divorces Stephanie to do so. Brooke gives birth to two of Eric's children. The couple eventually divorce and Eric reconciles with Stephanie. Likewise, Brooke and Ridge resume their pattern of an on-again-off-again relationship, between Brooke's relationships with other men and Forrester family members, and Ridge's multiple reunions with Taylor. Eric eventually marries Brooke's sister, Donna Logan and legally adopts her son Marcus. They later divorce due to their family's bitter history. Felicia and Kristen Forrester <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> their own paths, leaving the family company to be run by Ridge, Thorne, Rick, Marcus, and their families.|$|E

500|$|Another {{gameplay}} {{element that}} helps to distinguish the Marvel vs. Capcom series from other fighting game franchises is its emphasis on aerial combat. Every character in the Marvel vs. Capcom series is given a [...] "Launcher" [...] move, which sends the opponent flying up into the air. The player can then <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> up immediately by using a [...] "Super Jump", which allows a character to jump much higher than normal, {{in order to continue}} their combo; these airborne combos are called [...] "Air Combos" [...] or [...] "Aerial Raves". Marvel vs. Capcom 3 introduced a gameplay feature known as the [...] "Team Aerial Combo" [...] or [...] "Aerial Exchange", giving players the opportunity to extend their Air Combos further by quickly tagging in their other characters while mid-air.|$|E
500|$|Fleet Admiral Lord Terrence Hood (voiced by Ron Perlman) first {{appears in}} the novel [...] He {{is a member of}} the UNSC Security Committee and is the Chief of Naval Operations. He greatly respects the Spartans, not only because of their record, but because they have saved his life on two occasions. When Halo 2 begins, Admiral Hood {{presents}} the Master Chief, Sergeant Johnson, and Miranda Keyes with medals aboard the Cairo Station. In , Hood receives an urgent message by Dr. Halsey requesting for him to send Spartans to assist her, and obliges by ordering Fred-104, Will-043, and Linda-058 to Onyx. In Halo 3, Hood is in overall command of Earth's defense with Commander Miranda Keyes reporting directly to him. He accepts the need for humanity to ally with the Elites, but is not entirely happy about it. He leads the remaining human naval forces in an attack on the Prophet of Truth's dreadnought, but the attack fails when the Forerunner artifact under New Mombasa activates, creating a portal to the Ark. When the Master Chief, Keyes, and several Elite and human forces <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the Prophet of Truth through the portal, he decides to stay behind to make a final stand on Earth. At the end of the game, he commemorates a small monument to the war and the sacrifices it involved.|$|E

500|$|Officer grades up to {{lieutenant}} colonel reflect progression {{in training and}} organizational seniority, rather than command authority. Because of this, {{it is not uncommon}} for senior members commanding groups and squadrons to have members of superior grades serving under them. Current, retired and former members of the United States Armed Forces may be promoted directly to the CAP grade equivalent to their military grade, although some <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the same standards as non-prior-service members. Except for a few exceptional cases, senior members are only promoted to the grade of CAP colonel upon appointment as a Region Commander, responsible for overseeing multiple states, or Wing Commander, responsible for the administration of CAP units across an entire state. Former military enlisted personnel may choose to retain their grade as senior members, with grades E-5 (CAP Staff Sergeant) through E-9 (CAP Chief Master Sergeant) available. Former CAP National Commander, Maj Gen Carr, unveiled plans to restructure the CAP NCO program to allow individuals to 'enlist' as an NCO and progress through a specific professional development program. According to an AF.mil article on the subject, [...] "The current design of the NCO corps in the CAP only allows former active-duty NCOs to be a part of the corps, with no upgrade training for promotion within the ranks. The newly signed corps structure will mirror the Air Force NCO force structure with an established process to promote and develop NCOs.". Maj.Gen. Carr's plan did not follow through but in November 2016, a new NCO Professional Development program was implemented allowing NCO's to promote as you would in the officer ranks, furthering the ability of the CAP NCO corp.|$|E
