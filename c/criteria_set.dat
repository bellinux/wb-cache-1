5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the <b>criteria</b> <b>set</b> forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection <b>criteria</b> <b>set</b> by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
40|$|Recognition memory, that is, {{the ability}} to judge whether an item has been {{previously}} encountered in a particular context, depends on two factors: discriminability and <b>criterion</b> <b>setting.</b> Discriminability draws on memory processes while <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> (i. e., {{the application of a}} threshold resulting in a yes/no response) is regarded as a process of cognitive control. Discriminability and <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> are assumed to draw on distinct anatomical structures, but definite evidence for this assumption is lacking. We applied voxel-based and region of interest-based lesion-symptom mapping to 83 patients in the acute phase of ischemic stroke to determine the anatomical correlates of discriminability and <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> in verbal recognition memory. Recognition memory was measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Signal-detection theory was used to calculate measures for discriminability and <b>criterion</b> <b>setting.</b> Lesion-symptom mapping revealed that discriminability draws on left medial temporal and temporo-occipital structures, both thalami and the right hippocampus, while <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> draws on the right inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions in the right inferior frontal gyrus were associated with liberal response bias. These findings indicate that discriminability and <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> indeed depend on distinct anatomical structures and provide new insights in the anatomical correlates of these cognitive processes that underlie verbal recognition memory.

40|$|Ongoing {{concerns}} {{exist in}} the literature regarding the construct of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and how to best conceptualize and measure this disorder. We compared the traditional DSM-IV PTSD symptom criteria (i. e., symptoms from clusters B, C, and D) to a revised <b>criterion</b> <b>set</b> that omits overlapping mood and other anxiety symptoms on PTSD prevalence, PTSD diagnostic caseness, associated psychiatric comorbidity, functional status, and structural validity using a cross-sectional, multi-site primary care sample of 747 veterans. After removing items theorized to overlap with mood and other anxiety disorders, PTSD prevalence was identical using both <b>criterion</b> <b>sets</b> (i. e., 12 %). Overall, there were few statistically significant differences in PTSD caseness, associated psychiatric comorbidity, functional status, and structural validity across the two diagnostic <b>criterion</b> <b>sets.</b> These data provide further support that removing items that overlap with other psychiatric disorders does not significantly impact the prevalence of PTSD, its associated comorbidity and functional impairment, or its structural validity. Although the revised <b>criterion</b> <b>set</b> represents a more parsimonious model, the current study findings generally support the strong construct validity of PTSD. The implications of these study findings for research and clinical practice are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to <b>criteria</b> <b>set</b> out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the recently developed (statistically derived) "ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis Working Group" improvement criteria (ASAS-IC) for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) reflect clinically relevant improvement {{according to the}} opinion of an expert panel. The ASAS-IC consist of four domains: physical function, spinal pain, patient global assessment, and inflammation. Scores on these four domains of 55 patients with AS, {{who had participated in}} a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy trial, were presented to an international expert panel (consisting of patients with AS and members of the ASAS Working Group) in a three round Delphi exercise. The number of (non-) responders according to the ASAS-IC was compared with the final consensus of the experts. The most important domains in the opinion of the experts were identified, and also selected with discriminant analysis. A number of provisional <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> that best represented the consensus of the experts were defined. Using other datasets, these clinically derived <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> as well as the statistically derived ASAS-IC were then tested for discriminative properties and for agreement with the end of trial efficacy by patient and doctor. Forty experts completed the three Delphi rounds. The experts considered twice as many patients to be responders than the ASAS-IC (42 v 21). Overall agreement between experts and ASAS-IC was 62 %. Spinal pain was considered the most important domain by most experts and was also selected as such by discriminant analysis. Provisional <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> with an agreement of >or= 80 % compared with the consensus of the experts showed high placebo response rates (27 - 42 %), in contrast with the ASAS-IC with a predefined placebo response rate of 25 %. All <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> and the ASAS-IC discriminated well between active and placebo treatment (chi(2) = 36 - 45; p < 0. 001). Compared with the end of trial efficacy assessment, the provisional <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> showed an agreement of 71 - 82 %, sensitivity of 67 - 83 %, and specificity of 81 - 88 %. The ASAS-IC showed an agreement of 70 %, sensitivity of 62 %, and specificity of 89 %. The ASAS-IC are strict in defining response, are highly specific, and consequently show lower sensitivity than the clinically derived <b>criteria</b> <b>sets.</b> However, those patients who are considered as responders by applying the ASAS-IC are acknowledged as such by the expert panel as well as by patients' and doctors' judgments, and are therefore likely to be true responder...|$|R

40|$|Background: In this study, {{we sought}} to compare the {{performance}} of spondyloarthritis (SpA) classification <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> in an international SpA cohort with patients included from five continents around the world. Methods: Data from the (ASAS) COMOrbidities in SPondyloArthritis (ASAS-COMOSPA) study were used. ASAS-COMOSPA is a multinational, cross-sectional study with consecutive patients diagnosed with SpA by rheumatologists worldwide. Patients were classified according to the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG), modified European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (mESSG), Amor, modified Amor, Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA), ASAS peripheral spondyloarthritis (pSpA) and ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria. Overlap between the classification <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> was assessed for patients with and without back pain. Furthermore, patients fulfilling different arms of the ASAS axSpA criteria (imaging arm, clinical arm, both arms) were compared {{on the presence of}} SpA features. Results: A total of 3942 patients (5 continents, 26 countries) were included. The mean age was 43. 6 years, 65. 0 % were male, 56. 2 % were human leucocyte antigen B 27 -positive and 64. 4 % had radiographic sacroiliitis (based on modified New York criteria). Of the patients, 85. 5 % were classified by the ASAS SpA criteria (87. 7 % ASAS axSpA, 12. 3 % ASAS pSpA). Fulfilment of the Amor, ESSG and CASPAR criteria was present in 83. 3 %, 88. 4 % and 21. 6 % of patients, respectively. Of the patients with back pain (n = 3227), most were classified by all three of Amor, ESSG and ASAS axSpA criteria (71. 4 %). Patients fulfilling the imaging arm and the clinical arm of the ASAS axSpA criteria had similar presentations of SpA features. In patients without back pain, overlap between classification <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> was seen, although to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Most patients with a clinical diagnosis of axial SpA in the worldwide ASAS-COMOSPA study fulfil several classification <b>criteria</b> <b>sets,</b> and a substantial overlap between different <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> is seen, which suggests a high level of credibility of the criteria. Large inter-regional differences in the fulfilment of classification criteria were not found. Patients fulfilling the clinical arm were remarkably similar to patients fulfilling the imaging arm with respect to the presence of most SpA feature...|$|R
40|$|Recognition memory {{requires}} both retrieval {{processes and}} control {{processes such as}} <b>criterion</b> <b>setting.</b> Decision <b>criteria</b> were manipulated by offering different payoffs for correct “old ” versus “new ” re-sponses. <b>Criterion</b> <b>setting</b> influenced the following late-occurring (1, 000 ms), conflict-sensitive event-related brain potential (ERP) components: the stimulus-locked late posterior negativity (LPN) and the response-locked error-related negativity (ERN). The LPN–ERN were most negative to hits under conservative payoff conditions involving conflict between the correct old response and the payoff for new responses. This same conservative–hit condition was most frequently associated with response reversals when fast initial judgments were followed by slower judgments. Postresponse ERP activity may index conflict-sensitive processes underlying postretrieval cognitive control mechanisms involved with assessing responses to current items and updating response criteria on later trials...|$|R
40|$|Problems in {{modelling}} categorical perception (CP) {{and attempts}} to apply signal detection theory (SDT) to CP are reviewed. An approach based on SDT supplemented by a theory of <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> is presented. <b>Criterion</b> <b>setting</b> theory (CST) postulates mechanisms that reset the response criterion on each trial, and it accounts for sequential dependencies. A <b>criterion</b> <b>setting</b> model for discrimination is shown to fit data from the literature. The hypothesis that ''sharp'' category boundaries may arise from the suppression of noise caused by intertrial dependencies was examined in an experiment on the identification of [ba] and [pa] syllables, and tone combinations of varying tone-onset time. However, it was shown that {{both positive and negative}} intertrial dependencies were present. They could be fitted by the criterion-setting model; in this respect, CP resembles standard psychophysical judgements. Examination of the psychometric functions from the two CP tasks shows that they are not normal ogives, as in standard psychophysical tasks: these curves are steeper centrally and flatter at the extremes than a Gaussian ogive; we describe them as ''hypersigmoid''. The description of CP identification functions as hypersigmoid provides a new, qualitative characterization of the ''sharp'' category boundaries traditionally claimed for CP. Their causation remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} whether it is desirable to implement the new English system of higher education funding in the Czech Republic. The English system based on income contingent loans is the youngest system of higher education funding. Chapters two and three put forward <b>criteria</b> <b>sets</b> to determine suitability of education system. The first <b>set</b> of <b>criteria</b> reflects the unique role of human capital, its levels and quality necessary for sustainable economic growth. Second <b>set</b> of <b>criteria</b> includes requirements for the system to be economically efficient.
