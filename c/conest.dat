He was promoted to the rank of colonel and retired from the UPDF in 2007. He successfully contested for the LC5 Chairperson position in Oyam District in 2011, on the ruling National Resistance Movement, political party ticket which he won until 2016 when he left to <b>conest</b> for the Oyam North memebr of parliament.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a pair of}} {{accidents}} in the 1970s, heavy work was done on the route {{to make it more}} suitable for light vehicles, as reconfiguration for load-bearing vehicles, and for buses, was considered too expensive and difficult to achieve. The road was widened, and portions were expanded to three lanes near the summit. A strict prohibition was enforced, altogether banning vehicles which weigh more than eight tons and forbidding buses, except on local and regular routes, from using the road without authorization from the local prefect. [...] Local and regular service is only allowed on specially-designed vehicles with speed-reducers. Buses and trucks coming from the regular route must turn off at La Mure and take secondary road 529 past the massif of <b>Conest</b> towards Grenoble. Still, many violations of the rule have been noted. [...] To discourage drivers, a sign with a skull with flickering eyes was formerly installed {{at the top of the}} road; this, however, was soon removed because it was viewed in poor taste and as politically incorrect.|$|E
40|$|FORTRAN 77 codes SONEST and <b>CONEST</b> are {{presented}} for estimating the 1 -norm (or the infinity-norm) {{of a real}} or complex matrix, respectively. The codes are of wide applicability in condition estimation since explicit access to the matrix, A, is not required; instead, matrix-vector products Ax and ATx are computed by the calling program via a reverse communication interface. The algorithms {{are based on a}} convex optimization method for estimating the 1 -norm of a real matrix devised by Hager. We derive new results concerning the behavior of Hager's method, extend it to complex matrices, and make several algorithmic modifications in order to improve the reliability and efficiency...|$|E
