5000|$|Birmingham {{students}} {{notice the}} impact of his economic education, but particularly in his approach to <b>contracts</b> and <b>damage</b> measures. The first systematic statement of the efficiency of expectation damages {{to appear in the}} legal literature was that of Professor Birmingham, in his article Breach of <b>Contract,</b> <b>Damage</b> Measures, and Economic Efficiency, 24 Rutgers L. Rev. 273 (1970). [...] Illustrative is Birmingham's following statement in that piece: [...] "Although choice among Pareto optimal states requires appeal to subjective values, the superiority of at least one such state over any given state outside the set may be defended as almost tautological." [...] Since that time, contract scholarship has increasingly adopted economic perspectives. In the abstract for Damage Measure and Economic Rationality: The Geometry of Contract Law, Birmingham writes [...] "The question of damage measures presented by the conscious decision of a promisor to breach a losing contract raises one of the most perplexing conceptual problems in contract law. Recognizing the present inability of the courts rationally to resolve the problem, as illustrated by the opposing decisions in Groves v. John Wunder Company and Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal and Mining Company, the author undertakes to examine the premises of contract law with a fresh perspective-economic analysis." [...] It is precisely this [...] "fresh perspective" [...] of [...] "economic analysis" [...] that pervades and infuses much of this legal theory and is one of his biggest contributions to the legal world. At the same time, however, one would be wise not to overlook Birmingham's further remarks, now issuing some twenty years after Breach of <b>Contract,</b> <b>Damage</b> Measures, and Economic Efficiency: [...] "Scholarship about contracts suffers too, however, under our hypothetical hegemony of economics. There are no more revolutions for us, no new paradigms. Starting with our single rule, we practice Kuhnian normal science, writing successive articles showing that rule X, rule Y, etc. of contract law are efficient. This practice is useful and necessary but unheroic; our physics-envy is of Newton not of some anonymous technician." ...|$|R

[...] On appeal, a federal appellate court [...] "determined that the {{terms of the}} Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions". The case was remanded to the District Court, which did not apply the superior court's criteria (on the grounds that in the interim, the Supreme Court had changed the applicable law).

5000|$|It is, to be sure, undeniable {{that the}} {{regulations}} here prevent {{the most profitable}} use of appellees' property. Again, however, that is not dispositive. When we review regulation, {{a reduction in the}} value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking. Compare Goldblatt v. Hempstead, supra, at 594, and Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), with Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, supra. In the instant case, {{it is not clear that}} appellees will be unable to derive economic benefit from the artifacts; for example, they might exhibit the artifacts for an admissions charge. At any rate, loss of future profits - unaccompanied by any physical property restriction - provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim. Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform. Further, perhaps because of its very uncertainty, the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-related interests.

The dynamic structure of the model allows us to investigate investment dynamics under alternative <b>contract</b> <b>damages.</b> First, under expectation damages, the seller has an incentive to invest only in the first period (front-loading of investment). Second, under reliance damages, a similar front-loading of investment occurs, and the degree of front-loading is excessive relative to the expectation damages. Third, under restitution damages, the seller has an incentive to invest only in the second period. We also examine efficiency properties of new hybrid measures of damages in which damages depend on the timing of breach. <b>Contract</b> <b>Damages,</b> Investment Dynamics...|$|E

The correctness of this conclusion depends, however, on what is understood by punishment. This article argues that punishment is not necessarily explicable only as a form of state punishment, but may (adopting the retributive idea of punishment expounded by Jane Hampton) also be understood as a form of correlatively-structured response that redresses the moral injury inflicted by one 2 ̆ 7 s conduct on another.

40|$|The law of {{contracts}} is complex but remarkably stable. What we lack {{is a widely}} accepted interpretation of that law as embodying a coherent set of normative choices. Some scholars have suggested that either economic efficiency or personal autonomy provide unifying principles of contract law. These two approaches, however, seem incommensurable, which suggests that we must reject {{at least one of}} them in order to have a coherent theory. This Article dissents from this view and has a simple thesis: Economic accounts of the current doctrine governing <b>contract</b> <b>damages</b> have failed, but efficiency arguments remain key to any adequate theory of contract law. Contractual liability-like virtually all civil liability-is structured around the concept of bilateralism, meaning that damages are always paid by defeated defendants to victorious plaintiffs. Ultimately, economic accounts of this basic feature are unpersuasive. This criticism, however, leaves untouched many of the key economic insights into the doctrine of <b>contract</b> <b>damages.</b> The limited failure of economic interpretations points toward a principled accommodation of both autonomy and efficiency in a single vision of contract law where notions of autonomy provide the basic structure and economics fills in most of the doctrinal detail...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to conciliate some {{conclusions}} of the economic theories of breach of contract and tort law. The main result is that the two efficient alternatives that tort law identifies (negligence rule and strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence) are mirrored by two efficient ways of defining <b>contract</b> <b>damages.</b> The first consists of forcing the debtor to pay expectation damages but limiting the level of the creditor’s reliance (rule of damage mitigation). The second consists of obliging the debtor to pay expectation damages only when his breach of contract implies negligence, otherwise using restitution remedies (doctrines of impracticability and force majeure). ...|$|E
40|$|In Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s Direct Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil CO., the California Supreme Court affirmed its {{position}} that an insurance carrier may risk tort liability for {{breach of the}} implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in addition to <b>contract</b> <b>damages.</b> Moreover, Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s enabled the court to explore such liability {{in the context of}} an ordinary commercial contract in which 2 ̆ 2 parties of roughly equal bargaining power are free to shape the contours of their agreement. 2 ̆ 2 The Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s majority deemed it unnecessary to find tort liability on the breach of the implied covenant issue. Instead the court created a more limited area of tort liability - the so-called tort of 2 ̆ 2 stonewalling 2 ̆ 2 - in which the breaching party denies, in bad faith and without probable cause, the existence of a contract to shield itself from liability. This narrowly defined tort may well have ramifications on freedom of contract and affect the future of commercial contract negotiation. The essence of freedom of contract lies in the parties assuming responsibility for making enforceable contracts. This freedom also permits the parties to breach their contracts, resulting in liability to the other party for compensatory damages. Parties in an ordinary commercial contract who have mutually agreed on their obligations and expectations subject to specified covenants, conditions and remedies may not look favorably upon the imposition of tort liability for breach of contract in addition to traditional <b>contract</b> <b>damages...</b>|$|E
