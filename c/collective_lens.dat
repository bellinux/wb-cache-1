For {{the construction of}} an achromatic <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> ( [...] positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power. For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted. This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective; the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the Herschel or Fraunhofer Condition, the latter being the best vide supra, Monochromatic Aberration). In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii. According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f. Photog., 1891, 5, p. 225; 1893, 7, p. 221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr. Nachr., 1856, p. 289). Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater [...] ), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images. In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, [...] decreased as [...] increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the new achromats, and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first anastigmats (photographic objectives).|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} focusing {{concept in}} which a weak magnetic lens provides strong focusing of an intense ion beam pulse carrying a neutralizing electron background is investigated by making use of advanced particle-in-cell simulations and reduced analytical models. The original analysis by Robertson Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 149 (1982) is extended to the parameter regimes of particular importance for several high-energy density physics applications. The present paper investigates (1) the effects of non-neutral collective focusing in a moderately strong magnetic field; (2) the diamagnetic effects leading to suppression of the applied magnetic field due {{to the presence of}} the beam pulse; and (3) the influence of a finite-radius conducting wall surrounding the beam cross-section on beam neutralization. In addition, it is demonstrated that the use of the <b>collective</b> focusing <b>lens</b> can significantly simplify the technical realization of the final focusing of ion beam pulses in the Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment-I (NDCX-I), and the conceptual designs of possible experiments on NDCX-I are investigated by making use of advanced numerical simulations. 2011 American Institute of Physic...|$|R

The current study examined patients’ experiences of a group-based programme {{for the management of}} morbid obesity delivered within the UK National Health Service. The focus of the study was on the emerging dynamic of the group and patients’ perceptions of its impact on health outcomes. Design: A qualitative interview study was conducted and involved patients recruited from a Tier 3 bariatric service in the South West of England. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Methods: Twenty patients (12 females) with a BMI≥ 35 Kg/m 2 participated in a semi-structured one-to-one interview. Participants had been registered with the bariatric service for at least six months. None of the participants had had bariatric surgery. Results: Most participants felt that they had benefited from participating in the group programme and talked about the group as a resource for lifestyle change. Participants’ narratives centred on the emergence of a sense of self based upon their participation in the group: establishing psychological connections to other patients, or shared social identity, was regarded as a key mechanism through which the programme’s educational material was accessed, and underpinned the experience of social support within the group. Through interaction with other patients, involving the sharing of personal experiences and challenges, participants came to experience their weight “problem” through a <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> that they felt empowered them to initiate and sustain individual lifestyle change. Discussion: Bariatric care groups have the potential to support lifestyle change and weight loss and may help address the psychological needs of patients. Nurturing a sense of shared social identity amongst patients with morbid obesity should be a core aim of the care pathway and may provide the foundation for successful translation of dietetic content in group programmes...|$|E

40|$|This practice-based {{industrial}} design research examines sustainable transport {{through the lens}} of Open Design. As Whitelegg and Urry believe, automobility needs to be reimagined to meet future sustainability targets, and others like Manzini, Margolin Moriarty and Honery, deem that this cannot be achieved without new sociotechnical systems. To this end, the research question that asks: 'How might the design of a personal mobility vehicle become more accessible, diverse and sustainable?' In response, the project proposes that principles of Open Design- a term coined by Vallance, Kiani and Nayfeh to describe open source physical artefacts- be used to design a do-it-yourself (DIY) velomobile- a pedal-powered bicycle or tricycle covered by an exterior fairing. By using the device of Open Design, the production system, product materiality and end use can potentially become more diverse, accessible and sustainable. The project was undertaken using a method of practise-based research, or what Shon and Archer respectively term 'reflective practice' and 'research through design'. It relied on developing a range of design solutions through the process of tinkering, or what Buchanan terms, a 'craft' method. This was a heuristic approach which relied on examining the precedents of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) through a 3 D printer design project. The lessons learned were applied to the design of a velomobile and its production system. As an extension of Open Design, the research synthesised three supporting topic platforms; modularity, DIY production and upcycling. Modularity is critical to aid end-user innovation and design diversity; DIY principles allow greater design accessibility; and, upcycling acts as a sustainability device. The two project outcomes- a 3 D printer and a velomobile -were both designed as modular tensegrity systems and were made by hand in a domestic setting from waste materials, off-the-shelf components and 3 D-printed couplings. The designs allow the products to be constructed, reconfigured and finally deconstructed for further reuse at end-of-life (EoL). This approach extends the value of the outcomes beyond the artefacts themselves and into their systems of production. At present, few products in the personal transport domain encourage product diversity by promoting combined end-user participation in the build process, continuing avenues for user-led innovation and what Mcdonough and Braungart term cradle-to-cradle manufacturing. None have yet approached the issues of product accessibility, design diversity and sustainability through the <b>collective</b> <b>lens</b> of DIY tensegrity structures and upcycling systems. The research outcomes are of practical significance and are presented as prototypes for further end-user development. In this respect, the project was limited to the development of Open Design 'seeds' and did not include what Fischer and Giaccardi term the 'meta-design' aspects of the process - that is, the overarching systems required to enable collaborative end-user innovation. Rather, the development of such is an opportunity for further research...|$|E

40|$|There is {{much debate}} in {{academic}} advising practitioner literature {{and in the}} popular media over the influence exerted by involved parents on students and colleges. There is a broad consensus that parental involvement has increased to levels not previously witnessed on college campuses (Cutright, 2008; Shoup, Gonyea, & Kuh, 2009; Wartman & Savage, 2008). It can be argued, therefore, that {{the past ten years}} have seen a change in the relationship between students, their parents, and the students' academic advisors. Although there has been much discussion among academic advising professionals concerning the influence parents have on both student development and on their own role as guides and mentors of new students there is a paucity of research studies on the topic. Current research on parental involvement and student success remains in its infancy. This study contributes to the nascent research field by investigating academic advising professionals’ experiences and perceptions of parental involvement. Some level of parental involvement has been shown to positively influence student success in college (NSSE 2007; Shoup, Gonyea, and Kuh, 2009; Taub 2008). Studies have also indicated the positive influence of academic advising on student adjustment to college and student success (Gordon & Habley 2000; Hunter & White, 2004; Light, 2001; Yarrish, 2008). It is, therefore, important that the important but complex environment of students, parents, and advisors be studied more specifically. This study utilizes qualitative case study methods to examine the perceptions on involved parenting held by advising professionals at an integrated advising unit at a large, Midwestern, flagship type public university. The case study’s participants provide individual and <b>collective</b> narrative <b>lenses</b> to answer this study’s research questions through surveys and face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Information pertaining to unit policy, procedures, and communication resources was also collected. A number of issues emerged through the data analysis clearly reflecting the experiences and perceptions of this case study’s advising professionals: 1) the advising professionals generally found parental involvement to be helpful; 2) that most parental involvement revolved around legitimate issues improving the advisors’ knowledge of specific student problems capital; 3) there appears to be some generational differences in how advisors approach interaction with parents based on their own age and life experiences; 4) that the negative narratives perpetuated by the media, aspects of the literature, and shared conversations amongst advisors continue to dominate advisors’ responses to parental engagement; 5) there is an emotional aspect to parental engagement; 6) {{that there is a need}} for specific training for advisors to engage parents; and, 7) that good practices are emerging regarding how advisors can effectively work with parents to assist students and parents through the transition stage from home and high school to the college environment. The case study’s results and analysis offer a series of conclusions and recommendation both for practice and for research. The study makes a contribution to a field where there is a presently a dearth of research-based studies...|$|R
