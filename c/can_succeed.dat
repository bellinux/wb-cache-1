5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|First-person {{shooters}} may be structurally {{composed of}} levels, {{or use the}} technique of a continuous narrative in which the game never leaves the first-person perspective. Others feature large sandbox environments, which are not divided into levels and can be explored freely. In first-person shooters, protagonists interact with the environment to varying degrees, from basics such as using doors, to problem solving puzzles based {{on a variety of}} interactive objects. In some games, the player can damage the environment, also to varying degrees: one common device is the use of barrels containing explosive material which the player can shoot, destroying them and harming nearby enemies. Other games feature environments which are extensively destructible, allowing for additional visual effects. The game world will often make use of science fiction, historic (particularly World War II) or modern military themes, with such antagonists as aliens, monsters, terrorists and soldiers of various types. Games feature multiple difficulty settings; in harder modes, enemies are tougher, more aggressive and do more damage, and power-ups are limited. In easier modes, the player <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> through reaction times alone; on more difficult settings, it is often necessary to memorize the levels through trial and error.|$|E

25|$|In {{their role}} as a theatre trope, the Imperial Assault Force are {{preparing}} a stage adaptation of Les Misérables, which Ogami is tasked with directing. The need to properly portray the marriage scene leads to rampant misunderstandings as both Ogami and Imperial Assault Force members think each is proposing to the other. This is further complicated if Ogami had previously romanced {{any member of the}} Imperial and Paris Assault Force. When the Paris Assault Force arrives, if Ogami romanced any of them during the events of Sakura Wars 3, a love triangle situation is created. Ogami must choose which character he wishes to commit to. The production of Les Misérables proves to be a resounding success, and Ogami is left as the sole figure of authority after the Imperial Assault Force's original manager Ikki Yoneda retires, satisfied that Ogami <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> him. The final scenes vary depending on whether Ogami romanced any member of the Imperial or Paris Assault Force, and which character Ogami chooses to commit to.|$|E

Kailea becomes Leto's concubine, though he refuses to marry her for obvious political reasons. Rhombur seeks out a companion from the Bene Gesserit order and is matched with a young woman named Tessia who gives him {{a new sense of}} drive and purpose. After receiving a plea for help from C'tair Pilru, an Ixian rebel, Rhombur begins supplying the Ixian resistance with limited aid, though his attempts are greatly hindered by the Emperor's Sardaukar. Kailea soon gives birth to Leto's son, Victor. After the child's birth, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her role as Leto's concubine, wanting the Duke to marry her so that their son <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> his father someday.

500|$|Reception of Knight's {{idea in the}} {{mainstream}} media has been mixed. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gregory Dicum states that there is an [...] "undeniable logic" [...] to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas <b>can</b> <b>succeed,</b> arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in The Independent, noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At The Guardians website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as [...] "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of enculturation.|$|E

[...] The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit. For instance, during March 2007 British commanders accused the NATO members that refused to fight in the conflict-ridden south (in non-emergency situations) as causing [...] "huge resentment" [...] and a sense of betrayal, and undermined the credibility of the alliance.

[...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."
