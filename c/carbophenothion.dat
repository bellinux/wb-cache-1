50|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>carbophenothion</b> {{in human}} beings, {{is comparable to}} the metabolism in mice, insects and plants. There is little data of the quantitative degradation of <b>carbophenothion</b> to oxidative and hydrolytic compounds in mammals. It was found that in the rat more than 75% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. <b>Carbophenothion</b> is therefore estimated to be rapidly excreted in humans as well. The compound is most toxic when it is not metabolized. The acute toxicity {{of the majority of the}} metabolites of <b>carbophenothion</b> have been studied in rats. They are considerably less toxic and thus show that metabolism of <b>carbophenothion</b> does probably not involve bioactivation but rather detoxification. The two main products of this metabolism are sulphoxide and sulphone. Five oxidative products have been identified: the oxygen analogue of the <b>carbophenothion,</b> the sulphoxide and its oxygen analogue and finally sulphones and its oxygen analogue, all of which are depicted on the right.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> is {{a highly}} toxic {{organophosphate}} insecticide and acaricide. Organophosphates are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and disrupt the signal transduction at the cholinergic synapse. [...] It is classified as Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <b>Carbophenothion</b> is used in different brands like Trithion. This pesticide contains 80% <b>carbophenothion</b> as its only active ingredient. Because of {{the widespread use of}} those organophosphates in the nineties in the US, it was {{the most common cause of}} agricultural poisonings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> {{is used as}} an {{insecticide}} and acaricide, which main use is {{to protect}} citrus fruit, {{but it is also}} used to protect cotton against aphids (plant lice) and spider mites. Furthermore, it is used in combination with petroleum as well to function as a pesticide against numerous other pests on fruits, nuts, vegetables, sorghum, maize and others. Besides this it is used to control parasites on animals. Trithion, garrathion and lethox are three examples of pesticide brands that work with <b>carbophenothion</b> (Trithion is <b>carbophenothion).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> is {{lipophilic}} {{and therefore}} insoluble in water. It is non-corrosive {{but can be}} oxidized to phosphorothioate. <b>Carbophenothion</b> can be degraded in the atmosphere by a reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The half life of this reaction {{is estimated to be}} about two hours. This reaction does not occur very often, due to the low vapor pressure of <b>carbophenothion</b> (3.0 × 10−7 mm Hg at 20 °C). It is not susceptible to direct photolysis because it absorbs very little UV light and none above 310 nm. A more important fate may be hydrolysis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> can be {{synthesized}} in {{two steps}} from 4-chlorothiophenol, hydrogen chloride, formaldehyde and sodium O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate. First 4-chlorothiophenol can react with hydrogen chloride and formaldehyde to chloromethyl-4-chlorophenylsulfide. In {{the second step}} chloromethyl-4-chlorophenylsulfide reacts with sodium O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate to <b>carbophenothion</b> and sodium chloride. Both reactions occur spontaneously and are shown in the figure below.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> is {{not only}} very toxic to humans, but to other animals as well. For a lot of {{different}} animals the LD50, the dose at which 50% of the animals died, is determined. In the table below [...] the LD50 for certain types of birds and aquatic organisms are stated. It is highly toxic for crustaceans, marine organisms, amphibians, bees, wildlife as well, but no exact values are known. Long term effects were examined as well. Exposure of <b>carbophenothion</b> has a negative effect on reproductivity, at least in rats. When a dose of <b>carbophenothion</b> of 1-2 mg/kg/day was given to three following generations, this resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased rat pups’ survival. Furthermore, a study on 10-14 adult hens who were given a daily dose of <b>carbophenothion</b> for 24 days showed signs of cholinergic influence, e.g. ataxia, salivation and diarrhoea, loss of body weight and hampered egg production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> can {{be absorbed}} into the body by {{inhalation}} of its aerosol, through the skin and by ingestion. Exposure via ingestion is highly toxic, but absorption through the skin is nearly as toxic. Acute toxicity happens as most effects occur soon after uptake in the body. <b>Carbophenothion</b> affects the nervous system by inhibiting cholinesterase. There are no signs of chronic or carcinogenic effects.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{toxicity}} of <b>carbophenothion</b> was the poisoning of seven family members. The flour which they used in their food was probably contaminated with <b>carbophenothion.</b> The members became ill four to six hours after ingestion. The symptoms were nausea and vomiting, besides this one family member lost his consciousness. All the family members regained full strength after six days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> {{also known}} as Stauffer R 1303 as for the manufacturer, Stauffer Chemical, is an organophosphorus {{chemical}} compound. It {{was used as a}} pesticide for citrus fruits under the name of Trithion. <b>Carbophenothion</b> was used as an insecticide and acaricide. Although not used anymore, it's still a restricted use pesticide in the United States. The chemical is identified in the US as an extremely hazardous substance according to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 <b>carbophenothion</b> was {{evaluated}} at the Joint Meeting of Pesticide Residues (JMPR). During this meeting temporary tolerances were recommended for food, like several fruits, nuts and milk {{in the form}} of an acceptable daily intake (ADI). In 1975 these tolerances were re-evaluated and because the data on which the ADI’s were based was not available the ADI’s were withdrawn. The use of <b>carbophenothion</b> at that time did not indicate a need for additional maximum residue limits for crops, compared to the meeting in 1972. The latest meeting of the JMPR about this compound took place in 1980.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbophenothion</b> is an {{aromatic}} organophosphate with a chloride attached. It {{appears at}} room temperature as a colorless to yellow-brown liquid. It has a mild mercaptan-like odor (rotten eggs). Its boiling point is 82 °C and its melting point is unknown. It is relatively stable to heat (below 82 °C).|$|E
50|$|The EPA has {{classified}} <b>carbophenothion</b> as Category I - highly toxic. The toxicity in man has not {{yet been}} studied very well. There has been one study where five people were administrated <b>carbophenothion</b> 0.8 mg/kg/day for 30 days. There were no effects reported on plasma or red blood cell cholinesterase activity. These results were insufficient to determine the ADI. Later on, these results were even questioned because of an experiment with dogs which proved that a dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day already had effects. The estimate of temporary ADI for man is now set at 0 - 0.005 mg/kg. This is based on the NOAEL of rats of 5 ppm in the diet equivalent to 0.25 mg/kg/day. The estimated fatal oral dose is 0.6 g for a 150 lb. (70 kg) person. The LD50 for humans is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{exposed to}} <b>carbophenothion</b> show {{a wide variety}} of symptoms. It {{produces}} illness typical of cholinesterase inhibitors. Vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and excessive salivation are some common examples. When someone is exposed via inhalation, he or she may suffer from rhinorrhea and a tight feeling in the chest. As <b>carbophenothion</b> affects the activity of the nerves and the brain, symptoms like mental confusion, profound weakness and drowsiness are observed as well. When someone is exposed by absorption through the skin, they get muscle contractions as well. The only long term effect found in humans so far is a reduction of the amount of red blood cells and increase of the adrenal gland. These last two phenomenons only have been found in females. Other studies on long term effects only have been performed on animals and statements about possible extrapolations have not been made so far.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} route of {{degradation}} of <b>carbophenothion</b> in rats is sulfoxidation, as displayed on the right. This product can be further transformed into 4-chlorobenzenesulphinic and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid. A second major route involves the formation of 4-chlorothiophenol, which is further transformed via methylation and ring-hydroxylation to 4-Chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl methyl sulfone. This is then converted in approximately equal proportions to sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, there are metabolites that presumably arise from the cleavage of the P-S bond such as 4-chlorophenylsulphinylmethyl methyl sulphone. An overview of the metabolites and their occurrence as has been studied in rats {{can be found in}} the table below.One study on rats found that during 48 hours 66% of the administered <b>carbophenothion</b> was excreted in the urine and according to other experiments it takes approximately six days before complete excretion was achieved. Other studies say that even after 14 days there was a detectable level of the oxidation product present.|$|E
50|$|Effectiveness of <b>carbophenothion</b> is {{enhanced}} by its very long residual activity and easy uptake by insects. Carbophenothion’s mainly lipophilic character causes it to linger on the plants it is applied on and in the surrounding ground for extended periods of time. This makes it effective against eggs laid on treated plants. Another advantage of its lipophilic character is that it readily enters insects through sheer contact.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>carbophenothion</b> {{is highly}} toxic, it {{may only be}} used by {{certified}} applicators and the people directly supervised by them. A two-day safety waiting interval between the application is required to prevent unnecessary skin exposure. The compound is synthetically produced. The pure compound is a colorless to yellow-brown liquid, and is soluble in most industrial solvents. It is miscible with most organic compounds, like alcohols, ketones and esters.|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} {{solid-phase}} microextraction. and gas chromatography flame photometric detector for {{the determination of}} organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) in aqueous samples was described. Five kinds of commercially available fibers- 7, 30 and 100 mum PDMS, 85 mum PA and 65 mum PDMS-DVB-were compared and 100 mum PDMS and 85 mum PA were the most sensitive fiber coatings for the analytes. The extraction time, extraction temperature, pH and content of NaCl {{were found to have}} significant influence on extraction efficiency. The optimized conditions were 100 mum PDMS fiber, 30 min extraction time at 40 degreesC, with 3 % NaCl content and no pH adjustment. The linear range was 0. 5 - 100 mug l(- 1) for most of the analytes. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0. 049 mug l(- 1) (for parathion) to 0. 301 mug l(- 1) (for <b>carbophenothion)</b> and RSD% of repeatability at the 10 mug l(- 1) level were all below 8 %. Environmental water samples were analyzed, but none of the analytes was detected. The recovery of spiked water samples was from 75. 3 to 102. 6 %. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P 450 (P 450) and flavin-containing monooxygen-ase (FMO) enzymes are {{the major}} oxidative enzymes in phase I metabolism. Many organophosphate and carbamate thioether compounds are excellent substrates for these enzymes. Stereose-lective sulfoxidation of fenthion and methiocarb by human liver, kidney, and microsomes was investigated. A high level of stereo-selectivity {{in the formation of}} fenthion () -sulfoxide was observed in kidney and intestinal microsomes. This activity was not inhibited by the P 450 inhibitor 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was dramatically reduced following mild heat treatment. In liver, fenthion was me-tabolized to its sulfoxide in a nonstereoselective manner, and the activity was sensitive to both 1 -aminobenzotriazole and heat treat-ment. The carbamate pesticide methiocarb also was sulfoxidated {{with a high degree of}} stereoselectivity in human kidney micro-somes. Human liver microsomes formed both stereoisomers in equal amounts. Sulfoxide formation in kidney was not inhibited by 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was abolished in liver microsomes. For-mation of methiocarb sulfoxides was not observed in intestinal microsomes. The relative contribution of FMO 1 and FMO 3 to the sulfoxidation of <b>carbophenothion,</b> demeton-O, ethiofencarb, fono-fos, and methiocarb also was investigated by using baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins. FMO 1 showed the highest cata-lytic activity for all pesticides. This study indicates that FMO 1 may have a bigger role in extrahepatic metabolism than previously thought. The P 450 and FMO systems are multigene families involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics. The P 450 family is a superfamily of monooxygenases with at least 57 isoforms iden-tified in human...|$|E
