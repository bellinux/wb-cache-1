It {{has been reported that}} neutrophils from most patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) do not have a normal response after stimulation with a chemotactic ligand such as N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP). To further clarify the mechanism of this altered response and to confirm and expand earlier observations, the <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity of neutrophils from patients with LJP was evaluated. Peripheral blood neutrophils from 12 patients and 12 healthy subjects, age, sex, and race matched, were sonicated and subsequently subfractionated by ultracentrifugation into a soluble fraction (cytosol rich) and a particulate fraction (membrane rich). The <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity was evaluated in each fraction by phosphorylation of histone with radiolabeled ATP in the presence or in the absence of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate stimulation. Results revealed that the total <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity of neutrophils from patients with LJP and depressed chemotactic migration to FMLP (201. 0 +/- 63. 6 pmol/min/ 10 (7) cells) was lower than that of neutrophils from healthy subjects (287. 6 +/- 55. 7 pmol/min/ 10 (7) cells) (P < 0. 01). The <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity in neutrophils from patients with LJP exhibited a positive correlation with chemotactic migration to FMLP (P < 0. 05). The low activity of <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C in neutrophils from the patients reflected the low activity in the soluble fraction from the neutrophils. After stimulation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, the <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity was found to be lower from patients with LJP than from healthy subjects.

40|$|Rho-type small GTP-binding plant {{proteins}} function as two-state molecular switches in cellular signalling. There is accumulating evidence that Rho-of-plants (ROP) signalling is positively controlled by plant receptor kinases, through the ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins. These signalling modules regulate cell polarity, cell shape, hormone responses, and pathogen defence, among other things. Other ROP-regulatory proteins {{might also be}} subjected to protein phosphorylation by cellular kinases (e. g., mitogen-activated <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> or <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases),</b> in order to integrate various cellular signalling pathways with ROP GTPase-dependent processes. In contrast {{to the role of}} kinases in upstream ROP regulation, much less is known about the potential link between ROP GTPases and downstream kinase signalling. In other eukaryotes, Rho-type G-protein-activated kinases are widespread and have a key role in many cellular processes. Recent data indicate the existence of structurally different ROP-activated kinases in plants, but their ROP-dependent biological functions still need to be validated. In addition to these direct interactions, ROPs may also indirectly control the activity of mitogen-activated <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> or <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases.</b> These kinases may therefore function as upstream as well as downstream kinases in ROP-mediated signalling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinases involved in cell polarity establishment.

To improve crop productivity during periods of water deficit, it is essential to understand the complex regulatory pathways that adapt plant metabolism to environmental conditions. Among various plant hormones and second messengers, calcium ions are known to be involved in drought stress perception and signaling. Plants have developed specific calcium-dependent protein kinases that convert calcium signals into phosphorylation events. In this study we attempted to elucidate the role of a <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> in the drought stress response of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), one of the most economically important crops worldwide. The ongoing barley genome project has provided useful information about genes potentially involved in the drought stress response, but information on the role of calcium-dependent kinases is still limited. We found that the gene encoding the <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> HvCPK 2 a was significantly upregulated in response to drought. To better understand the role of HvCPK 2 a in drought stress signaling, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed the corresponding coding sequence. Overexpressing lines displayed drought sensitivity, reduced nitrogen balance index, an increase in total chlorophyll content and decreased relative water content. In addition, in vitro kinase assay experiments combined with mass spectrometry allowed HvCPK 2 a autophosphorylation sites to be identified.

40|$|A <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> {{activity}} from suspension-cultured soybean cells (Glycine max L. Wayne) {{was shown to}} be dependent on calcium but not calmodulin. The concentrations of free calcium required for half-maximal histone H 1 phosphorylation and autophosphorylation were similar (≈ 2 micromolar). The protein kinase activity was stimulated 100 -fold by ≥ 10 micromolar-free calcium. When exogenous soybean or bovine brain calmodulin was added in high concentration (1 micromolar) to the purified kinase, calcium-dependent and -independent activities were weakly stimulated (≤ 2 -fold). Bovine serum albumin had a similar effect on both activities. The kinase was separated from a small amount of contaminating calmodulin by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After renaturation the protein kinase autophosphorylated and phosphorylated histone H 1 in a calcium-dependent manner. Following electroblotting onto nitrocellulose, the kinase bound 45 Ca 2 + in the presence of KCl and MgCl 2, which indicates that the kinase itself is a high-affinity calcium-binding protein. Also, the mobility of one of two kinase bands in SDS gels was dependent on the presence of calcium. Autophosphorylation of the calmodulin-free kinase was inhibited by the calmodulin-binding compound N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalene sulfonamide (W- 7), showing that the inhibition of activity by W- 7 is independent of calmodulin.

40|$|The major {{challenges}} which {{plants have}} to withstand is osmotic stress (caused by drought, {{high and low}} temperature and high salinity), and wounding (caused by mechanical damage, f. ex. wind or herbivorous). Plant cells respond to these abiotic stresses by a multi-component defense strategy. Several families of protein kinases are involved in plant stress signaling. Among them are members of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> (CDPK), GSK 3, and SNF- 1 -related kinase (SnRK). In our laboratory we have identified and cloned protein kinase rapidly activated in Nicotiana tabacum BY- 2 cells subjected to osmotic stress.

ABA stimulates ACPK 1 in a dose-dependent manner, and the ACPK 1 expression and enzyme activities alter accordantly with the endogenous ABA concentrations during fruit development. The ABA-induced ACPK 1 stimulation appears to be transient with a rapid effect in 15 min but also with a slow and steady state of induction after 60 min. ABA acts on ACPK 1 indirectly and dependently on in vivo state of the tissues. Two inactive ABA isomers, (−) - 2 -cis, 4 -trans-ABA and 2 -trans, 4 -trans-(±) -ABA, are ineffective for inducing ACPK 1 stimulation, revealing that the ABA-induced effect is stereo specific to physiological active (+) - 2 -cis, 4 -trans-ABA. The other phytohormones such as auxin indoleacetic acid, gibberellic acid, synthetic cytokinin N-benzyl- 6 -aminopurine, and brassinolide are also ineffective in this ACPK 1 stimulation. Based on sequencing of the two-dimensional electrophoresis-purified ACPK 1, we cloned the ACPK 1 gene. The ACPK 1 is expressed specifically in grape berry covering a fleshy portion and seeds, and in a developmental stage-dependent manner.

The first peak was inhibited by ned- 19 and 3 -(2, 3 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea and the second peak by ned- 19 and antimycin A, indicating that NO synthesis is dependent on calcium release and occurs in organelles. The level of H 2 O 2 increased at 2, 3, and 12 h and was inhibited by ned- 19, ryanodine, xestospongin C, and moniliformin, indicating that H 2 O 2 accumulation is dependent on calcium release and Krebs cycle activity. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2 -oxoxglutarate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities of the Krebs cycle increased at 2, 3, 12, and/or 14 h, and these increases were inhibited in vitro by EGTA, a calcium chelating agent.

Their N-myristoylation was found to be highly overrepresented in the proteome, whereas myristoylation motifs are almost absent in known chloroplast proteins. However, only abolishing their myristoylation was not sufficient to target those kinases to chloroplasts and resulted in nuclear accumulation instead. In contrast, inhibition of N-myristoylation of a <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> was sufficient to alter its localization from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts and chloroplast localization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and Rubisco activase could be efficiently suppressed by artificial introduction of myristoylation and palmitoylation sites...|$|E

An increase in the con-centration of cytosolic free calcium ion ([Ca 2 *],) is prere-quisite for the turgor regulation (Okazaki and Tazawa (1990) /. Membr. Biol. 114 : 189], We examined {{whether or not a}} <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> (CDPK) is in-volved in the Ca 2 +-mediated turgor regulation of Lampro-thamnium cells. A 53 -kDa CDPK which phosphorylated preferentially histone HI but poorly myelin basic protein or casein, was detected in the cell extract of Lamprotham-nium by an in-gel protein kinase assay. This protein kinase was detected by Western blotting and was immunoprecipi-tated using an anti-Dunaliella tertiolecta CDPK antibody which can neutralize the Dunaliella CDPK activity [Yuas...|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> (CDPKs) {{is a unique}} enzyme which plays crucial roles in {{intracellular}} calcium signaling in plants, algae, and protozoa. CDPKs of malaria parasites {{are known to be}} key regulators for stage-specific cellular responses to calcium, a widespread secondary messenger that controls the progression of the parasite. In our study, we identified a gene encoding Plasmodium vivax CDPK 4 (PvCDPK 4) and characterized its molecular property and cellular localization. PvCDPK 4 was a typical CDPK which had well-conserved N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal calmodulin-like structure with 4 EF hand motifs for calcium-binding. The recombinant protein of EF hand domain of PvCDPK 4 was expressed in E. coli and a 34 kDa product was obtained. Immunofluorescence assay by confocal laser microscopy revealed that the protein was expressed at the mature schizont of P. vivax. The expression of PvCDPK 4 -EF in schizont suggests that it may participate in the proliferation or egress process in the life cycle of this parasite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Apicomplexan parasites rely on calcium as {{a second}} {{messenger}} to regulate a variety of essential cellular processes. <b>Calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> (CDPK), which transduce these signals, are conserved among apicomplexans but absent from mammalian hosts, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Despite their importance, the signaling pathways CDPK regulate remain poorly characterized, and their protein substrates are completely unknown. In Toxoplasma gondii, CDPK 1 is required for calcium-regulated secretion from micronemes, thereby controlling motility, invasion, and egress from host cells. CDPK 1 is unique among parasite and mammalian kinases in containing glycine at the key “gatekeeper ” residue, which results in an expanded ATP-binding pocket. In the present study, we use a synthetic ATPγS analogue that displays steric complementarity to the ATP-binding pocket and hence allows identification of protein substrates based on selective thiophosphorylation. The specificity of this approach was validated by the concordance between the identified phosphorylation sites and the in vitro substrate preference o...|$|R
40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +), {{a crucial}} second {{messenger}} in plants, {{is involved in}} diverse signaling pathways including biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the functions of most calcium sensors including <b>calcium-dependent</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> (CDPKs), calmodulins (CaMs), calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), and calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) remain limited in plants, particularly in woody plants. Currently, a total of 83 CMLs and seven CaMs were discovered in the apple genome in this study. Functional domain analysis showed that these CMLs and CaMs contain a highly conserved EF-hand motif. qRT-PCR assays indicated that these CMLs were expressed ubiquitously in apple, including in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits, and also possessed spatial specificity. Finally, most of these CMLs were induced by hormonal and abiotic stress, suggesting their potential roles in the regulation of growth, development, and the stress response in apple. In summary, our findings provide potential evidence that apple CMLs {{may be involved in}} abiotic stress and the regulation of plant growth and development...|$|R
