At its peak, the station employed twenty-two and had an Arbitron ranking of No. 1 against four other radio stations. This No. 1 position in the ratings was due to several factors: on-air personalities; popular choice of artists like Reba McEntire, Oak Ridge Boys, Christopher Cross, Eddie Rabbitt, Patsy Cline, Crystal Gayle, Barbara Mandrell, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Linda Ronstadt; as well as aggressive marketing campaigns. One such marketing campaign with City Market grocery was to place a registration card in each grocery sack that entitled a winning registrant to a cash prize (multiples of $102.50). A common on-air theme was the [...] "Z-one oh two Block Party Weekend" [...] where a sequence of three songs from the same artist was played back-to-back-to-back with three artists (9 songs) played in a row with no commercials.|$|R
