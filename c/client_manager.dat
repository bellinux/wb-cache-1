40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} financial incentives within construction projects {{can contribute to}} strong alignment of project stakeholder motivation with project goals. However, effective incentive system design can be a challenging task and takes skillful planning by <b>client</b> <b>managers</b> {{in the early stages}} of a project. In response to a lack of information currently available to construction clients in this area, this paper explores the features of a successful incentive system and identifies key learnings for <b>client</b> <b>managers</b> to consider when designing incentives. Our findings, based on data from a large Australian case study, suggest that key stakeholders place greater emphasis on the project management processes that support incentives than on the incentive itself. Further, contractors need adequate time and information to accurately estimate construction costs prior to their tender price submission to ensure cost-focused incentive goals remain achievable. Thus, <b>client</b> <b>managers</b> should be designing incentives as part of a supportive procurement strategy to maximize project stakeholder motivation and prevent goal misalignment...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two main parts. First, in Chapters 1 - 4 I develop a framework for analysis of research on credibility (competence and trustworthiness) in audit settings and review literature by types of examined effects (determinants of credibility vs. consequences of credibility) and by examined credibility components (competence, trustworthiness, or both). In {{the conclusion of the}} literature review I suggest areas for future research. Second, in Chapters 510 I follow-up the literature review by examining one of the topics suggested in it. Specifically, I examine auditor assessments of <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> competence following a failure of internal controls, focusing on two key components of competence implied by COSO's 2013 Integrated Framework: an understanding of what to do to improve controls and a willingness to do it. Drawing on the Culpable Control Model (Alicke 2000), I predict that lack of a client manager's attempt to improve internal controls affects auditor ability to assess these competence dimensions. As a consequence, I predict that, given a relatively high prior perception of manager competence, the auditor gives the manager {{the benefit of the doubt}}, but prior communication about the control weakness mitigates this pattern. In my main experiment, 108 Big-Four audit seniors participate in a 2 x 2 between-participants design that varies whether the auditor previously communicated the potential for a control failure to the <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> and whether the <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> instituted the compensating control. My results support my predictions and suggest that, absent enhanced auditor communication before control failure, auditors may give managers the benefit of the doubt when managers to not attempt to improve controls, thereby discouraging managers from doing so. A follow-up experiment with 163 mTurk participants in a more general evaluation setting further supports my predictions by indicating that evaluations in the "no previous auditor communication, no <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> action" condition vary with the evaluator's prior belief about the competence of the evaluatee. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E

40|$|Network {{management}} systems {{built on a}} client/server model centralize responsibilities in <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> processes, with server agents playing restrictive support roles. As a result, managers must micro-manage agents through primitive steps, resulting in ine ective distribution of management responsibilities, failure-prone management bottlenecks, and limitations for real time responsiveness. We present a more exible paradigm, the Manager-Agent Delegation (MAD) framework. It supports the ability to extend the functionality of servers (agents) at execution time, allowing exible distribution of management responsibilities in a distributed environment. MAD can store and instantiate delegated scripts, and provides a concurrent runtime environment, where they can execute asynchronously without requiring the manager's intervention. A delegation protocol allows a manager to transfer programs, create process instances, and control their execution. We describe the delegation model, its application to network management, and {{the design of a}} prototype implementation. ...|$|E

We administered an experiment to 101 practicing auditors from one international public accounting firm who assessed fraud risk based on a scenario in which <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> narcissism (attitude) and fraud motivation were each manipulated at two levels (low and high). Our results show that narcissistic client behavior and fraud motivation are significantly and positively related to auditors’ overall fraud risk assessments.

30|$|Mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, {{blockchain}} technology, {{and other}} FinTech have greatly changed traditional commercial banks. First, they {{have broken the}} relationships and channels between traditional banks and customers. In the past, the relationship between banks and customers was established and maintained through business services. However, future relationships will depend more on daily nonbusiness social networking. Second, with advancements in technology, payment systems and methods have experienced revolutionary changes. Business conducted through counters or ATMs in the past can now be done at mobile terminals anywhere anytime. Banking workspaces and environments have expanded without boundaries, and traditional physical branches have disappeared or transformed. Third, these changes have fundamentally altered and restructured banks’ business models. <b>Client</b> <b>managers</b> currently wait and look for projects; they negotiate, deal, and communicate with customers offline. Thus, communication skills, social skills, and social resources are the core competencies of <b>client</b> <b>managers.</b> However, {{in the era of}} everyday banks, <b>client</b> <b>managers</b> mainly mine data and communicate online. Hence, big data mining and data analysis capabilities are now the core competencies. Fourth, the resulting bank value assessment system differs from its own value systems and ideas. Various assets face revaluations; many assets that cannot currently be priced by banks are likely to receive new value forms. Fifth, the social and commercial credit system faces changes in the mobile Internet era. Sixth, an era of financial disintermediation is emerging, and not just for commercial banks. As a result, the entire financial ecology will change. Seventh, financial innovation has been normalized and socialized. Eighth, the financial asset price discovery mechanism is now different. Ninth, the financial ecology has been diversified. More financial institutions and organizations will appear. More complex and structured financial instruments will become more widespread. Tenth, to address complex financial ecology and forms, banking regulation will have more flexibility. Classified, dynamic, and process regulations have become new regulatory models.|$|R

40|$|Maintaining a {{positive}} auditor-client relationship {{is critical for}} audit firms, particularly during sensitive events. For instance, audit firms state in transparency reports that they take steps to minimize disruption during audit partner rotations, yet {{it is unclear what}} these actions entail or the potential effects of these actions on auditor independence and audit quality. I use multiple methods to provide insight into these practices and their related effects. First, I interview 20 audit partners to learn about the process by which audit firms manage the auditor-client relationship during sensitive partner rotation events. Interviewees describe how audit firms identify appropriate partner candidates and procedures followed to select and prepare the next lead partner. Respondents also elaborate on firms’ ongoing relationship-managing activities, including the assignment of non-decision-making liaisons (often referred to as relationship partners or 2 ̆ 2 RPs 2 ̆ 2) to a subset of engagements to assist in navigating the auditor-client relationship during sensitive events (i. e., in preparation for upcoming partner rotations and when contentious auditor-client issues arise). Second, I conduct an experiment with financial executives to examine the influence that RPs may have on the resolution of contentious auditor-client issues. I also consider how RP influence may vary depending {{on the extent to which}} the audit partner and <b>client</b> <b>manager</b> have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to resolve the issue (i. e., negotiation ripeness). I find that, in a traditional setting in which a RP is not involved, client managers concede less toward an audit partner 2 ̆ 7 s more appropriate position when the negotiation has reached a more ripe stage than when the negotiation stage is less ripe. However, I find it is at a more ripe stage that RP intervention is more effective in moving client managers toward a resolution, limiting the risk of seeking alternative methods of resolution that may impair the auditor-client relationship (e. g., issuing a qualified audit opinion). Collectively my findings inform regulators and researchers about the ongoing process by which audit firms manage the auditor-client relationship during sensitive events and how one common approach for managing the auditor-client relationship (i. e., assignment of RPs to a subset of engagements) influences the auditor-client relationship and audit quality...|$|E
