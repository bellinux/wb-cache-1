5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{statistical}} {{learning by}} itself cannot account {{even for those}} aspects of language acquisition for which {{it has been shown}} to play a large role. For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> Infants in this <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable {{to take advantage of the}} statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the temperature and relative humidity influence in the life cycle, mortality and fecundity patterns of Triatoma rubrovaria. Four cohorts with 60 recently laid eggs each were conformed. The cohorts were divided into two groups. In the <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> group insects were maintained in a dark climatic chamber under constant temperature and humidity, whereas triatomines of the ambiental temperature group were maintained at room temperature. Average incubation time was 15. 6 days in the <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> group and 19. 1 days in the ambiental temperature. In group <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> the time from egg to adult development lasted 10 months while group ambiental temperature took four months longer. Egg eclosion rate was 99. 1 % and 98. 3 % in <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> and ambiental temperature, respectively. Total nymphal mortality in <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> was 52. 6 % whereas in ambiental temperature was 51. 8 %. Mean number of eggs/female was 817. 6 <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> and 837. 1 ambiental temperature. Fluctuating temperature and humidity promoted changes in the life cycle duration and in the reproductive performance of this species, although not in the species mortality...|$|R

25|$|They tested {{this concept}} under three {{different}} conditions. The first was person focused, where {{the person who}} tossed the coin mentioned that she was tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that the coin was {{coming up with a}} lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|E
25|$|To {{support and}} verify such {{assumptions}} about dialogue journal writing, studies {{will need to}} provide for random assignment of students to either dialogue journal writing or a <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> for a sufficient length of time, ideally within the same instructional context. Where this is not possible, carefully designed studies of individual students can yield strong research evidence. For example, Regan, Mastropiere, and Scruggs conducted a study of special-needs students using a multiple baseline design to measure outcomes of a dialogue journal intervention compared to baseline data. Studies following this design can provide a model of dialogue journal research that addresses issues of selection and maturation.|$|E
25|$|A {{primary source}} has {{reported}} a functional neuroimaging experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects {{and while the}} experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) {{as well as the}} visual and somatosensory inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E
30|$|In general, the {{correlations}} among traits were weaker under <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> than under SF.

All LSL were very highly significantly correlated with PH. Under <b>control</b> <b>conditions,</b> DTF had either positive or negative correlation {{with some of the}} traits (Additional file 7 : Table S 4).|$|R

30|$|Of importance, stratigraphic columns involve {{aligning}} geologic temporal {{information to}} space. Thus, {{students in both}} the intervention and <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> received practice aligning geologic time to space and exposure to magnitude information.

25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E
25|$|To provide clarity, cross-linguistic {{influence}} can {{be understood}} as the various ways that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons linguistic performance or development. Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E
500|$|Smeets used {{name and}} {{birthday}} matching in a product liking experiment. He made up product names for a DVD that matched both {{part of the}} participant's name {{and his or her}} birthday. For example, a participant named Mariëlle, born on 14 May would get an ad for a DVD-player named [...] "DVD-Ma 14" [...] in the self-relevant condition and [...] "DVD-Pu 30" [...] in the <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.|$|E
50|$|A major {{consideration}} is {{the inclusion of}} appropriate <b>control</b> <b>conditions.</b> Typically, <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> include the presentation of unimpaired audio materials, introduced {{in ways that are}} unpredictable to the subjects. It is the differences between judgement of these control stimuli and the potentially impaired ones that allows one to conclude that the grades are actual assessments of the impairments.|$|R

500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants in the <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E

The <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. [...] A no-overlap <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation on one point. This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which {{was followed by a}} random dot pattern presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The dot pattern disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another dot pattern then appeared in the same location. Participants had to identify whether the two patterns were the same or different.|$|E
