40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} due to their inherent character of being globally flexible and locally rigid. Under certain conditions flow through the <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> causes severe noise and vibration problems. Thus, to understand the phenomenon and parameters that play role is a real asset for industry. This study {{is a continuation of}} a research based on multiple side branch system and presented together with results of an investigation performed on <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Many similarities between the <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> and multiple side branch system have been observed. A Strouhal number which uses as characteristic length the cavity width plus the upstream edge radius yields the best collapse of the data for both <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> and multiple side branch system. For both systems the upstream edge radius of the cavity has significant effect on pressure fluctuation amplitudes. It can increase the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation by an order of magnitude compared to sharp edges. The radius of the downstream edge has a less pronounced effect on the sound production. Strouhal numbers display two hydrodynamic modes the first with a Strouhal number around 0. 1 and the second one varying in the range between 0. 4 and 0. 6. The variation in critical Strouhal number for the second hydrodynamic mode correlates with the relative corrugation volume compared to the pipe volume. Experiments with <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> reveal that 1 st hydrodynamic mode is limited to configuration with small relative corrugation volume.

40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are widely}} used because they combine local {{rigidity}} with global flexibility. Whistling induced by flow through such pipes can lead to serious environmental and structural problems. The whistling of a multiple side branch system is compared to the whistling behavior of <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> The study has been restricted to cavities with sharp edges which are convenient for theoretical modeling. The side branch depth is chosen to be equal to the side branch diameter, which corresponds to cavity geometries in typical <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> The low frequency resonance modes of the multiple side branch system have been predicted by means of acoustic models, of which the validity has been tested experimentally. Several experiments {{have been carried out}} for characterizing the whistling behavior of the system. While the behavior of a multiple side branch system is interesting on its own it can be compared to that of <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> These experiments show that the multiple side branch system is in many aspects a reasonable model for <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Advantage of the multiple side branch system is that it is an experimental setup allowing easy modification of cavity depth. We used this feature to identify the pressure nodes of the acoustic standing wave along the main pipe as the regions where sound is produced. This contradicts recent publications on <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Another interesting aspects is that the system appears to whistle at the second hydrodynamic mode of the cavities rather than at the first hydrodynamic mode. A prediction model for the whistling behavior is proposed, consisting of an energy balance, based on the vortex sound theory. The model predicts the observed Strouhal number but overestimates the acoustic fluctuation amplitude by a factor four. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|When a <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is subject}} to a dry gas flow, high {{amplitude}} sound can be produced (so-called ‘whistling’). It was shown previously that liquid addition to <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> flow {{has the ability to}} reduce sound production. Small amounts of liquid are sufficient to mitigate whistling entirely. One of the mitigation mechanisms, cavity filling, is studied experimentally. Acoustic measurements are combined with a planar laser-induced fluorescence technique to measure the liquid accumulation in the cavities of a <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe.</b> Using this technique, it is shown that the amount of filling of the cavities with liquid increases with increasing liquid injection rate and with reducing gas flow rate. The reduction in whistling amplitude caused by the liquid injection is closely related to the cavity filling.

40|$|Current wet {{gas meters}} used by Statoil can detect liquid volume {{fractions}} (LVFs) over 5 %, but not smaller fractions. This {{means that there}} are currently no technologies capable of monitoring separation performance. It is in Statoil s interest to measure and monitor the separation performance, since too high LVFs can damage downstream process equipment and {{increase the risk of}} hydrate formation. This thesis performs an early study of a new technology for separation performance monitoring. It is based on sound measurements and the influence of liquid on sound wave propagation, i. e. acoustic damping. Other studies have showed that introducing liquid in a gas increase the attenuation of the sound amplitude. Two different design concepts were investigated: a <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> and a smooth pipe with a loud speaker. The <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> is capable of generating sound without external sources. When gas flows through a <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe,</b> it induces vortex shedding in the cavities. At high enough flow velocities, the frequency of the vortex shedding couples with the pipe s natural frequency. This results in a high tonal sound, or whistling. A phenomenon usually dubbed "singing riser" in {{the oil and gas industry}} as it occurs in the flexible risers transporting hydrocarbons from the seabed to the sea surface. The smooth pipe, however, has no self-generating sound source and hence a loud speaker is needed to create sound. The design concepts are approached theoretically, by modelling and by experiment. A one-dimensional flow-acoustics model was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics. The model failed to return realistic sound pressure levels but captured the physical phenom- ena occurring in a <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> well. For instance, it predicted the first mode of the pipe s natural frequency accurately. The two designs concepts were tested experimentally for different flow rates and different liquid rates. The experiments strongly indicated an added acoustic damping due to liquid, even for LVFs much lower than 1 · 10 − 4, and thus the main principle of the technology was supported. However, the experiment could not reveal any significant advantages in measurement accuracy for either a smooth or a corrugated design...|$|E

40|$|The flow-induced {{pulsations}} in corrugated pipes {{result from}} a feedback loop between an acoustic resonator and the noise amplification at each shear layer in the axisymmetric cavities forming the corrugations. The quality factor of the resonator {{is determined by the}} reflection coefficients at the ends of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> and by the damping in the pipe. In this work, the damping of acoustic waves in a set of smooth and corrugated pipes is measured by a direct method. For these measurements, the tested pipes are placed between two measuring pipes equipped with flush-mounted pressure transducers to allow reconstruction of the acoustic waves with the two-microphone method. Loudspeakers are used to generate acoustic waves, and anechoic terminations allow near reflection-free conditions. The tests are done in air without flow and with flow velocities up to 60 m/s. The results for the corrugated pipes allow to investigate the influence of the corrugations on the damping. Two cases are considered: Without flow, the visco-thermal damping is increased for the <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe</b> compared to a smooth pipe of same diameter. When there is a flow in the pipe, the damping results depend strongly on the flow velocity. At certain frequencies which depend on the flow velocity, the damping increases or decreases. The regions of increase or decrease are shown to be at constant ranges of Strouhal numbers. The decrease of the damping can in some cases be such that acoustic waves are amplified through the <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipe.</b> This corresponds to the acoustic source behavior of the shear layers.

To this extend we determine the dependency of the flow rate and the increase in temperature, on the geometrical characteristics of the loop. The geometry considered is a set of axially symmetric <b>corrugated</b> <b>pipes</b> described by a set of parameters; namely the pipe inner radius, the period of the corrugation, the amplitude of the corrugation, and the ratio of expansion and contraction regions of a period of the pipe. The governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, in combination with an adaptive mesh refinement technique in order to capture the effects of wall shape. We characterize the effects of the amplitude and of the ratio of expansion and contraction. In particular we show that for a given fixed amplitude it is possible to find an optimal ratio of expansion and contraction that minimizes the temperature inside the thermosyphon.
