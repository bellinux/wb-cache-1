40|$|Abstract—Regression {{verification}} {{flows in}} modern integrated circuit development environments expose {{a plethora of}} <b>counter-examples</b> during simulation. Sorting these <b>counter-examples</b> today is a tedious and time-consuming process. High level design debug-ging aims to triage these <b>counter-examples</b> into groups that will be assigned to the appropriate verification and/or design engineers for detailed root cause analysis. In this work, we present an automated triage process that leverages knowledge extracted from simulation and SAT-based debugging. We introduce novel metrics that corre-late <b>counter-examples</b> based on the likelihood of sharing the same root cause. Triage is formulated as a pattern recognition problem and solved by hierarchical clustering techniques to generate groups of related <b>counter-examples.</b> Experimental results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 94 % for the proposed automated triage frame-work, which corresponds to a 40 % improvement over conventional scripting methods.

25|$|A {{commonly}} cited <b>counter-example</b> where {{energy is}} not shared among its various forms and where equipartition {{does not hold}} in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, the energy in each normal mode is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that children display gender-typed musical instrument preferences. Two studies were conducted to determine (a) whether these preferences can be modified by presenting <b>counter-examples</b> (i. e., instruments played by gender-inappropriate musicians) and (b) whether child gender or age (kindergarten vs. 4 th grade) influences the efficacy of such interventions. A videotape presentation format was employed in Study 1 and drawings in Study 2. Children exposed to <b>counter-examples</b> were less stereotyped than those who saw the instruments without musicians (Study 1) or with gender-appropriate musicians (Studies 1 & 2). Age did not influence children's responsiveness to the <b>counter-examples,</b> but boys were more resistant to the intervention than girls. There was some evidence that the <b>counter-examples</b> were effective not simply because children were attracted to same-sex musicians. Instead, children's instrument choices also appeared to be motivated by a desire to avoid behaving like musicians of the other-sex.

40|$|The aim of {{inverting}} artificial {{neural networks}} (ANNs) {{is to find}} input patterns that are strongly classified as a predefined class.

The hypothesis is that the <b>counter-examples</b> extracted by the inversion will cause larger updates of the weights of the ANN and create a better mapping than what is caused by retraining using randomly generated <b>counter-examples.</b> This hypothesis is tested on recognition of pictures of handwritten digits.

[...] The New Statesman compiled reviews from The Independent, The Observer, and The New York Times.

[...] Other writers attempting to gauge the book's reception also describe it as [...] "mixed".

500|$|The {{fact that}} all pilots in the novel are women (in {{contrast}} to the infantry, which is entirely male) has been cited as evidence of progressive gender politics within the story, although the idea expressed by Rico that women are the motivation for men {{to fight in the}} military is a <b>counter-example</b> to this. A 1996 science fiction encyclopedia said that like much of Heinlein's fiction, Starship Troopers exemplified [...] "macho male culture". The prosthetically enhanced soldiers in the novel, all of whom are men, have been described {{as an example of the}} [...] "hyper-masculinity" [...] brought on by the proximity of these men to technology. The story portrays the Arachnids as so alien that the only response to them can be war. Feminist scholars have described this reaction as a [...] "conventionally masculinist" [...] one. Steffen Hantke has described the mechanized suits in the novel, which make the wearer resemble a [...] "steel gorilla," [...] as defining masculinity as [...] "something intensely physical, based on animal power, instinct, and aggression". He calls this form of masculinity [...] "all body, so to speak, and no brain". Thus, in Hantke's reading, Starship Troopers expresses fears of how masculinity may be preserved in an environment of high technology. This fear is exacerbated by the motifs of pregnancy and birth that Heinlein uses when describing how the soldiers in suits are dropped from spaceships, which are always piloted by women. Though Rico says he finds women [...] "marvelous", he shows no desire for sexual activity; the war seems to have subsumed sex in this respect. A 1979 summary argued that despite the gestures towards women's equality, women in the story were still objects, to be protected, and to fight wars over.|$|E
