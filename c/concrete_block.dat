40|$|With an {{increasing}} interest in recycling and reusing waste, {{there is a}} need to carry out research on exploring ways to transform industrial wastes into construction materials. This paper attempts to explore the feasibility of reutilizing textile effluent sludge (TES) for producing <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> with a pretreatment step. The lime-based pretreatment process was adopted to remove ammonia in TES which had been found to lead to bad odor and strength loss of the <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks.</b> The <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> were prepared with an aggregate to cement ratio of 12, 10 and 6. The pretreated TES was adopted to replace the fine aggregate at a mass ratio ranging from 0 % to 30 %. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage values were determined to evaluate the performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> containing TES. The results indicated that the lime-based pretreatment process can lower the ammonia concentration in TES significantly. The <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> with a lower TES content and lower ammonia concentration had higher compressive strength and better volume stability. When the TES content in the <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> was about 10 %, the <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> with an aggregate to cement ratio of 10 can satisfy the minimum strength requirement for non-load bearing applications. Meanwhile, the result of leaching test indicated that the toxic trace metals present in textile effluent sludge could be stabilized/solidified and metal leaching from the <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> is not a concern.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the potential of}} adopting an accelerated mineral carbonation process to produce {{a new generation of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> with recycled <b>concrete</b> aggregates (RCA). The replacement contents of coarse and fine natural aggregates by coarse and fine RCA in <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> ranged from 0 % to 100 % by mass, respectively. The accelerated mineral carbonation of RCA and <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> was processed under a gas pressure of 0. 1 Bar and 5. 0 Bar. The experimental results showed that incorporating the carbonated RCA in <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> led to an increase in strength by 2 %- 18 %, which can also increase the reuse rate of RCA by 35 % for the <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> with the required strength. Moreover, the use of the carbonated RCA in <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> resulted in a lower drying shrinkage. A high CO 2 gas pressure and longer carbonation duration had an insignificant effect on the properties of <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> when the carbonation process was extended to 24 h. It would be more efficient and economical to fabricate this type of eco-blocks by using the carbonated RCA, a low CO 2 gas pressure (i. e. 0. 1 Bar) and a short-term carbonation (i. e. 6 h).

This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
40|$|The reuse of {{concrete}} as aggregate in new concrete mixes helps {{to reduce the}} expenses related to management of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, and to helps the environment by reducing the development rate of new quarries. This study has investigated the potentiality of using coarse recycled concrete aggregate {{in the manufacture of}} precast hollow <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks.</b> Four series of mixtures have been prepared by using coarse recycled concrete aggregates in replacement percentages of coarse natural aggregates (20 %, 50 %, 70 %, 100 %), and an ordinary mix made by natural aggregate as control.

40|$|Steam curing of <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> is {{an energy}} {{extensive}} process {{and contributes to}} {{a significant portion of}} the block production cost. CO 2 curing of <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> consumes CO 2, reduces energy consumption and produces dimensionally more stable products. This study investigated the strength development and weathering properties of steam- and CO 2 -cured full size lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks.</b> Some freshly molded lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> were taken from a block manufacture plant and cured in a CO 2 curing tank in lab. Steam-cured lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> were randomly taken from the same plant. Several hundreds of <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> after steam and CO 2 curing were stockpiled outside for winter exposure. The compressive strength of CO 2 -cured blocks was similar to that of steam-cured ones. It continued to increase when blocks were placed in a moist environment after steam and CO 2 curing. However, steam-cured blocks showed faster strength development rate than CO 2 -cured ones did, and they behaved the same during the outdoor winter exposure, CO 2 -cured blocks demonstrated lower drying shrinkage and water absorption than steam-cured ones after 180 days of outdoor winter exposure. This indicated that CO 2 -cured <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks</b> had better dimensional stability, but similar weathering properties to steam-cured ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
