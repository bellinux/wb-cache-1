This would completely eliminate problems with <b>combustion</b> <b>instability</b> and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the <b>combustion</b> <b>instability</b> problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

A relatively small conversion of the energy released will produce both random fluctuations or noise, and, under many circumstances, organized oscillations generically called <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Owing to the high energy densities and low losses in combustion chambers designed for propulsion systems, the likelihood of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> is high.

This paper is a brief review of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> in liquid-fueled propulsion systems-rockets, ramjets, and thrust augmentors-with emphasis on work accomplished during the past decade. To provide a common framework for discussing the wide range of works, a theory of two-phase flow is reviewed as the basis for an approximate analysis of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The analysis is directed primarily to treatment of linear stability; it is sufficiently general to accommodate all processes occurring in actual systems.

50|$|Thirty-two Atlas B, D, E and F {{missiles}} were launched on suborbital test flights from LC-11.

In addition to the suborbital tests, one orbital launch was conducted from the complex. On 18 November 1958, Atlas 10B launched SCORE, the world's first communications satellite into low Earth orbit. Two on-pad explosions occurred on LC-11. The first was Missile 48D in April 1960, which suffered <b>combustion</b> <b>instability</b> and exploded on the pad. Although no specific cause for the <b>combustion</b> <b>instability</b> could be determined, the separate duct for the booster turbine exhaust {{had been removed from}} the Atlas pads at CCAS earlier in the year since it was considered unnecessary and complicated ground testing of the missiles. The failure occurred slightly under a month after Missile 51D had exploded on LC-13 due to <b>combustion</b> <b>instability,</b> and after these back-to-back failures, it was decided to put the exhaust duct back on the pads. Although there was no evidence indicating that the lack of the exhaust ducts caused the failures, program officials decided to play it safe, and in any case wanted the pads to conform with Atlas D silo configurations.|$|E
40|$|As lean {{premixed}} combustion {{systems are}} more susceptible to <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> than non-premixed systems, there is an increasing demand for improved numerical design tools that can predict the occurrence of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> with high accuracy. The inherent non-linearities in <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> can be of crucial importance, and we here propose an approach in which the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes and scalar transport equations are solved for geometries of variable cross-section.

40|$|After {{developing}} an active control system (ACS) {{that uses a}} gaseous fuel actuator and demonstrating its effectiveness in the suppression of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities</b> in a combustor that burned gaseous reactants, efforts under this program focused {{on the development of}} an ACS that uses a liquid fuel actuator (LFA).

40|$|Conditions of {{high energy}} densities and low losses in {{combustion}} chambers encourage the excitation and sustenance of organized unsteady motions generically called <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The fluctuations, common in propulsion systems, often reach sufficient amplitudes to cause excessive rates of heat transfer to exposed surfaces and unacceptable structural vibrations, causing failure in extreme cases. In many cases, {{to avoid the}} occurrence of <b>instabilities,</b> <b>combustion</b> chambers are operated below their maximum performance. Considerable effort has been spent, {{for more than four}} decades, on experimental and analytical programs devoted to solving problems of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Much of the work has been required to measure quantities which, because of the complex processes involved, cannot be predicted accurately from first principles. Analytical work has been concerned largely with linear behavior, the chief purpose being to predict stability of small disturbances in combustion chambers. Many useful results have been obtained, serving in practice to help design experiments, correlate data, and predict the stability of new systems. However, linear behavior is {{only a small part of}} the general problem. A combustion chamber is an isolated system so far as its stability is concerned, and unstable disturbances evolve as 'self-excited' motions. Hence their amplitudes will grow indefinitely unless nonlinear processes are effective. Complete understanding of observed behavior will therefore be reached only by treating nonlinear behavior. In the recent past, increased attention has been paid to nonlinear <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> It is particularly important for practical purposes to explain the existence of limit cycles and the occurrence of unstable motions in linearly stable systems exposed to large initial disturbances. These matters are far from closed, and although substantial progress has been accomplished, little impact has been made on the development of new systems. The chief purpose of this paper is to provide a brief review of work on nonlinear <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities,</b> largely in the framework of an approximate analysis.

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is nowadays considered as the most promising CFD tool for the study of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Its intrinsic unsteadiness and the capability of directly solving the motion of the largest vortices and acoustic waves propagation, enable LES to analyze the strong interactions between turbulence, chemical species mixing, acoustics and chemical reactions, which are the primary sources of <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> However, the exact precision and the limitations of LES remain to be determined in particular for the prediction of combustion noise and self-excited <b>combustion</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Therefore, in this work the ability of the LES code AVBP of CERFACS to accurately compute simple configurations involving only one phisical phenomenon (turbulence, acoustics or combustion) is firstly verified.
