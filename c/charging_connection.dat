40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICE) are combined {{with electric motors}} and batteries in both hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to improve efficiency and allow a limited all electric range. This paper quan- tifies the electrical power needed for charging a fleet of PHEVs in Belgium. A stochastic model based on the driving behavior of Western European drivers, determines {{the availability of the}} PHEVs for charging from grid. Three scenarios are defined to generate charging profiles based on the driving profiles. The scenarios are based on current tariff schemes available to residential users, which only includes a day and night tariff. Therefore, the management or coordination of the PHEVs is diffucult based on these tariffs. Two scenarios are based on the current single tariff schemes; the distinction between them is the availability of a <b>charging</b> <b>connection</b> at the work place. The third scenario is a day and night tariff. As night work is not that popular, there is no effectual difference whether or not a <b>charging</b> <b>connection</b> at work is available. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{charging}} schemes for ATM networks {{based on the}} concept of virtual effective bandwidths (VEB). VEBs were initially developed by the authors to support real-time Connection Admission Control (CAC) in a framework where traffic sources with different quality of service (QoS) requirements are multiplexed into the same finite length queue [6]. VEBs allow different QoS requirements to be related which is important for charging purposes. We propose three charging schemes which can be included in real-time CAC: the first one depends solely on the resource requirements of the call; the second is dependent on resource as well as QoS requirements of the call; the third is dependent on the current traffic intensity of the other connections also. Keywords: ATM networks, QoS, <b>charging,</b> <b>Connection</b> admission control. 1 Introduction Among the various issues related to ATM research, the problem of appropriate charging for different types of traffic has not received much attent [...] ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInconsistency of {{perceptions}} and approaches for determining electricity network <b>connection</b> <b>charges</b> explains our research interest. The paper surveys {{the issues of}} investment expenditure allocation in the restructured electricity transmission network companies. A concept of deep and shallow <b>connection</b> <b>charges</b> is examined {{with respect to the}} “connection dilemma”, issues of transmission expansion, as well as technological and organizational peculiarities of network connections. A comparative analysis of the approaches for determining transmission network <b>connection</b> <b>charges</b> in Russia and France provides a framework of further actions to be implemented in Russia highlighting such issues as the choice between deep and shallow <b>connection</b> <b>charges,</b> the principle of the “least costs”, advance payments, partial reimbursement of <b>connection</b> <b>charges,</b> categories of power supply reliabilit...|$|R
40|$|Keywords- mobile robots, {{wireless}} RF interface, HOLTEK microchip, laser {{range finder}} Abstract—The article develops an auto-charging system for mobile robots, and programs a new docking processing to enhance successful rate. The system contains a docking station and a mobile robot. The docking station contains a docking structure, a limit switch, a charger, two power detection modules and two wireless RF modules. The mobile robot contains a power detection module (voltage and current), an auto-switch, a wireless RF module, a <b>charging</b> <b>connection</b> structure and a laser range finder. The docking structure is designed with one active {{degree of freedom}} and two passive degrees of freedom. The power detection module is controlled by HOLTEK microchip. We calculate the power values using the redundant management method and statistical signal prediction method, and develop an auto-recharging processing using multiple sensors and laser range finder for mobile robots. The processing can enhances the successful rate to guide the mobile robot moving to the docking station. In the experimental results, {{the power of the}} mobile robot is under the threshold value. The mobile robot transmits the charging command to the docking station via wireless RF interface, and searches the landmark of the docking station using laser range finder (SICK). The laser range finder guides the mobile robot approach to the docking station. The mobile robot touches the docking station to trig the power detection device. The docking station supplies the power to the mobile robot by charger, and detects the current and voltage values of the charging processing. The charging current of the docking station is under the threshold value. The docking station turns off the charging current, and trigs the mobile robot leaving the docking station via wireless RF interface...|$|E

50|$|Revenues {{are usually}} {{generated}} through two <b>charges</b> to customers: <b>connection</b> fees and use <b>charges.</b> <b>Connection</b> fees are <b>charged</b> once to new customers as they {{connect to the}} sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover capital investments made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover operations and maintenance expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.|$|R
