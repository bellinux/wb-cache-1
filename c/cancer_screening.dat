40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the immediate {{influence of a}} validated patient information leaflet (PIL) on patient anxiety and intention to have a <b>screen</b> for oral <b>cancer</b> in primary care attenders. Participants: Patients (n= 800) attending their primary health care provider. Setting: Fourteen general practices (eight dental and six medical) in the northwest of England. Design: Randomised controlled trial with two arms: leaflets provided in information group, leaflet was absent in control group. Measures: Single item ratings of (1) intention to have an oral <b>cancer</b> <b>screen,</b> and (2) anxiety towards a screen, (3) perceived risk of oral cancer. Knowledge of oral cancer, self-reported dental service attendance history and demographic variables were also collected. Results: Patients who had read the oral cancer PIL demonstrated an increase in their intention to have a screen (Mann Whitney U test: z=− 3. 67, P< 0. 001) and reduced anxiety (Mann Whitney U test: z=− 2. 07, P< 0. 05). Subjective risk was not elevated by the extra information. Intention to have a screen was predicted by knowledge level and anxiety (odds ratios: 1. 10 and 0. 70 respectively, both P's< 0. 001). Conclusion: The influence of an information leaflet appeared {{to have a positive}} effect on anxiety level and intentions to agree to receive an oral <b>cancer</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Promoting <b>Cancer</b> and <b>Screening</b> Awareness in Women with Intellectual Disabilities: A Mixed Methods Study. BY Mary Reidy Background: People with {{intellectual}} {{disabilities are}} living longer {{which has led to}} increasing cancer rates among this demographic. Women with intellectual disabilities {{are more likely to have}} poorer cancer awareness and lower screening participation than women in the general population. They also present at later stages of cancer despite similar cancer rates in both populations. Aim: This two phase mixed methods study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a targeted educational intervention for women with ID and their carers. EMBRACES-ID (Early Monitoring of Breast and Cervical <b>Cancer</b> Signs & <b>Screening</b> in Intellectual Disabilities) aimed to raise the awareness of warning signs, risk factors, screening programmes, and promote early help-seeking on symptom discovery. Methods: In line with the MRC’s Guidance for Complex Interventions this work was based on empirical evidence and was theoretically underpinned by Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory. Phase I involved a survey of carers (n= 125) and women with mild to moderate ID (n = 45), as well as semi- structured interviews with 25 carers. Phase II involved the feasibility and acceptability testing of EMBRACES- ID among 25 women with mild to moderate ID and 9 carers. A pre-test/post-test design incorporating a 12 week evaluation survey and interview was utilised. Ethical approval for the study was received from the relevant Research Ethics Committees. Findings: In Phase I, gaps in <b>cancer</b> and <b>screening</b> awareness were found. These results formed the basis for the development of the EMBRACES-ID intervention. In Phase II, testing of EMBRACES-ID identified changes in <b>cancer</b> and <b>screening</b> awareness for women with ID and their carers, the majority of changes were retained over the 12 week post intervention time frame. Conclusions: EMBRACES-ID raised <b>cancer</b> and <b>screening</b> awareness for women with ID and their carers. This may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of cancers with better survival outcomes...|$|R
