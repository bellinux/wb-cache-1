5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti when he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached {{their way into the}} main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Morath sought out, befriended, {{and photographed}} artists and writers. During the 1950s she [...] photographed artists for Robert Delpire's {{magazine}} L'Oeil, including Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. [...] She met the artist Saul Steinberg in 1958. When {{she went to}} his home to make a portrait, Steinberg <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> wearing a mask which he had fashioned from a paper bag. Over {{a period of several}} years, they collaborated on a series of portraits, inviting individuals and groups of people to pose for Morath wearing Steinberg's masks. Another long-term project was Morath's documentation of many of the most important productions of Arthur Miller's plays.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas had praised Wilde's play Salome in the Oxford magazine, The Spirit Lamp, {{of which}} he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining {{acceptance}} for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written Salomé in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs [...] "On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs" [...] ("One should only look in mirrors") he rendered [...] "One must not look at mirrors". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and [...] claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: [...] "For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was simply scandalous". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as [...] "the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of my house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. Once, I was walking up to campus, and she fell in with me and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wisniski was {{originally}} from Maple Valley, Washington. He {{is said to}} have come from a dysfunctional family. He was a devout Christian for many years. He was married in the early 1950s and the marriage lasted 20 years until they divorced. He was later married to a woman named Sharon, who worked across the street from his apartment in the mid 1970s when they met. She later visited John as he was recovering in hospital from his 1975 plane crash. Some time later the relationship ended as he didn't want her to see him in his condition. Years later while on braces and crutches he managed to drive around her neighbourhood for hours until he found her house. As he slowly walked to the front door Sharon`s daughter announced to Sharon that Johnny Valentine was in front of their home. Sharon having been ill refused to go to the door and hid. Wisniski insisted he wouldn't leave until he saw her. When she finally <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he asked her to marry him and she accepted. Following John`s death, Sharon planned to write a book titled A Never Ending Love Story of a Wrestler and His Wife about their life together. He also had a son from a long ago previous relationship, Greg Valentine, who has wrestled professionally since 1970 and is best known as Greg [...] "The Hammer" [...] Valentine. Ric Flair, who wrestled with Wisniski, has described him as a quiet person who kept to himself. He was also known for making his demands clear to employers and not backing down, and many stories continue to circulate about practical jokes, or ribs, that he played on his fellow wrestlers.|$|E
