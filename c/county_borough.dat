5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed {{among those}} places {{to be granted}} <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and this was something that Hanley could not agree too.|$|E
5|$|The city {{became a}} county {{corporate}} in 1461, {{and later a}} <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974 it lost its status as the smallest <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> in England, after the Local Government Act 1972, and came {{under the control of}} Kent County Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 {{parts of}} the Limehurst Rural District {{were added to the}} <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> of Oldham, and in 1954 further {{parts of the}} same {{district}} added to it on its abolition. Since 1961, Oldham has been twinned with Kranj in Slovenia. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town's autonomous <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status was abolished, and Oldham has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.|$|E
50|$|As in England and Wales, the Act created <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> of Ireland's largest towns {{which were}} {{independent}} of their surrounding county councils, but {{in contrast to}} England, the <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> were deemed to be administrative counties themselves. Thus there were 38 administrative counties, of which 8 were <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b> After {{the separation of the}} Irish Free State, eight administrative counties remained in Northern Ireland (including two <b>county</b> <b>boroughs),</b> while the Irish Free State had 30 administrative counties (including four <b>county</b> <b>boroughs).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> of Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford and Stockport and the {{municipal}} boroughs of Stretford and Ashton-under-Lyne {{put forward a}} joint proposal for consideration by the Commission in July 1960. This proposal would have seen an extension of <b>county</b> <b>boroughs,</b> {{and the creation of}} two new <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> based on Stretford and Ashton, such that the core urban area was contiguous <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The map {{depicts the}} <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> in England {{immediately}} prior to their abolition in 1974. <b>County</b> <b>boroughs</b> in Wales and Northern Ireland are not shown.|$|R
5|$|Introduction of the Local Government Bill in March 1888 caused {{much debate}} in the Potteries about the {{position}} of the towns under the proposed council structure. The bill proposed the creation of county councils across England and Wales and the granting of <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status to towns with a population exceeding 100,000. <b>County</b> <b>borough</b> status would allow such places to govern themselves independently of the county council.|$|E
5|$|Little {{interaction}} between the separate settlements occurred until the 18th century when the pottery industry began to expand rapidly. By the early 19th century, initial steps {{had been made to}} ensure greater co-operation between the Potteries towns over the issue of law and order. The county plan of 1888 made the first attempts to form the six towns into one <b>county</b> <b>borough,</b> following an act of Parliament that restructured the county system and created the administrative county of Staffordshire. Wishing to remain independent, the Potteries towns discussed uniting to form a separate county, the Staffordshire Potteries. When it became apparent that such a move would fail, the proposal was revised to one of uniting the six towns into one <b>county</b> <b>borough.</b> This plan failed after Hanley Corporation and Stoke Corporation could not agree on the location of the future administrative centre. Instead, only Hanley gained <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status because the other towns did not meet the criteria for such designation.|$|E
5|$|The Local Government Act 1888 created elected county councils to {{administer}} services throughout England and Wales. Where a municipal borough had {{a population of}} more than 50,000 at the 1881 Census it was created a <b>county</b> <b>borough,</b> with the powers and duties of both a borough and county council. As Oldham had an 1881 population of 111,343 it duly became a <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> on 1 April 1889. The borough, while independent of Lancashire County Council for local government, remained part of the county for purposes such as the administration of justice and lieutenancy.|$|E
50|$|The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> in Ireland. Under the Act, four former {{counties}} corporate (Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford) became <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|With the {{creation}} and growth of <b>county</b> <b>boroughs,</b> and a movement {{of people from the}} country to the towns and cities, the population in the <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> began to outnumber those in the administrative counties. By 1971, 53% of the population of Yorkshire were living in the <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b> The division of population in 1971 was as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{territory}} and population of administrative counties was {{reduced by the}} increasing numbers of <b>county</b> <b>boroughs,</b> and extensions thereof. This was recognised as a problem, {{and the process of}} creation and enlargement of such boroughs was made more difficult by the Local Government (<b>County</b> <b>Boroughs</b> and Adjustments) Act 1926. By June 1970 25% of the population were within the <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a {{commercial}} shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic). The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> of Plymouth, the <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single <b>County</b> <b>Borough.</b> The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The {{counties}} {{were also}} used as the administrative unit of local government introduced in Ireland under the 1898 Local Government Act along with <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b> In regards to Northern Ireland the cities of Belfast and Londonderry became <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b> The <b>counties</b> and <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> in terms of governance where abolished in Northern Ireland in 1972 and replaced with twenty-six unitary councils, many of which cross county boundaries.|$|R
5000|$|England and Wales, outside London, was {{to consist}} of [...] "police areas". These were to be {{administrative}} <b>counties,</b> <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> or [...] "combined police areas", consisting of combinations of <b>counties</b> and <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cities: These {{were the}} <b>County</b> <b>boroughs</b> {{created by the}} 1898 Act and later legislation, renamed. All the <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> except Galway had {{previously}} had the courtesy title of city by charter or letters patent.|$|R
5|$|Work {{to restore}} the {{passenger}} service to the line took place between 2006 and 2008. The scheme {{was part of the}} response to the closure of Corus' Ebbw Vale steelworks in 2002, and the resulting economic downturn in one of Wales' most deprived areas. The project was led by Blaenau Gwent <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> Council and supported by Caerphilly <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> Council, Newport City Council, the Welsh Assembly Government and Network Rail. Capita Symonds project managed the scheme and the project contractor was Amey Rail, a subsidiary of Amey plc.|$|E
5|$|As Leeds had an 1881 {{population}} of 309,119 it duly became a <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> on 1 April 1889. The borough, while {{independent of the}} West Riding County Council for local government, remained {{part of the county}} for purposes such as the administration of justice and lieutenancy.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{the city}} council sought another extension, this time to the south, by taking in the parish of Middleton from Hunslet Rural District. The {{boundary}} change took effect on 1 April 1920, and Middleton formed a 17th ward, electing 3 councillors and 1 alderman to {{the city council}}, which was increased in size accordingly. The parish of Middleton was abolished, with its area added to the existing parish of Hunslet. The extra territory was acquired by the <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> for a major scheme of council housing, the construction of which commenced almost immediately. On 1 April 1925 the five parishes in the <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> were united into a single parish of Leeds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, {{with the}} {{establishment}} of Northern Ireland, lord-lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and two <b>county</b> <b>boroughs.</b> In 1973 the <b>counties</b> and <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> were abolished as local government units in Northern Ireland, and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the Queen to [...] "counties and <b>county</b> <b>boroughs...</b> as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973".|$|R
50|$|The <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> {{proposed}} by the Commission were {{to be responsible for}} most local government in their area, only looking to the county councils for large area services. They were a mixture of existing <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> and larger non-county boroughs.|$|R
2500|$|The Act did not {{in terms}} affect the status of cities and towns which were {{counties}} corporate. [...] Most of the counties corporate became <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> and therefore administrative counties of themselves, but while other <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> continued {{to be part of}} their existing counties for all other purposes, that did not apply to existing counties corporate. [...] Those that did not become <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> became part of adjacent administrative counties but retained their existing lieutenancies and shrievalties.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} report into the West Midland General Review area was also {{delivered}} in July 1961 and {{a proposal for}} Worcester to lose its <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> status was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|The Local Government Act 1888 created elected county councils to {{administer}} services throughout England and Wales.

5|$|Bath {{had long}} been an ancient borough, having that status since 878 when it became a royal borough (burh) of Alfred the Great, and was {{reformed}} into a municipal borough in 1835. It has formed {{part of the county}} of Somerset since 878, when ceded to Wessex, having previously been in Mercia (the River Avon had acted as the border between the two kingdoms since 628). However, Bath was made a <b>county</b> <b>borough</b> in 1889, independent of the newly created administrative county and Somerset County Council. Bath became part of Avon when the non-metropolitan county was created in 1974, resulting in its abolition as a <b>county</b> <b>borough,</b> and instead became a non-metropolitan district with borough status. With the abolition of Avon in 1996, the non-metropolitan district and borough were abolished too, and Bath has since been part of the unitary authority district of Bath and North East Somerset (B). Bath was returned to the ceremonial county of Somerset in 1996, though as B is a unitary authority, it {{is not part of the}} area covered by Somerset County Council.|$|E
5000|$|... 1966 saw a {{substantial}} {{reform in the}} local government of the area as the patchwork of <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> with municipal boroughs and urban district councils in between {{was replaced by a}} core of <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> covering a contiguous area, roughly as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The Local Government (<b>County</b> <b>Boroughs</b> and Adjustments) Act, 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5 c.38) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{amended the}} Local Government Act 1888, {{changing}} {{the process by}} which <b>county</b> <b>boroughs</b> could be created or extended.|$|R
50|$|<b>County</b> <b>boroughs</b> {{could not}} apply to the Minister for a {{provisional}} order extending the borough boundaries unless they had first sent a draft of their proposals to all the councils of the administrative <b>counties,</b> <b>boroughs,</b> rural and urban districts affected.

5|$|Elizabeth Margaret Braddock (née Bamber; 24September 1899– 13November 1970) was a British Labour Party {{politician}} {{who served as}} Member of Parliament (MP) for the Liverpool Exchange division from 1945 to 1970. She {{was a member of}} Liverpool <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> Council from 1930 to 1961. Although she never held office in government, she won a national reputation for her forthright campaigns in connection with housing, public health and other social issues.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 Great Bolton, most of Little Bolton and the Haulgh area of Tonge with Haulgh were {{incorporated}} under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as a municipal borough, {{the second to}} be created in England. Further additions were made adding part of Rumworth in 1872 and part of Halliwell in 1877. In 1889 Bolton was granted <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> status and became self-governing and independent from Lancashire County Council jurisdiction. In 1898, the borough was extended further by adding the civil parishes of Breightmet, Darcy Lever, Great Lever, the rest of Halliwell, Heaton, Lostock, Middle Hulton, the rest of Rumworth which had been renamed Deane in 1894, Smithills, and Tonge plus Astley Bridge Urban District, and part of Over Hulton civil parish. The <b>County</b> <b>Borough</b> of Bolton was abolished in 1974 and became a constituent part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. Bolton unsuccessfully applied for city status in 2011.|$|E
