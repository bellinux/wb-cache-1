40|$|In modern {{illumination}} systems, {{compact size}} and high brightness are important features. Light recycling allows {{an increase of}} the spectral radiance (brightness) emitted by a light source {{for the price of}} reducing the total radiant power. Light recycling means returning part of the emitted light to the source where part of it will escape absorption. As a result, the output brightness can be increased in a restricted phase space, compared with the intrinsic brightness of the source. In this work the principle of light recycling is applied to artificial light sources in order to achieve brightness enhancement. Firstly, the feasibilities of increasing the brightness of light sources via light recycling are examined theoretically, based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics including Kirchhoff's law on radiation, Planck's law, Lambert-Beer's law, the étendue conservation and the brightness theorem. The theory of light recycling can be derived from first principles. From an experimental viewpoint, the radiation properties of three different kinds of light sources including short-arc lamps, incandescent lamps and LEDs characterized by their light-generating mechanisms are investigated. These three types of sources are used in light recycling experiments, for the purpose of 1. validating the intrinsic light recycling effect in light sources, e. g. the intrinsic light recycling effect in incandescent lamps stemming from the coiled filament structure. 2. acquiring the required parameters for establishing physical models, e. g. the emissivity/absorptivity of the short-arc lamps, the intrinsic reflectivity and the external quantum efficiency of LEDs. 3. laying the foundations for designing optics aimed at brightness enhancement according to the characteristics of the sources and applications. Based on the fundamental laws and experiments, two physical models for simulating the radiance distribution of light sources are established, one for thermal filament lamps, the other for luminescent sources, LEDs. Both are validated with high resolution measurements. The physical models are capable of analytically modelling the radiance distribution with few required parameters (geometry, material properties and operating conditions). They are widely applicable to any kind of sources with similar light-emitting mechanisms. Combining the advantages of conciseness, high accuracy and wide applicability, the physical models can be integrated into ray-tracing software. As validation of the theoretical and experimental investigation of the light recycling effect, an optical device, the Carambola, is designed for achieving deterministic (as opposed to stochastic) and multiple light recycling. The Carambola has the function of a concentrator. In order to achieve the maximum possible brightness enhancement with the Carambola, several combinations of sources and <b>Carambolas</b> are modelled in ray-tracing simulations. Sources with different light-emitting mechanisms and different radiation properties (optical thickness), and <b>Carambolas</b> with different geometries and optical properties are used. It is concluded that a high-pressure xenon lamp is suitable for light recycling with the Carambola due to its moderate optical thickness, its continuous spectrum and its geometrical features. In the ray-tracing simulation, the suitability of the XBO lamp and the Carambola optics for light recycling is confirmed. A prototype five-point reflective Carambola was manufactured from aluminium, for the purpose of experimentally demonstrating a brightness increase. The Carambola is tested with different sources. The experimental results are below the theoretical expectation, i. e. the measured brightness enhancement factor is lower than the designed factor and the modelled factor. The discrepancies are explained. A real Carambola must have a high reflectivity and an accurate shape, if a significant effect of light recycling is to be shown. The brightness enhancement by light recycling with the Carambola is expected to be improved greatly by enhancing the surface quality of the reflectors, using suitable sources with small optical thickness, compact size, (and in the case of LEDs) high intrinsic reflectivity and external quantum efficiency. The Carambola is expected to be utilized in applications such as high brightness displays. In conclusion, both theoretical investigation and experimental measurements on light recycling demonstrated a significant increase of the brightness of optically thin sources...|$|E

Producing fruit of export quality means that high quality fruit and vegetables are available to satisfy the appetite of the tourists who come to the island. This appetite would otherwise have to be satisfied with costly imports. And top quality for tourists also means better quality and choice for the local population. These were the main reasons behind government policy to encourage exports as well, of course, as the need to earn foreign exchange. However, incentive alone is not quite enough. The government quickly recognized that thousands of growers cultivating small scattered parcels of land too steep or too poor for sugar could not, by themselves, establish the organization and infrastructure necessary to achieve consistent, high quality produce. Individual growers, even those producing fruit and vegetables for sale from their own backyards, have organized themselves into produce groups. Megh Pillay, General Manager of the country's Agricultural Marketing Board, explains that by working with these groups the island's production can be carefully planned. Together they decide who will plant what, in what quantities and when. The Board organizes distribution of seed and offers a guaranteed market at a floor price, and this despite the fact that production is seasonal whereas demand remains steady throughout the year. It has been able to do this by building up cold storage facilities so that excess production during the season can be skimmed off, put in coldstores and then put back on the market when that market can no longer be supplied directly by the grower. Produce destined for export rather than the local market is moved from exporters' own coldstore facilities at the packing houses, along good roads in temperature controlled trucks to the air terminal. in order to complete the cold chain and avoid the problems arising from delayed or canceled flights, cold storage facilities have been built at the airport. The store has a capacity of 1680 m 3, which is far greater than that required for exports at the present time. Imports and goods in transit can therefore be serviced as well, and the earnings set against the cost of exports servicing. This successful, well integrated system has supported many small producers, but has been painful for others. There is no place for those whose produce fails to reach the premium price. And growers have to abide by the rules. On one occasion the export of litchis was banned completely for two weeks, affecting everybody, because of an unfavourable report from a European importer. One grower had tried to catch the market by sending litchis extremely early in me season before they had reached the proper stage of maturity. The situation was only restored to normal after appropriate inspection and control procedures were put in place by the Ministry, of Agriculture. For, as Megh Pillay says, 'the good image of Mauritius as an exporter of high value crops has to be preserved by all means'. AS the visitor to Maurtius drives {{from the international}} airport on the south-eastem tip of the island towards the capital Port Louis on the west coast, or past the smart luxury hotels scattered discreetly around the shores, he quickly realizes [...] ...|$|E

The trees were treated with increasing doses of lime during the pre-planting period. Liming led to a increase in calcium concentration of <b>carambola</b> leaves and fruits. Adequate nutrition of the plant with calcium improved post-harvest fruit quality, permitting a longer (~ 2 days) period of storage under ambient conditions...|$|R

An eradication programme based on the male annihilation technique (MAT) was developed and funded by IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development), the Netherlands, France and the United States and officially began in 1998. The programme worked in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil. By 2001, the distribution of B. <b>carambolae</b> was reduced to limited areas of Suriname and French Guiana. In 2002 funding was reduced and then halted. In the following years B. <b>carambolae</b> has expanded its distribution with detections as far southeast as Curralinho, in the Para state of Brazil, and as far north as Orlando, Florida, in the US. The closing of this programme before completion has resulted in increased cost to South American agriculture and increased risk to Central America, North America and the Caribbean. A coordinated programme amongst infested countries could still mitigate the risk of the spread of B. <b>carambolae</b> in the region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
