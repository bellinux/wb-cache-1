Although these materials are amorphous, the micropore size and surface area {{can be controlled}} by varying {{the length of the}} phenyleneethynylene struts (see picture; the network is shown in blue, and one 1, 3, 5 -substituted benzene node and three <b>connected</b> <b>struts</b> are highlighted with C gray and H white) ...|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the rear}} storage area was through a unique door hinged on the side. For 1957 and 1958, the rear access door was a {{combination}} of the lift gate and tailgate being connected with two <b>connecting</b> <b>struts.</b> This design meant that the rear-door back glass had to be divided into three sections, two outer curved portions and a center piece. It was identical to the Ford Parklane and later the Ford Del Rio wagons without side glass installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{elevated}} with a gabled roof supported by wooden columns. The <b>connecting</b> <b>struts</b> and the columns are decorated. On the platform {{are a small}} shop, a passenger shelter, and a shelter for the lineman preserved. The station is an island platform and 2 tracks. In direction Wedel is a separated track siding to reverse the train direction, if necessary. There are no service personnel attending the station, but an emergency call and information telephone is available. There are about 20 places to lock a bicycle. There are no lockerboxes.|$|R
50|$|Jury struts come in many configurations. On monoplanes {{with one}} main strut, {{there may be}} just a single jury <b>strut</b> <b>connecting</b> the main <b>strut</b> to an {{intermediate}} point on the wing. A braced monoplane with 'V' struts such as the Fleet Canuck may have a complicated assembly of jury struts.|$|R
50|$|The Martin Marietta Spacemaster was a {{proposed}} configuration for {{what became the}} Space Shuttle, which featured an X-24-derived orbiter, and an unusual “catamaran style” booster stage. During launch and ascent, the orbiter would be located in a recess in the booster. The booster's 14 engines would be located in clusters of seven, {{at the bottom of}} both halves of the booster. Unlike the final design for the Space Shuttle, the Spacemaster would lack an external tank, and the boosters would be joined, by means of <b>connecting</b> <b>struts</b> which would also serve as the mounting for the orbiter.|$|R
50|$|The D.IX was {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings {{constructed}} in Fokker's established fashion with two box spars and fabric covering. The interplane struts were N-form while the cabane structure included two fully triangulated forward <b>struts</b> <b>connecting</b> to the forward spar, {{and a pair of}} single <b>struts</b> <b>connecting</b> to the rear spar. Ailerons were only fitted on the upper planes.|$|R
25|$|The Beaver {{family of}} {{aircraft}} all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 aluminum tube {{that supports the}} tail, landing gear and seats. The wings and engine mount are similarly of 6061-T6 aluminum tube and attached to the main tube by <b>connecting</b> <b>struts.</b> The wing features aluminum tube spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits {{in as little as}} 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory-claimed build times 150–200 hours for the SS and 180–200 hours to the RX 550 Plus.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the structural behavior of six reinforced concrete pile caps in rectangular arrangement, considering the ground deformability of pile support, different concrete strengths with square or rectangular {{cross section of}} column under central load. For this purpose, the analysis emphasizes a strut and tie method design and a three-dimensional numerical using the finite element method. So, the stress flow configuration {{and the formation of}} struts were seen in perspective. How much deformable is the ground, more uniform are the reactions distribution observed be-tween the piles. The column cross section influenced the configuration of the <b>connecting</b> <b>struts.</b> The concrete strength variation had more influence in the pile caps strength than the stiffness. The analytical method has shown compatibility which obtained from the numerical simulation results...|$|R

40|$|During {{the ascent}} of carrier rockets the massively {{separated}} {{flow in the}} base region generates highly unsteady wall pressure fluctuations. The resulting dynamic loads can induce a response of the launcher structure called buffeting. In order to study {{the characteristics of the}} base flow behind three different configurations of the Ariane~ 5 launcher, Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) in combination with unstructured grids is used. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of IDDES to describe the impact of the <b>connecting</b> <b>struts</b> between central stage and boosters and to analyze the efficiency of a buffeting reduction device in the base region. Comparisons of the numerical results with time resolved and time averaged surface pressure data and PIV measurements obtained from the DNW High Speed Wind Tunnel are carried out in good agreement...|$|R

50|$|The twin arches have a {{constant}} width of 0.8 m and depth varying from 1.7 m at the springing to 1.1 m at the crown. These are <b>connected</b> laterally with <b>struts</b> (known as Vierendeel truss) and box girder.|$|R
500|$|The {{skull of}} Nigersaurus was delicate, {{with the four}} side fenestrae (openings in the skull) larger than in other sauropodomorphs. The total area of bone {{connecting}} the muzzle {{to the back of}} the skull was only [...] These <b>connecting</b> <b>struts</b> of bones were usually less than [...] thick. Despite this, the skull was resistant to the sustained shearing of the teeth. Another unique trait it had among sauropodomorphs was a closed supratemporal fenestra. The nasal openings, the bony nostrils, were elongated. Though the nasal bones are not completely known, it appears the front margin of the bony nostril was closer to the snout than in other diplodocoids. The snout was also proportionately shorter, and the tooth row was not at all prognathous, the snout tip not protruding relative to the remainder of the tooth series. The maxillary tooth row was in its entirety transversely rotated, its normal rear 90° everted towards the front. This was matched by an identical rotation of the dentary of the lower jaw. As a result, no other tetrapod had all of its teeth located as far to the front as Nigersaurus.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has two {{symmetrical}} arches {{which have}} a span of 22.1 m and consist of five parallel lattice X-shaped ribs which are 760 mm deep and are braced by wrought iron tie-bars which <b>connect</b> spandrel <b>struts.</b> Lateral stiffening is ensured with rectangular diaphragms at the segment joints and adjacent ribs are linked with diagonal bracing. Traffic lights are located {{at both ends of}} the bridge to control the flow of single-line traffic and two footpaths exist for pedestrians to use.|$|R

40|$|Auxetic (negative Poisson’s ratio) {{configurations}} {{have been}} used recently to build prototypes of deployable structures using classical shape memory alloys (Nickel-Titanium-Copper). Chiral configurations, featuring three or more inter-connected spiral-wound hubs, exploit efficient tensile-rotational mechanisms. These structures offer high deployability ratios in structural elements with load-bearing characteristics. Shape memory polymers {{have the potential to}} replace conventional shape memory alloys and other stored-energy actuators, and have the attractive properties of low mass, high actuation strain, easy fabrication and tunable thermal properties. In this work we discuss how shape memory polymers (SMP) integrated into a chiral core could offer enhanced deployable characteristics and increase the efficiency of the auxetic deformations in these unusual cellular structures. We consider the spiralwound fundamental component needed for SMP n-chiral prototypes and present test results showing actuation motion of expanding SMP deployable structures. The angle of attachment of struts to hubs can be varied in order to tune the mechanical stiffness and compressibility of the deployed structure. The balance between axial loading in radial <b>connected</b> <b>struts</b> and flexural loading in tangentially-connected struts can also be matched to the material properties and tailored to the application. Applications likely to benefit from these structures include lightweight elements for structural engineering applications, deployable structures for space applications and implantable medical devices...|$|R
50|$|Displacement {{amplification}} {{can also}} be accomplished by using rigid <b>struts</b> <b>connected</b> by flexure bearings. This separation allows inverted geometries, allowing either contraction or expansion of the output even if the dominant motion of the piezo is expansion. Actuators of this type can have a stroke of 2 mm.|$|R
50|$|Pipe racks {{consist of}} a series of {{transverse}} bents that run {{along the length of the}} pipe system, spaced at uniform intervals typically around 20 ft. To allow maintenance access under the pipe rack, the transverse bents are typically moment frames. Transverse bents are typically <b>connected</b> with longitudinal <b>struts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in 1917, Friedrichshafen {{created the}} even more unusual Friedrichshafen FF54 scout fighter, which {{featured}} narrow-chord second and third wings, with <b>struts</b> <b>connecting</b> only the upper pair and lower pair of planes. The prototype proved unacceptable {{in the air and}} was later modified as an equally unsuccessful triplane, again with a short-chord intermediate plane.|$|R
50|$|Where an {{aircraft}} has a wing running clear above the main fuselage, {{the two components}} are often <b>connected</b> by cabane <b>struts</b> running up {{from the top of}} the fuselage or crew cabin to the wing centre section. Such a wing is usually also braced elsewhere, with the cabane struts forming part of the overall bracing scheme.|$|R
30|$|Direct and {{indirect}} loadings were studied on a composite tibia bone model (3 rd generation sawbones®) with a mid-diaphyseal defect 3.5  mm in size. A universal test machine (UTS®, Germany) {{linked to a}} multichannel measuring system (MGC-Plus with ML 55, HBM®) {{was used for the}} study. In the set-up for the direct loading, both bone ends were attached to the test machine. For the indirect loading, the struts were distally extended, leaving the distal bone end levitating with no direct contact to the base plate of the test machine (Fig.  3). The attachment to the test machine allowed a solely axial loading parallel to the mechanical axis of the composite bone. The bone was stabilised in a standard Ilizarov frame consisting of 4  ×  160 -mm rings and four <b>connecting</b> <b>struts</b> (Smith&Nephew®, Memphis). Two 1.8 -mm wires on each ring were drilled through the tibia in an anatomical position (60 ° angulation, new wires for every test series), and the tibia was placed more anteriorly in relation to the inner diameter of the ring to more realistically mimic the clinical application. The mid-diaphyseal defect was created with an oscillating saw. At the site of the defect, the distance between the bone and the inner diameter in the anterior-posterior direction was 4.5  cm anterior and 8.0  cm posterior. The wires were tensioned to 1, 100  N using the tensioning device that comes with the Ilizarov set and were attached to the rings with slotted bolts.|$|R
500|$|Magnum XL-200's steel {{track is}} [...] in length, {{and its main}} hill is {{approximately}} [...] high. Magnum XL-200 originally had a scarlet red track with silver supports. The track was repainted Molly orange in 2005, but the supports remained silver. The track consists of a tubular steel spine <b>connected</b> by <b>struts</b> to tubular steel running rails. When it opened, a steel out and back roller coaster without any loops was unheard of. Magnum is not a smooth-riding roller coaster, partly because its pieces were welded together, unassisted by computer design. The track sections range from [...] to [...] and 157 support columns were used.|$|R
50|$|On a high-wing aircraft, a lift <b>strut</b> <b>connects</b> an {{outboard}} {{point on}} the wing with a point lower on the fuselage to form a rigid triangular structure.

5000|$|The Edwards Rhomboidal was an annular wing biplane with {{identical}} {{upper and}} lower surfaces consisting of four surfaces in a diamond arrangement, the aft wings being of three times the chord of the forward wings. It had been arrived at {{as a result of}} successful experiments with a rubber-driven model monoplane. [...] The main structure of the aircraft was formed by a pair of triangular section wire-braced trusses arranged one above another, connected by five sets of paired struts. Each girder bore a pair of substantial flexibly mounted struts extending outwards, the wings being tensioned between the ends of the longitudinal girders and the outer ends of the struts by means of cables which formed the wing leading edges. The trailing edges were under less tension, the intention being that the wings would automatically deform to spread flight loads. [...] They had no internal spars, being stiffened by ribs aligned with the direction of flight sewn into pockets in the single thickness of fabric. A rectangular elevator was mounted on the rearmost <b>connecting</b> <b>struts,</b> and a small rudder was mounted above the upper wing. There was no provision for lateral control. It was powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Humber water-cooled engine using chains to drive a pair of tractor propellers between the wings, with the pilot sitting behind the engine. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of skids each bearing a pair of wheels, supplemented by a castoring nosewheel and a tailskid. It was tested at Brooklands during early 1911, but there is no record of it having left the ground.|$|R

However, it underwent a major redesign and was a distinct type rather than {{a variant of the}} S.VII. the S.VII can be distinguished from both the S.XII and the later and larger S.XIII by having unraked cabane <b>struts,</b> <b>connecting</b> the top wing to the fuselage, as well as differences in armament.|$|R
50|$|The space {{enclosed}} {{by a set}} of interplane struts is called a bay, hence a biplane or triplane with one set of such <b>struts</b> <b>connecting</b> the wings {{on each side of the}} aircraft is a single-bay biplane.

The teeth in the lower jaw may have been 20-30% smaller than those in the upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|R
