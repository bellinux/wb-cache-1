50|$|Most of the world's {{supply of}} {{pyrethrin}} and C. cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya, which produces {{the most potent}} flowers. Other countries include Croatia (in Dalmatia) and Japan. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. Since the 2000s, Kenya has produced about 70% of the world's supply of pyrethrum. A substantial amount of the flowers is cultivated by small-scale farmers who depend on it {{as a source of}} income. It is a major source of export income for Kenya and source of over 3,500 additional jobs. About 23,000 tons were harvested in 1975. The active ingredients are extracted with organic solvents to give a concentrate containing the six types of pyrethrins: pyrethrin I, pyrethrin II, cinerin I, <b>cinerin</b> <b>II,</b> jasmolin I, and jasmolin II.|$|E

In order to prepare calibration standards for the individual components of the pyrethrum extract, the pyrethrins were isolated by semi-preparative HPLC and their content and purity were determined by H- 1 -NMR spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|In {{a screen}} of 1800 plant and fungal {{extracts}} for antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, and leishmanicidal activity, the n-hexane extract of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium (Trevir.) Vis. flowers showed strong activity against Plasmodium falciparum. We isolated the five pyrethrins [i. e., pyrethrin II (1), jasmolin II (2), <b>cinerin</b> <b>II</b> (3), pyrethrin I (4), and jasmolin I (5) ] from this extract. These were tested together with 15 synthetic pyrethroids for their activity against P. falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and for cytotoxicity in rat myoblast L 6 cells. The natural pyrethrins showed antiplasmodial activity with IC(50) s between 4 and 12 ?M, and antitrypanosomal activity with IC(50) s from 7 to 31 ?M. The pyrethroids exhibited weaker antiplasmodial and antitrypanosomal activity than the pyrethrins. Both {{pyrethrins and pyrethroids}} showed moderate cytotoxicity against L 6 cells. Pyrethrin II (1) was the most selective antiplasmodial compound, with a selectivity index of 24...|$|E
40|$|The flower extract of Chrysanthemum coronarium L. {{and their}} {{fractions}} have shown insecticidal {{effect on the}} cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis. The third instar larvae fed for two days on treated leaves were more susceptible to plant extracts and to their ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions. The active lowest concentration (5 %) of the flower fractions showed no {{significant effect on the}} percent reduction of emerged adult parasitoids, Microplitis rufiventris Kok. GC/MS analysis revealed that the major constituents in ethyl acetate fraction were 3 -dihydro-methylene- 2 - (3 H) furanone (17. 8 %), jasmolin I (15. 6 %), carveol 1 (13. 6 %), phosphoric acid, tributyl ester (11. 4 %) and <b>cinerin</b> <b>II</b> (11. 1 %), while those of chloroform fraction were 5 -hydroxy- 3 methyl- 1 H-pyrazole (42. 7 %) and carveol 1 (24. 8 %).

40|$|Pyrethrins {{are natural}} {{insecticides}} derived from chrysanthemum flowers containing {{a mixture of}} six components: pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I, pyrethrin II, <b>cinerin</b> <b>II,</b> and jasmolin II. In this work, a rapid and sensitive LC–(ESI) -MS/MS method has been developed for the individual quantification and confirmation of pyrethrin residues in fruit and vegetable samples by monitoring two specific transitions for each pyrethrin component under Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. Samples were extracted with acetone/water or acetone, depending on the sample type, and raw extracts were directly injected in the LC–MS/MS system. Method validation was carried out evaluating linearity, accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of quantification (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) in eight types of fruit and vegetable samples at 0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg (referred to {{the sum of all}} pyrethrins). The method based on acetone/water (70 : 30) extraction led to satisfactory recoveries (70 – 110 %) and good precision (below 14 %) for all pyrethrin components in lettuce, pepper, strawberry and potato. The method based on acetone extraction allowed satisfactory recoveries for lettuce, cucumber, tomato and rice samples with recoveries between 71 and 107 % and RSDs below 15 %. For pistachio samples, satisfactory results were obtained only for some analytes and extracts were also injected using APCI interface, but the lower sensitivity achieved allowed only the validation at 0. 5 mg/kg. The analytical methodology developed was applied to the analysis of fruit and vegetable samples...|$|E
40|$|Dalmatian {{pyrethrum}} (Tanacetum cinerariifolium /Trevir. / Sch. Bip.) is {{a perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} Asteraceae family. It is endemic to the East coast of the Adriatic Sea and its natural habitat extends from Italy to northern Albania and up in the mountainous regions of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Pyrethrum flowers yield an important insecticide, the pyrethrin. Pyrethrin is mainly concentrated in oil glands {{on the surface of}} the seed inside the tightly packed flower head, but they can also be found in the other plant parts, however in much lower concentrations. The pyrethrin exist as a combination of six insecticide active ingredients: pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I, pyrethrin II, <b>cinerin</b> <b>II</b> and jasmolin II, with pyrethrin I and pyrethrin II present in higher concentrations. Pyrethrin is non-toxic to mammals and other worm-blooded animals, it is unstable in light, oxygen, water and at elevated temperatures and therefore highly biodegradable. Due to the fact it is environmentally safe it is leading insecticide in organic farming systems. The most scientific work concerning Dalmatian pyrethrum was focused on its morphological and biochemical traits that are relevant in breeding. Breeding programmes are primarily focused on increasing the yield of pyrethrin per unit area. Relative to dry flower weight, flower heads contain the majority of the pyrethrin. Croatian wild populations contain approximately 0. 60 to 0. 79 %, while clones in breeding programmes of Australia and Kenya contain up to 3. 0 % of pyrethrin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) extraction (SFE) of targeted secondary metabolites from selected natural products. Phytochemical characterization and determination of biological efficacy was completed using advanced analytical methods and in-vivo bio-assays. More than 500 SFE extracts were generated and characterized. Sample preparation (particle size, moisture content) and extraction parameters (pressure, temperature and flow rate) were investigated {{and the ability of}} SFE to extract specific biosynthetic classes of compounds was evaluated. Where warranted, pilot scale studies were conducted for larger scale biological trials. SFE of the neotropical vine, Souroubea sympetala, a traditional medicine used for a culture bound syndrome related to anxiety, resulted in an extract rich in betulinic acid (5. 54 +/- 0. 24 mg/g) determined by HPLC-APCI/MS. When subjected to validated rodent anxiety behavioral assays (e. g. elevated plus maze (EPM)) the SFE extract demonstrated significant anxiolysis (anti-anxiety) compared to the vehicle control, with a 50 % increase in time spent in open arms and a 73 % increase in unprotected head dips observed. The significant in-vivo anxiolysis observed provides scientific support for the ethnobotanical use of this traditional medicine and a promising lead for a natural health product (NHP) to treat anxiety. Systematic variation of SFE parameters (pressure and temperature) on pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) oleoresin, a natural insecticide, resulted in a residue free pyrethrin concentrate, suitable for organic agricultural applications. The highest pyrethrin concentration (0. 531 g/g) and highest ratio of pyrethrins I (pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I) to pyrethrins II (pyrethrin II, <b>cinerin</b> <b>II,</b> jasmolin I) (PI:PII = 1. 95) was obtained at 40 °C; 10 MPa while 40 °C; 30 MPa produced the lowest pyrethrin concentration (0. 436 g/g) and lowest ratio of PI:PII (1. 87). Total pyrethrin recovery was highest at 40 °C; 30 MPa (8. 39 g pyrethrins) vs. 40 °C; 10 MPa (6. 96 g pyrethrins). The insecticidal activity of the SFE extracts of the pyrethrum oleoresin was confirmed (> 70 % mortality at 48 h) using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) a major pest of agriculture. SFE of piperamides from black pepper (Piper nigrum), a promising botanical insecticide and synergist, was successful at pressures above 30 MPa and temperatures greater than 50 ˙C with total yields greater than 7. 87 % (CV < 0. 10) and piperamide concentrations greater than 150 mg/g (CV < 6. 0). Flow rate, sample size, and particle size were optimized at 5 L/min, 10 g, and 1 mm mesh respectively. Insecticidal activity corroborated dose dependent piperamide bioactivity. Extract from 10 MPa; 60 °C (42. 38 mg/g) produced 10. 0 +/- 6. 8 (24 h) and 13. 3 +/- 6. 7 % (48 h) mortality. Extract from 35 MPa; 40 °C (148. 56 mg/g) produced 70. 0 +/- 10. 0 (24 h) and 73. 3 +/- 8. 4 % (48 h) mortality. Northern shrimp (Pandelus borealis) by-products extracted by SFE (35 MPa; 40 °C) generated a deep red oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (7. 8 +/- 0. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (8. 0 +/- 0. 07 %). Optimization of pressure (60 MPa), temperature (80 °C), moisture (13 %), particle size (0. 85 mm), and flow rate (9 L/min) resulted in a more efficient extraction without significantly changing concentrations of EPA and DHA. Pilot scale studies confirmed experimental data and supports further investigation of commercial production of an omega - 3 (o- 3) concentrate from Northern shrimp by-products...|$|E
