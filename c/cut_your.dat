25|$|Doctors {{have known}} of strong links between fish and healthy hearts {{ever since they}} noticed that {{fish-eating}} Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of heart disease. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> chances of suffering a heart attack by half. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less saturated fat and more omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood – two fats that, in excess, {{increase the risk of}} heart disease. Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought {{to reduce the risk of}} arrhythmia – irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.|$|E

500|$|One critic, Matt Singer of indieWIRE, said in January 2013 {{that he has}} [...] "started to look at January with {{anticipation}} rather than dread." [...] He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have [...] "way too much money riding on [...] {{to be anything but}} mediocre and boring," [...] January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. [...] "Why throw good money after bad?" [...] he asks rhetorically. [...] "Just <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> losses and let the thing really suck." [...] Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to The Devil Inside, [...] "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." [...] He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June were more like [...] "controlled demolitions." [...] Cloverfield, he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by The Grey and Mama.|$|E

He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia, when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were [...] "going to <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> hearts out".

In a press release, ACL accused PSD that it engages in a campaign against Klaus Iohannis by misinforming and deceiving voters.

[...] Captain Delano enjoys {{the sight of}} Babo performing the kind of personal service to his master Delano thinks blacks are especially well suited for, manicuring, hair-dressing, and barbering. Don Benito, on the other hand, shakes with fear. Apparently, Babo tests the blade across his palm, and for Delano the sound {{is that of a}} man humbling himself, while Cereno hears [...] "the black man warning him: if you make one move toward candor, I will <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> throat." [...] When Delano notices that the shaving cloth covering Don Benito is the Spanish flag, he finds this use an indignity that for a moment gives him occasion to see in Babo a [...] "headsman" [...] and in Don Benito [...] "a man at the block", but quickly reassures himself that blacks are like children and therefore fond of bright colors, so that nothing is wrong with scene.

Two main voices of RTLM were announcers Valérie Bemeriki and Georges Ruggiu. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments {{was an attempt to}} mobilize the population to help eradicate the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the Akazu. Politician Léon Mugesera gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, [...] "Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> neck...Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!"

2500|$|Clare’s {{introductory}} storyline {{focused upon}} domestic violence—her father Liam's physical abuse of her mother—and being caught between her feuding parents. Later storylines involved {{the death of}} her mother, who was killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1995, and a subsequent custody battle between her father and stepfather, which ultimately led to Nigel being given custody of Clare. After six years in the serial, the character was written out in 1998 as a result of Paul Bradley's decision to leave, reportedly for fear of being typecast in the role of Nigel the [...] "nerd". The writers of EastEnders wanted to give Nigel a happy ending, so a character named Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn) was invented to be a love interest for Nigel, whilst her son, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee), was invented to be a love interest for Clare. In the storyline, Nigel fell for Julie, Clare’s teacher, as they tried to sort out Clare’s problematic behaviour at school. Simultaneously, Clare fell for Julie’s son Josh, and when the storyline reached its climax in April 1998, the Bates family relocated to Scotland to begin a new life with Julie and Josh. Since her initial departure, actress Gemma Bissix has commented on her character’s exit from the soap: “it was the right time for the character to go. Besides, when you get to 15 and haven't been able to <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> hair for six years, you want a change.” ...|$|E
