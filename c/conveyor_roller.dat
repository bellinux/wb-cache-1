50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within conveyor rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> failure. This ultimately makes <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller,</b> using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make conveyor rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|E

5000|$|Conveyor {{production}} {{delays and}} reliability issues are generally {{a result of}} a failure in one of the three main components of a conveyor system. The belt, drives/gearboxes or the conveyor rolling elements. Of which - Conveyor idlers are the most numerous component on the conveyor system. It has been shown that <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> failure in underground coal mines is the premier cause of fires. This presents a significant hazard to coal mine workers.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced {{inventory}} control or reduction in overall inventory on site {{due to the}} targeted nature of automated <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> monitoring systems will generates large operational savings for the business. A more efficient and focused spare parts management, process could result in less associated business running costs. Also, improving particular equipment such as the conveyors could increase the equipment lifetime, and as such, delay future equipment replacement costs. Therefore, reducing the components {{total cost of ownership}} (TCO).|$|E
50|$|Externally mounted {{monitoring}} {{technologies are}} also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or vibration monitoring transducers mounted to the conveyor frame. The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure. This is because <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> failure is multi-modal and is indicated over a variety of failure signals not solely identified using single mode detection systems which are characteristic of optic fibre or vibration transducers mounted to the conveyor structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{fracturing}} {{occurred at}} the welded joint of the belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> while being in use in a coal mine of Fujian Province, the paper analyses the roller’s structure and stress in {{the basis of the}} transmission principle. It explores the reasons of the fracturing problem, and then proposes method to improve the roller’s welding technology. These are the cause of the roller fracturing，which the tension of the belt is great, and the roller itself is not strong enough, and welding process of steel plate is poor, and welding quality is not high. Use CO 2 and Ar mixed gas shielded arc welding to do backing weld, then use the welding method of automatic submerged arc welding. Finally the tempering to the welded joint part with the track-type far-infrared heater eliminate the welding residual stress. By actual use, it’s proved that the Welding Process Improvement is feasible, reasonable, reliable and practical.

40|$|The {{fertilizer}} bagging line {{operation for}} packaging and conveying {{to the final}} delivery trucks {{was a source of}} problem for one fertilizer producer referred to here as Company “N”. This resulted in frequent maintenance activities from constant machine breakdown, loss of production, and the attendant loss in plant revenue. To overcome this, a technical study was conducted to address the problem. Plant site visit and technical inspection revealed the breakdowns were primarily due to fertilizer granules being trapped on the packaging/bagging conveyors, {{and as a result of}} fast acidic corrosion causing rust and eventual seizures of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>rollers</b> and lines. The resistances to free roller movement induce a drag load on the drive motors, with the additional loading causing failures of the electronic control sensors and stoppages. The unreliability of the bagging operations in the unplanned, repeated start-stop sequence in the packaging operation also led to safety concerns, with a few incidences of injuries being recorded. The engineered solution is presented in this report. I...|$|R
