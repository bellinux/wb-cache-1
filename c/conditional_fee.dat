40|$|Prior to the {{subprime}} crisis, mortgage brokers charged higher percentage fees for loans {{that turned out}} to be riskier ex post, even when conditioning on other risk characteristics. High <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> reveal borrower attributes that are associated with high borrower risk, such as suboptimal shopping behavior, high valuation for the loan or high borrower-specific broker costs. Borrowers who pay high <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> are inherently more risky, not just because they pay high fees. We find a stronger association between <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> and delinquency risk when lenders have fewer incentives to screen borrowers, for purchase rather than refinance loans, and for loans originated by brokers who have less frequent interactions with the lender. Our findings shed light on the proposed QRM exemption criteria for risk retention requirements for residential mortgage securitizations. ...|$|R

Such companies used aggressive sales techniques and exaggerated claims, profiting from exorbitant commissions on after the event insurance policies.

40|$|This thesis uses {{theoretical}} models {{to study the}} effects of recent developments in the funding of civil litigation in England and Wales. This involves a form of contingency payment (<b>conditional</b> <b>fees),</b> a legal expenses insurance that can be purchased either before or after an accident has taken place and the combination of them. The issue revolves around the implications of litigants' choices and lawyers' effort decision. More recently, policy discussion has raised the possibility of legal service being delivered in new organisational structures. We first use a model to analyse the combined effects of the insurance and the fee arrangements on settlement probabilities, settlement amount, care levels and litigants' welfare. After that, we extend our model to consider the role of risk aversion in litigation and the timing of settlement. Then, we examine the effects of law firm's organisational structure and ownership changes on its legal effort provision in a property rights framework. Our results show that plaintiffs generally benefit from an organisational structure which allows law firms to provide legal insurance services. Efficiencies and welfare effects of other potential business structures are also examined. Other issues such as the three-way relationship between a client, his lawyer and an insurer and comparisons between health care insurance and legal expenses insurance are also discussed in this thesis. This thesis differs from other contributions in this area for two reasons. First, it recognises the complementarity between fee reform and structural developments. Second, it considers the effects of these arrangements on lawyer effort...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{competitive}} effects of vertical contracts in a contracting situation where rival retailers offer contracts to a manufacturer. In contrast to Bernheim and Whinston (1998), {{who study the}} situation in which competing manufacturers offer contracts to a common retailer, we find that two-part tariffs (even if contingent on exclusivity or not) do not suffice to implement the monopoly outcome. Richer arrangements (including, e. g., <b>conditional</b> fixed <b>fees</b> and upfront payments) are thus required to internalize all contracting externalities. The welfare implications are ambiguous. On the one hand, richer contracts ensure that no efficient retailer is excluded. On the other hand, they allow firms to maintain monopoly prices despite intrabrand competition. Simulations suggest that the latter effect may be more significant...|$|R

40|$|East Africa {{has become}} {{a focal point for}} impact investors across the globe, with {{investments}} steadily increasing since 2010. Yet despite this growth in recent years, the number of investment opportunities available remains limited. Catalysing Impact Deal Flow in East Africa explores the causes of this constraint and provides recommendations for donors seeking to increase impact investing volumes (deal flow). Top Takeaways Two key challenges are constraining the growth of impact investing in East Africa: 1) The pairing of investors and enterprises ("matching challenge"); and 2) enterprises' lack of readiness to take on investment ("preparation challenge"). Local service providers (consulting and advisory firms) that help enterprises raise capital and build capacity are already addressing both the matching and the preparation challenges. However, these service providers themselves face constraints in scaling their services due to delayed and <b>conditional</b> payment of <b>fees</b> from enterprises resulting from a deferred success fee model. An appropriate market-shaping intervention could help service providers to scale up sustainably, and help to develop a more vibrant impact investing market overall...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{correlate}} students’ {{performance with}} their professional background and motivation {{to take part}} in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) courses. We base our analysis on the self-determination theory that differentiates intrinsic (ambition to perform by individual itself) from extrinsic motivation (incentive by external stimuli). Design: We present a non-blinded, monocentric, non-randomized descriptive study of 376 students taking part in an ATLS course at one course site in Germany. Part of a two-day ATLS course are two written tests; we correlate test scores with background information provided by the students in a questionnaire of 13 items (age, sex, adress, board certification, specialty, subspecialty, position, hospital level of care, hospital operator and hospital participation in trauma network, motivation, funding source, condition of funding). Setting: The students were recuited at the BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen (Germany), a large 528 -bed trauma center and one of 13 ATLS course sites in Germany. Participants: 449 ATLS course students taking part in ATLS courses at the above-mentioned course site from February 2009 to May 2010 were sent a questionnaire asking for their background. All 449 course students were eligible to participate. 376 (83. 7 %) questionnaires were returned, pre- and post-test results of all students aquired and included into our calculations. 312 (83 %) were male and 64 (17 %) female. The majority (59. 3 %) of recruited students came from trauma surgery, 21. 8 % from anesthesiology, 8 % from general surgery, 4 % from abdominal surgery, 0. 5 % from vascular or thoracic surgery each and 5. 9 % from other specialties. Results: Neither age, sex, subspecialty, hospital level of care, hospital operator, or hospital participation in trauma network played a role with respect to motivation or test results. The high degree of intrinsic motivation of consultants (92. 3 %) had no impact on their test results. Anesthesiologists were higher motivated (75. 6 % intrinsically motivated) in contrast to all surgical colleagues (63. 6 %), which showed significant differences in the pre- (89. 8 % vs. 85. 3 %, p= 0. 03) but not the post-test. Of all 13. 6 % students who were self-payers, 94. 1 % were intrinsically motivated; the 86. 2 % whose course fee was accounted for {{were less likely to be}} intrinsically motivated (63. 9 %). Sponsoring however did not have a negative impact on test results. Conditional funding (sponsored only on passing both tests) was detrimental to motivation: 0 % of these individuals were intrinsically motivated and they scored significantly lower (82. 5 %) than all other students in the post-test (86. 9 %, p= 0. 002). Overall, intrinsically motivated students overtopped extrinsically motivated students in the post-test (88. 0 % vs. 83. 4 %, p< 0. 001). Conclusions: ATLS course participation is not compulsory for medical doctors in Germany. Intrinsic motivation {{to take part in}} these courses is a key prerequisite to increase performance, irrespective of the background of the students. Intrinsically motivated students are ready to invest into their education and vice versa. <b>Conditional</b> funding (course <b>fee</b> only sponsored on passing the course) evokes no intrinsic motivation at all and causes worse results...|$|R
