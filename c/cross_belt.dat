25|$|It {{was common}} for {{infantry}} soldiers {{to wear a}} <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> consisting of two white buff leather straps which made an X across their chests; one belt held a bayonet {{and the other a}} cartridge box. Officers wore one shoulder belt which often supported a sabre scabbard or pistol cartridge box, since they did not carry a musket. The belts had a plate at the center which identified a soldier's regiment. Soldiers were issued white pipe clay which was used to whiten the belts to maintain their appearance.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Paolo Bernardini, monumental statuary appears also at {{the site}} of [...] "San Giovanni Sergiu", in South Sardinia, most probably linked to a necropolis. At the site, a surface survey among the stones piled from a field tillage uncovered a head carved in sandstone, surmounted by a tall and bent headgear, embellished with tusks. The lineaments, extremely damaged, still preserve two nested circles representing eyes, identical to those of the statues of Mont'e Prama, and a sharp chin. Other fragments from the same site seem to belong to a human trunk with a <b>cross</b> <b>belt,</b> with a clear image of a small palm tree, sculpted in relief and partially painted in red.|$|E
60|$|In {{one hand}} the {{creature}} carried a stout club, and suspended at its left side from a shoulder belt was a short, sheathed knife, while a <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> supported a pouch at its right hip. Confining these straps {{to the body}} and also apparently supporting the loin cloth was a broad girdle which glittered in the moonlight as though encrusted with virgin gold, and was clasped {{in the center of}} the belly with a huge buckle of ornate design that scintillated as with precious stones.|$|E

60|$|If Erling the Bold was {{a splendid}} {{specimen}} {{of a man}} in his ordinary costume, when clad in the full panoply of war he was truly magnificent. The rude but not ungraceful armour of the period was admirably fitted to display to advantage the elegant proportions of his gigantic figure. A shirt or tunic of leather, covered with steel rings, hung loosely--yet, owing to its weight, closely--on his shoulders. This was gathered in at the waist by a broad leathern belt, studded with silver ornaments, from which hung a short dagger. A <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> of somewhat similar make hung from his right shoulder, and supported a two-edged sword of immense weight, which was quite as strong, though not nearly so long, as that which he had forged for Glumm. It was intended for a single-handed weapon, though men of smaller size might have been constrained, in attempting to wield it, to make use of both hands. The youth's lower limbs were clothed in closely-fitting leather leggings, and a pair of untanned leather shoes, laced with a single thong, protected his feet. On his head he wore a small skull-cap, or helmet, of burnished steel, from the top of which rose a pair of hawk's wings expanded, as if in the act of flight. No gloves or gauntlets covered his hands, but on his left arm hung a large shield, shaped somewhat like an elongated heart, with a sharp point at its lower end. Its top touched his shoulder, and the lower part reached to his knee.|$|E
60|$|On {{the road}} {{which led to}} the old dark manor-house upon the side of the hill a youth had been riding. His mount was a sorry one, a weedy, shambling, {{long-haired}} colt, and his patched tunic of faded purple with stained leather belt presented no very smart appearance; yet in the bearing of the man, in the poise of his head, in his easy graceful carriage, and in the bold glance of his large blue eyes, there was that stamp of distinction and of breed which would have given him a place of his own in any assembly. He was of small stature, but his frame was singularly elegant and graceful. His face, though tanned with the weather, was delicate in features and most eager and alert in expression. A thick fringe of crisp yellow curls broke from under the dark flat cap which he was wearing, and a short golden beard hid the outline of his strong square chin. One white osprey feather thrust through a gold brooch in the front of his cap gave a touch of grace to his somber garb. This and other points of his attire, the short hanging mantle, the leather-sheathed hunting-knife, the <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> which sustained a brazen horn, the soft doe-skin boots and the prick spurs, would all disclose themselves to an observer; but at the first glance the brown face set in gold and the dancing light of the quick, reckless, laughing eyes, were the one strong memory left behind.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan voiced a {{suppressed}} sigh for he {{had liked}} Om-at and then, with Ta-den, approached the edge and looked over. Far below, {{in the dim light}} of the coming dawn, two inert forms should be lying stark in death; but, to Tarzan's amazement, such was far from the sight that met his eyes. Instead, there were the two figures still vibrant with life and still battling only a few feet below him. Clinging always to the pegs with two holds--a hand and a foot, or a foot and a tail, they seemed as much at home upon the perpendicular wall as upon the level surface of the vestibule; but now their tactics were slightly altered, for each seemed particularly bent upon dislodging his antagonist from his holds and precipitating him to certain death below. It was soon evident that Om-at, younger and with greater powers of endurance than Es-sat, was gaining an advantage. Now was the chief almost wholly on the defensive. Holding him by the <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> with one mighty hand Om-at was forcing his foeman straight out from the cliff, and with the other hand and one foot was rapidly breaking first one of Es-sat's holds and then another, alternating his efforts, or rather punctuating them, with vicious blows to the pit of his adversary's stomach. Rapidly was Es-sat weakening and with the knowledge of impending death there came, as there comes to every coward and bully under similar circumstances, a crumbling of the veneer of bravado which had long masqueraded as courage and with it crumbled his code of ethics. Now was Es-sat no longer chief of Kor-ul-ja--instead he was a whimpering craven battling for life. Clutching at Om-at, clutching at the nearest pegs he sought any support that would save him from that awful fall, and as he strove to push aside the hand of death, whose cold fingers he already felt upon his heart, his tail sought Om-at's side and the handle of the knife that hung there.|$|E

60|$|Separated by {{a hundred}} paces the two halted simultaneously. Before him the {{stranger}} saw a tall white warrior, naked {{but for a}} loin cloth, <b>cross</b> <b>belts,</b> and a girdle. The man was armed with a heavy, knotted club and a short knife, the latter hanging in its sheath at his left hip {{from the end of}} one of his <b>cross</b> <b>belts,</b> the opposite belt supporting a leathern pouch at his right side. It was Ta-den hunting alone in the gorge of his friend, the chief of Kor-ul-ja. He contemplated the stranger with surprise but no wonder, since he recognized in him a member of the race with which his experience of Tarzan the Terrible had made him familiar and also, thanks to his friendship for the ape-man, he looked upon the newcomer without hostility.|$|R
60|$|He was hatless, and his {{stained and}} ragged khaki betokened much {{exposure}} to the elements and hard and continued usage. At his saddle-bow a carbine swung in its boot, and upon either hip was strapped a long revolver. Ammunition in plenty filled the <b>cross</b> <b>belts</b> that he had looped about his shoulders.|$|R

50|$|The current {{standard}} uniform {{comes from}} the last major changes made in 1974. However, several additions have been made since then for practical reasons. The old white uniform still remain as the full-dress uniform of Officers above the rank of sub inspector SI, only worn for ceremonial occasions. This includes white tunic, trousers (or skirt), and medals, and is adorned with black epaulettes with rank insignia, a black leather <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> with the lion head badge with whistle and chain, police badge-affixed black leather pouch, sword, and a white pith helmet. Gazetted officers - ASP, and above ranks may wear a waist sash in gold colour instead of the <b>cross</b> <b>belt.</b> Mounted officers wear a red tunic for ceremonial occasions with a gold <b>cross</b> <b>belt</b> and a black custodian helmet. Officers above the rank of sub inspector - SI, carry swords, and constables carry lances with a police pennant.|$|E

60|$|In {{order to}} make the above remarks more clear as regards {{atmospheric}} phenomena, let us suppose the case of a sailor who makes the same voyage every year, but not precisely at the same time each year (and it must be remembered that the rigid punctuality at starting which now holds good did not exist in former times). In his first voyage he had to cross, say, four of the wind-belts. While <b>crossing</b> <b>belt</b> number one, he experiences south-west winds chiefly, and, being an observant man, notes the fact. In belt number two he encounters westerly winds. In number three he is in a region of variable winds and calms. In this region the winds blow all round the compass, averaging about three months from each quarter. But our sailor does not know that; he does not stay there all the year to make notes; he passes on, having recorded his experience. In <b>crossing</b> <b>belt</b> number four, he finds the prevailing winds to be easterly.|$|R

50|$|Buff leather is a strong, soft {{preparation}} of bull's or elk's hide, which was worn under mail armor {{in the middle}} ages to deaden the effect of a blow. As armor fell into disuse, buff coats, which would turn a broadsword cut, and even a pistol ball, were often worn in lieu of complete steel, either with or without a cuirass and gorget of metal. Modern buff leather, of which soldiers' <b>cross</b> <b>belts</b> and other accoutrements are frequently made, is for the most part made of common buckskin.|$|R
