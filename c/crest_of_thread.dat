40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{machined}} finish {{plays a major role}} in the performance of milling operations, good surface quality can significantly improve fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, or creep behaviour as well as surface friction. In this study, the effect of cutting parameters and cutting fluid pressure on the quality measurement of the surface <b>of</b> the <b>crest</b> for <b>threads</b> milled during high speed milling operations has been scrutinised. Cutting fluid pressure, feed rate and spindle speed were the input parameters whilst minimising surface roughness on the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> was the target. The experimental study was designed using the Taguchi L 32 array. Analysing and modelling the effective parameters were carried out using both a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural networks (ANNs). These were shown to be highly adept for such tasks. In this paper, the analysis of surface roughness at the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> in high speed thread milling using a high accuracy optical profile-meter is an original contribution to the literature. The experimental results demonstrated that the surface quality in the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> was improved by increasing cutting speed, feed rate ranging 0. 41 - 0. 45 m/min and cutting fluid pressure ranging 2 - 3. 5 bars. These outcomes characterised the ANN as a promising application for surface profile modelling in precision machining...|$|R

30|$|The white layers were {{observed}} around the implant threads in all specimens. The {{area of the}} white layers varied, and included the thread crests, circular-shaped sites around the thread ridges, and thread roots.

50|$|The major {{diameter}} <b>of</b> external <b>threads</b> is normally {{smaller than the}} {{major diameter}} <b>of</b> the internal <b>threads,</b> if the threads are designed to fit together. But this requirement alone does not guarantee that a bolt and a nut of the same pitch would fit together: the same requirement must separately {{be made for the}} minor and pitch diameters <b>of</b> the <b>threads.</b> Besides providing for a clearance between the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the bolt <b>threads</b> and the root <b>of</b> the nut <b>threads,</b> one must also ensure that the clearances are not so excessive as to cause the fasteners to fail.|$|R
50|$|Provided {{that there}} are {{moderate}} non-negative clearances between the root and <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the opposing <b>threads,</b> and everything else is ideal, if the pitch diameters of a screw and nut are exactly matched, {{there should be no}} play at all between the two as assembled, even in the presence of positive root-crest clearances. This is the case when the flanks <b>of</b> the <b>threads</b> come into intimate contact with one another, before the roots and crests do, if at all.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to create an acid etched implant surface that results in a surface similar to that gained by using sandblasting combined with acid etching and to compare it with surfaces of commercially available screw-type implants. Titanium grade V discs were machined in preparation for acid etching. Tests were carried out using different acids and their combinations with variable time exposures. All etched surfaces were scanned with electron microscope (JEOL JSM- 5600, Japan) and digital images were made for visual evaluation and description of the surfaces. The etched surfaces were evaluated for surface morphology (combination of micro roughness and waviness) and were best attained by a combina-tion of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids. The etched titanium discs were fixed in resin (two were cut and polished and two – scored and fractured) and the surface profile was examined in. The second part of the investigation used screw-shaped titanium implants. Twenty-eight screw-shaped implants that were manufactured from commercially available titanium grade V, were se-lected and divided into two groups: 3 implants as controls (machined surface) and 25 implants processed using the etching methods used {{in the first part of}} the investigation.

40|$|Presently, {{the rotary}} wing-head and hub {{subassemblies}} of the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter require almost complete disassembly to inspect failure critical <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> the main spindle. Even with {{direct access to}} the <b>threads,</b> detection <b>of</b> fatigue cracks in the thread roots is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the spindle threads applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the spindle thread roots not only by scanning the outside diameter (<b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threads),</b> but also by scanning the hollow spindle bore under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threads,</b> high sensitivity to very small defects in the thread roots was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the spindle bore. Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable. From the bore, detection of a thumbnail shaped EDM slot measuring 7. 75 mm long by 2. 21 mm deep by 0. 102 mm wide was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> opposing <b>threads</b> are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|R
5000|$|The pitch {{diameter}} (PD, or D2) <b>of</b> a particular <b>thread,</b> internal or external, is {{the diameter of}} a cylindrical surface, axially concentric to the thread, which intersects the thread flanks at equidistant points, when viewed {{in a cross-sectional plane}} containing the axis <b>of</b> the <b>thread,</b> the distance between these points being exactly one half the pitch distance. Equivalently, a line running parallel to the axis and a distance D2 away from it, the [...] "PD line," [...] slices the sharp-V form <b>of</b> the <b>thread,</b> having flanks coincident with the flanks <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> under test, at exactly 50% of its height. We have assumed that the flanks have the proper shape, angle, and pitch for the specified thread standard. It is generally unrelated to the major (D) and minor (D1) diameters, especially if the crest and root truncations of the sharp-V form at these diameters are unknown. Everything else being ideal, D2, D, & D1, together, would fully describe the <b>thread</b> form. Knowledge <b>of</b> PD determines the position <b>of</b> the sharp-V <b>thread</b> form, the sides of which coincide with the straight sides <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> flanks: e.g., the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the external <b>thread</b> would truncate these sides a radial displacement D - D2 away from the position of the PD line.|$|R
50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a <b>thread</b> pitch angle <b>of</b> 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO metric thread form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO metric thread, where screws must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R
5000|$|Lead [...] {{and pitch}} {{are closely related}} concepts. They can be {{confused}} {{because they are the}} same for most screws. Lead is the distance along the screw's axis that is covered by one complete rotation of the screw (360°). Pitch is the distance from the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> one <b>thread</b> to the next. Because the vast majority of screw threadforms are single-start threadforms, their lead and pitch are the same. Single-start means {{that there is only one}} [...] "ridge" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of one ridge. [...] "Double-start" [...] means that there are two [...] "ridges" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of two ridges. Another way to express this is that lead and pitch are parametrically related, and the parameter that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.|$|R
