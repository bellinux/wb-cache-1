40|$|Falling {{exchange}} rates cause {{a decline in}} the value of the U. S. dollar, increasing import prices and reducing export prices. These relative price changes create income and substitution effects. This study uses an econometric model of the U. S. economy, developed using 1960 - 2000 data, to assess the relationship of recent changes in the exchange rate to changes in demand for imports and exports. The study finds the positive effects of export growth and substitution toward domestic goods, more than offset the negative effects on real income of higher import prices resulting from the 2000 - 2008 decline in U. S. exchange rate. The paper estimates the declining exchange rate (16. 4 %) stimulated exports and domestic consumer demand sufficiently to add 3. 7 % to total GDP growth over the period, and significantly decreased the trade deficit ($ 187. 2 billion) from what it otherwise would have been. This decline in the trade deficit and the increase in domestic savings from higher incomes increased U. <b>S.</b> <b>owned</b> <b>assets</b> by an estimated $ 114 billion compared to what they would otherwise have been.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} cost estimates when using different modeling techniques. The techniques applied {{in this study are}} ordinary least squares regression (OLS), Analogy-based estimation, stepwise ANOVA, regression trees (CART), and robust regression. This is the first test of robust regression on a large-scale industrial data set. We compare the accuracy of the estimates for one organization when using their own data with the accuracy when using carefully matched data {{from the rest of the}} ISBSG data set. This analysis reveals that when using the ISBSG data set for the one organization, the most accurate techniques are robust regression and OLS. When using the organizations own data as the basis for the estimates we found that most of the techniques performed equally well (except for two variants of the techniques). In contrast to previous studies, the accuracy when using the companies own data for estimation is significantly higher than when using the rest of the ISBSG data set. The only non-significant difference occurred with a CART variation. The implications of these results are that when a company collects its own data, it does not really matter which technique to apply to achieve reasonable accuracy. This will of course be influenced by the variability in the <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>own</b> data set. If a company contributes to the ISBSG data set, the use of a robust technique, such as robust regression is recommended from these results. As the used data set is relatively large, these results are expected to be somewhat generalizable. However, some of the above results are different when compared to the results from previous studies...|$|R

These differences arise primarily because when profitability declines, carriers keep owned aircraft and return leased aircraft, which lessors redeploy to more productive operators. ...|$|R
