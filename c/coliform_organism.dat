40|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of the “tube dilution” method for the assay of antibiotics in human serum has been illustrated by utilizing serum-sensitive and serum-resistant strains of Escherichia coli.

Different strains grown and tested under standard conditions showed great variations in enzyme activity although the amount of diaminopimelic acid in the cell hydrolysates was similar. Except for a higher average activity in Aerobacter aerogenes, there was no correlation between the activity of diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase and the biochemical type of <b>coliform</b> <b>organism.</b> No strain was found that contained diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase in the absence of lysine decarboxylase. The enzyme was also found in a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not in Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis or Bacillus subtilis.

40|$|SUMMARY: Experiments by the Thunberg tube {{technique}} {{have shown}} that tetra-thionate can oxidize reduced Nile blue {{in the presence of}} tetrathionate-adapted cells of a Gram-negative <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> but not in the presence of cells lacking a developed tetrathionase system, viz. unadapted cells of the same organism and cells of Shigella sonnei. Concentrations of tetrathionate of the order of ~/ 3200 and slight tetrathionase activity can be detected by the Thunberg tube technique, which may be useful also in investigating the effect of certain physical and chemical agents on the tetrathionase system. It appears that tetrathionate can act as a hydrogen acceptor for organisms capable of reducing it. Knox, Gel 1 & Pollock (1943) showed that certain organisms can reduce tetra-thionate {{in the presence of a}} hydrogen donator, and it has been suggested that tetrathionate. acts as a hydrogen acceptor alternative to oxygen for those organisms that are able to reduce i t (Knox et al. 1943; Pollock & Knox, 1943; Knox, 1945).

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{influence}} of the temperature of incubation on the course of formic acid and gas production by cultures of a <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> growing in buffered and unbuffered peptone media was studied. The evidence suggests that at 30 ' and at 87 ' the onset of gas production {{is determined by the}} concentration of undissociated formic acid in the culture, but that a higher concentration of acid is required to elicit response at 87 ' than at 30 ". Undissociated formic acid is toxic to the organism and it appears that gas is not produced in unbuffered glucose medium at 3 ' 7 " because the environmental conditions do not allow elaboration of hydrogenlyase before inhibitory conditions of pH value and formate concentration are attained. Coliform bacteria which ferment sugars at 37 ' with the production of acid and gas are believed to be mainly of intestinal origin and their presence in water is considered indicative of faecal contamination. In routine water analysis occasional coliform strains are encountered which ferment sugars at 37 " with-out the production of gas but which produce acid and gas in the normal way at lower temperatures (Prescott, Winslow & McCrady, 1946). These strains ar...|$|E
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. during this study {{in drinking water}} is of primary importance because these constitute {{a major part of}} <b>coliform</b> <b>organism.</b> This result implies that the water samples were potentially contaminated from fecal sources and as such were not safe for consumption. Coliform is used as water quality indicator. According to WHO (2011), the number of faecal coliforms should not be observed in 100  ml of drinking water. In this study, 18.42 % drinking water samples for different areas showed that the presence of fecal coliforms (FCC), i.e., E. coli (Table  3), indicates the contamination of drinking water. Enteropathogenic E. coli causes diarrhea, food-borne disease and vomiting (Suthar et al. 2009). Moreover, E. coli is also responsible for urinary tract infection. Other coliforms such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are detected during this study where Enterobacter aerogenes creates food spoilage and Klebsiella pneumonia causes urinary tract infection and pneumonia. P. aeruginosa has been previously reported in the bottled water (Ahmed Ahmed et al. 2013; Svagzdiene et al. 2010). The organism may be harmful to newborns and elderly patients because it can multiply and reach to harmful number very quickly. Moreover, being a primary cause of disease Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often identified as an indicator of other bacterial contaminations of fecal origin (Warburton et al. 1994). Occurrence of coliforms shows the danger of fecal contamination and the consequent hazard of contracting disease through pathogenic organisms.|$|E
40|$|In a multi-laboratory {{trial with}} the {{membrane}} filtration technique, three surfactants [...] Teepol 610 (T 610), Tergitol 7 (T 7) and {{sodium lauryl sulphate}} (LS) [...] were compared in media for the enumeration of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> and Escherichia coli in water. A total of 179 samples of water (87 raw and 92 marginally chlorinated) were examined for colony counts of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms,</b> and 185 water samples (94 raw and 91 marginally chlorinated) for E. coli.

Pulmonary tuberculosis is well understood {{by the majority of}} primary care doctors and nurses, whereas genito-urinary tuberculosis may not be as easy to diagnose and treat. We reviewed our experience with this condition in 52 patients, who represented 0, 74 % of urology admissions between 1986 and 1991. There was a 3 : 2 male/female ratio, the age range was 7 - 76 years (mean 43 years), and the disease was more common among blacks and coloureds than among whites. Multiple sites of involvement were fairly common. Seventy-five per cent of patients had renal involvement and 17 % epididymal involvement. The commonest presenting complaints were urinary frequency and haematuria, although flank and scrotal pain were also reported by a number of patients. Physical examination seldom helped to suggest the diagnosis. On microscopic examination and culture of the urine, sterile pyuria was present in only 50 % of our patients and 29 % had positive cultures for a 'normal' <b>coliform</b> <b>organism.</b> Fifty patients underwent excretory urography and the findings were very varied. Patients were treated primarily with antituberculosis drugs, but 58 % also required some form of surgery; nephrectomy was the commonest operation.

40|$|The name B. coli mutabile was {{employed}} by Neisser (1906) to designate a non-lactose-fermenting <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> which suddenly acquired {{the capacity to}} ferment lactose. The muta-tion-like variation became manifest through the formation of secondary colonies on lactose agar. Subcultures from a secon-dary colony proved to be active fermenters while similar cultures from {{the remainder of the}} colony had no such capacity. Other workers have since shown that this mode of variation occurs {{in a wide variety of}} bacterial species and that various carbon com-pounds may be involved. Since the term "mutabile " denotes variation by mutation, Burri (1910) objected to it and proposed the name, "imperfec-tum, " for a form which varied to sucrose in a similar manner. While Burri's contention that the term is a misnomer may be well founded, it has been so widely used that it will doubtless survive. Our knowledge of bacterial variation has been extended through the study of various mutabile strains but there are still differences of opinion which are difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize. Previous workers have based their conclusions on experiments conducted with complex media containing peptone as well as the carbon compound to which variation occurs. Hence, it seems that little or nothing is known concerning the ability of such organisms to attack specific compounds when supplied as the sole source of carbon.

40|$|SUMMARY: Cells of a tetrathionate-reducing <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> {{growing in}} semi-anaerobic {{conditions}} gained no advantage from {{the presence of}} tetrathionate at el 0, but at lower temperatures (e. g. 34 p) they grew much better with than without it. When freely supplied with oxygen, the cells grew about as well at 41 " as at 34 ". The adaptive formation of tetrathionase in washed suspension has already been shown to diminish with increase of temperature from 341 " to a", whereas {{the activity of the}} enzyme when formed increases with temperature in this range; nkatase, on the other hand, is still actively formed at temperatures as high as a". It is clear that whatever factors may be necessary for adaptation, one of them is more sensitive to heat than either nitrataw formation or the overalI growth process. In previous work the following facts about the bacterial enzyme system tetrathionase were established: (1) Salmonellae {{and a number of other}} Gram-negative bacteria can reduce tetrathionate quantitatively to thiosulphate (Knox, Gel 1 & Pollock, 1943). Both the activity of the fully developed enzyme and its adaptive formation can be demonstrated in washed suspension in the presence of a suitable H donator (Pollock & Knox, 1948; Knox & Pollock, 1944). (2) The velocity of reduction by adapted cell suspensions increases with temperature at least up to $ 0 " or even higher. Adaptation, on the other hand, is almost completely suppressed at 41 - 4 Z 0, while it occurs rapidly at 37 ' and even lower temperatures (Pollock, 1945). (3) The reduction of tetrathionate is of value in growth to those organisms that can reduce it. Tetrathionate is a selective hydrogen acceptor and an alternative to oxygen; it is not so efficient as oxygen but it enables a broth culture to reach in a few hours a population two to three times the population reached in unaerated broth (Knox, 1945). The relation between adaptation (which may involve the biosynthesis of a specific enzyme or enzyme system) and growth of a bacterial culture (synthesis of bacterial protoplasm as a whole) is one of intriguing interest. A study has now been made of the effect of temperature on the capacity of a bacterial culture to reduce tetrathionate during growth...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{and grass}} {{filtration}} {{of a domestic}} sewage effluent for trace element removal was investigated by applying oxidation-pond-treated waste water to twelve 2. 44 -meter-long, 30. 5 -cm-diameter, lysimeter columns and to a half-acre plot planted to common bermudagrass. Bermudagrass was also planted on the soil columns {{to aid in the}} removal of accumulated metals, thus prolonging the filtering capacity of the soil system. Four irrigation patterns, continuous flooding, alternate day flooding, one day wet-three days dry cycles and two days wet-five days dry cycles, were employed during the eleven week lysimeter test. Water samples were extracted from the soil columns at eight sampling depths to determine the soil depth at which the various trace metals were removed from the filtrate by the processes of adsorption, absorption and biological assimilation. Atomic absorption spectrophotometric techniques were used to determine the concentrations of iron, manganese, hexavalent chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, cobalt and strontium in the applied effluent, filtrate, soil and grass clippings. Filtrate samples for trace metal analysis were also extracted at shallow depths and from two groundwater zones at 9. 1 and 15. 2 meters depth under the grass plot. In the lysimeter study, iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, lead and cadmium were removed from the filtrate at, or near, the soil surface. Some copper, zinc and cobalt were found in the deeper filtrate samples during periods of high infiltration rates and in the presence of anaerobic conditions. Smaller amounts of manganese, nickel and lead were also found at the deeper sampling points. Strontium was not removed from the water percolating through the calcareous soil employed in this study. Chromium and cobalt were not present in measurable quantities in the applied effluent. Iron and manganese were removed from the soil system in the grass clippings in the greatest amounts. Traces of copper, zinc and cadmium were also detected in the grass clippings. Larger quantities of iron, manganese and copper were detected in the filtrate at the grass plot than at comparable depths of the lysimeter columns, probably due to effluent applications at the grass plot over a period of two years. Lower quantities of nickel and lead in the filtrate at the grass plot were attributed to leaching by effluent during grass filtration tests, prior to the trace metal experiments. The concentrations of trace metals in the filtrate {{at the bottom of the}} lysimeter columns and in the groundwater zones at the grass plot were irsignificant by United States Public Health Service drinking water standards (1962) and would meet most other water supply requirements. The total nitrogen and nitrate contents were successfully reduced when a combination of aerobic and anaerobic environments were present in the soil system. Total nitrogen and nitrate levels were not reduced by grass filtration through 304. 8 meters of dense grass. Fewer total coliform organisms were detected in the aerobic lysimeter columns than in the continuously flooded columns. The majority of coliform organisms detected in the filtrate at the 61 cm depth were believed to be of non-fecal origin. The chemical oxygen demand of the applied effluent was reduced to as low as 105 mg/L by grass filtration. A substantial portion of the remaining COD was attributed to high algal concentrations. The most effective treatment employed in this study was the one day wet-three days dry irrigation cycles. This treatment provided the necessary aerobic environment for trace metal removal from the effluent, nitrification of reduced nitrogen compounds and <b>coliform</b> <b>organism</b> elimination.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the second year of investigative and evaluative work of the University of Hawaii's Sea Grant Program project, "Quality of Coastal Waters" The general objectives of this multidisciplinary project are to identify, develop, and evaluate the critical physical, biological, and rational parameters needed in formulating effective policies, institutions, and systems for protecting the quality of coastal waters in Hawaii. To this end, the attainment of eight specific objectives is assigned to faculty specialists participating in the 14 activities which comprise the Project. These specialists also assist the Principal Investigator in planning the work and in interpreting the results. Research activities for the project year consisted principally of field and laboratory studies of coastal waters initiated in the first project year but with increased emphasis on biota and sediment. Assistance was rendered to the State Department of Health in the revision and updating of the State Water Quality Standards. Kahana Bay was selected for study as a coastal water area under the influence of relatively undeveloped land. Land contribution of nutrients to the bay via Kahana Stream and all nonpoint routes was found to be small despite the perennial nature of the surface and subsurface discharges. However, the nitrogen and phosphorus levels measured for Kahana Bay waters and in the contiguous open ocean water exceeded the levels allowed under its state Class AA water classification. <b>Coliform</b> <b>organism</b> concentrations met the Class A rather than Class AA standards. Thus, the Kahana Bay water quality tends to satisfy the Class A standard rather than the Class AA standard. Heavy metals, especially lead, copper, zinc, chromium, and nickel, appeared consistently and within a range of a few to a few hundred ppm in the bay sediments, stream sediments, and watershed soils. The ubiquitous nature of their presence is related to the parent rocks from which the soils and sediment are derived. However, mercury and cadmium were only occasionally detected in the sediments and when detected, occurred at only within a range of a fraction of to a few parts per million. DDT was detected in the range of a few parts per trillion in the Kahana Bay sediment together with only periodically detected and very low levels of dieldrin, DDE, a and y chlordane. In the Kahana Bay water both heavy metals and DDT were detected but only at levels similar to open ocean water, i. e., a fraction of, or a few parts per billion for the heavy metals, and only a few parts per trillion for DDT. The project's approach to revealing the effects of urban land development is selection of single predominant type of urbanization of land to reveal the cause-effect relation. Recreational use of coastal land and water in and domestic urban use of water and the abutting land in Hawaii Kai Marina and east Maunalua Bay furnish such situations. Domestic sewage is collected and removed from the areas. Investigative results for the Hawaii Kai area and Maunalua Bay showed a general trend to improvement in water quality from the marina to the near-ocean bay waters. Nitrogen levels in the bay and only the near-ocean station were within the Class A state standard by which the water bodies are classified but phosphorus levels exceeded the standard elsewhere. All heavy metals were consistently present in the coastal sediments in the parts per million level. The levels of the ubiquitous pesticides analyzed, DDT, dieldrin, and PCP, (the latter is used primarily for termite control in house construction), were at least one order of magnitude higher than in the Kahana Bay sediments, thus reflecting intensive urban activities associated with a relatively new and growing residential development. In the Hawaii Kai Marina and coastal waters, heavy metals were detected in the usual minimal parts per billion level as in open ocean water, and DDT, dieldrin and PCP were in the usual parts per trillion range. A turbid water plume in Maunalua Bay was occasionally identified and apparently was related to currents and roiling bottom sediments rather than any liquid discharge. A biota study of the bay waters was completed and detailed. Coastal water quality data obtained for the Mamala Bay waters off in support of a conjunctive study by Chave for the Corps of Engineers and coliform monitoring by the Department of Health are reported. in general the data satisfied state requirements for Class A waters except for phosphorus. Coral abundance was generally less toward Diamond Head than toward Ala Wai Canal. which is the only major drainage canal intercepting the surface runoff from the valleys and discharging into coastal waters. From the findings, there is little evidence which would attribute any specific water quality effect solely to the presence of intense recreational activity at Sandy Beach represents a rather complex situation and departs from the project approach: the open ocean coast beach being popular, the land use changing from rural and undeveloped to residential urban development, and above all, the coastal water receiving treated domestic effluent. Shoreline water quality data were obtained to complement the studies undertaken by the consulting firm of Sunn, Low, Tom, and Hara, and the routine monitoring by the State Health Department. Results for the project area showed clear shoreline water similar to but with higher nutrients than Kahana Bay water and the state Class A standard Levels. However, the study by the consulting firm of the offshore condition adjacent to the Hawaii Kai sewer outfall showed that there is little significant effect to the coastal water and benthos from the discharge of treated wastewater off Sandy Beach. A baseline survey of benthic biota, particularly coral and micromollusc abundance and diversity, and fish was performed for Kailua Bay, the proposed Mokapu outfall site, and the existing Kailua sewer outfall. While the greatest abundance and species diversity of the fish were not near the outfall, the highest standing crop of micromolluscs is near the outfall. The occurrence of micromolluscs is comparable with the patterns in other areas of similar depth and substrate. Nonpoint discharge studies of sugarcane production and milling wastes were continued but at a reduced scale on Kauai. Observations of mill waste discharge and coastal water, sediments, and biota were made {{both before and after the}} 90 -year old Kilauea Sugar Company closed down its operations in north Kauai in 1971. Untreated mill wastes were found to be the major contributing factor to the presence of coliforms, sediments, trash, and bagasse. The effect was largely an extensive visible plume in the coastal waters and debris in both the water and on the beach. Sediments, rather than water, harbored most of the nutrients, heavy metals, and pesticides in the ocean. DDT, although not used by the sugarcane industry, was present in small amounts in all wastes and sediments. Herbicides used in sugarcane culture did not appear in coastal waters. A striking aesthetic improvement of the coastal water and the beach quickly followed the cessation of mill waste discharge. Coastal water qualities continued to improve: phosphorus decreased to better than Class AA standards, DDT and PCP were detectable only at parts per trillion level. The rapid improvement is attributed to both the cessation of mill waste discharge and the heavy sea. Beach and ocean sediments continue to harbor about the same level of heavy metals but contain a much decreased amount of nutrients. Fish have reappeared rapidly since 1973. No apparent changes in micromolluscs have been observed since the cessation of mill operation. Tentative conclusions of the continued Kilauea investigative studies are: no evidence of eutrophication in coastal water, adverse effects of discharge mostly transitory, and epibenthic communities more influenced by waves, currents, and coastal topography than by mill waste discharge. Studies were continued in south Kauai to assess the effect of changed operation practices by the McBryde Sugar Company subsequent to an EPA survey of coastal waters of the area in 1968. Company practices demonstrate that it is possibze to operate milzing operations without discharge to the ocean, and to prevent irrigation tailwater overflows except flooding due to intense rainfall. At the time of reporting, the coastal waters of Wahiawa Bay showed an anomalously high nitrogen content while no pesticide residues were found in the offshore water except for the one to two parts per trillion DDT which seems to be present everywhere. Evaluative summaries were detailed for several key quality parameters in water and sediment. Heavy metals were ubiquitous and in parts per million range in coastal sediment in Hawaii. This suggests that if standards for the level of heavy metals in dredge spoil were to be set, care should be taken not to fix unrealistic levels that cannot possibly be attained. In the coastal waters, heavy metals also occur but only in the parts per billion range, a level quite comparable to the level in ocean water. Conjunctive studies of mercury uptake in an aquatic food chain from the water and sediment were continued and detailed. Of the insecticides, the presence of DDT in sediments is ubiquitous. In Maunalua Bay and Hawaii Kai sediments, dieldrin, and a and y chlordane are found frequently and with highest concentration in the Low parts per billion range. Their occurrence may be attributed to prior and current continous use of these chemicals in the abutting land area and the poor sediment circulation within the Hawaii Kai Marina. In coastal waters insecticides were generally undetectable or at only a few parts per trillion. PCP, like DDT, seems to occur ubiquitously. Herbicide residues in West Loch of Pearl Harbor and Kaiaka Bay were studied. Atrazine and ametryne do not appear to be a problem, however, because of its persistence in soils, diuron can be found in coastal sediments because eroded agricultural soils are transported with storm runoff. Kahana Bay water contains about the lowest amounts of nutrients in coastal waters. The state standards for nitrogen and phosphorus were exceeded in all areas except for Kilauea, in the case of nitrogen, and McBryde, in the case of phosphorus. The use of mircomolluscs as an indicator organism was reported with a differentiation noted in species between coastal areas affected primarily by silting compared to areas affected primarily by nutrient input. In the former situation Bittium zebrum becomes the major fauna component and standing crops and diversity values are conspicuously depressed. In the latter case, the community changes towards dominance by suspension feeding forms which depend on primary productivity of the water columns. Also associated strongly with silted reef flats is Obtortio pupoides. The responses of an ecosystem to land-generated effects are changes in structure from a grazing herbivore environment with associated frondose algae to either a rubble associated ecosystem with few species or to a eutrophic state with many suspension feeders and Low diversity. The principal changes in institutional arrangements noted in the project year are those resulting from the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments PL 92 - 500. The effects of this legislation will be far-reaching and result in changes which include: new discharge permit requirements, reporting of operating and monitoring results for wastewater treatment facilities, a minimum requirement level of secondary treatment for municipal wastewaters, and industrial waste treatment effluent guidelines. The full impact of these and other changes is not yet apparent although some delays have incurred in regulatory actions and attempts to implement legislation.

As as a samples were used three species for our most consumed fish. As a sample was used three samples of fish meat from three different shops and for the samples was used two storage temperatures. Other were four samples of smoked fish. The obtained results were compared, with the now invalid, Decree No. 132 / 2004 Coll. and Commision regulation (ES) No. 2073 / 2005. Based on the obtained results it can be stated that there was statistically significant difference in the total nummer of microorganisms, <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> and E. coli between stores. It also was not statistically significant difference in the total nummer of microorganisms, <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> and E. coli selected storage temperatures between 4 °C and 8 °C. The highest total nummer of microorganisms in smoked fish was detected in a sample of sprat in the amout of 6, 67 log CFUg- 1. The highest nummer of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> in the sample was also sprat in the amount of 5, 02 log CFUg- 1. E. coli was detected in smoked fish with only one sample, the sample smoked bream in an amount of 2, 03 log CFUg- 1. Composition of the microflora in fish muscle is influenced by many factors. Every organism requires different conditions for their growth. These conditions must be known to the exclusion of undesirable microorganisms from food...|$|R

A dual substrate membrane filtration medium was developed to detect coliforms and E. coli on the same membrane filter, constituting a highly cost-effective method without the need for extensive confirmatory tests. The medium was evaluated with a number of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> and simulated chlorine-stressed contaminated water samples. The intense fluorescence of coumarin-based molecules has enabled them to be incorporated into enzyme-based tests for the quantitative assay of indicator bacteria. Several novel derivatives were evaluated in this study and were found to be more promising than the commercially available cournarin giving a combination of greater fluorescence over a broad pH range and reduced growth inhibition with representative coliform strains On conversion to 13 -galactoside derivatives, the substrates were evaluated and incorporated into a miniaturised broth assay format, based on most probable number (MPN). The chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates described here have been evaluated and have shown their potential as powerful tools in diagnostic microbiology, utilising specific enzymatic activities of conforms, either in addition to or in place of standard methodologies...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} methods {{available}} for demonstration of enterococci contained in samples of foods and for determination of their numbers by {{the table of}} M. P. N. The author undertook a study of basic problems involved {{in one of the}} methods by which the numbers of enterococci are determined {{on the basis of the}} result of incubation of the culture of a confirmative medium which has been inoculated with the culture of a presumptive medium generally used to reveal the presence of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms.</b> The results of the study are summarized as follows: (1) Enterococci of some strains are easily affected by sodium azide; if samples examined for enterococci contain them in minute amounts, multiplication of the micro-organisms would be inhibited. In order to obtain an accurate and reliable result, any inhibitor should not be added to the presumptive medium so that all varieties of enterococci may be allowed to multiply. (2) Experiments revealed that, when lactose broth was used as the presumptive medium, and a medium made by adding 0. 03 % sodium azide and 0. 00006 % ethyl violet to dextrose broth was used as the confirmative medium, the result was far better than would have been the case if any other methods had been used. The presence of enterococci was proved by morphologic and taxonomic study in nearly all the tubes which had been found positive by the above tests. We might, therefore, be justified in doing without morphologic and taxonomic study in some instances. (3) The method developed by the author makes it possible to carry on the experiments on enterococci side by side with those on <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> at the same time; lactose broth is used as the presumptive medium for the two types of organisms, while brilliant green bile lactose broth and B. T. B. ethyl violet azide dextrose broth (Miyabayashi) are used as the confirmative media for <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> and enterococci, respectively; and the final examinations are performed by the method specific to each type of organisms. It is to the credit of this method that both enterococci and <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> could be examined at the same time using the same specimens, and that little technical complexity is involved in the procedure...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The organisms whose {{antibacterial}} {{powers are}} to be investigated are grown in parallel streaks on cellophan superposed on an agar plate. The cellophan is stripped off and the test organisms are streaked on the sterile agar surface thereby revealed, a t right angles to the first streaks. After incubation, growth of the test organisms will be interrupted in those areas in which an inhibitor has diffused through the cellophan from the first organisms. There are some limitations {{in the application of}} the method. During some recent work (Heatley & Florey, 1946) a strain of Bact. coEi (Escherichia coli) was found to produce an antibiotic which inhibited some <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> a t a very high dilution, other <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> being unaffected. Examination of a number of other strains of Bact. coli (M. A. Jennings, unpublished) showed that a few of them also formed antibiotics which were highly specific in the same way, inhibiting some strains of coliforms but not others, but differing from each other and from the first inhibitor examined in regard to the particular strains against which they were active...|$|R
40|$|Samples of blended mutton {{tissue in}} small {{polyvinyl}} chloride sachets were incubated in water baths for {{different times and}} at varying temperatures. The temperature of each bath was recorded accurately throughout each experiment. Using equations previously derived for the lag and generation times of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> in blended mutton tissue, the expected increases of these bacteria were calculated from the time/temperature recordings. These were compared with the data obtained from plate counts made on the tissue samples in the sachets before and after incubation. The studies were done with a strain of Escherichia coli, one of Salmonella typhimurium and the <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> naturally present on sheep carcasses processed in a commercial abattoir. The calculated growth agreed closely with that measured. Therefore, if mutton, after overnight chilling, is warmed again to temperatures within the growth range of these bacteria, the possible increases {{in the numbers of}} cells present can be calculated directly from time and temperature measurements. The implications for the present codes of practice in abattoirs are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In a multi-laboratory trial, minerals-modified {{glutamate}} medium (MMGM) {{was compared}} with lauryl tryptose lactose broth (LTLB) in the multiple tube method for the enumeration of <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms,</b> including Escherichia coli, in water. Samples of raw and chlorinated waters yielded {{a total of}} 2313 positive tube-reactions with MMGM and 2174 with LTLB. These were interpreted either as E. coli; other coliform organisms; or as false positive reactions. The results at first reading (18 or 24 h) and at 48 h have been analysed statistically in terms of (i) most probable numbers of coliform organisms; (ii) positive reactions and their interpretation; and (iii) {{whether or not the}} sample yielded any E. coli or other <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms.</b> All three analyses indicated the same trends. For the detection of E. coli in raw waters LTLB was better than MMGM at 18 - 24 h, but MMGM was better at 48 h with waters containing small numbers of coliform organisms; for raw waters with greater numbers of organisms, both media performed equally well. Analysis of a subset of samples read at both 18 and 24 h indicated that the superiority of LTLB over MMGM with raw waters disappeared by 24 h. For chlorinated waters, LTLB yielded more positive gas reactions at 18 - 24 h, but fewer of these were E. coli than with MMGM; at 48 h MMGM was clearly better than LTLB for total <b>coliform</b> <b>organisms</b> including E. coli [...] especially if the numbers were small. MMGM therefore remains the medium of choice for the detection of E. coli as an indicator of faecal contamination of chlorinated drinking water supplies.
