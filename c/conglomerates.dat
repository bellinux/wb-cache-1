5|$|The {{top five}} <b>conglomerates</b> in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous <b>conglomerates</b> lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other <b>conglomerates</b> struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing <b>conglomerates</b> for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving <b>conglomerates</b> to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E

50|$|Because a <b>conglomerate</b> merger is {{one between}} two {{strategically}} unrelated firms, {{it is unlikely}} that the economic benefits will be generated for the target or the bidder. As such, <b>conglomerate</b> mergers seldom occur today. However, <b>conglomerate</b> mergers were popular in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s. Many <b>conglomerate</b> mergers are divested shortly after they are completed.|$|R

There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
50|$|Metaconglomerate is a rock type which {{originated}} from <b>conglomerate</b> after undergoing metamorphism. <b>Conglomerate</b> is easily identifiable by the pebbles or larger clasts in {{a matrix of}} sand, silt, or clay. Metaconglomerate looks similar to <b>conglomerate,</b> although sometimes the clasts are deformed. The cement matrix of <b>conglomerate</b> is not as durable as the grains, and hence when broken, <b>conglomerate</b> breaks around the grains. Metaconglomerate, however, breaks through the grains, as the cement has recrystallized and may be as durable as the clasts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sandy <b>conglomerate</b> {{reservoir}} has {{the characteristics}} of poor sorting, complex pore structure, heterogeneity, and so sandy <b>conglomerate</b> oil layer is difficult to identify. In this paper, based on symmetrical effective medium conductance theory and poor sorting of grains of sandy <b>conglomerate,</b> a symmetrical effective medium resistivity model for sandy <b>conglomerate</b> reservoir is established by dividing sandy <b>conglomerate</b> reservoir into three components, including a non-conductive matrix, gas and water. The log data is processed and interpreted with the proposed model, and the interpretation result compared with gas production test data. It shows that the model is applicable to evaluate the fluid property of sandy <b>conglomerate</b> reservoirs...|$|R

50|$|The Roxbury <b>Conglomerate</b> {{comprises}} {{the lower part}} of the Boston Bay Group, which is a 5,000-meter-thick (3 miles) sequence of sedimentary rocks that fill the Neoproterozoic Boston Basin in eastern Massachusetts. The upper part of the Boston Bay Group consists of the Cambridge Argillite, which overlies the Roxbury <b>Conglomerate.</b> The Roxbury <b>Conglomerate</b> traditionally has been subdivided into three subdivisions; (1.) basal Brookline Member (<b>conglomerate</b> and sandstone), (2.) medial Dorchester Member (mostly sandstone with minor <b>conglomerate)</b> and (3.) upper Squantum Member (largely diamictite). However, these three subdivisions of the Roxbury <b>Conglomerate</b> complexly interfinger with each other and lack the simple layer-cake distribution that past studies have described.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we sought}} to {{theoretically}} explain the phenomenon of <b>conglomerate</b> companies in emerging markets. <b>Conglomerate</b> companies in emerging markets are mostly family owned. There are four generations of <b>conglomerate</b> companies. Currently the most numerous is the fourth and third-generation of <b>conglomerate</b> companies, observed by the lifetime. In addition, we have established the main factors that influence the development and strengthening of the competitive position of the <b>conglomerate</b> companies in emerging markets. In addition, {{we found out that}} the <b>conglomerate</b> companies in their business operations apply the strategy of broad diversification. Accordingly, we have determined that the application of modern strategies of business diversification affects the creation of optimal diversification and strengthening of <b>conglomerate</b> companies’ competitive advantage in emerging markets.

5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, <b>conglomerates,</b> coal, and limestone.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} the Miocene Ukan Formation, {{sporadically}} distributed in Ukan-cho, Okayama prefecture, from a viewpoint of analysis of lithology and molluscan assemblages. The Ukan Formation is lithostratigraphically divided into the Suzuoka <b>Conglomerate,</b> Yamagata Muddy Sandstone, Shimoyokomi Sandstone and <b>Conglomerate,</b> Azechi Sandstone and <b>Conglomerate,</b> Tsuneyama Siltstone Members in ascending order. The following 6 molluscan assemblages are recognized. The lower four members and the last member is correlative to the Lower Sandstone and Upper Shale Formation of the Bihoku Group, respectively judging from lithology and fauna. The temporal chages of the above mentioned molluscan assemblages represents that gradual deeping of sea during the depositional period from the Suzuoka <b>Conglomerate</b> and Yamagata Muddy Sandstone Members to the Azechi Sandstone and <b>Conglomerate</b> Member via the Shimoyokomi Sandstone and <b>Conglomerate</b> Member, and abrupt deeping of sea seems to have happened between the Azechi Sandstone and <b>Conglomerate</b> Member and the Tsuneyame Siltstone Member...|$|R
50|$|The Schunemunk puddingstone, {{which is}} exposed {{extensively}} on Bearfort Mountain, Boonton, Rockaway Township and Schunemunk Mountain, is a <b>conglomerate</b> {{that is part}} of a 3,000 ft thick geologic formation formally known as the Skunnemunk <b>Conglomerate.</b> This puddingstone is a distinctive, Late Devonian, grayish-purple to grayish-red, thin to very thick-bedded, cross-bedded, <b>conglomerate.</b> Within the Skunnemunk <b>Conglomerate,</b> it is interbedded with grayish-purple to grayish-red sandstone, thin-bedded, medium-gray sandstone, and greenish-gray and grayish-red shale with mudcracks. This <b>conglomerate</b> consists of pebbles and cobbles of white vein quartz, red and green quartzite, sandstone, red and gray chert, and red shale. The grayish-purple to grayish-red <b>conglomerate</b> and sandstone is cemented largely by hematite and microcrystalline quartz. The cobbles that it contains range in size from 2.5 in to 6.5 in. Pieces of Skunnemunk <b>Conglomerate</b> are easy to recognize and have been found in glacial deposits throughout the lower Hudson Valley region.|$|R
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting <b>conglomerates,</b> sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the <b>conglomerates</b> to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
