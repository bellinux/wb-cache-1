40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationships among the computer self-efficacy beliefs, introduction to <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> scores and academic achievements of teacher candidates enrolled in Atatürk Teacher’s Academy during 2007 - 08 academic years. 143 teacher candidates participated in the study. Computer self-efficacy beliefs of the teacher candidates in this study were measured by a scale developed by Aşkar and Umay (2001). The academic achievement and introduction to <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> scores of the teacher candidates were gathered from the Registrar’s office at Atatürk Teacher’s Academy. The mean scores of the computer self-efficacy beliefs of the male teacher candidates were higher, their academic achievement and introduction to <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> scores were lower compared to the female teacher candidates. There was not any significant correlation among the teacher candidates’ computer self-efficacy beliefs with academic achievement and introduction to <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> scores. But there was a positive correlation between the teacher candidates’ academic achievement and introduction to <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> scores...|$|R

It {{has been described}} as Chicago’s [...] "most significant symbol of the cultural heritage of the Chinese". That same year, the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) bought the building from the government for $1.4 million. The CCUC now uses the newly named Pui Tak Center to host religious, community, and educational programs such as family literacy classes, music programs, <b>computer</b> <b>courses,</b> and youth activities, with English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL) being the Center's largest program. Recent Chinese immigrants can also visit the Center for assistance with everyday needs. Serving approximately 2,500 new immigrants annually, the Center's annual $1.5million operating budget is partially funded by state and local government grants and private donations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the effect of Augmented Reality and QR Code Integration on achievements and views of undergraduate students taking <b>computer</b> <b>course.</b> Study group of the research included 50 voluntary students taking compulsory <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> studying {{in the department of}} Guidance and Psychological Counseling at Near East University. Experimental research design was used in the study. In the beginning of the term, students were seperated into two groups including experimental and control group consisting of 25 students in each group. Pre-test was administered to the two groups in the first lecture and lecture was given with traditional methods, computer features were defined and functions of computer features were explained to the 1 st group. Three-dimensional images of hardware features in the hardware chapter of <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> were explained through augmented reality and QR technology in laboratory environment with computer, projection and voice systems to the 2 nd group. Students examined computer hardware with QR code cards and augmented reality technology during the lecture from their own mobile devices and all lectures were given by this way {{until the end of the}} semester. At the end of the term, post-test was administered to the experimental and control group and a questionnaire related with augmented reality and <b>computer</b> hardware <b>course</b> application with QR code integration was also applied to the experimental group. Results obtained from the study revealed that achievement level of experimental group is higher. In this context, results showed that <b>computer</b> hardware <b>course</b> application with augmented reality and QR code integration has a positive effect on academic achievements of students and students have positive views towards this course. Based on the results, it is expected that method used in this study might contribute to the integration of technology into education and therefore technology and education could support each other...|$|R
40|$|Starting in 2001 a {{group of}} faculty at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee School of Architecture and Urban Planning {{undertook}} a three year effort to integrate introductory studio with introductory computer-aided design. Each year 160 incoming sophomores begin their first design studio. They also receive a laptop computer and begin concurrent enrollment in an introductory <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> entitled Virtual Modelling. Students participate in studio projects, computer assignments, hand drawing tutorials, <b>computer</b> tutorials, studio <b>course</b> lectures and <b>computer</b> <b>course</b> lectures. This takes the dedicated effort of four faculty members and five graduate teaching assistants. The goals of this paper are 1) to describe the evolution of this large-scale integration effort, 2) to identify key success factors, and 3) to describe the impact on our studentsi beginning design education. The paper provides a balanced perspective by discussing both benefits and challenges. It begins with more concrete information and moves gradually into deeper issues...|$|R
