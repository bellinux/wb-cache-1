40|$|Impending Smart Grid {{environment}} can offer innovative solutions to alleviate network congestion through efficient network management. This paper proposes a <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> based Smart Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) pricing mechanism to provide efficient pricing signal to users for mitigating network congestion. Considering that future smart meters would measure user's coincident peak demand, the user is offered a <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> based Smart Pricing signal in a LRIC pricing framework. The proposed approach is applied on 22 -bus practical Indian reference network. Users connected {{at the various}} nodes face network charges based on their <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> to each upstream asset. The results encourage users to modify their consumption pattern, and reduce their coincidence to network peak usage...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized formulation {{to determine the}} optimal. operating strategy of industrial cogeneration schemes. The model includes both electrical and thermal systems. All types of cogeneration equipment viz steam turbines, gas turbines, diesel generators, steam boilers, waste heat recovery boilers, and steam header configuration, with grid connection are separately represented {{in terms of their}} characteristics so that the model has the flexibility to be applicable for any industry. The model is multiperiod and nonlinear in nature and utilizes Newton based algorithm for minimizing the total operating cost. Optimal operating strategies for different equipment combinations for a typical industrial configuration under different electricity tariff rates are determined using the proposed model. The results show that industrial cogeneration has a significant potential in reducing peak <b>coincident</b> <b>demand.</b> The optimal response of cogeneration plant reduces the peak <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> by 42. 8 MW (71 %) under flat tariff and 54 MW (90 %) under TOU tariff. The industry gets 16 % saving in the total. operating cost with the optimal operation of the cogeneration plant. When power export is permitted to grid, it provides the utility a peak saving of 63. 7 MW...|$|E
40|$|Cogeneration {{systems have}} proved to be a good choice for {{decentralized}} power generation in sites of coincident electrical and thermal loads. However, site electrical and thermal demands can vary substantially with the hour of the day, which makes cogeneration systems achieve a high energy utilization factor (EUF) at hours of high <b>coincident</b> <b>demands,</b> and a low EUF at hours of small <b>coincident</b> <b>demands.</b> In designing such a system, energy supplied by different prime movers should be compared with energy demands, in order to choose the best option. Thermal systems simulation is a useful design tool which helps assess the economical feasibility of different possible cogeneration systems. In this paper, a computational hourly profile simulation methodology that combines curve fittings from literature and manufacturers' data with mathematical representations of physical phenomena is used to predict the performance of one given cogeneration configuration with two different engines, one naturally aspirated and the other turbocharged...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − This work {{proposes a}} method that allows the remote {{measurement}} of the electric power demand of clusters consisting {{of a small group}} of consumers that are connected to a line section of the distribution network and concentrated in an electricity pole. The method is based on the detection of the electrical current and voltage changes at both ends of a distribution line section, and then computing the demand of the clusters. Due to the statistical nature of the electricity consumption, <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> steps of the users can cause some error that can be considered as noise perturbing the measurement signal. The measurement error characteristics are predicted through simulation. The obtained results show that the new technique can be an efficient tool to reduce technical and non-technical losses in the electricity distribution network...|$|E
40|$|The City of Austin is {{studying}} the impact of solar water heaters on summer peak electric demand. One passive and two active solar water heating systems were in-stalled on city-owned commercial buildings which had electric water heaters in 1985 and have been monitored for two years. A method has been developed to determine the peak demand reduction attributable to the solar systems. Results show that solar water heating systems are capable of large demand reductions {{as long as there}} is a large hot water demand to displace. The average noncoincident demand reduction (during the water heater's peak output) ranged from 0. 8 to 5. 8 kilowatts per system. However, the <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> reduction during the utility peak demand period was 0. 3 to 0. 8 kilowatts per system. Thus, a critical factor when assessing the benefit to the electric utility is the time of hot water demand...|$|E
40|$|Mini steel-plants in India, using electric-arc {{furnaces}} for steel manufacturing, {{are highly}} energy intensive. In {{the context of}} increasing electricity prices {{and the introduction of}} time varying electricity rates by utilities, mini steel-plants can reschedule their operations to reduce their electricity bills. This paper presents a load model, which incorporates the characteristics of batch-type loads common to any type of process industry. The model is coupled with an optimisation formulation utilising integer programming for minimising the total electricity-cost satisfying production, process flow and storage constraints for different tariff structures. The methodology proposed can be used for determining the optimal response for any industry under time varying tariffs. The case study of a steel plant shows that significant reductions in peak-period demand (about 50 %) and electricity cost (about 5. 7 %) are possible with optimal-load schedules. The utility can also get significant reduction in the peak <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> if large industries optimally reschedule their productions in response to time-of-use (TOU) tariff.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{capacity}} value {{is widely used}} to quantify the contribution of additional generation (most notably renewables) within generation adequacy assessments. This paper surveys the existing probability theory of assessment of the capacity value of additional generation, and discusses the available statistical estimation methods for risk measures which depend on the joint distribution of demand and available additional capacity (with particular reference to wind). Preliminary results are presented on assessment of sampling uncertainty in hindcast LOLE and capacity value calculations, using bootstrap resampling. These results indicate strongly that, if the hindcast calculation is dominated by extremes of demand minus wind, there is very large sampling uncertainty in the results due to very limited historic experience of high <b>demands</b> <b>coincident</b> with poor wind resource. For meaningful calculations, some form of statistical smoothing will therefore be required in distribution estimation. Comment: Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems conference, Istanbul.

40|$|Analysis of {{comprehensive}} smart grid technology applications at 200 {{of the largest}} US utilities shows potential smart grid savings of 115, 145 MegaWatts (MW) with avoided costs of more than $ 120 billion and net savings after smart grid costs of $ 48 billion. This study {{is the first to}} apply individual utility customer end-use hourly electric loads to evaluate smart grid costs and benefits. Data for more than 800, 000 residential and commercial utility customers in the 200 largest US utilities were applied in the study. Studies to date, including a recently released FERC analysis, rely on assumptions about elasticities and electricity pricing to estimate changes in total utility hourly loads or broad customer class aggregate hourly loads. Instead of applying the elasticity/aggregate load approach of previous approaches, this new study applies load control and pricing program impacts directly to individual customer end-use loads such as air conditioning, water heating and so on to determine utility-level impacts. The utility customer hourly load data applied in this study consists of more than 800, 000 residential and commercial utility customers records for the 200 utilities. The commercial sector is defined to include commercial, institutional and government utility customers. These utility customer records were drawn from MAISY Utility Customer Hourly Loads Databases. Commercial customers provide about one-quarter of the potential avoided cost savings or $ 31. 7 billion. Individual utility avoided cost savings range from $ 49 million to more than $ 5. 5 billion. Subracting costs of a comprehensive smart grid deployment provide net savings that range from negative savings to $ 3. 2 billion. Benefits {{of comprehensive}} smart grid systems vary widely across utilities even within individual states and depend on a complicated mix of factors including dwelling unit size, age, electric appliance holdings, demographics and so on.

40|$|Within {{the energy}} sector, {{two of the}} most tightly coupled systems are natural gas and {{electric}} power. The recent advent of cheap gas extraction technologies have only driven these systems more tightly together. Despite their interconnections, {{in many areas of the}} world these systems are operated and managed in isolation. This separation is due to a number of reasons and challenges, ranging from technological (problems involving connected systems are difficult to solve) to political and commercial (prevention of monopolies, lack of communication, market forces, etc.). However, this separation can lead to a number of undesirable outcomes, such as what the northeastern United States experienced during the winter of 2013 / 2014. In this paper, we develop approaches to address the technological reasons for separation. We consider the problem of expanding and designing coupled natural gas and electric power systems to meet increased <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> on both systems.

40|$|California {{utilities}} {{have been}} exploring {{the use of}} critical peak prices (CPP) to help reduce needle peaks in customer end-use loads. CPP {{is a form of}} price-responsive demand response (DR). Recent experience has shown that customers have limited knowledge of how to operate their facilities in order to reduce their electricity costs under CPP (Quantum 2004). While the lack of knowledge about how to develop and implement DR control strategies is a barrier to participation in DR programs like CPP, another barrier is the lack of automation of DR systems. During 2003 and 2004, the PIER Demand Response Research Center (DRRC) conducted a series of tests of fully automated electric demand response (Auto-DR) at 18 facilities. Overall, the average of the site-specific average <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> reductions was 8 % from a variety of building types and facilities. Many electricity customers have suggested that automation will help them institutionalize their electric demand savings and improve their overall response and DR repeatability. This report focuses on and discusses the specific results of the Automated Critical Peak Pricing (Auto-CPP, a specific type of Auto-DR) tests that took place during 2005, which build on the automated demand response (Auto-DR) research conducted through PIER and the DRRC in 2003 and 2004. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the technical opportunities of automating demand response and to remove technical and market impediments to large-scale implementation of automated demand response (Auto-DR) in buildings and industry. A second goal of this research is to understand and identify best practices for DR strategies and opportunities. The specific objectives of the Automated Critical Peak Pricing test were as follows: (1) Demonstrate how an automated notification system for critical peak pricing can be used in large commercial facilities for demand response (DR). (2) Evaluate effectiveness of such a system. (3) Determine how customers will respond to this form of automation for CPP. (4) Evaluate what type of DR shifting and shedding strategies can be automated. (5) Explore how automation of control strategies can increase participation rates and DR saving levels with CPP. (6) Identify optimal demand response control strategies. (7) Determine occupant and tenant response...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have had}} a number of air conditioner rebate and maintenance programs for many years. The purpose of these programs was to improve the efficiency of the stock of air conditioning equipment and provide better demand-side management. This paper examines the effect of refrigerant charging (proper servicing of the equipment), system sizing, and efficiency on the steady-state, <b>coincident</b> peak utility <b>demand</b> of a residential central air conditioning system. The study is {{based on the results of}} laboratory tests of a three-ton, capillary tube expansion, split-system air conditioner, system capacity and efficiency data available from manufacturer's literature, and assumptions about relative sizing of the equipment to cooling load on a residence. A qualitative discussion is provided concerning the possible impacts of transient operation and total energy use on utility program decisions. The analysis indicates that proper sizing of the unit is the largest factor affecting energy demand of the three factors (sizing, charging, and efficiency) studied in this paper. For typical oversizing of units to cooling loads in houses, both overcharging and undercharging showed significant negative impact on peak demand. The impacts of SEER changes in utility peak demand were found to be virtually independent of oversizing. For properly sized units, there was a small peak benefit to higher efficiency air conditioners...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references: pages 103 - 105 This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{inventory}} control. The control problem involve s determining the size and timing of purchases for inventory to satisfy a set of demand requirements. Purchases must be large enough to take advantage of quantity price discounts but not incur unwarranted holding costs. The inventory situation to be examined is classified as one of certainty in the hierarchy of inventory control problems. In this case, all factors that affect the inventory situation are known {{for the duration of the}} time period being considered. A mathematical model is formulated to simulate the inventory situation and solve for the minimum cost purchase schedule. Dynamic programming is employed to develop the algorithm which serves as the basis for the mode l. Input to inventory is assumed to occur at equidistant points in time and to be <b>coincident</b> with the <b>demand</b> for inventory. The cost of the purchase alternative s at each input point are deter. mined and the alternatives are combined into purchase schedules. Each purchase schedule is evaluated and the minimum cost schedule is selected. The preceding technique involve s many iterative steps and the resulting number of computations is quite large. For this reason, the algorithms adapted to a large scale IBM 7090 digital computer for solution and is programmed in IBM FORTRAN II program language. The cost of the computer solution is developed in terms of the problem parameters to enable the user to predict the computer time required and the resulting cost to solve a given inventory problem...|$|R
40|$|Financial systems, their institutions, {{markets and}} {{regulatory}} bodies, are constantly evolving {{in response to}} the changing dynamics of technology, politics, demographics and cultural norms. These pressures are evident in Australia today where Australia’s ageing population provides a challenge to both public resources and the financial services sector in terms of meeting the needs of this generation of ‘baby boomer’ retirees who are the healthiest and wealthiest in the nation’s history. <b>Coincident</b> with increased <b>demand</b> from the older generation is a wave of digital disruption, which provides opportunities for innovation and customisation in developing retirement solutions. This paper examines four key areas of concern for older Australians: retirement income steam products; options for managing the wealth stored in the family home; and financial aspects of providing for aged care and later life health costs. In doing so the paper explores areas of public policy and regulation, which may act as a barrier or catalyst to the private sector provision of financial products and services to assist older Australians with these challenges. The paper finds that the provision of financial services and level of innovation with respect to each of these needs varies considerably. Where retirement income steam products are concerned there has been an increased focus on post-retirement guidance and products. This should accelerate with the much-anticipated removal of regulatory barriers through the Review of Retirement Income Stream Regulation, which will open the way for products such as deferred lifetime annuities. On the other hand, current policy settings tend to impede rather than assist the development of equity release products to aid ‘asset rich, income poor’ retirees. While older Australian store around half of their wealth in the family home, policy setting provide a significant disincentive to drawing on this equity, and as a consequence, there is an evident lack of effective equity release products. Reform in the aged care sector demonstrates that a market driven, customer-centric approach, with a strong social safety net, can incentivise the private sector to participate in the provision of aged care services, although we have yet to see much innovation in financial products to assist with this potential cost. Where health services are concerned, the sheer complexity of the system, the lack of demarcation between the provision of public and private health insurance, and community rating in health insurance hinder the delivery of financial products to assist older Australians in preparing for and managing health-associated financial risks. Over time, unless these policy barriers are addressed, the financial system is unlikely to evolve to provide the full range of integrated income and wealth-based solutions needed to assist an increasingly self-reliant population of older Australians. • This paper is one of three in Stage 3 of the Australian Centre for Financial Studies (ACFS)  program: Funding Australia’s Future.  Initiated in 2012, this program aims to better understand the changing dynamics of the financial system and its impact on role in future economic growth. The first stage of the project, completed in 2013, analysed the interaction between suppliers of funds, financial sector participants, and end users throughout the economy.   The four papers from Stage 2 explored these issues further and provided valuable input to the Financial System Inquiry on how well Australia’s financial sector serves the economy (especially households and business), and how effectively it links the sources and uses of finance for the benefit of Australian society.   This third and final stage of the project, launched in January 2015, explored three specific challenges to the financial sector highlighted by the Financial System Inquiry, Tax System Review and Intergenerational Report. While quite diverse, each of the topics in stage 3 has a bearing on important issues {{for the future of the}} financial system and its role in serving the economy.   Stage Three was supported by a group of stakeholders comprising: Accenture, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Challenger Limited, IBM, Industry Super Australia, National Australia Bank, Self managed Super Fund Association and Vanguard Investments, as well as the Treasury. A key objective of this project is to ensure the papers bring together a diverse range of insights and opinions from all areas of the Australian financial services sector, however in accordance with the ACFS Code of Research Conduct, the final outcomes are independent...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of distributed generation and wind power {{in particular is}} expected to increase significantly over the coming years, and a huge shift in control, operation and planning of distribution networks is going to be necessary if this generation is to be connected in a cost effective manner. Traditionally, distribution networks have been operated as passive networks with uni-directional power flows and were designed through deterministic (load flow) studies considering the critical cases so that distribution networks could operate with a minimum amount of control. With the connection of increasing amounts of distributed generation, these networks are becoming active and with power flowing in the two directions, hence requiring more intelligent forms of management. Increasing connection of intermittent distributed generation, such as wind power, to distribution networks requires new control strategies to provide greater flexibility and use of existing network assets. Active network management (ANM) will {{play a major role in}} this and will help in facilitating connection of new generation without the need for traditional reinforcements. This thesis is based on a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF) -based technique for evaluating the maximum capacity of new intermittent distributed generation able to be connected to a distribution network when ANM control strategies are in place. The ANM schemes embedded into the OPF include coordinated voltage control, adaptive power factor, energy curtailment and demand side management. A generic U. K. medium voltage distribution network is analyzed using <b>coincident</b> <b>demand</b> and wind availability data derived from hourly time-series. Results clearly show that very high penetration levels of new variable generation capacity can be achieved by considering ANM strategies compared to the widely used passive operation (i. e., “fit and forget”). It has been shown that with coordinated voltage control (CVC) there will be a positive impact on minimizing the losses in a distribution network compared with old passive operation by around 20 %. Also active network management (ANM) can result in reducing the total average voltage deviation. The thesis has founded that the DG installed capacity can be increased by active network schemes to some extent in case of load growth...|$|E
