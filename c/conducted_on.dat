5|$|By {{detecting}} {{and tracking}} visual landmarks, {{in addition to}} estimating its position relative to the aircraft, the robot can perform a visual servoing. Research in vision is also <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A merger of information between the two methods of acquisition and laser vision is being considered. Artificial intelligence arbitrating various locations is also under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> trains {{carrying}} {{equipment to the}} front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{was part}} of this same working group which {{recommended}} that an internal NSC study be <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the overall U.S. foreign policy as it pertained to the newly developing Cold War. This classified study (declassified in 1977) called NSC-68, was the blueprint for the Truman Doctrine for containment of communism, which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Following Operation Source, {{the task}} of attacking Tirpitz was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers. Following months of preparations, a successful attack (Operation Tungsten) involving two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters was <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 3 April 1944. While Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, she was placed out of action for several additional months while repairs were completed.|$|E
5|$|Following the delay, the Space Head Module {{was removed}} from the rocket, and {{returned}} to its integration building on 22 February. Whilst it was in the integration building, daily inspections were made to ensure that the spacecraft was still functioning normally. Once the fuel issue had been resolved, the launch was rescheduled for 8 April, and launch operations resumed. On 1 April, the Space Head Module was returned to the silo, and reinstalled atop the Dnepr. Following integrated tests, the practice countdown was successfully <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 6 April.|$|E
5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 is {{a racing}} video game, {{and the fourth}} in the Forza Motorsport series.

This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the government announcement, HSA persisted with work on the P.1154.

Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.
