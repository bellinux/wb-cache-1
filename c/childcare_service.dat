5000|$|The [...] Children Act 1948 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom that {{established}} a comprehensive <b>childcare</b> <b>service.</b> It reformed the services available to deprived children, consolidating existing childcare legislation and establishing departments “in which professional {{social work practice}} would develop in child care and, in due course, in work with families.” The Act {{made it clear that}} it was the duty of local authorities to receive into care any child who was without parents or whose parents could not care for him for any reason, if it was {{in the interest of the}} child’s welfare.|$|E

40|$|Under {{the social}} {{investment}} paradigm, a child-centred investment {{strategy has been}} developed. The mainstay of such a strategy is the provision of <b>childcare</b> <b>services,</b> which are expected to increase maternal employment rates, further children's human capital and mitigate social inequalities in early life. In this article, I critically assess the child-centred investment strategy and question whether <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> in European countries are, in their current state, {{up to the task}} of producing the anticipated benefits. The argument I develop is fairly simple: in order to be effective, <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> should be provided for all social groups, and in particular for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Drawing on recent EU-SILC data, I show that in all but one country this condition is not met: <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> are often taken up at low or moderate levels, and children from low-income families use them to a much lesser extent than those from high-income families. In order to overcome these childcare deficits, countries should pursue a consistent investment strategy which entails increasing both the supply of childcare and employment opportunities for all social groups. This will require huge budgetary efforts for most member states. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|In {{discussing}} the numbers {{it is important}} to note that in 2001, more than one half of the children in the United States attended childcare facilities. This number has only increased as the number of working parents has increased. The increase in the amount of children that are required to have some sort of <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> has made childcare facilities more necessary than they have ever been. [...] The quality of childcare given by a facility is generally indicated by the center's cost of enrollment. If the center charges more for the service, it will generally provide better care to the children. Centers that charge more for their services can provide quality education, more current resources, and nicer facilities. These are all helpful when trying to educate a child academically. A higher standard for teachers, such as requiring a degree in early childhood education or a degree of the like, has shown to result in improved growth in the development of a child. The childcare system in France is a great example of this. They have two separate branches of early childhood childcare. These two separate branches are called crèche and école maternelle. Crèche is the program for infants and toddlers and école maternelle is part of the education system. They both require teacher to have a college degree and sometimes a specialized degree on top of that.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, the childcare support projects {{undertaken by}} the Korean Government {{over the past four}} years are 1) the enhancement of the access to childcare facilities, 2) the alleviation of household burden incurred from <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> expenses, and 3) the reinforcement of quality of <b>childcare</b> <b>service.</b> These three projects are childcare policy tasks pursued not only by Korea, but also commonly pursued by other nations which require childcare support policies. This paper will briefly outline projects focused on by the Government in order to accomplish these three tasks, and also examine whether these projects are bringing about the expected results, and improving or worsening childcare conditions, making use of all relevant and available data.|$|E
30|$|There is a {{claim that}} the {{self-regulation}} of childcare fees {{will contribute to the}} enhancement of <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> through competition in service, with the view that regulations on prices cause poor quality <b>childcare</b> <b>service.</b> Furthermore, since options for consumers will be expanded according {{to a wide range of}} service price options, the market for childcare will be revitalized, even contributing to the support of high-income groups. However, the adoption of a self-regulating price mechanism means that the Government will have to surrender the public nature of childcare, because the service provided for young children will be graded according to the incomes of their parents, resulting in deepening socio-economic polarization. In terms of private childcare, there is a degree of opposition to self-regulation because price competition rather than service competition is likely to cause those facilities in poor condition to be neglected.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} study conducted analyzed needs assessments from the Todd County Youth Services Center to examine needs of Todd County families. The {{study consisted of}} six variables of which included demographic information, <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> needs, basic care needs, {{health and mental health}} needs, and parent support needs.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{understand}} the unequal allocation of time by gender in Italian households,trying {{to account for the}} simultaneity of partners’ decisions as well as the issue of censored observations. For these purposes, we estimate a simultaneous equation model on the partners’ allocation of time based on the 2007 Italian Statistics on Income and Living Conditions microdata. This survey allows us to analyze the contribution of institutional factors (such as the heterogeneous distribution of <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> in Italy and labour market differences), which are particularly relevant in a country like Italy where the female labour supply differs from region to region, and the gender gap in time distribution can be affected by the heterogeneous availability of <b>childcare</b> <b>services.</b> We note that the availability of <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> represents the most relevant factor after regional unemployment, affecting women’s participatory decisions as well as their hours of paid work. This effect is tangibly higher than the effect of their own wages: consistent with the literature on the female labour supply, this is positive, yet tangibly lower than the impact of the availability of kindergartens. In the light of the negative effect on mothers’ working hours of the number of children of any age group, this phenomenon leads to calls for an increase in the availability of <b>childcare</b> <b>services</b> and better synchronization between working times and school opening times in order to increase the female labour supply...|$|R
40|$|Background: Childcare {{services}} {{represent a}} key setting to implement nutritional interventions {{to support the}} development of healthy eating behaviours in young children. Childcare-specific nutritional guidelines outlining recommendations for provision of food in care have been developed. Despite this, research suggests that few childcare services currently implement these guidelines. This study aimed to {{examine the impact of}} providing printed educational materials on <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> cooks’ intentions to use nutritional guidelines and provide fruit and vegetables on their menu. Findings: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 77 childcare services (38 control and 39 intervention). Intervention service cooks were mailed a two-page educational material together with a menu planning checklist. Intervention development and evaluation was guided by the theory of planned behaviour. Outcome data assessing intentions to use nutritional guidelines and serves of fruit and vegetables provided on menus (primary outcomes) as well as secondary outcomes (attitudes, behavioural regulation and social norms) were collected via a telephone interview with cooks. Relative to the comparison group, cooks in the intervention arm had significantly higher intentions to use the guidelines (p value 0. 0005), accompanied by significant changes in perceived behavioural control (p value 0. 0008) and attitudes (p value 0. 0071). No significant difference in serves of fruit (p value 0. 7278) and vegetables (p value 0. 0573) was observed. Conclusions: The use of educational materials can improve <b>childcare</b> <b>service</b> cooks’ intentions to use nutritional guidelines; however, as a standalone strategy, it may not improve provision of food on menus...|$|E
