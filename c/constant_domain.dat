5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> of the heavy chain or the <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} beta 2 -microglobulin, the light chain {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex class I antigens, has been determined by x-ray crystallography. An electron density map of the bovine protein was calculated at a nominal resolution of 2. 9 A by using the methods of multiple isomorphous replacement and electron density modification refinement. The molecule is approximately 45 X 25 X 20 A in size. Almost half of the amino acid residues participate in two large beta structures, one of four strands and the other of three, linked by a central disulfide bond. The molecule thus strongly resembles Ig <b>constant</b> <b>domains</b> in polypeptide chain folding and overall tertiary structure. Amino acid residues that are {{the same in the}} sequences of beta 2 -microglobulin and Ig <b>constant</b> <b>domains</b> are predominantly in the interior of the molecule, whereas residues conserved among beta 2 -microglobulins from different species are both in the interior and on the molecular surface.

5000|$|During {{thymocyte}} development, the T {{cell receptor}} (TCR) chains undergo {{essentially the same}} sequence of ordered recombination events as that described for immunoglobulins. D-to-J recombination occurs first in the β chain of the TCR. This process can involve either the joining of the Dβ1 gene segment to one of six Jβ1 segments or the joining of the Dβ2 gene segment to one of six Jβ2 segments. [...] DJ recombination is followed (as above) with Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements. All gene segments between the Vβ-Dβ-Jβ gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted and the primary transcript is synthesized that incorporates the <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> gene (Vβ-Dβ-Jβ-Cβ). mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence and allows translation of the full length protein for the TCR Cβ chain.|$|E

The µ heavy chain bears oligosaccharides at five asparagine residues. The oligosaccharides on mouse and human IgM have been partially characterized {{by a variety of}} techniques, including NMR, lectin binding, various chromatographic systems and enzymatic sensitivity (reviewed in).

5000|$|The basic {{structure}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules is a tetramer of two light chains and two heavy chains linked by disulphide bonds.

There are five types of heavy chains: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma and mu, all consisting of a variable domain (VH) and three (in alpha, delta and gamma) or four (in epsilon and mu) constant domains (CH1 to CH4). Ig molecules are highly modular proteins, in which the variable and constant domains have clear, conserved sequence patterns. The domains in Ig and Ig-like molecules are grouped into four types: V-set (variable; [...] ), C1-set (constant-1; [...] ), C2-set (constant-2; [...] ) and I-set (intermediate; [...] ).

50|$|Immunoglobulins are {{composed}} of two types of protein chain -- the heavy chain and the light chain. The heavy chains, which determine the immunoglobulin class, are of five different types, denoted by the Greek letters, µ, δ, γ, ε and α, corresponding to the classes, IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA, respectively. Light chains are of two types, denoted λ and κ. Each chain is itself divided into two functional parts, the variable (V) domain and the constant (C) domain. The V domains of the light and heavy chain are folded {{together to form a}} structure that binds antigen; different V domains bind different antigens, i.e., binding of antigen by immunoglobulin is antigen specific. Inasmuch as the V domains can occur in a nearly unlimited variety of amino acid sequences, immunoglobulins collectively have the potential of binding to virtually any molecular structure. The immunoglobulin C domains interact with other physiological components, eg cellular immunoglobulin receptors and the complement system. Thus, the <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> of an immunoglobulin can help mobilize phagocytic cells or the complement system to act on an antigen to which it is bound by via variable domain.|$|E
5000|$|Class {{switching}} occurs by {{a mechanism}} called class switch recombination (CSR) binding. Class switch recombination is a biological mechanism {{that allows the}} class of antibody produced by an activated B cell to change during {{a process known as}} isotype or class switching. During CSR, portions of the antibody heavy chain locus are removed from the chromosome, and the gene segments surrounding the deleted portion are rejoined to retain a functional antibody gene that produces antibody of a different isotype. Double-stranded breaks are generated in DNA at conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, which are upstream from gene segments that encode the constant regions of antibody heavy chains; these occur adjacent to all heavy chain constant region genes {{with the exception of the}} δ-chain. DNA is nicked and broken at two selected S-regions by the activity of a series of enzymes, including Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID), uracil DNA glycosylase and apyrimidic/apurinic (AP)-endonucleases. The intervening DNA between the S-regions is subsequently deleted from the chromosome, removing unwanted μ or δ heavy chain constant region exons and allowing substitution of a γ, α or ε constant region gene segment. The free ends of the DNA are rejoined by a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to link the variable domain exon to the desired downstream <b>constant</b> <b>domain</b> exon of the antibody heavy chain. In the absence of non-homologous end joining, free ends of DNA may be rejoined by an alternative pathway biased toward microhomology joins. [...] With the exception of the μ and δ genes, only one antibody class is expressed by a B cell at any point in time.While class switch recombination is mostly a deletional process, rearranging a chromosome in [...] "cis", it can also occur (in 10 to 20% of cases, depending upon the Ig class) as an inter-chromosomal translocation mixing immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from both alleles.|$|E
