5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. <b>Crop</b> <b>and</b> agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover.

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
