5000|$|Plants {{are known}} to be {{well-defined}} with respect to their pH tolerance, and {{only a small number of}} species thrive well under a broad range of acidity. Therefore the categorization acidophile/acidophobe is well-defined. Sometimes a complementary classification is used (calcicole/calcifuge, with <b>calcicoles</b> being [...] "lime-loving" [...] plants). In gardening, soil pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of soil, with pH=7 indicating the neutral soil. Therefore acydophobes would prefer pH above 7. Acid intolerance of plants may be mitigated by lime addition and by calcium and nitrogen fertilizers.|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} studies of the <b>calcicoles</b> Centaurea scabiosa and Leontodon hispidus, the stomata on isolated epidermis closed partially when the concentration of calcium in the medium was above 1 mol m− 3. This is a much smaller concentration than that believed to be delivered into the leaves in xylem sap when the plants are growing in a calcium-rich medium, and hence the mechanism for 'protecting' stomata from excessive exposure to free calcium {{is thought to be}} of great physiological significance. It is shown here that, in the leaves of both species, a substantial amount of the calcium they contain is located within meso-phyll cells, and virtually all of that which does enter the epidermis is contained within trichomes, probably as calcium oxalate. The amounts of calcium {{in the vicinity of the}} stomata thus remain small despite high concentrations elsewhere, ensuring that the essential role of Ca 2 + in intra-cellular signalling in guard cells can continue to be performed without disturbance...|$|R

The extinct species share many ecological similarities: they tend to be small, to grow in open habitats and to be characteristic of environments with low fertility. A disproportionate number of calcifuge species has been lost in both areas; in Middlesex, where calcareous soils are rare, many marked <b>calcicoles</b> have also been lost. In both counties the percentage extinction in the small Boreal and Oceanic groups has been greater than that in the larger phytogeographical elements. The peak periods of extinction · in Cambridgeshire have been those characterised by major agricultural change; in Middlesex they coincide with the spread of the London conurbation. The overall totals suggest that, judging by the number of extinctions, agricultural intensification is almost as damaging to the native flora as urbanisation...|$|R

40|$|Thalictrum cooleyi Ahles (Cooley’s meadowrue) is {{a federally}} endangered, {{herbaceous}} perennial found in very wet, loamy pine savannas of North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Pine savannas {{are characterized by}} palustrine hydrology and oligotrophic, acidic soils. Some rare plant species are associated with high calcium soils (<b>calcicoles).</b> An unpublished report suggested that soils associated with populations of this meadowrue have different chemistry and plant nutrient abundances than do soils where the plant is not present. Knowledge of soils and other habitat characteristics is crucial to T. cooleyi conservation. I collected soil samples near and away from T. cooleyi plants at Shaken Creek Preserve, Pender Co., NC, and had their nutrients analyzed (labs noted later). Soil with T. cooleyi present was distinctive from that lacking T. cooleyi, i. e., higher mean calcium content (719 ± 108 vs. 248 ± 33 mg/dm 3), cation exchange capacity (CEC) (6. 6 ± 0. 5 vs. 4. 5 ± 0. 3 meq/ 100 cm 3), and base saturation (60 ± 4 vs. 32 ± 3 %). Such values are characteristic of sandy, clay-based soils of the Coastal Plain, considered as relatively infertile soils. These results suggest that higher calcium content, CEC, and base saturation {{may be associated with}} the presence of Cooley’s meadowrue. I also asked whether calcium contents affect growth of T. cooleyi. In a greenhouse, I grew 57 plants in Fafard 3 B® soilless substrate mix, 19 plants in each of three treatments suggested by the literature: 1) none (control), 2) 0. 5 % (low), or 3) 2. 0 % (high) powdered calcium carbonate (CaC 03) by weight. I measured several growth responses of each plant every month for 7 mo. The mean longest leaf length, number of leaves, and total plant biomass did not differ significantly among treatments. This lack of response is not surprising, for not all plant growth metrics respond to higher calcium levels in the greenhouse, particularly in artificial soil mixes; plant response is complex and confounded. Edaphic factors other than calcium positively and negatively influence plant response, such as exposure to exchangeable aluminum, which can inhibit the growth of <b>calcicoles.</b> Pine savannas are fire-dependent communities. Fires {{are an integral part of}} the ecology of pine savannas, allowing thinning of shrubby undergrowth and of the canopy so herbaceous plants receive more light. They also elevate the availability of nutrients and mineralization in the soil (Wilbur and Christensen 1983). Whether caused by or correlated with T. cooleyi presence, chemical properties of soils, including calcium content, CEC, and base saturation, are somehow related to distribution of this endangered plant species...|$|R

We analysed the multivariate response of cereal weed assemblages (including biomass and foliar analyses) to a strong man-made soil gradient (from highly calcareous to highly acidic, nutrient-poor soils) over short distances (field scale). The soil gradient favoured a substitution of <b>calcicoles</b> by calcifuges, {{and an increase in}} abundance of pseudometallophytes, with preferences for Atlantic climate, broad geographical distribution, hemicryptophytic life form, adapted to low-nutrient and acidic soils, with lower concentrations of Ca, and very narrow range of Cu concentrations in leaves. The trends of abundance of the different ecological groups of indicator species along the soil gradient were systematically reflected in the maintenance of leaf P concentrations, and strong homeostasis in biomass N:P ratio. Using annual weed vegetation at the field scale as a fairly simple model, we demonstrated links between gradients in soil properties (pH, nutrient availability) and floristic composition that are normally encountered over large geographic distances. We showed that leaf nutrient status, in particular the maintenance of leaf P concentrations and strong homeostasis of biomass N:P ratio, underpinned a clear functional response of vegetation to mineral stress. These findings can help to understand assembly processes leading to unusual, novel combinations of species which are typically observed as a consequence of strong environmental filtering, as for instance on sites affected by industrial activities...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{grassland}} Sites of Special Scientific Interest on the Magnesian Limestone of County Durham were botanically surveyed {{using the}} methodology of the National Vegetation Classification. Both primary grasslands and grassland developed in abandoned quarries were included, but the sampling was limited to open calcicolous grassland and scrub-invaded grassland, with areas of impenetrable scrub and woodland being avoided. Characteristic of these grasslands is blue moor grass, Sesleria albicans, which reaches its southern lowland limit in County Durham. The results were analysed using multivariate techniques to reveal patterns in community composition and possible environmental factors causing this variation. Six main communities are described, comprising both grassland and scrub vegetation. A successional sequence linking these communities and their sub-communities is postulated. It is suggested that abandoned quarries are floristically different from primary grasslands, but may achieve similarity in time {{if there is a}} nearby seed source of S. albicans. Scrub invasion, mainly by hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna, is ubiquitous in both the primary and secondary grasslands and presents the major threat to the integrity of the limestone flora. The botanical survey reveals a significant change to the flora under scrub, with some of the low-growing <b>calcicoles</b> being partially replaced by tall nutrient-demanding grasses and herbaceous species. However, the invasion of willow (Salix spp.) at one of the abandoned quarries has had negligible impact on the ground flora. The two most common scrub species, hawthorn and dog rose (Rosa canina agg.) appear to have more influence on the ground flora than any other species. It is suggested that the age of these species is more important than density in altering the ground flora.
