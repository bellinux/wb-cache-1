5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} male {{is mostly a}} deep shade of <b>chestnut</b> in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the <b>chestnut</b> weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male <b>chestnut</b> sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with <b>chestnut</b> crescent markings, until the bright <b>chestnut</b> of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E

5|$|Hartlaub {{considered}} the <b>chestnut</b> sparrow's colouration and morphology to be distinct enough to allocate {{it to its}} own monotypic genus, Sorella. Although a few authors have followed Hartlaub's treatment, it is usually placed in the genus Passer. It {{is very similar to}} the two golden sparrows, from which it may have once been only clinally different. The male Arabian golden sparrow is almost entirely gold-coloured, the male <b>chestnut</b> sparrow is mostly <b>chestnut,</b> and the male Sudan golden sparrow is intermediate between the two. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen {{considered the}}se three species to be conspecific; however, the range of the Sudan golden sparrow overlaps with that of the <b>chestnut</b> sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Sudan. These species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males quiver their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in a clump of trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together.|$|E

5000|$|Liver chestnut: Silver dapples, {{especially}} bay silvers, {{are frequently}} misidentified as liver <b>chestnuts</b> or flaxen <b>chestnuts.</b> Flaxen manes and tails in <b>chestnuts</b> {{tend to have}} honey or red tones, while the pale manes and tails of silver dapples are soot-toned and darker at the roots. Liver <b>chestnuts</b> also lack the grey-brown dappling on the lower legs. The darkest liver <b>chestnuts</b> often {{have a kind of}} marbling on the lower legs, though this hair, too, should show red or yellow tones. Overall, <b>chestnuts</b> of all shades have red-yellow character to their coats, while silver bays recall grey-brown. Knowledge of the pedigree of the horse in question is often useful: two chestnut-based parents cannot produce a silver bay or silver black. DNA testing can be used in the most difficult cases.|$|R

Westbound NY31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the Inner Loop, <b>Chestnut</b> Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY31 retains to Pittsford.
