The club {{embarked}} on a successful period, led by two key players: Belgian record international Florimond Vanhalme and player-coach Louis Saeys. Cercle led the league midway through the 1925–26 season, but player injuries led to poor results that saw them finish in fifth place. Several important players left Cercle after this season, leaving hopes low for the 1926–27 campaign, but the year saw Cercle achieve their second national championship on the penultimate matchday with a thrilling 5–6 win over Daring Bruxelles. The victory was overshadowed by two deaths at the club a few months earlier: Albert Van <b>Coile,</b> who had succumbed from injuries sustained in a match against US Tourcoing, and former chairman René de Peellaert, who died from pneumonia which he had caught during Van Coile's funeral.|$|E

6000|$|Or again, if {{you ever}} go up Deeside in Scotland, towards Balmoral, and turn up Glen Muick, towards Alt-na-guisach, of which you may see a picture in the Queen's last book, you will observe {{standing}} on your right hand, just above Birk Hall, three pretty rounded knolls, which they call the <b>Coile</b> Hills. You may easily know them by their being covered with beautiful green grass instead of heather. That {{is because they are}} made of serpentine or volcanic rock, which (as you have seen) often cuts into beautiful red and green marble; and which also carries a very rich soil because it is full of magnesia. If you go up those hills, you get a glorious view--the mountains sweeping round you where you stand, {{up to the top of}} Lochnagar, with its bleak walls a thousand feet perpendicular, and gullies into which the sun never shines, and round to the dark fir forests of the Ballochbuie. That is the arc of the bow; and the cord of the bow is the silver Dee, more than a thousand feet below you; and in the centre of the cord, where the arrow would be fitted in, stands Balmoral, with its Castle, and its Gardens, and its Park, and pleasant cottages and homesteads all around. And when you have looked at the beautiful amphitheatre of forest at your feet, and looked too at the great mountains to the westward, and Benaun, and Benna-buird and Benna- muicdhui, with their bright patches of eternal snow, I should advise you to look at the rock on which you stand, and see what you see there. And you will see that on the side of the Coiles towards Lochnagar, and between the knolls of them, are scattered streams, as it were, of great round boulder stones--which are not serpentine, but granite from the top of Lochnagar, five miles away. And you will see that the knolls of serpentine rock, or at least their backs and shoulders towards Lochnagar, are all smoothed and polished till they are as round as the backs of sheep, [...] "roches moutonnees," [...] as the French call ice-polished rocks; and then, if you understand what that means, you will say, as I said, [...] "I am perfectly certain that this great basin between me and Lochnagar, which is now 3000 feet deep of empty air was once filled up with ice to the height of the hills on which I stand--about 1700 feet high--and that that ice ran over into Glen Muick, between these pretty knolls, and covered the ground where Birk Hall now stands." ...|$|E

50|$|Van <b>Coile</b> is {{especially}} remembered by the Cercle Brugge fans {{because he is}} the only player who died because of injuries sustained in a Cercle Brugge match. During a tournament in Tourcoing, Van <b>Coile</b> was playing as centre forward by occasion. In the match against US Tourcoing, he collided with the local goalkeeper. Van <b>Coile</b> suffered no visible injuries, but when his situation deteriorated the day after the match, doctors discovered a tear in his bowels. A speedy operation had no result. Van <b>Coile</b> died 4 April.|$|E

50|$|PIX was {{originally}} conceived in early 1994 by John Mayes of Redwood City, California and designed and coded by Brantley <b>Coile</b> of Athens, Georgia. The PIX name {{is derived from}} its creators' aim of creating the functional equivalent of an IP PBX to solve the then-emerging registered IP address shortage. At a time when NAT was just being investigated as a viable approach, they wanted to conceal a block or blocks of IP addresses behind a single or multiple registered IP addresses, much as PBXs do for internal phone extensions. When they began, RFC 1597 and RFC 1631 were being discussed, but the now-familiar RFC 1918 {{had not yet been}} submitted.|$|E
50|$|Brantley <b>Coile,</b> who {{had written}} the code for the PIX {{firewall}} for NTI and later Cisco, started coding of the LocalDirector very shortly after this meeting. As {{a result of the}} NTI acquisition by Cisco Systems in late 1995, Brantley hired a team of four long-time associates who were developers: Richard Howes, now at Steelbox Networks, and Pete Tenereillo worked for NTI prior to the Cisco acquisition, and Jim Jordan and Tom Bohannon, also at SteelBox, were hired immediately after the acquisition. Together the four developed the code for the Finesse OS and LocalDirector (Finesse was also used in the Cisco version of the PIX). The majority of the LocalDirector code was shared with the early PIXes.|$|E
50|$|Word of {{a planned}} {{confrontation}} {{appears to have been}} widespread well before it took place, even being gossiped about by militia-men stationed Dublin and Westport. Catholic Bernard <b>Coile,</b> from Lurgan, County Armagh, who had rose to become a merchant in the linen industry, called upon the local two parishes to agree to a non-aggression pact. This appears to have succeeded in regards to the Lurgan area, were no Lurgan men were amongst the combatants. There would also seem to have been adequate time for preparations, with one County Tyrone militia-man sending home a guinea to purchase a musket for the Defenders, and Peep o' Day Boys scouring Moy, County Tyrone for gunpowder.|$|E
50|$|Cadder (Scottish Gaelic: <b>Coile</b> Dobhair) is a {{district}} {{of the town}} of Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, Scotland. It is located 7 km north of Glasgow city centre, 0.5 km south of the River Kelvin, and approximately 1.5 km north-east of Bishopbriggs town centre, sited on the route of the Forth and Clyde Canal. There is a Glasgow council housing scheme of a similar name, generally pronounced Cawder, in the district of Lambhill some 4 km to the west along the Canal, which was built in the early 1950s. Similarly, within Cadder, there is also Cawder Golf Club, which also uses that alternative spelling. In antiquity, Cadder was the site of a Roman fort on the route of the Antonine Wall. Cadder House was a property held by the Stirling family for generations.|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} has highlighted other {{explanations for the}} evolution of early retirement in the last decades. 1 Some examples are changes in Social Security programs and pension plans (Crawford and Lilien (1981), Blau (1994), Rust and Phelan (1997), Blundell et al. (2002), <b>Coile</b> and Gruber (2007), Vere (2011), Ferreira and dos Santos (2013), Vestad (2013), Atalay and Barrett (2015), Euwals and Trevisan (2014)), changes in the age and skill composition of the labor force (Blau and Goodstein (2010)), changes in workers’ health status (McGarry (2004)), changes in leisure consumption choices (Kopecky (2011)), or the rise of the dual-earner family and the tendency of couples to retire around the same time (Gustman (2000), Maesta (2001), <b>Coile</b> (2004), Stancanelli (2012)). We include several regressors in our econometric specification in order to account {{for a wide range of}} these complementary explanations.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{that began in}} 2008 had multiple implications for retirement behavior. The stock market crash may have caused some individuals to defer retirement because of losses they experienced in their 401 (k) -type retirement plans. The spike in unemployment may have led others to “retire ” sooner {{in response to a}} job loss or the inability to find work. <b>Coile</b> an...|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{recession}} not only lowered overall wealth, {{but it also}} caused a two year retirement delay among native and immigrant households. This finding corroborates that of Goda et al. (2011) and McFall (2011), who found that {{the recession}} caused retirement delays, but it contradicts <b>Coile</b> and Levine (2011) who claim instead that the recession and recessions in general speed up retirement. Because <b>Coile</b> and Levine’s results were derived from an examination of 30  years of data, while ours and those by Goda et al. (2011) and McFall (2011) only use data from the Great Recession, the findings may be {{pointing out that the}} Great Recession was somewhat different from earlier recessions and, accordingly, elicited a different response. For example, earlier recessions may have impacted employment opportunities while preserving accumulated asset values for near retirees. Being on track with respect to their asset accumulation towards retirement and finding employment less desirable, near retirees may have chosen to leave the labor market. But, given the developments {{that took place in the}} financial and housing markets during the Great Recession, many near-retirees in 2006 may have found their asset position to be such that they did not have the option to retire, opting instead to continue working, even in less than optimal jobs. The prolonged working lives of established and experienced workers could add to the difficulties encountered by new labor market entrants in securing good jobs.|$|E
30|$|Many {{retirement}} studies {{conclude that}} an important explanation {{for the fact that}} partners retire together are complementarities in leisure, implying that the utility of leisure time increases if leisure is enjoyed together with the partner (Hurd 1990; Gustman and Steinmeier 2000, 2004; <b>Coile</b> 2004; An et al. 2004; Casanova 2010). This is the first study that investigates the extent to which partners actually do spend more leisure time together upon retirement. We exploit diary data collected for both partners on the same day, chosen by the interviewer, to investigate the effect of retirement on partners’ leisure hours spent together or separately. To account for the potential endogeneity of partners’ retirement decisions, we exploit the legal retirement age in France and instrument retirement with legal retirement age in our model of the demand for leisure.|$|E
30|$|Also {{within this}} first strand of literature, {{there are some}} studies {{exploring}} {{the effects of the}} Great Recession on retirement behavior. One possibility that has been raised is that older Americans may have sped up their retirement plans due to financial difficulties faced by the firms that were employing them, resulting in job cuts, reduced profit sharing and hours of work. The need to keep up with mortgage payments and other responsibilities may have caused individuals to choose commencing social security benefits at age 62 or to take an early retirement incentive with its longer-run implication of reduced retirement payouts. 1 In this vein, using 30  years of Current Population Survey data, the 2000 Census and subsequent American Community Survey data, <b>Coile</b> and Levin (2011) find that unfavorable labor market conditions induce earlier retirements for those aged 62 and above.|$|E

40|$|In 1993 38. 9 {{million people}} were covered by a 401 (k) plan, up from 7. 1 million in 1983. The rapid growth of 401 (k) and other defined {{contribution}} pension plans may alter retirement patterns of older workers. Previous research showed that the spread of defined benefit plans, with sharp age-related incentives first discouraging and later encouraging retirement, contributed to the early retirement trend of past decades. Defined contribution plans differ along several dimensions, especially in their smooth rate of pension wealth accrual. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to show that retirement patterns have begun to change as defined contribution plans have spread. Our estimates indicate that the financial incentives in defined benefit pensions lead people to retire almost two years earlier on average, compared to people with defined contribution plans.

40|$|Disability Insurance (DI) is {{a public}} program that {{provides}} income support to persons unable to continue work due to disability. The difficulty of defining disability, however, has raised the possibility that this program may be subsidizing the early retirement of workers who are not sufficiently disabled. A critical input for assessing the optimal size of the DI program is therefore the elasticity of labor force participation with respect to benefits generosity. Unfortunately, this parameter {{has been difficult to}} estimate {{in the context of the}} U. S. DI program, since all workers face an identical benefits schedule. I surmount this problem by studying the experience of Canada, which operates two distinct DI programs, for Quebec and the rest of Canada. The latter program raised its benefits by 36 % in January, 1987, while benefits were constant in Quebec, providing exogenous variation in benefits generosity across similar workers. I study this relative benefits increase using both simple "difference-in-difference " estimators and more parameterized estimators that exploit the differential impact of this policy change across workers. I find that there was a sizeable labor supply response to the policy change; my central estimates imply an elasticity of labor force non-participation with respect to DI benefits of 0. 28 to 0. 36. * I am grateful to Courtney <b>Coile,</b> Kevin Frisch and particularly Sue Dynarski for excellent researc...|$|E
