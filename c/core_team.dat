5|$|The FreeBSD Project {{is run by}} around 500 committers, or {{developers}} who have commit access to the master source code repositories and can develop, debug or enhance {{any part of the}} system. Most of the developers are volunteers and few developers are paid by some companies. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD <b>Core</b> <b>Team</b> who are responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new commiters, or the granting of SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD <b>Core</b> <b>Team,</b> for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takashi Tezuka and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of both Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda, with Shigefumi Hino serving as the graphics designer. Development was handled by Nintendo EAD and consisted of ten people including three main programmers and one character designer, most of whom had worked on Super Mario Bros. In a retrospective interview, the <b>core</b> <b>team</b> stated that Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During this phase, the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as <b>core</b> <b>team</b> members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they choose, and the introduction of the item rental system.|$|E
5000|$|Through the 2011-12 series, {{the number}} of <b>core</b> <b>teams</b> was 12, but {{the number of}} <b>core</b> <b>teams</b> was {{expanded}} to 15 for 2012-13. The three extra teams were determined by a 12-team qualifying tournament held as part of the 2012 Hong Kong Sevens. [...] The {{increase in the number of}} <b>core</b> <b>teams</b> did not directly lead to an increase in the size of the existing tournaments.|$|R

5|$|Counselor: Counselors are {{required}} {{as part of}} the <b>core</b> <b>team</b> by Medicare regulations. Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not every patient will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Plans for DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in August 2010, with it being planned {{as an extension}} of the game. The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only <b>core</b> <b>team</b> members, development was slow due to the main focus being on Human Revolution. For The Missing Link, the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A. Noire {{one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E

5|$|Development of post-release content faced {{numerous}} setbacks. In May 2012, publisher Autumn Games was sued over {{allegations of}} fraud regarding an unrelated property, Def Jam Rapstar, cutting off Skullgirls financial support and forcing developer Reverge Labs {{to lay off}} the entire development team. The <b>core</b> <b>team</b> would eventually reform as Lab Zero Games in November 2012, launching a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to continue their work. After Autumn Games severed ties with distributor Konami Digital Entertainment in December 2013, the latter formally requested to have the game removed from the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. The game was later re-released on both platforms in 2014 as Skullgirls Encore. When the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One in 2015, it was renamed once again to Skullgirls 2nd Encore.|$|E
5|$|Rockstar San Diego {{began to}} develop Red Dead Redemption in 2005. Development was {{conducted}} {{by a team of}} more than 800 people, including Rockstar San Diego's <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and staff from parent company Rockstar Games's studios around the world. The game runs on the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), which was improved for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks. Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on previous projects, Rockstar felt inspired after realising the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$80 million and US$100 million, which would make {{it one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of L.A. Noire began in 2004 following {{the founding of}} its developer Team Bondi. Rockstar Games published L.A. Noire on 17 May 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows; a re-release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is scheduled for 14 November 2017. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between the <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. L.A. Noire was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints from staff members. L.A. Noire was formally announced in 2005; it was heavily promoted through video trailers and press demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the <b>core</b> <b>team,</b> who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one <b>core</b> <b>team</b> worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E

These Australian teams had previously only been opposition sides for the <b>core</b> <b>teams</b> and were not in contention for the title.|$|R
5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As {{a substitute for the}} multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the <b>Core</b> <b>team</b> were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E
