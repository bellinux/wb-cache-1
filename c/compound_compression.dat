40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} <b>compound</b> image <b>compression</b> {{algorithm}} for real-time applications of computer screen image transmission. It is called Shape Primitive Extraction and Coding (SPEC). Real-time image transmission {{requires that the}} compression algorithm should not only achieve high compression ratio, but also have low complexity and provide excellent visual quality. SPEC first segments a compound image into text/graphics pixels and pictorial pixels, and then compresses the text/graphics pixels with a new lossless coding algorithm and the pictorial pixels with the standard lossy JPEG, respectively. The segmentation first classifies image blocks into picture and text/graphics blocks by thresholding the number of colors of each block, then extracts shape primitives of text/graphics from picture blocks. Dynamic color palette that tracks recent text/graphics colors is used to separate small shape primitives of text/graphics from pictorial pixels. Shape primitives are also extracted from text/graphics blocks. All shape primitives from both block types are losslessly compressed by using a combined shape-based and palette-based coding algorithm. Then the losslessly coded bitstream is fed into a LZW coder. Experimental {{results show that the}} SPEC has very low complexity and provides visually lossless quality while keeping competitive compression ratios.

40|$|Abstract—Compound {{images are}} a {{combination}} of text, graphics and natural image. They present strong anisotropic features, especially on the text and graphics parts. These anisotropic features often render conventional compression inefficient. Thus, this paper proposes a novel coding scheme from the H. 264 intraframe coding. In the scheme, two new intramodes are developed to better exploit spatial correlation in compound images. The first is the residual scalar quantization (RSQ) mode, where intrapredicted residues are directly quantized and coded without transform. The second is the base colors and index map (BCIM) mode that {{can be viewed as}} an adaptive color quantization. In this mode, an image block is represented by several representative colors, referred to as base colors, and an index map to compress. Every block selects its coding mode from two new modes and the previous intramodes in H. 264 by rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the coding efficiency even more than 10 dB at most bit rates for compound images and keeps a comparable efficient performance to H. 264 for natural images.
