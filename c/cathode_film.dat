50|$|Etched ion tracks can be {{replicated}} by polymers or metals. Replica and template {{can be used}} as composite. A replica can be separated from its template mechanically or chemically. Polymer replicas are obtained by filling the etched track with a liquid precursor of the polymer and curing it. Curing can be activated by a catalyst, by ultraviolet radiation, or by heat. Metal replicas can be obtained either by electroless deposition or by electro-deposition. For replication of through-pores, a <b>cathode</b> <b>film</b> is deposited {{on one side of the}} membrane, and the membrane is immersed in a metal salt solution. The <b>cathode</b> <b>film</b> is negatively charged with respect to the anode, which is placed on the opposite side of the membrane. The positive metal ions are pulled toward the cathode, where they catch electrons and precipitate as a compact metal film. During electro-deposition, the channels fill gradually with metal, and the lengths of the nano-wires are controlled by the deposition time. Rapid deposition leads to polycrystalline wires, while slow deposition leads to single crystalline wires. A free-standing replica is obtained by removing the template after deposition of a bearing film on the anode side of the membrane.|$|E

The redox reaction involving Fe 3 ?/Fe 2 ? during Li insertion/extraction was confirmed by post-mortem XPS and cyclic voltammetry...|$|R
