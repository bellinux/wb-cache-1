30|$|The pupillary {{diameter}} {{variation is}} linked to mental workload and is used to assess cognitive skills [29, 30]. However, we must consider the variability related to the light reflex induced by the laboratory environment and the devices themselves [31]. To some extent, this could explain results from the V 500 that has a screen luminosity that is {{higher than that of}} other devices. Heart and respiratory rates and/or tidal volume variations are linked to emotional behaviour [32 – 34]. The better results that were observed with the Avea {{can be explained by the}} fact that this device was well known to all participants. Our results on the other devices clearly enable the depiction of differences in terms of task <b>completion</b> <b>perceptions</b> among users while using these parameters. Importantly, while the evolution of physiological parameters may not provide comparable results to those obtained with the psycho-cognitive scores, they are consistent with the objective task completion rate results.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A {{network for}} the {{extraction}} of salient image structure in dot patterns is proposed which uses a phase diffusion process to label the image into holistic perceptual objects and the background. The image is processed using three successive stages, copying the design of biological visual mechanisms. The popula-tion coded direction specific edge representation generated from phase-dependent energy filters is used by a competitive and cooperative phase process to allow boundary completion, grouping of perceptual elements and the suppression of false responses generated by the edge detection stage. Key-Words:- Preattentive grouping, boundary <b>completion,</b> visual <b>perception,</b> Gestalt...|$|R
40|$|When one monocular image {{contains}} a red square partly occluding a green square, {{and the other}} monocular image is the same except that the green square is partly occluding the red one, the two images resemble each other's amodal completion. Observers typically perceive two complete squares as if the red and green surfaces are transparent or penetrating each other at their overlapping image location, which never appears yellow. With this example, we introduce dichoptic <b>completion</b> as a <b>perception</b> with the following characteristics. (1) Similar to binocular rivalry, it is evoked by dichoptic stimuli with monocular images so disparate that they cannot arise from physical scenes; however, (2) it occurs when objects inferred from one monocular image are identified with, or do not conflict with, objects inferred from the other; and, consequently, (3) it {{is a form of}} perceptual superposition, distinct from the result of binocular summation or rivalry...|$|R

Academically underprepared students may not be entering community colleges to earn a credential. This quantitative study examined students enrolled in community college Educational Opportunity Programs (EOPs) in the State University of New York from the perspectives of student-defined goal <b>completion,</b> self-efficacy, and <b>perceptions</b> of the EOP. The study used secondary data available from the State University of New York’s Office of Institutional Research as well as an online survey instrument. Results of the study showed a multivariate relationship between goal completion, enrollment in EOP, race, and type of self-defined goal. The study also revealed that students perceived additional financial aid assistance as the most influential component of the EOP. A positive correlation was found between the social and course self-efficacy subscales. As a result of the study, community colleges are encouraged to examine their policies and practices around EOP enrollment, advisement, and services provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While {{there is}} {{increasing}} support for training youth-serving providers in trauma-informed care (TIC) {{as a means of}} addressing high prevalence of U. S. childhood trauma, we know little about the effects of TIC training on organizational culture and providers’ professional quality of life. This mixed-methods study evaluated changes in organizational- and provider-level factors following participation in a citywide TIC training. Methods Government workers and nonprofit professionals (N[*]=[*] 90) who participated in a nine-month citywide TIC training completed a survey before and after the training to assess organizational culture and professional quality of life. Survey data were analyzed using multiple regression analyses. A subset of participants (n[*]=[*] 16) was interviewed using a semi-structured format, and themes related to organizational and provider factors were identified using qualitative methods. Results Analysis of survey data indicated significant improvements in participants’ organizational culture and professional satisfaction at training <b>completion.</b> Participants’ <b>perceptions</b> of their own burnout and secondary traumatic stress also increased. Four themes emerged from analysis of the interview data, including “Implementation of more flexible, less-punitive policies towards clients,” “Adoption of trauma-informed workplace design,” “Heightened awareness of own traumatic stress and need for self-care,” and “Greater sense of camaraderie and empathy for colleagues. ” Conclusion Use of a mixed-methods approach provided a nuanced understanding of the impact of TIC training and suggested potential benefits of the training on organizational and provider-level factors associated with implementation of trauma-informed policies and practices. Future trainings should explicitly address organizational factors such as safety climate and morale, managerial support, teamwork climate and collaboration, and individual factors including providers’ compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress, to better support TIC implementation...|$|R
40|$|Divorce is a {{significant}} event in children's lives. The ability of school personnel to be helpful with children of divorce can be influenced by their attitudes and by other factors. This study described the attitudes towards divorce of elementary school personnel and examined the relationships among the personnel's attitudes, personality factors, and selected personal and professional variables. The sample was comprised of 212 elementary school personnel from a large metropolitan school district in Western Canada. Data were derived from subjects' responses to the Sixteen Personality Factor Scale and two instruments developed by the author to assess subjects' attitudes towards divorce and their personal and professional characteristics. Findings indicated that teachers perceive divorce as a socially acceptable phenomenon. They perceived {{that it is better}} for children to live in happy homes, divorced or intact, than in conflict-ridden intact homes, and that children of divorce benefit when their fathers are active in parenting. Nearly all respondents perceived the school as fulfilling an important role for children of divorce. Significant differences were found between high and low scoring groups on each attitudinal sub-scale when personality factors, personal variables, and professional variables were considered. The {{results of this study suggest}} that certain personal variables (age, marital status, religion, and years of teaching experience) were related to differences in attitudes. Most of the professional variables (perceptions of children's motivation and homework <b>completion</b> and <b>perceptions</b> of parents' concerns) accounted for differences in attitudes. Several personality factors (warmth, ego-strength, rebelliousness, self-sufficiency, and imagination for example) also were indicated to have particular relevance for the attitudes of elementary school personnel towards divorce...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robot search task (social tag) that uses social interaction, {{in the form}} of asking for help, as an integral component of task <b>completion.</b> Socially distributed <b>perception</b> is defined as a robot’s ability to augment its limited sensory capacities through social interaction. We describe the task of social tag and its implementation on the robot GRACE for the AAAI 2005 Mobile Robot Competition & Exhibition. We then discuss our observations and analyses of GRACE’s performance as a situated interaction with conference participants. Our results suggest we were successful in promoting a form of social interaction that allowed people to help the robot achieve its goal. Furthermore, we found that different social uses of the physical space had an effect {{on the nature of the}} interaction. Finally, we discuss the implications of this design approach for effective and compelling human-robot interaction, considering its relationship to concepts such as dependency, mixed initiative, and socially distributed cognition.

40|$|The chapter {{deals with}} the notion of phenomenal realness, which was first {{systematically}} explored by Albert Michotte. Phenomenal realness refers to the impression that a perceptual object is perceived to have an autonomous existence in our mind-independent world. Perceptual psychology provides an abundance of phenomena, ranging from amodal <b>completion</b> to picture <b>perception,</b> that indicate that phenomenal realness is an independent perceptual attribute that can be conferred to perceptual objects in different degrees. The chapter outlines a theoretical framework that appears particularly well-suited for dealing with corresponding phenomena. According to this framework, perception can be understood as a triggering of conceptual forms by sensor inputs. It is argued that the attribute of phenomenal realness is based on specific types of internal evaluation functions which deal with the segregation of causes conceived as ‘external’ from those conceived as ‘internal’. These evaluation functions integrate different internal sources of ‘knowledge’ about the potential causes for the activation of conceptual forms and provide markers by which conceptual forms can be tagged as ‘external world objects’...|$|R
40|$|Several {{decades after}} Michotte’s work was published, it {{continues}} to inspire current research in perception, cognition, and beyond. In this special issue we pay tribute to this heritage {{with a collection of}} empirical and theoretical papers on amodal <b>completion</b> and the <b>perception</b> of causality, two areas of research within which Michotte’s work and ideas have had a lasting influence. As a background to better understand the remaining papers, we briefly sketch Michotte’s life and work and the scope (in breadth and in depth) of his impact. We then review Michotte’s seminal contributions to the areas covered in this special issue, some of the major research discoveries and themes in the intervening decades, and the major open questions and challenges we are still facing. We also include a sneak preview of the papers in this special issue, noting how they relate to Michotte’s work and to each other. This review shows both how much influence Michotte has had on contemporary perception and cognition research, and how much important work remains to be done. We hope that the papers in this special issue will serve both to celebrate Michotte’s heritage in this respect, and to inspire other investigators to continue the projects he began...|$|R
40|$|Questions: Will outcomes-based funding be implemented? How {{or does it}} impact student <b>completion</b> initiatives? Is <b>perception</b> any {{different}} than reality of current approaches? Performance Funding: From Idea to Action (Jones, 2012) • Recognize that all funding models are performance based; {{this is not a}} new idea. • Get agreement on goals before putting performance funding in place. The public agenda should state a limited set of goals that: o Are tailored to the needs of the state, not borrowed from elsewhere o Focus on the needs of the state and its citizens, not the institutions of higher education • Construct performance metrics more broadly – other important objectives besides attainment of degrees include: o Innovations that expand and broaden the state’s economy o Production of graduate and professional degrees in selected fields such as STEM or health care o Development of a workforce for high-need occupations • Institutions should “win ” by contributing to state goals, not doing well at their own. Failure to do so can easily lead to: o Encouragement of unwanted behavior by institutions — mission creep by some institutions, and research institutions enrolling more students than deemed desirable by policymakers and increasing competition for students even more in the process o Legislative opposition from supporters of institutions that can’t benefit from staying within their mission and doing that missio...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a common}} belief amongst those who are {{involved}} in projects that as project complexity increases the difficulty to manage a project increases and thus the probability to succeed in project <b>completion</b> considerably decreases. <b>Perception</b> of complexity in a project usually refers to common criteria from traditional project management thinking such as the scale of the project; cost; duration; and the degree of risk to its owner. However, whether a project is perceived to be complex or not may not be purely a product {{of the size of the}} project. It may also be derived from the person’s experience in projects. The aim of this study is to identify attributes of perception of project complexity and observe whether experience is also a determining factor in perceiving a project as complex. The research is based on the assumption that a complex project may exhibit behaviour similar to complex adaptive system. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on projects understood as complex adaptive systems. A project experience matrix is developed which will be useful to help link degree and type of experience to perceptions of project complexity. This study employs a comparative study between two cases to explore and compare the perception of complexity in each case. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained through semi-structured interview and questionnaires, then analysed accordingly. The outcomes of this research attempted to find answers to the following questions: How do project managers and team members perceive a project as complex (project complexity) ?” In answering this question we explored how project managers and team members perceived project complexity. The major question above was elaborated by some minor specific questions. These are: Which attributes of complex adaptive systems are attributed by project managers and team members to project complexity? Is project experience a determining factor to the perception of project complexity? Based on our sample we found no significant differences between attributes of complex adaptive systems and perception of project complexity; no significant association between depth and context of experience and perception of project complexity. We also found no significant differences between the Chinese and Indonesian samples...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar o desenvolvimento cognitivo e comportamental em idade pré-escolar de crianças prematuras com baixo peso ao nascimento que vivem em um país em desenvolvimento. MÉTODOS: Estudo {{transversal}} prospectivo de 80 recém-nascidos de um hospital universitário no sul do Brasil. A avaliação neuropsicológica aos 4 - 5 anos de idade incluiu a Escala de Inteligência de Wechsler para a Idade Pré-Escolar e Primária (WPPSI), a Escala de Conners para Pais Revisada (CPRS-R), o teste de Denver e exames neurológicos. As informações de desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor inicial e perinatal foram coletadas a partir do banco de dados durante o acompanhamento. Os resultados foram relacionados com o peso ao nascimento, o sexo e a idade gestacional. RESULTADOS: Os escores da WPPSI foram: quociente de inteligência (QI) total 88, 00 ± 16, 96, QI verbal 89, 72 ± 16, 72 e QI executivo 88, 12 ± 15, 71 para o grupo com menos de 1. 500 gramas; e QI total 91, 11 ± 14, 73, QI verbal 93, 36 ± 12, 65 e QI executivo 90, 20 ± 16, 06 para o grupo entre 1. 500 e 2. 500 gramas. Os melhores escores foram obtidos em testes que avaliaram a capacidade de abstração e simbolização, completar figuras e percepção comum, nos quais apenas 5 e 6, 3 % das crianças apresentaram resultados anormais, respectivamente. Os menores escores foram obtidos em testes que avaliam a coordenação visual-motora e a flexibilidade-velocidade de raciocínio, nos quais 27, 5 e 16, 3 % das crianças tiveram resultados anormais, respectivamente. No total, 32, 5 % das crianças tiveram resultados anormais em testes aritméticos. Comportamentos relacionados com transtorno do déficit de atenção com hiperatividade (TDAH) foram observados em 48 % da amostra. Os baixos resultados na Escala Mental de Bayley e o resultado anormal no teste de Denver apresentaram correlação significativa com o TDAH (p = 0, 017 e p = 0, 004). Os resultados anormais na Escala Mental de Bayley (p OBJECTIVE: To assess {{cognitive and}} behavioral development at preschool age of children born preterm and with low birth weight and raised in a developing country. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study of 80 neonates born in a university hospital in southern Brazil. Neuropsychological assessment at age 4 - 5 years included the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Denver test and neurological examination. Perinatal and early neuropsychomotor development information was collected from the database during follow-up. Results were related to birth weight, sex and gestational age. RESULTS: WPPSI scores were: total IQ 88. 00 ± 16. 96, verbal IQ 89. 72 ± 16. 72, and executive IQ 88. 12 ± 15. 71 for the group with less than 1, 500 grams; and total IQ 91. 11 ± 14. 73, verbal IQ 93. 36 ± 12. 65, and executive IQ 90. 20 ± 16. 06 for the group between 1, 500 and 2, 500 grams. The best scores were obtained in tests that evaluated capacity of abstraction and symbolization, picture <b>completion</b> and common <b>perception,</b> in which only 5 % and 6. 3 % of the children had abnormal results, respectively. The lowest scores were obtained in tests that evaluated visual-motor coordination and flexibility-speed of reasoning, in which 27. 5 % and 16. 3 % of the children had abnormal results, respectively. A total of 32. 5 % had abnormal results in the arithmetic tests. Behaviors related to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were observed in 48 % of the sample. Low score in the Bayley Mental Scale and abnormal result in the Denver test were significantly correlated to ADHD (p = 0. 017 and p = 0. 004). Abnormal results in the Bayley Mental Scale (p < 0. 001), Denver test (p < 0. 001) and neurological examination (p = 0. 002) were associated with lower IQ. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed an increased incidence of behavioral and cognitive disorders at preschool age...|$|R
