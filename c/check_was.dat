5|$|Shortly {{before this}} {{publication}} {{it was revealed}} in The Hague that Dutch law enforcement officers succeeded twice in smuggling a firearm into the parliament buildings and into the guarded headquarters of Wilders' party. This <b>check</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out by the}} Special Security Assignments Brigade BSB, a special unit of the Dutch Military Police. The test was carried out following a complaint from Wilders about his security being inadequate.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} had two main entrances: a main entrance {{at ground level}} that faced east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from {{what used to be}} the Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat <b>check</b> <b>was</b> an evocative quote from Dante Alighieri Divine Comedy. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.|$|E
5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such <b>check</b> <b>was</b> provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use {{the powers of the}} state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E
30|$|Yamanouchi et al. [11] {{reported}} that the total widths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among the six sugi cultivars, {{but they did not}} discuss the factors affecting the differences. In this study, the total lengths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among cultivars (Fig.  2; Table  3). The total length of the surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> positively correlated with the tangential shrinkage when all surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> included, and was correlated with tangential and radial shrinkage when the short-end <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> excluded. On the other hand, the total length of surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio or the BD. This result suggests that the surface-check variation among cultivars is affected by tangential shrinkage, which varies among cultivars due to the variation in MFA [7].|$|R

5|$|William Edward Forster {{argued that}} a Coercion Act—which would punish those participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the {{suspension}} of Habeas Corpus—should be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MP's attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as filibustering. One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the house {{if there was a}} three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This {{was the first time that}} a <b>check</b> <b>was</b> placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|On one {{occasion}} in early 1945, a <b>check</b> <b>was</b> written to King Neptune for his upkeep. The bank asked Lingle {{to obtain the}} pig's endorsement to cash the checks. Lingle was promoted to Chief Petty Officer {{as a result of}} his fund raising efforts with Neptune.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2011, a $900,000 <b>check</b> <b>was</b> posted with Travis County that {{permitted}} grading to begin. The money {{was to be}} used to restore the land if the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declined to allow the project to move forward because part of the site lies in a floodplain. FEMA issued a letter on June 28, 2011, stating the project meets its floodplain management criteria.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difference}} between women's and men's ice hockey <b>is</b> that body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed in}} women's hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, body <b>checking</b> <b>was</b> eliminated in women's hockey. In current IIHF women's competition, body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> either a minor or major penalty, decided at the referee's discretion. In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective full-face masks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{reasons of}} efficiency, {{in almost all}} {{implementations}} of Prolog the occur <b>check</b> <b>is</b> left out. This a mechanism should protect the program against introducing circular bindings of variables. In practice the occur <b>check</b> <b>is</b> very expensive, however, and it is left to {{the skills of the}} user, to avoid these circular bindings in the program. In this paper a semantics of Prolog without occur <b>check</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The new kind of resolution, i. e. SLD-resolution without occur <b>check,</b> <b>is</b> referred to as CSLD-resolution. Important theorems such as soundness and completeness of both CSLD-resolution and the “negation as failure” rule, are established...|$|R

25|$|At about 6:43 P.M. {{local time}} (1043 UTC) on 22 August 1999, the MD-11 was making its final {{approach}} to runway 25L when Typhoon Sam was 50km NE of the airport. At {{an altitude of}} 700 feet prior to touchdown a further wind <b>check</b> <b>was</b> passed to the crew: 320 deg/28 knots gusting to 36 knots. This results in a crosswind component of 21.4 knots gusting to 27.5 knots, while the tested limit for the aircraft was 35 knots.|$|E
25|$|Another similar tartan {{was found}} on a cloak, in the peat bog at Thorsberg, in the modern-day Schleswig-Holstein region of {{northern}} Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, though <b>check</b> <b>was</b> commonly used, its use in Schleswig {{is thought to have}} been greater (even as far as being used for tunics, unlike in England where tunics were usually plain hues, with cloaks and trouser being the most common check garments), suggesting that the continental Germanic peoples of the area used the design to an even greater extent than those in England.|$|E
25|$|Zehaf-Bibeau {{arrived in}} Ottawa on or before October 2, ostensibly to pursue {{securing}} a passport. Zehaf-Bibeau had {{applied for a}} Canadian passport and a background <b>check</b> <b>was</b> in progress. RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said this issue was central in driving the attacks. Zehaf-Bibeau, who also had Libyan citizenship, applied for a Libyan passport renewal on October 2 and was refused the same day. Zehaf-Bibeau had received a Libyan passport in 2000 and then travelled to Libya in 2007. That document had expired, and Zehaf-Bibeau told officials that he wanted a new passport so he could visit family and friends in Libya.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, {{the lease}} amount that {{formerly}} was paid in gold coin was instead paid with U.S. dollars per the Gold Reserve Act {{so it was}} adjusted {{to account for the}} value of gold into U.S. dollars, which set it at $3,386.25. The lease amount was further adjusted in 1973 to $3,676.50 and in 1974 to $4,085, based on revisions to the value of the U.S. gold dollar. Payments have been sent annually, but only one lease payment has been cashed since the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro claimed that this <b>check</b> <b>was</b> deposited due to confusion in 1959, and the Cuban government has not deposited any other lease checks.|$|E
25|$|Although The Wonderful Wizard of Oz {{was very}} profitable, the family {{remained}} low on cash in 1900 near Christmas. The book's initial royalty was {{slated to be}} given to Frank in January. However, Maud told Frank to ask for it in advance to purchase Christmas gifts. Begrudgingly, Frank requested and received the money, pocketing it. Not glancing at the money, Frank returned home, finding Maud ironing his shirt. He gave her the money after she asked for it, whereupon she became shocked. Anticipating it to be no more than $100, Maud was delighted to learn that the <b>check</b> <b>was</b> for $3,432.64. Maud misremembered the iron during the ensuing flurry and burned Frank's shirt.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{was also}} an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in {{recognition}} of distinguished sportsmanship. He {{is a member of}} the World Golf Hall of Fame. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place <b>check</b> <b>was</b> for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.|$|E

5000|$|However, cashier's <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> often {{forged in}} fraud schemes. The {{recipient}} of the check can deposit the check {{in his or her}} account, withdraw funds under next-day availability, and assume that the <b>check</b> <b>is</b> good. The <b>check</b> can take weeks to clear the banks.

25|$|As {{a private}} organization, the Committee {{followed}} normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individual(s) {{to accept and}} endorse checks {{on behalf of the}} Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the Committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the <b>check</b> <b>was</b> deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that Committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.|$|E
25|$|Work was {{commenced}} at Tilmanstone in 1906. An {{accident in}} 1909 killed {{three men and}} destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months. The site {{was connected to the}} East Kent Light Railway in 1912 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1913. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield. An aerial ropeway was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954. In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above. The colliery closed in 1986, having produced over 20,000,000 tons of coal. A system of tokens was used in the pithead baths and canteen and a lamp <b>check</b> <b>was</b> operated, in common with the majority of pits. All buildings have been demolished.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, {{in a daze}} {{following}} what {{he thought}} was a check by Toronto's Ace Bailey, charged the latter player from behind, flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. [...] The <b>check</b> <b>was</b> so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston. Neurosurgeons operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice.
