40|$|Utility {{theory as}} {{developed}} by Von Neuman and Morgenstern provides an elegant {{way to make}} consistent choices among risky alternatives by maximizing the expected value of a personal utility function over known probability distributions of outcomes. The theory is usually presented {{in the context of}} a single (possibly complex) decision, where it gives little guidance on the choice of a utility function. This paper provides a tutorial on the consequences of applying expected utility theory to repeated decisions, using theory and simulation to reveal the statistical regularity arising cumulatively from repeatedly applying the same utility. If decisions are repeated and consequences accumulate, two utility functions stand out as maximizing <b>cumulative</b> incremental <b>growth</b> and <b>cumulative</b> compound <b>growth,</b> namely the linear utility and the logarithmic utility, respectively. Repeatedly basing decisions on the linear utility when compound growth applies and severe losses are possible can be disastrous in the long term. Relevance to financial investment and population catastrophes is considered. ...|$|R
2500|$|Human {{capital is}} {{distinctly}} {{different from the}} tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively {{over a long period}} of time. [...] The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of business cycles. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of recession and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth {{over a long period of}} time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs. [...] The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health. [...] The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human capital formation in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human capital formation in the current generation. This is the <b>cumulative</b> <b>growth</b> of human capital formation generated by superior quality of manpower in the succeeding generation as compared to the preceding generation.|$|E

Both cross-section and panel data methods are employed. The regression analysis reveals that the direction of net in-migration flows {{can be explained by}} a set of region-ally differing characteristics. Unemployment rates, tax rates, and the share of primary production affect net in-migration negatively, whereas the share of higher education and the growth of regional incomes have a positive effect. This indicates that regional disparities may not be alleviated by migration, but there is some evidence for a <b>cumulative</b> causation <b>growth</b> pattern induced by net in-migration flows...|$|R

During the HPEs, the precise cause of PM 2. 5 explosive growth (mass concentration at least doubled in several hours to 10  h) is uncertain. Here, we analyzed and estimated relative contributions of boundary-layer meteorological factors to such growth, using ground and vertical meteorological data. Beijing HPEs are generally {{characterized by the}} transport stage (TS), whose aerosol pollution formation is primarily caused by pollutants transported from the south of Beijing, and the cumulative stage (CS), in which the <b>cumulative</b> explosive <b>growth</b> of PM 2. 5 mass is dominated by stable atmospheric stratification characteristics of southerly slight or calm winds, near-ground anomalous inversion, and moisture accumulation. During the CSs, observed southerly weak winds facilitate local pollutant accumulation by minimizing horizontal pollutant diffusion. Established by TSs, elevated PM 2. 5 levels scatter more solar radiation back to space to reduce near-ground temperature, which very likely causes anomalous inversion. This surface cooling by PM 2. 5 decreases near-ground saturation vapor pressure and increases relative humidity significantly; the inversion subsequently reduces vertical turbulent diffusion and boundary-layer height to trap pollutants and accumulate water vapor. Appreciable near-ground moisture accumulation (relative humidity >  80  %) would further enhance aerosol hygroscopic growth and accelerate liquid-phase and heterogeneous reactions, in which incompletely quantified chemical mechanisms need more investigation. The positive meteorological feedback noted on PM 2. 5 mass explains over 70  % of <b>cumulative</b> explosive <b>growth...</b>|$|R
