For manufacturers and importers that had to comply with a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals of their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great achievement.

These two Directives following the "new approach" aim at ensuring the free movement of products within the European Union (EU), improving safety of both consumers and professionals and implementing harmonised safety requirements for such products in all Members States.

40|$|International audienceIn the European Union (EU) <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> are {{subjected}} to comply with national regulations {{in addition to a}} series of EU Directives. In order to harmonize regulations in the EU, the placing on the market <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> is going to fall under the scope of a new European Directive. Among these <b>articles,</b> one finds <b>pyrotechnic</b> components <b>of</b> automotive safety equipment such as gas generators or igniters. In the very fast growing market of automotive safety industry, regulations might be perceived as non-technical barriers to innovation in the field. Conversely, through innovation arguments, industries sometimes try to promote specific cases of exemptions to comply various regulations. In a broad approach, we examine both regulation and industrial recent repercussions in the field <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> devices for automotive safety, as these points of view face each other too often. Considerations regarding design, transport classification, approvals, safety features, environmental issues and treatment of end-life waste disposal are provided along the life cycle of the products. We enlighten needs in term of harmonized standards and technical procedures to answer regulation requirements. Such needs bring new perspectives and make room to various stakeholders for possible and efficient developments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{manufacturers}} and importers that generally have {{to comply with}} a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals for their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great expectancy. The Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] concerning the placing on the market and the use <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> could fulfil those dealing with automotive occupant restraint systems (mainly airbags and seat belts pretensioners). By introducing harmonised Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) this new Directive offers the possibilities to replace the National approval procedures concerned by a single legal framework throughout the European Union (EU) for these <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application in replacement of the current National regulatory frameworks may create difficulties at the beginning. In this paper we present the different parts of the Directive specifically these concerning pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety and how to comply with it. As Notified Body and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic devices.

40|$|A basic {{characteristic}} of the supply chain of fireworks is that most manufacturers {{are located in the}} Far East. Considering control results on tests made by CERL and INERIS on fireworks coming from this area (mainly from China), and taking into account that a new Directive has been published in 2007 in Europe for the certification <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> (including fire-works), it seems clear {{that it is necessary to}} put in place an additional system for checking and certifying the fireworks, when importers of fireworks cannot check the imported batches by themselves according to the existing or newly arriving standards. This system could be applicable to manufacturers not belonging to the European Union or to control laboratories, and can be extended to any other country wishing to improve the safety of use of fireworks. We present in this paper our views concerning such a system;- a comparison between the checking procedure applied by the Canada (CERL) – i. e. on all imported batches- and those made by France (INERIS) – i. e. on samples taken on the spot in the importers warehouses on imported fireworks from the far east, and some results- some proposals on criteria of minimal competence (qualified or accredited testing laboratory, competent people, testing equipment, testing procedures, …) to put in place in order to qualify the manufacturers exporting into Europe, or local control bodies...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how swedish {{newspapers}} represent the use <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnics</b> and the users <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnics</b> at football matches in the swedish first division.

Using the methods of qualitative text analysis and critical discourse analysis we have examined 12 articles in Swedens biggest sports tabloid Sportbladet that were wrtitten in relation to events where pyrotechnics were used. These methods were used along with the theoretical framework of sensational journalism, the sports media complex and the dramaturgy of the press. The results show that the report surrounding pyrotechnics at football matches is more nuanced than our initial beliefs. There is report which supports legalising pyrotechnichs and there is report that support a ban on the users <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnics.</b> Whether the report is more positive than negative towards the use <b>of</b> <b>pyrotechnics</b> is decided by the circumstances in which the article is written.
