However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his inattention to classwork, his classroom absences and his asocial behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge) Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that [...] " [...] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power... that's why she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> church– because we were helping several people like him." [...] Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by [...] "demonic power" [...] and needed [...] "deliverance." [...] Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.|$|E

The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together."
