40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{theoretical}} investigation aimed at testing whether full amplitude, nonlinear, convective models account for the I-band light curves of Bump Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We selected two objects from the OGLE sample that show a well-defined bump along the decreasing (short-period) and the rising (long-period) branch respectively. We find that current models do reproduce the luminosity variation over the entire pulsation cycle if the adopted stellar mass is roughly 15 % smaller than predicted by evolutionary models that neglect both mass loss and convective core overshooting. Moreover, we find that the fit to the light curve of the long-period Cepheid located close to the cool edge of the instability strip requires an increase in the mixing length from 1. 5 to 1. 8 Hp. This suggests an increase in the efficiency of the convective transport when moving toward cooler effective temperatures. <b>Current</b> <b>pulsation</b> calculations supply a LMC distance modulus ranging from 18. 48 to 18. 58 mag.

40|$|Context: Calculating stellar {{pulsations}} {{requires a}} sufficient accuracy {{to match the}} quality of the observations. Many <b>current</b> <b>pulsation</b> codes apply a second order finite-difference scheme, combined with Richardson extrapolation to reach fourth order accuracy on eigenfunctions. Although this is a simple and robust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes desirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be implemented in either 1 D or 2 D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required. Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference schemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current ways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or applying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited to eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems, because they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce supplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary conditions. Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids strategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above difficulties. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to superconvergence, a process in which the accuracy of the finite differences is boosted by one order. Results: This new approach is shown to be accurate, flexible with respect to the underlying grid, and able to remove mesh-drift. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E

As a result, this approach will not be suitable for high power drives such as those used in tractions, as they require good torque control performance at considerably lower frequency.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} analysis of Cepheids in NGC 4258, Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way in order to verify the reliability of the theoretical scenario based on a large set of nonlinear convective pulsation models. We derive Wesenheit functions from the synthetic BVI magnitudes of the pulsators and we show that the sign and the extent of the metallicity effect on the predicted Period-Wesenheit (P-W) relations change according to the adopted passbands. These P-W relations are applied to measured BVI magnitudes of NGC 4258, Magellanic and Galactic Cepheids available in the literature. We find that Magellanic and Galactic Cepheids agree with the metallicity dependence of the predicted P-W relations. Concerning the NGC 4258 Cepheids, the results strongly depend on the adopted metallicity gradient across the galactic disc. The most recent nebular oxygen abundances support a shallower gradient and provide a metallicity dependence that agrees well with <b>current</b> <b>pulsation</b> predictions. Moreover, the comparison of Cepheid distances based on VI magnitudes with distance estimates based on the revised TRGB method for external galaxies, on the HST trigonometric parallaxes for Galactic Cepheids, and on eclipsing binaries in the Magellanic Clouds seems to favor the metallicity correction predicted by pulsation models. The sign and the extent of the metallicity dependence of the Period-Wesenheit and of the Period-Luminosity relations change according to the adopted passbands. Therefore, distances based on different methods and/or bands should not be averaged.

The comparison between their pulsation masses, based on new Period-Mass-Radius (PMR) relations, and their evolutionary masses, based on both optical and NIR Color-Magnitude (CM) diagrams, suggests that pulsation masses are on average {{of the order of}} 10 % smaller than the evolutionary masses. <b>Current</b> <b>pulsation</b> masses show, at fixed radius, a strongly reduced dispersion when compared with values published in literature. The increased precision in the pulsation masses {{is due to the fact}} that our predicted PMR relations based on nonlinear, convective Cepheid models present smaller standard deviations than PMR relations based on linear models. At the same time, the empirical radii of our Cepheid sample are typically accurate at the 5 % level. Our evolutionary mass determinations are based on stellar models constructed by neglecting the effect of mass-loss during the He burning phase. Therefore, the difference between pulsation and evolutionary masses could be intrinsic and does not necessarily imply a problem with either evolutionary and/or nonlinear pulsation models. The marginal evidence of a trend in the difference between evolutionary and pulsation masses when moving from short to long-period Cepheids is also briefly discussed. The main finding of our investigation is that the long-standing Cepheid mass discrepancy seems now resolved at the 10 % level either if account for canonical or mild convective core overshooting evolutionary models.

The main aim {{of this research is}} the development of solutions for effective use of the wind generators in alternative energetics devices, at the same time providing uninterrupted power supply of the critical loads. In this research, it was accepted that the alternative energetics microgrid operates in an autonomous mode and the connection to the conventional power grid is not used. In the case when wind speed is low, the necessary power is provided by the energy storage system, which includes a fuel cell and a tank with stored hydrogen. The theoretical analysis of the storage system operation is made. The possible usage time of the stored hydrogen depends on the available amount of hydrogen and the consumption of the hydrogen by the fuel cell. The consumption, in turn, depends on used fuel cell power.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of double-periodic Cepheid pulsation is still poorly understood. Recently we rediscussed {{the problem of}} modelling the double-periodic pulsation with non-linear hydrocodes. We showed that the published non-resonant double-mode models are incorrect, because they exclude the negative buoyancy effects. Aims. We continue our efforts to verify whether the Kuhfuss one-equation convection model with negative buoyancy included can reproduce the double-periodic Cepheid pulsation. Methods. Using the direct time integration hydrocode, which implements the Kuhfuss convection model, we search for stable double-periodic Cepheid models. We search for models pulsating in both fundamental and first overtone modes (F+ 1 O), {{as well as in}} the two lowest order overtones (1 O+ 2 O). In the latter case, we focus on reproducing double-overtone Cepheids of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results. We have found full amplitude non-linear beat Cepheid models of both types, F+ 1 O and 1 O+ 2 O. In the case of F+ 1 O models, the beat pulsation is most likely caused by the three-mode resonance, 2 omega_ 1 =omega_ 0 +omega_ 2, while in the double-overtone models the underlying mechanism (resonant or non-resonant) cannot be identified beyond doubt. Double-periodic models found in our survey exist, however, only in narrow period ranges and cannot explain the majority of the observed double-periodic objects. Conclusions. With only little doubt left, we conclude that current one dimensional one-equation convection models are incapable of reproducing the majority of the observed beat Cepheids. Among the shortcomings of <b>current</b> <b>pulsation</b> hydrocodes, the simple treatment of convection seems to be the most severe one.

The pulsating subdwarf B star V 391 Pegasi (or HS 2201 + 2610), which {{is close to the}} two known hybrid pulsators in the log g - Teff plane, has recently been discovered to host a planetary companion. In order {{to learn more about the}} planetary companion and its possible influence on the evolution of its host star (subdwarf B star formation is still not well understood), an accurate characterisation of the host star is required. As part of an ongoing effort to significantly improve the asteroseismic characterisation of the host star, we investigate the low-frequency behaviour of HS 2201 + 2610. We obtained rapid high signal-to-noise photometric CCD (B-filter) and PMT (clear-filter) data at 2 m-class telescopes and carried out a careful frequency analysis of the light curves. In addition to the previously known short-period luminosity variations in the range 342 s- 367 s, we find a long-period variation with a period of 54 min and an amplitude of 0. 15 per cent. This can most plausibly be identified with a g-mode pulsation, so that HS 2201 + 2610 is a new addition to the short list of hybrid sdB pulsators.

Wave properties are also estimated using the orbital drifter motions and linear (Airy) wave theory. The effects of various wave conditions on the time-averaged rip current systems are investigated to show that wave height is a critical parameter. Measurements of circulation cells are obtained by spatially averaging the drifter track velocity measurements into a polar grid ranging from 0. 25 m to 3. 25 m {{from the center of the}} cell. Circulation cell features, such as the center of circulation and cell width, are calculated to characterize their response to various wave conditions. Spectral analyses are used to characterize the rip <b>current</b> <b>pulsations</b> in the experimental measurements. Three frequencies are found to be energetic in several of the experiments in the low frequency band: the wave group frequency, a lower frequency, and the interaction of the wave group and lower frequencies. Some experiments have significant energy at each of the three peaks, where others have only one or none. The lower frequency motions have also been found in the video measurements and attributed to rip meandering. Possible causes for the low-frequency pulsations, including wave basin seiching, circulation cell instabilities, and wave-current interaction, are discussed. This thesis adds to previous rip current studies by providing a spatially-large and time-varying perspective of rip current systems as a whole. M. S.

40|$|Construction of a {{model of}} the {{regional}} magnetic field and investigation of the local magnetic anomalies and their origin were approaches used in attempts to study the crustal structure near Japan and its Antarctic bases. Spatial properties of the regional magnetic field and comparison of the regional model with that derived from MAGSAT data are discussed. Possible causes of the magnetic anomalies, and results of aeromagnetic surveys incorporating gravity and seismic data are explored. Ionospheric and magnetospheric contributions to geomagnetic variations, field-aligned <b>currents,</b> magnetic geomagnetic <b>pulsations,</b> and hydromagnetic waves by analysis of MAGSAT data are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. The {{focus of}} {{the paper is the}} {{analysis}} of the flow in rip current systems generated by channels in longshore bars on a beach. The horizontal variations of rip current systems are described through the use of the quasi-three-dimensional nearshore circulation model SHORECIRC. Model predictions are compared to laboratory measurements of waves and current velocities throughout the entire rip current system and show reasonable agreement. The rips in the two channels are found to behave differently because of the depth variation across the basin. It is found that higher bottom stress leads to more stable flow where the rip current meanders less and fewer eddies are generated. The wave current interaction creates forcing which reduces the distance rip currents flow offshore and can lead to a slow pulsation of the rip <b>current.</b> This <b>pulsation</b> is in addition to the instabilities of a jet which can also be present in rip currents. The three dimensionality of the rip current system is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall circulation patterns...|$|R
