50|$|The {{process of}} {{chemical}} pulping {{is used to}} chemically disband the lignin found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the cellulose fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical <b>pulping</b> <b>can</b> be characterized by two main methods: sulfate (Kraft process) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate <b>pulping</b> <b>can</b> be performed {{on a wide range}} of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.|$|R

The brightness of the treated pulp increased 1. 84 %ISO, light scattering coefficient alse increased, opacity coefficient decreased. Tearing index, breaking length and bursting index respectively increased by 15. 7 %, 9. 07 % and 14. 85 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve press dewatering and paper properties of kraft pulps by controlling hornification and internal fibrillation. Hornification was induced by drying and by pressing pulps, and internal fibrillation was developed in refining. Hornification and internal fibrillation {{are related to the}} change in fibre pore structure. In this thesis, a thermoporosimetry technique with cyclohexane as an absorbate was tested and found suitable for detecting the change in pore size and pore volume during drying and refining. The results show that for never-dried fibres, refining mainly expands the large pores in the cell wall, whereas it has only a slight effect on the small pores. Drying closes most of the large pores and a substantial amount of the small pores. For dried fibres, refining not only expands the large pores but also reopens the small pores to a certain extent. Even though the pore volume of previously dried <b>pulps</b> <b>can</b> be recovered by refining (i. e., the <b>pulp</b> <b>can</b> be reswollen), some small pores, which are closed in drying, ar...|$|R
