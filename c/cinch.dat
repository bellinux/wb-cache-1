500|$|Regardless of her {{popularity}} and sex appeal, Monroe wished to present {{more of her}} acting range, and {{in the summer of}} 1952 she appeared in two commercially successful dramas. The first was Fritz Lang's Clash by Night, for which she was loaned to RKO and played a fish cannery worker; to prepare, she spent time in a real fish cannery in Monterey. She received positive reviews for her performance: The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] "she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation", and Variety wrote that she [...] "has an ease of delivery which makes her a <b>cinch</b> for popularity". The second film was the thriller Don't Bother to Knock, in which she starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which Zanuck had assigned for her to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic role. It received mixed reviews from critics, with Crowther deeming her too inexperienced for the difficult role, and Variety blaming the script for the film's problems.|$|E

500|$|The team {{set about}} taking time {{back in the}} high {{mountain}} stage 18, ending with an hors catégorie arrival at the Col du Galibier. Monfort and Posthuma both made the morning breakaway, providing support for Andy Schleck after he attacked out {{of the group of}} overall favorites on the ascent of the Col d'Izoard. Schleck bridged first to Posthuma and then to Monfort, the latter guiding him down the [...] long descent of the Izoard, as Schleck is a superlative climber but a poor descender. After catching and surpassing all other remaining members from the morning breakaway, Monfort then rode an extremely lengthy and strenuous pull ahead of Schleck until [...] remained in the stage, when he finally bonked and dropped back. This left Andy free to climb the Galibier solo, taking the stage win alone two minutes ahead of the next rider, which happened to be brother Fränk. He rode clear of the group of the race's top riders in the final kilometer, gaining eight seconds against Evans. While the team's tactics on the day appeared to <b>cinch</b> the yellow jersey for Andy, prior race leader Voeckler retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Julia Seaton, a rich heiress, has two suitors, Dr. John Seymour, a wealthy physician, and Richard Calhoun, a poor lawyer. They both propose in the same evening, but while inclined to prefer John, Julia has not yet made a definite choice, and tells both {{to come back in}} a month for their answer. The scene shifts to the squalid home of the charwoman, Mrs. Smith, who, ill in bed and unable to earn the rent money, is about to be evicted with her tiny daughter May. The mother faints from weakness, and May rushes for a doctor. She sees Seymour's sign in a window, and asks him to help her mother. Then the man shows his caliber. Because she has no money, he turns her away. Calhoun, the lawyer, meets May, learns of her plight, and, although poor, pays the overdue rent, and the family moved back in the house. But the privation she has suffered proved fatal to the mother and tiny May is left an orphan. On her death bed, Mrs. Smith is found by Miss Seaton, who is visiting the poor quarters on charity work, and on the charwoman's passing, society girl adopts poor little May. The child becomes a happy member of the Seaton family {{and at the end of}} the month is a fast friend of the kind-hearted Julia. At the end of a month, too, Julia prepares to decide who shall be her life partner, as promised. But it is little May who really decides. At sight of Seymour, she recalls the physician who turned her away, and denounces him to his own and Miss Julia's face. May recognizes Calhoun as the friend in need, and tells Miss Julia so. The latter feels that Calhoun is a real man and would make a splendid husband, so it's a <b>cinch</b> that 'the best man wins.'" ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Ring annuloplasty {{prevents}} acute ischemic mitral regurgitation in sheep, {{but it also}} abolishes normal mitral annular and posterior leaflet dynamics. We investigated a novel surgical {{approach of}} simple septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> with sutures to treat acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. Methods: Nine adult sheep underwent implantation of multiple radiopaque markers on the left ventricle, mitral anulus, and mitral leaflets. A septal-lateral transannular suture was anchored to the midseptal mitral anulus and externalized to a tourniquet through the midlateral mitral anulus and left ventricular wall. Open-chest animals were studied immediately postoperatively. Acute ischemic mitral regurgitation was induced by means of proximal left circumflex artery snare occlusion, and 3 progressive steps of septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> (each 2 - 3 mm suture tightening for 5 seconds) were performed with the transannular suture. Biplane videofluoroscopy for 3 -dimensional marker coordinates and transesophageal echocardiography were performed continuously before and during left circumflex ischemia and septal-lateral annular <b>cinching.</b> Results: Acute left circumflex ischemia caused ischemic mitral regurgitation (+ 0. 5 ± 0. 4 [baseline] vs + 2. 0 ± 0. 7 [ischemia]; P =. 005; scale, + 0 - 4), which decreased progressively with each step of septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> and was eliminated during the third step (ischemic mitral regurgitation, + 0. 6 ± 0. 5; P = not significant vs baseline). The third step of septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> decreased the septal-lateral diameter by 6. 0 ± 2. 6 mm (P =. 005); however, mitral anulus area reduction (8. 5 % ± 1. 0 % and 6. 9 % ± 1. 9 % for ischemic mitral regurgitation and septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> step 3, respectively; P =. 006) and posterior leaflet excursion (50 ° ± 9 ° and 44 ° ± 11 ° for regurgitation and annular <b>cinching</b> step 3, respectively; P =. 002) throughout the cardiac cycle were affected only mildly. Normal mitral annular 3 -dimensional shape was maintained with septal-lateral annular <b>cinching.</b> Conclusions: Isolated 22 % ± 10 % reduction in mitral annular septal-lateral dimension abolished acute ischemic mitral regurgitation in normal sheep hearts while allowing near-normal mitral annular and posterior leaflet dynamic motion. Septal-lateral annular <b>cinching</b> may represent a simple method for the surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation, either as an adjunctive technique or alone, which helps preserve physiologic annular and leaflet function.

2500|$|A corset was {{required}} to achieve the tiny waistline shown in fashion plates. Already de rigueur in the wardrobes of military officers, men of all middle and upper classes began wearing them, out of the necessity {{to fit in with}} the fashionable gentry. [...] Usually referred to as [...] "girdles", [...] "belts" [...] or [...] "vests" [...] (as [...] "corsets" [...] and [...] "stays" [...] were considered feminine terms) they were used to <b>cinch</b> the waist to sometimes tiny proportions, although sometimes they were simply whalebone-stiffened waistcoats with lacing in the back. [...] Many contemporary cartoonists of the time poked fun at the repressed nature of the tightlaced gentlemen, although the style grew in popularity nonetheless.

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{proprietary}} systems {{that seek to}} combine the convenience of step-in systems with the control levels attainable with strap-ins.

[...] The back flips down and allows the boot to slide in; it's then flipped up and locked into place with a clamp, eliminating the need to loosen and then re-tighten straps every time the rider frees and then re-secures their rear foot. The rider's boot is held down by an adjustable webbing that covers most of the foot. Newer Flow models have connected straps in place of the webbing found on older models; these straps are also micro adjustable. In 2004, K2 released the <b>Cinch</b> series, a similar rear-entry binding; riders slip their foot in as they would a Flow binding, however rather than webbing, the foot is held down by straps.|$|E

2500|$|While {{waiting to}} repair the airplane, the Signal Corps decided to seek a more {{favorable}} climate location for flying during the winter. Foulois was directed to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where he was directed by CSO Allen to [...] "teach yourself to fly." [...] He did so, and at 9:30 a.m. on March 2, 1910, on the Arthur MacArthur parade field made four flights on S.C. No. 1, which included his first solo takeoff, first solo landing, and first crash. Over the next fifteen months, Foulois modified S.C. No. 1's elevators at the instructions in correspondence from Orville Wright, and demonstrated {{the use of the}} Wright B aircraft for aerial mapping, photography, reconnaissance {{and the use of the}} radio while airborne. To end the requirement of using a 60-foot launch rail to take off, he drew up plans for and installed wheels in place of skids, and equipped the S.C. No. 1 with the first seat belt, using a four-foot leather <b>cinch</b> obtained from the cavalry saddlery. As the result of repeated crashes and repairs, many caused by Foulois being [...] "ground shy" [...] (the result of his having no formal training in landing an airplane), S.C. No. 1 became unflyable, and in February 1911 the Army leased a Wright Model B from Robert Collier. Because Foulois was unfamiliar with the type, the Wright Company sent Philip O.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The {{present in}} vitro study evaluated, {{by means of}} the {{photoelastic}} technique, the effects generated by the Connecticut Intrusion Arch (CIA), with a 90 o bend on the distal surface of molar tubes and using the 4 x 2 appliance on the anterior and posterior regions of the upper dental arch. Methods: Five models were manufactured, in which two different clinical situations were correlated: 1) use of intrusion arch not <b>cinched</b> back and transpalatal bar for anchorage (Group 1); 2) use of intrusion arch <b>cinched</b> back and transpalatal bar for anchorage (Group 2). Stress generated in the apical and middle regions of tooth roots of maxillary anterior teeth and maxillary first molars was evaluated. Results: Taking a reference value of 1. 0 MPa = 100 %, qualitative descriptive analysis was performed, which showed uniformity between stress values in the apical region of anterior teeth of both groups (G 1 and G 2). In the posterior region, for models with the arch <b>cinched</b> back (G 2), stress remained within 100 %. As for G 1 models (with the arch not <b>cinched</b> back), variations in the mesial surface of first molars were observed, with an increase of 20 % in the generated stress. The apical region did not undergo any changes, while in the distal region of molars there was a decrease of 20 % in stress. Conclusion: Laboratory results revealed differences in stress between Groups 1 and 2 in the molar region, thereby indicating that there was a tendency towards mesial root tipping of first molars when the distal end of the CIA was not <b>cinched</b> back...|$|R
