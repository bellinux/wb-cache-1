25|$|The Chisso Corporation {{first opened}} a {{chemical}} factory in Minamata in 1908. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan's chemical industry, branching out into production of acetylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, vinyl chloride, and octanol, among others. The Minamata factory {{became the most}} advanced in all of Japan, {{both before and after}} World War II. The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into Minamata Bay through the factory wastewater. These pollutants had an environmental impact.

Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company.|$|E

5000|$|Positive {{accounting}} can {{be associated}} with the contractual view of the firm. The firm is viewed as “a nexus of contracts” and accounting one tool to facilitate the formation and performance of contracts. Under this view, accounting practices evolve to mitigate contracting costs by establishing ex ante agreement among varying parties. For example, positive accounting postulates that conservatism in accounting -in this sense defined conditionally as requiring lower (higher) standards of verifiability to recognize losses (gains)- has origins in contract markets, including managerial compensation contracts and lender debt contracts. As an example, absent conservatism, managerial <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> may reward managers based on current reports that later evidence indicates were unwarranted.|$|E
50|$|The {{petition}} {{was initiated}} by the German Communist Party (KPD), who were then joined, with some reluctance, by the Social Democrats (SPD). It {{was not only the}} KPD and SPD voters who supported expropriation without compensation. Many supporters of the Centre Party and the German Democratic Party (DDP) were also in favour. In some regions voters of conservative national parties also supported expropriation. Associations of the aristocracy, the churches of the two major denominations, large-scale farming and industrial interest groups as well as right-wing parties and associations supported the dynastic houses. Their calls for a boycott finally brought about the failure of the referendum. Expropriation without compensation was replaced by individual <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements,</b> which regulated the distribution of the estates among the states and the former ruling families.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the next}} four decades, Achenbaum was {{chairman}} {{of a series of}} marketing management consultancies, including Canter, Achenbaum and Associates, which he co-founded with longtime colleague Stanley Canter in 1974, [...] and Achenbaum, Bogda Associates, which he formed with Pete Bogda in 1993. These firms advised more than 150 blue chip American and global companies. Notable clients included Procter and Gamble, GE, Nestle, Kraft, Honda, and the United States Department of Defense. [...] Achenbaum regularly spoke out about emerging trends and the future of advertising and marketing, challenging many of the accepted business practices of the day. [...] He wrote weekly columns for Ad Age and Marketing Week in the 1980s. [...] He generated considerable controversy by challenging {{the nature of the relationship}} between advertising agencies and their clients. His consulting work contributed to major changes in both the advertising agency selection process and the development of negotiated agency <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2005, a {{petition}} was filed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on the Rio Negro Massacre, {{and it is}} in the admissibility stage. Meanwhile, the government has sought to deal with the petitioners and victims of over 100 complaints filed against Guatemala in the IACHR, in some cases negotiating resettlement and <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements.</b> These, however, have often been conducted under the threat of violence or massacre and have largely been aborted, halted, or reneged after agreement had been reached. Even when “paid” on paper, remediation has often failed to reach the intended recipients. Entitlements such as the provision of free electricity have vanished, and since they were usually made by verbal promise alone, no documentation exists by which to defend the rights. Inadequate farm and household land provided through resettlement has contributed significantly to the severe poverty and malnutrition of the region (Center for Political Ecology, Chixoy Dam Legacy Issues Study, 2005). Some of the cases, though, have been resolved, and financial compensation {{has been paid to the}} families of a number of individuals who disappeared or suffered summary execution. In a comparable case in 2000, families who survived the 1982 Las Dos Erres Massacre were awarded a total of 1.82 million US$ in compensation (Summary record of the 1940th meeting: Guatemala. 10/08/2001. CCPR/C/SR.1940.) along with a formal excuse from President Alfonso Portillo on behalf of the state.|$|E
50|$|Hard-pressed by Bonaparte, now firmly at {{the helm}} in France as First Consul, the Empire was obliged soon after Lunéville {{to take on the}} task of drawing up a {{definitive}} compensation plan (Entschädigungsplan). The Imperial Diet resolved to entrust that task to the Emperor, as plenipotentiary of the Empire, while it intended to reserve the final decision to itself. Not wanting to bear the full onus of the changes that were bound to occur under French dictate, Francis II declined. After months of deliberations, a compromise was reached in November 1801 to delegate the compensation task to an Imperial Deputation (Reichsdeputation), with France to act as 'mediator'. The Deputation consisted of the plenipotentiaries of the Electors of Mainz, Saxony, Brandenburg/Prussia, Bohemia and Bavaria, and of the Duke of Württemberg, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.Soon after Lunéville, the key German rulers entitled to compensation moved quickly to secure their compensation directly with France, and Paris was soon flooded with envoys bearing shopping lists of coveted territories. The French government encouraged the movement. Bonaparte left the details to his foreign minister Talleyrand, who famously lined his pockets with bribes. Meanwhile, Bonaparte, who had been courting the new Tsar Alexander I, replied favourably to the latter's wish to become involved in the process as co-mediator. On 19 October 1801 the two countries signed an agreement to act jointly as the “mediating Powers”. Essentially, Alexander, whose wife and mother belonged to the princely houses of Baden and Württemberg, wanted to favor his various German relatives and this concurred with France's long-standing aim to strengthen the southern states of Baden, Württemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt and Bavaria, strategically located between France and Austria, the arch-foe.Hectic discussions and dealings went on, not only with the mediating Powers and between the various princes, but within the various governments as well. Inside the Prussian cabinet, one group pushed for expansion westward into Westphalia while another favored expansion southward into Franconia, with the pro-Westphalian group finally prevailing. Between July 1801 and May 1802, preliminary <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> were signed with Bavaria, Württemberg, and Prussia and others were concluded less formally with Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel and other mid-level states.|$|E

40|$|EBITDA, {{earnings}} before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, {{is used by}} {{many firms}} {{as a measure of}} performance in financial covenants and incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements.</b> In 2009, when the FASB, in conjunction with the IASB, likely begins requiring firms to report virtually all leases as capital leases, we expect calculated measures of EBITDA to increase. As a result, firms may find unexpected slack in financial covenants and increases in incentive compensation that are unrelated to real improvements in performance. In anticipation of the change in accounting for leases, companies will want to revise contracts that employ EBITDA to ensure that unanticipated consequences are avoided. This research report examines the effects of lease capitalization on EBITDA in cases where it is employed in financial agreements. Our focus is on companies noted to employ EBITDA in financial covenants or incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> with significant exposure to operating leases. For a sample of 25 companies we recalculated EBITDA, treating operating leases as though they were capital-lease commitments. For some firms, we found significant increases in EBITDA, with a sample-wide median increase of 7. 7...|$|E
