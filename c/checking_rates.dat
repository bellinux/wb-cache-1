H 577 P BRE 2016 Changxvi, 239 pages :illustrationsIn {{the past}} few decades, {{universities}} have established {{a close relationship with}} industry, thus placing university-industry technology transfer at the forefront of academia, industry practice and policymaking. Discussions in this regard are based primarily on the assumption that university faculty voluntarily disclose details on inventions to the universities with which they are affiliated. Evidence from the US and European countries illustrate, however, that a sizeable number of faculty inventions are not assigned solely to universities. Many studies also point out that the invention disclosure process is affected by moral hazard and adverse selection. Although existing research has demonstrated the negative influence of invention disclosure on university technology transfer, few studies have been devoted to faculty invention disclosure in the context of Chinese universities. This scarcity is attributed to considerable difficulty in data collection. To fill the aforementioned research gaps, this thesis investigates the reality that surrounds the patent assignment practices of university faculty in mainland China. To this end, theoretical game models that simulate stakeholder strategies are developed. First, I create a special dataset that comprises 18, 435 faculty/patent pairs. The investigation indicates that from 2002 to 2012 13. 16 % of pairs are not solely assigned to universities in 35 top patent application Chinese universities. The empirical study conducted at the individual faculty level correlates types of patent assignment with the characteristics of inventions, the intellectual eminence of universities and policies for licensing. The study emphasises the following insights: patent assignment changes depending on research field; university assignment is positively related to patent claims but negatively related to the number of co-inventors; and university royalty and equality policies play different roles in the patent assignment practices of university faculty. The empirical research carried out at the organisational level is intended to analyse the influence of university characteristics, R&D input/output and external environment. The results reveal that university faculty tend to attribute low-quality inventions to the universities with which they are connected. Second, I scrutinise the influence of patent checking on faculty invention disclosure and university licensing strategies, after which I develop a static game model specifically for examining such influence. I found that patent evaluation is negatively related to invention disclosure but that it influences high-value inventions to a lesser extent. I propose that the requirement for universities to match checking policies, licensing strategies and <b>checking</b> <b>rates</b> are negatively related to inventor share rates. This study also explores the process of technology transfer from faculty inventors to industrial firms. The theoretical results uncover a series of conditions necessary for invention disclosure and commercial model selection. They also serve as bases for formulating an optimal revenue distribution scheme and patent licensing contract. The empirical results confirm the validity of the theoretical conclusions and provide valuable practical implications. Moreover, this research introduces the concept of a university technology transfer chain and generates a game model that enables the investigation of a double moral hazard problem. I found that the licence contract commonly adhered to in Chinese universities cannot reduce such hazard. The portfolio contract with royalties and revenue sharing successfully works only under specific circumstances, but the side-payment self-enforcing contract can effectively coordinate all stakeholder behaviours. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} empirical and theoretical insights derived in this work, the influence of university policies and government-related measures is qualitatively analysed. The policies and measures reviewed include regulations on the ownership of university inventions, patent checking, government funding and teachers' key performance indicators. This research provides new insights for faculty who are interested in patent application and presents implications for university administration and policymaking.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty radiata pine boards were dried using {{different}} methods (air drying, commercial kiln drying and laboratory kiln drying) to study the effect of knot, wood and seasoning variables {{on the nature of}} knot checking. Among the knot variables, the largest knot group (diameter> 75 mm) was found associated with the highest <b>check</b> <b>rate</b> and the most severe checks. Medium size group (25 mm < diameter ≤ 75 mm) had significantly lower <b>check</b> <b>rate.</b> Face knots were significantly more liable to cracking than any type else. The major check directions of a knot generally ran across the symmetrical axes of the knot. In wood variables, due to lower number of medium size knots butt half had higher <b>check</b> <b>rate</b> than upper part of stem. After studying the density and check ratio of northern outer wood, southern outer wood and core wood, a reverse relation was found between the density and the check ratio. Final moisture content affected knot checking directly because it is proportional to shrinkage. Temperature did not show significant influence. Air dried timbers, especially those exposed to air without shield, had more severe checks than those exposed to other drying conditions. There were no relationships found among sawn pattern, dimensions of boards and <b>check</b> <b>rate</b> of knots...|$|R

Results: Both subjective and objective criteria were rated as significantly more important in obsessional checkers than in controls; obsessional checkers also used more criteria overall for the termination of the <b>check,</b> and <b>rated</b> more criteria as “extremely important” than the control groups.
