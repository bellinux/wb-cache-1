5|$|<b>Camouflage</b> for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as <b>camouflage</b> officers. Ship <b>camouflage</b> developed via conspicuous dazzle <b>camouflage</b> schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship <b>camouflage</b> has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to <b>camouflage</b> them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made painted <b>camouflage</b> less effective, though inshore craft {{continue}} to use <b>camouflage</b> schemes alongside anti-radar stealth.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional <b>camouflage</b> generally less effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar <b>camouflage.</b> However, <b>camouflage</b> may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have <b>camouflage</b> reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E

25|$|Majerus, et al., (2000) {{have shown}} that {{peppered}} moths are cryptically <b>camouflaged</b> against their backgrounds when they rest in the boughs of trees. It is clear that in human visible wavelengths, typica are <b>camouflaged</b> against lichens and carbonaria against plain bark. However, birds are capable of seeing ultraviolet light that humans cannot see. Using an ultraviolet-sensitive video camera, Majerus et al. showed that typica reflect ultraviolet light in a speckled fashion and are <b>camouflaged</b> against crustose lichens common on branches, both in ultraviolet and human-visible wavelengths. However, typica are not as well <b>camouflaged</b> against foliose lichens common on tree trunks; though they are <b>camouflaged</b> in human wavelengths, in ultraviolet wavelengths, foliose lichens do not reflect ultraviolet light.|$|R
40|$|Semiconductor {{supply chain}} is {{increasingly}} getting exposed to Reverse Engineering (RE) of Intellectual Property (IP). <b>Camouflaging</b> of gates in integrated circuits are typically employed {{to hide the}} gate functionality to prevent reverse engineering. The functionalities of these gates cannot be found by De-layering as they don’t leave any layout clues. Adversaries perform reverse engineering by replacing the <b>camouflaged</b> gate with the known gate and by developing custom software to determine test patterns. These test patterns are {{used to analyze the}} outputs and to conclude the functionality of the <b>camouflaged</b> gate. In this thesis, we show that reverse engineering of <b>camouflaged</b> design can be performed by exploiting the test features of commercial/publicly available Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tools. We also propose controllability/observability and Hamming Distance sensitivity based metric to select target gates for <b>camouflaging.</b> Simulations on ISCAS 85 benchmarks shows that the proposed techniques can increase the reverse engineering effort significantly by <b>camouflaging</b> small fraction of gates...|$|R

5|$|Aircraft <b>camouflage</b> {{is the use}} of <b>camouflage</b> on {{military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground <b>camouflage.</b> Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night <b>camouflage</b> schemes. There are trade-offs between <b>camouflage</b> and aircraft recognition markings, and between <b>camouflage</b> and weight. Accordingly, visible light <b>camouflage</b> has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Camouflage</b> {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from <b>camouflage</b> on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main <b>camouflage</b> methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while <b>camouflage</b> becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
2500|$|J.W. Tutt was {{the first}} to propose the [...] "differential bird {{predation}} hypothesis" [...] in 1896, as a mechanism of natural selection. The melanic morphs were better <b>camouflaged</b> against the bark of trees without foliose lichen, whereas the typica morphs were better <b>camouflaged</b> against trees with lichens. As a result, birds would find and eat those morphs that were not <b>camouflaged</b> with increased frequency.|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of <b>camouflaged</b> objects {{is important for}} industrial inspection, medical diagnoses, and military applications. Conventional supervised learning methods for hyperspectral images can be a feasible solution. Such approaches, however, require a priori information of a <b>camouflaged</b> object and background. This letter proposes a fully autonomous feature selection and <b>camouflaged</b> object detection method based on the online analysis of spectral and spatial features. The statistical distance metric can generate candidate feature bands and further analysis of the entropy-based spatial grouping property can trim the useless feature bands. <b>Camouflaged</b> objects can be detected better with less computational complexity by optical spectral-spatial feature analysis...|$|R

5|$|<b>Camouflage</b> {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, <b>camouflage</b> was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern <b>camouflage</b> textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. <b>Camouflage</b> is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of <b>camouflage</b> have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital <b>camouflage</b> patterns made of pixels.|$|E
5|$|Companies closely {{associated}} with <b>camouflage</b> patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, Stüssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and overprinting genuine military surplus fabric; others use <b>camouflage</b> patterns in bright colours such as pink or purple. Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated <b>camouflage</b> patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|Cott {{served in}} the Leicestershire Regiment of the British Army as a <b>camouflage</b> expert from 1919–1922, and, during the Second World War, with the Royal Engineers as a <b>camouflage</b> {{instructor}} from 1939–1945. Cott was chief instructor at the <b>Camouflage</b> Development and Training Camp at Helwan, Egypt, under filmmaker Geoffrey Barkas from its inception in November 1941.|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor {{supply chain}} is {{increasingly}} getting exposed to variety of security attacks such as Trojan insertion, cloning, counterfeiting, reverse engineering (RE) and piracy of Intellectual Property (IP) due to involvement of untrusted parties. <b>Camouflaging</b> of gates {{has been proposed}} to hide the functionality of gates. However, gate <b>camouflaging</b> is associated with significant area, power and delay overhead. In this paper, we propose <b>camouflaging</b> of interconnects using multiplexers (muxes) to protect the IP. A transistor threshold voltage-defined pass transistor mux is proposed to prevent its reverse engineering since transistor threshold voltage is opaque to the adversary. The proposed mux {{with more than one}} input, hides the original connectivity of the net. The <b>camouflaged</b> design operates at nominal voltage and obeys conventional reliability limits. A small fraction of nets can be <b>camouflaged</b> to increase the RE effort extremely high while keeping the overhead low. We propose controllability, observability and random net selection strategy for <b>camouflaging.</b> Simulation results indicate 15 - 33 % area, 25 - 44 % delay and 14 - 29 % power overhead when 5 - 15 % nets are <b>camouflaged</b> using the proposed 2 : 1 mux. By increasing the mux size to 4 : 1, 8 : 1, and 16 : 1, the RE effort can be further improved with small area, delay, and power penalty. Comment: 6 pages, 12 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} <b>camouflage,</b> despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed <b>camouflage</b> netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at <b>camouflage</b> practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime <b>camouflage.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination <b>camouflage</b> using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light <b>camouflage</b> redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in <b>camouflage</b> schemes; recent experiments have again explored active <b>camouflage</b> systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital <b>camouflage</b> patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral <b>camouflage</b> at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a flow based architecture for network traffic <b>camouflaging.</b> We aim at hiding both the message traffic pattern {{and the fact}} that <b>camouflaging</b> itself is taking place, {{while at the same time}} guaranteeing the QoS requirement of the message flow. The idea is to embed the packets of the message flow into the packets of another flow, denoted as carrier flow, which in turn may be generated by a well known network service. We say that message flows act as parasites while the carrier flows are the hosts. We study issues in selecting the carrier to improve the system’s performance while satisfying both security and QoS requirements. A flow-based traffic <b>camouflaging</b> prototype system has been realized. The experimental evaluation shows that the use of parasite flows effectively hide both the message traffic pattern {{and the fact that}} <b>camouflaging</b> is taking place.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is threefold. First, it {{examines}} nuances that specific <b>camouflaging</b> perspectives provide to enhance traditional and widely adopted theories in social and environmental accounting. Second, within research on <b>camouflaging,</b> the paper stimulates multidisciplinarity and cross-fertilization by presenting recent developments in organizational theory that hold promise for enhancing our understanding of <b>camouflaging.</b> Finally, it discusses how the research contributions published in this special issue help advance the notion of corporate <b>camouflaging.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper makes use of an extensive literature review and discusses research implications related with the choice of theoretical framework. Findings – The idea of <b>camouflaging</b> may provide narrower and more refined perspective(s) that can help researchers delve deeper into their topic of interest and thereby support potentially substantive contributions to the field. Originality/value – The paper offers suggestions for future social and environmental accounting research that adopts the concepts of organized hypocrisy, organizational façades and functional stupidity into the study of organizations...|$|R

5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat <b>camouflage.</b> Moving objects with disruptive <b>camouflage</b> patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' <b>camouflage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Military <b>camouflage</b> {{is part of}} the art of {{military}} deception. The main objective {{of military}} <b>camouflage</b> is to deceive the enemy as to the presence, position and intentions of military formations. <b>Camouflage</b> techniques include concealment, disguise, and dummies, applied to troops, vehicles, and positions.|$|E
5|$|Multi-scale <b>camouflage</b> {{is a type}} of {{military}} <b>camouflage</b> combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital <b>camouflage</b> pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide <b>camouflage</b> over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant <b>camouflage),</b> in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal <b>camouflage.</b> Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E

40|$|Integrated circuit (IC) <b>camouflaging</b> is a {{promising}} technique {{to protect the}} design of a chip from reverse engineering. However, recent work has shown that even <b>camouflaged</b> ICs can be reverse engineered from the observed input/output behaviour of a chip using SAT solvers. However, these so-called SAT attacks have so far targeted only <b>camouflaged</b> combinational circuits. For <b>camouflaged</b> sequential circuits, the SAT attack requires that the internal state of the circuit is controllable and observable via the scan chain. It has been implicitly assumed that restricting scan chain access increases the security of <b>camouflaged</b> ICs from reverse engineering attacks. In this paper, we develop a new attack methodology to decamouflage sequential circuits without scan access. Our attack uses a model checker (a more powerful reasoning tool than a SAT solver) to find a discriminating set of input sequences, i. e., one that is sufficient to determine the functionality of <b>camouflaged</b> gates. We propose several refinements, including the use of a bounded model checker, and sufficient conditions for determining when a set of input sequences is discriminating to improve the run-time and scalabilty of our attack. Our attack is able to decamouflage a large sequential benchmark circuit that implements a subset of the VIPER processor...|$|R
5|$|No Admiralty <b>camouflage</b> {{section was}} {{established}} until October 1940.

40|$|Autobiographical {{descriptions}} and clinician observations {{suggest that some}} individuals with autism, particularly females, ‘camouflage’ their social communication difficulties, which may require considerable cognitive effort and lead to increased stress, anxiety and depression. Using data from 60 age- and IQ-matched {{men and women with}} autism (without intellectual disability), we operationalized <b>camouflaging</b> in adults with autism {{for the first time as}} the quantitative discrepancy between the person’s ‘external’ behavioural presentation in social–interpersonal contexts (measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and the person’s ‘internal’ status (dispositional traits measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient and social cognitive capability measured by the ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ Test). We found that the operationalized <b>camouflaging</b> measure was not significantly correlated with age or IQ. On average, women with autism had higher <b>camouflaging</b> scores than men with autism (Cohen’s d[*]=[*] 0. 98), with substantial variability in both groups. Greater <b>camouflaging</b> was associated with more depressive symptoms in men and better signal-detection sensitivity in women with autism. The neuroanatomical association with <b>camouflaging</b> score was largely sex/gender-dependent and significant only in women: from reverse inference, the most correlated cognitive terms were about emotion and memory. The underlying constructs, measurement, mechanisms, consequences and heterogeneity of <b>camouflaging</b> in autism warrant further investigation...|$|R
