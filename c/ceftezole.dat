40|$|<b>Ceftezole,</b> a new {{cephalosporin}} derivative, {{was compared}} with cefazolin, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. Data obtained {{indicate that it}} is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, with almost identical antimicrobial activity against pathogenic organisms isolated from patients. The therapeutic effect of <b>ceftezole</b> on experimental infections in mice was similar to that of cefazolin and was superior to that of cephalothin. The binding of <b>ceftezole</b> to serum proteins was somewhat less than that of cefazolin. The concentrations of <b>ceftezole</b> in the sera of test animals and human volunteers were determined after intramuscular injection of 20 mg/kg and after a single dose of 500 mg, respectively. The concentration of <b>ceftezole</b> in the serum of volunteers peaked at 24. 9 μg/ml 15 min after injection and remained effective (about 2. 6 μg/ml) at 4 h. The half-life in serum under the same conditions was 56 min, i. e., about one-half that of cefazolin. The 24 -h urinary recovery rate was 87. 5 %. Most of the administered <b>ceftezole</b> was excreted unchanged mainly through the urinary tract. The biliary excretion rate in SD strain rats after intramuscular injection of 20 mg/kg was about 4. 4 %. As compared with commercially available cephalosporins, <b>ceftezole</b> was second only to cefazolin in biliary excretion rate. Various tissue levels of <b>ceftezole</b> in animals were higher than cephalothin but, with the exception of renal levels in the early stage after administration, were lower than cefazolin...|$|E
40|$|The susceptibilities of 52 {{clinical}} isolates of Bacteroides fragilis to five monoanionic cephalosporins were examined. Cefoperazone {{showed the}} highest antibacterial activity, followed by <b>ceftezole,</b> cefazolin, cefamandole, and cephalothin. There were {{two groups of}} resistant strains: one group (ca. 15 %), of which B. fragilis G- 232 was a typical sample, was resistant to <b>ceftezole</b> (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), cefazolin (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), and cephalothin (MIC, 200 micrograms/ml) but not cefoperazone (MIC, 6. 25 micrograms/ml) or cefamandole (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml). On the basis of studies of stability to beta-lactamase, outer membrane permeation, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), we conclude that decreased affinity for PBP 3 may {{play an important role}} in the resistance to <b>ceftezole,</b> cefazolin, and cephalothin in B. fragilis G- 232. Another group (also ca. 15 %), of which B. fragilis G- 242 was a representative, was resistant to all five cephalosporins (MIC, 100 to 400 micrograms/ml) and produced a high amount of beta-lactamase. Similar broad-spectrum resistance was seen in a mutant of strain G- 232 that had a greater-than- 30 -fold increase in beta-lactamase production...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ceftezole</b> (CTZ), a new {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic, was clinically {{evaluated in}} urinary tract infections including chronic complicated UTI. Clinical data were analysed and evaluated based on "Criteria for clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agent on UTI". The results obtained were as follows: 1) <b>Ceftezole</b> was administered twice daily to 20 cases, 2 cases with acute simple UTI and 18 cases with chronic complicated UTI, at {{a dose of}} 4000 mg per day by intravenous injection for several days. Overall clinical efficacy {{was found to be}} excellent in one case, good in 8, poor in 2 and unevaluated in 9. Effective ratio was 81. 8 %. Poor effective cases were only found in the indwelling catheter group. 2) In sensitivity test using disc, 2 strains out of 3 in Proteus and 2 out of 2 in Pseudomonas were not susceptible to CTZ. All of isolated strains in E. coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were susceptible. 3) Bacteriological response was found in 15 strains out of isolated 20 strains. Tendency to poor response was found in Serratia, Pseudomonas and Proteus. 4) No allergic reaction was observed. Slight elevation of serum transaminase values without symptom was found in 2 cases, whose elevation was transient and normalized with discontinuance of drug. Jaundice, malaise and remarkable elevation of serum transaminase were found in one case during administration. In this case, however, HBs-antigen was positive probably due to previous blood transfusion. These findings obviously suggested viral hepatitis unrelated to drug administration...|$|E
40|$|Epileptogenic {{activities}} of certain cephalosporins administered intravenously into rats with stainless steel electrodes implanted into the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were investigated. At doses {{of less than}} 200 mg/kg, the cephalosporins did not induce any EEG or behavioral signs. At doses greater than 500 mg/kg, seizure effects were noticed in both EGGs and behavior in the decreasing order of <b>ceftezole,</b> cefotiam, cefazolin and cephaloridine. Especially at a dose of 1, 000 mg/kg, seizure signs were noticed. Effects of diazepam, phenobarbital and phenytoin in preventing generalized seizures induced by intraventricular injection of 100 μg cefazolin were investigated. Intravenous administrations of diazepam and phenobarbital inhibited cefazolin-induced seizures markedly. The ID 50 (s) of inhibition of seizure patterns in EEG were 3. 4 mg/kg and 30. 5 mg/kg, respectively, and the ID 50 (s) of seizure behavior suppression were 4. 7 mg/kg and 49 mg/kg respectively. However, phenytoin did not repress cefazolin-induced seizures even at 100 mg/kg (i. v.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{epileptogenic}} {{activities of}} several beta-lactam antibiotics were compared following their intracerebroventricular administration in rats. Different convulsant potencies were observed {{among the various}} beta-lactam antibiotics tested, but the epileptogenic patterns were similar. The patterns consisted of an initial phase characterized by wet-dog shakes followed by head tremor, nodding, and clonic convulsions. After the largest doses of beta-lactam antibiotics injected, clonus of all four limbs and/or the trunk, rearing, jumping, falling down, escape response, transient tonic-clonic seizures, and sometimes generalized seizures were observed, followed by a postictal period with a fatal outcome. At a dose of 0. 033 mumol per rat, cefazolin was the most powerful epileptogenic compound among the drugs tested. It was approximately three times more potent than benzylpenicillin in generating a response and much more potent than other cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and cefamandole. No epileptogenic signs were observed with equimolar doses of cefotaxime, cefonicid, cefixime, and ceftizoxime in this model. The more convulsant compounds (i. e., cefazolin and <b>ceftezole)</b> are both characterized {{by the presence of}} a tetrazole nucleus at position 7 and show a marked chemical similarity to pentylenetetrazole. Imipenem and meropenem, the two carbapenems tested, also showed epileptogenic properties, but imipenem was more potent than meropenem, with a convulsant potency similar to those of <b>ceftezole</b> and benzylpenicillin. In addition, the monobactam aztreonam possessed convulsant properties more potent than those of cefoperazone and cefamandole. This suggest that the beta-lactam ring is a possible determinant of production of epileptogenic activity, with likely contributory factors in the substitutions at the 7 -aminocephalosporanic or 6 -aminopenicillanic acid that may increase or reduce the epileptogenic properties of the beta-lactam antibiotics. While the structure-activity relationship was also investigated, there seem to be no convincing correlations among the rank order of lipophilicities and the convulsant potencies of the compounds studied. The lack of marked convulsant properties of cefixime, cefonicid, cefuroxime, and cephradine suggests that these antibiotics may interact with a binding site which is different from that by which the beta-lactam antibiotics exert their convulsant effects or may demonstrate a reduced affinity for the relevant site(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{universal}} spectral ranges (4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1) {{for construction}} of quantitative models of homologous analogs of cephalosporins were proposed by evaluating the performance of five spectral ranges and their combinations, using three data sets of cephalosporins for injection, i. e., cefuroxime sodium, ceftriaxone sodium and cefoperazone sodium. Subsequently, the proposed ranges were validated by using eight calibration sets of other homologous analogs of cephalosporins for injection, namely cefmenoxime hydrochloride, <b>ceftezole</b> sodium, cefmetazole, cefoxitin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, cefradine, cephazolin sodium and ceftizoxime sodium. All the constructed quantitative models for the eight kinds of cephalosporins using these universal ranges could fulfill the requirements for quick quantification. After that, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm and infrared (IR) –near infrared (NIR) two-dimensional (2 D) correlation spectral analysis {{were used to determine}} the scientific basis of these two spectral ranges as the universal regions for the construction of quantitative models of cephalosporins. The CARS algorithm demonstrated that the ranges of 4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1 included some key wavenumbers which could be attributed to content changes of cephalosporins. The IR–NIR 2 D spectral analysis showed that certain wavenumbers in these two regions have strong correlations to the structures of those cephalosporins that were easy to degrade...|$|E
40|$|Newton and Abraham(1)) により見い出されたcephalosporin Cが,現在のcephalosporin系抗生物質のprototypeである. この薬物は, {{penicillin}}やchloramphenicolに比較するとその抗菌力は必ずしも強くないが,広域な抗菌スペクトルを有し,penicillinaseに比較的抵抗し得る事が特長であった. その化学構造は,penicillin Gに類似したβ-lactam環を有する 7 -amino-cephalosporanic acidを基本骨格としている事が明らかとなり,この骨格に種々な側鎖を結合する事により,抗菌力,安定性のより優れた半合成の類似化合物が多数作られた. これらの半合成cephalosporin系抗生物質は,グラム陽性球菌,グラム陰性球菌,グラム陽性桿菌及び一部のグラム陰性桿菌に対し殺菌的に作用し,しかも抗菌作用も強く,またpenicillinに対し耐性を獲得した梅毒トレポネーマやブドウ球菌に対しても有効(2)) であるため,広く臨床で使用されている. 口腔外科領域においても,これらのcephalosporin系抗生物質の静脈内投与や点滴静注が繁用されており,しかも投与量は時に数gの大量に達する. 一方,penicillin Gの静脈内投与後に痙攣が誘発されたという報告(3, 4)) があり,また,penicillin Gの大脳皮質内適用後誘発される痙攣は,抗痙攣薬の薬効評価に用いられている程周知である(5, 6)). penicillin Gによる痙攣誘発作用は,その構造内のβ-lactam環が関与すると考えられている(7, 8)). もし,この説が正しければ,その構造式にβ-lactam環をもっているcephalosporin系抗生物質も当然penicillinと同様な痙攣誘発作用をもつ可能性がある. この仮説の当否を調べ,且つ種々な化学構造をもつcephalosporin系抗生物質の痙攣誘発効果の強弱が,それらの化学構造とどのような相関を示すのかを検討する目的で本実験を行なった. Stainless-steel electrodes {{were implanted}} stereotaxically into the hippocampus and amygdala and screw electrodes were fixed in the frontal and accipital skull of male Wistar rats. A cannula guide was also {{implanted in the}} right lateral ventricle. Ten days after operation, unanesthetized rats were placed in an observation box and electroencephalograms were recorded before and after intraventricular injection of the test drugs. Behavioral changes were observed simultaneously. When the epileptogenic properties of 10 cephalosporins and penicillin G as the refefence drugs were compared, cefazolin was definitely more potent than penicillin. At doses higher than 32 μg/head, cefazolin provoked tremendous epileptiform activity; "spike and wave complex" appeared in close session in all tracings for more than 30 min and svere convusion were observed with this repeatedly. Cefotiam {{was a little bit}} stronger than penicillin; both <b>ceftezole</b> and cephaloridine were almost equipotent and their activities were slightly weaker than penicillin. No epileptogenic signs or behavious was observed in the EEGs after 1000 μg/head of cephalexin and cephradine. Cephapirin, cefmetazole, cephalothin and ceftizoxime caused some epileptogenic symptoms but less markedly, diminishing the activity in this order both in EEGs and the behavioral signs between active and inert drugs. The compounds with two different heterocyclic rings substituted at position 7 of the beta-lactam ring and at position 3 of the dihydrothiazine ring (R 2) of 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid were potent in producing epileptogenic signs both in EEGs and behaviors. While the compounds with a heterocyclic ring substituted at either position of 7 -amino-cephalosporanic acid were less potent. The compounds such as cefizoxime, cephalexin and cephradine which had a small group substituted at R 2 produced almost no epileptogenic activity...|$|E
