5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win, or black <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win, or both sides <b>can</b> <b>force</b> at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E
5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs <b>can</b> <b>force</b> humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E

5000|$|Movement Phase : In {{this phase}} a nation may move none, {{some or all}} of its pieces on the board. Distances are {{generally}} limited, but some nations may be able to move pieces along the coasts using boats. Also new forces arriving from across the sea will be able to land. Roman and cavalry <b>forces</b> <b>can</b> move further than infantry, as <b>can</b> <b>forces</b> with leaders.|$|R

25|$|Solved by Ralph Gasser (1993). Either player <b>can</b> <b>force</b> {{the game}} into a draw.|$|E
25|$|Solved by Victor Allis (1993). First player <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win without opening rules.|$|E

50|$|In game theory, a two-player {{deterministic}} perfect-information turn-based game is first-player-win if {{a perfect}} player who plays first <b>can</b> always <b>force</b> a win.Similarly, a game is second-player-win if a perfect player who plays second <b>can</b> always <b>force</b> a win.When winning {{is not possible}} with perfect play by both opposing sides, the game is a draw.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} of air through the cavity <b>can</b> be <b>forced</b> (by means of mechanical {{devices such as}} fans), or occur freely, by means of convection. Whether the air flow is free or <b>forced</b> <b>can</b> affect energy efficiency of the window.|$|R
25|$|Another variant, Qubic, {{is played}} on a 4×4×4 board; it was solved by Oren Patashnik in 1980 (the first player <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win). Higher {{dimensional}} variations are also possible.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators <b>can</b> <b>force</b> votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority <b>can</b> <b>force</b> another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators <b>can</b> <b>force</b> votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E
25|$|In the {{position}} at left (with White to move), Black threatens to capture White's pawn (which {{would be a}} draw), and a promotion to queen would be stalemate. The move 1.g8=R! wins because White <b>can</b> <b>force</b> an elementary checkmate from the resulting position.|$|E

25|$|Solved {{first by}} James D. Allen (Oct 1, 1988), and {{independently}} by Victor Allis (Oct 16, 1988). First player <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win. Strongly solved by John Tromp's 8-ply database (Feb 4, 1995). Weakly solved for all boardsizes where width+height is at most 15 (as well as 8×8 in late 2015) (Feb 18, 2006).|$|E
25|$|A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced {{induction}} {{device that}} increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra {{air into the}} combustion chamber. This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output {{is due to the}} fact that the compressor <b>can</b> <b>force</b> more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.|$|E

50|$|Rural/Metro Fire Department firefighters were on {{the scene}} within minutes and kept the 20 ft-high blaze from {{spreading}} to neighboring houses. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed {{to be caused by}} either rifle ammunition or paint <b>cans,</b> <b>forced</b> them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.|$|R

25|$|A fast bowler {{can also}} employ intimidatory tactics to anger (or frustrate) a batsman into playing a rash shot, by {{directing}} {{the ball to}} strike the batsman. Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and even the best batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that <b>can</b> <b>force</b> them off the field {{and out of the}} game. In almost all instances verbal 'sledging' accompanies the attack.|$|E
25|$|If {{stalemate}} were a {{loss for}} the player unable to move, the outcome of some endgames would be affected. In some situations the superior side <b>can</b> <b>force</b> stalemate but not checkmate. In others, the defending player can use stalemate as a defensive technique to avoid losing (under the current rule). If the proposed rule change were made, both of these situations would become wins for the superior side instead of draws.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{using an}} {{extended}} {{version of the}} Stern–Gerlach apparatus, Isidor Rabi and colleagues showed that by using a varying magnetic field, one <b>can</b> <b>force</b> the magnetic moment to go from one state to the other. The series of experiments culminated in 1937 when they discovered that state transitions could be induced using time varying fields or RF fields. The so-called Rabi oscillation is the working mechanism for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment found in hospitals.|$|E
50|$|Although Maelestes was a eutherian, {{it was not}} a placental mammal. The {{presence}} of an epipubic bone suggests that it could not expand its torso the same way placentals <b>can,</b> <b>forcing</b> it to give birth to small, relatively undeveloped young like modern marsupials. Like modern marsupials, it might have had a pouch, though there is no evidence for this and many marsupials like shrew opossums lack pouches.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the use of}} overly strong chest {{voice in}} the higher {{registers}} {{in an attempt to}} hit higher notes in the chest <b>can</b> lead to <b>forcing.</b> <b>Forcing</b> <b>can</b> lead consequently to vocal deterioration.|$|R

25|$|If the {{minority}} objects, those motions are debatable (and therefore {{subject to a}} filibuster) and divisible (meaning {{the minority}} <b>can</b> <b>force</b> them to be debated, and filibustered, separately). Additionally, after the first two motions pass, but before the third does, senators can offer an unlimited number of motions to give the special committee members non-binding instructions, which are themselves debatable, amendable, and divisible. As a result, a determined minority can cause {{a great deal of}} delay before a conference.|$|E
25|$|Nine Men's Morris is a {{strategy}} board game for two players dating {{at least to the}} Roman Empire. The game is also known as Nine Man Morris, Mill, Mills, The Mill Game, Merels, Merrills, Merelles, Marelles, Morelles and Ninepenny Marl in English. The game has also been called Cowboy Checkers and is sometimes printed on the back of checkerboards. Nine Men's Morris is a solved game in which either player <b>can</b> <b>force</b> the game into a draw.|$|E
25|$|In the endgame {{soldiers}} have more power, but far-advanced soldiers are generally less powerful compared to soldiers on or before the 7th rank, since soldiers cannot move backwards. In the endgame, three soldiers starting on the 7th rank are approximately equal to a chariot: they <b>can</b> <b>force</b> a win against 2 advisors and 2 elephants, or a horse/cannon plus 2 elephants, while instead a chariot cannot, and a chariot cannot force a win against three {{soldiers on the}} 7th rank when well-defended.|$|E
