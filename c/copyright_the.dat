5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{initially}} published as a serial in Kwee's magazine Panorama; {{it proved to}} be his most popular work. By 1930 there had been a number of stage adaptations, not all of which were authorised, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> work was filmed in 1931 by The Teng Chun and then in 1975 by Fred Young and Rempo Urip. Though not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, the book ranks amongst the most reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature. It has been translated into Dutch and English.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
50|$|When L. Frank Baum began {{publishing}} the Oz books, <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> law in effect was <b>the</b> <b>Copyright</b> Act of 1831, which provided a 28-year term {{with a possible}} fourteen more years upon renewal of <b>the</b> <b>copyright.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Copyright</b> Act of 1909 retroactively affected Baum's books, allowing a 28-year renewal for fifty-six total years of <b>copyright</b> protection. <b>The</b> L. Frank Baum Trust renewed <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> on all of Baum's Oz novels.|$|R

5000|$|The film's working {{title was}} [...] "Teenage Killers".

5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the Drapier's Letters, in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition {{led to the}} Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under British copyright legislation, {{to many of the}} works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the Drapier's Letters were not under <b>copyright,</b> <b>the</b> complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|William and Stephen Bradshaw Ives {{dissolved}} their partnership on April 24, 1854. William {{then put}} {{most of his}} time managing his newspaper, The Salem Observer. Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a fancy goods importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion Of Happiness print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the <b>copyright,</b> <b>the</b> Ives family chose lithographer F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion Of Happiness in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new litho stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained. In addition to continue publishing The Mansion of Happiness, H. P. Ives and A. A. Weeks published at least two new games: Experts and Tournament & Knighthood.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill did not <b>copyright</b> <b>the</b> play.

2500|$|The {{unrelated}} U.S. magazine Rolling Stone, {{called the}} newspaper's actions [...] "horrific" [...] {{and stated that}} Rolling Stone magazine has [...] "demanded they [...] cease using our name as a title". However, the magazine had little legal recourse because, despite <b>copyrighting</b> <b>the</b> name [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] in {{a large number of}} countries, they had not copyrighted it in Uganda. As publisher Jann Wenner stated, [...] "There's nothing we can do. We never <b>copyrighted</b> <b>the</b> name in Uganda.

50|$|With {{regards to}} {{copyrights}} of musical recordings, {{there are at}} least two distinct copyrights. There is (1) <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> of <b>the</b> composition, embodied in the sheet music (the “musical work”), which may include separate copyrights for lyrics or composition; and (2) <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> in <b>the</b> sound recording, embodied as a “phonorecord” (Please note that the law considers ANY tangible medium capable of storing a recording to be a phonorecord. This includes MP3 players, CDs, 8-tracks, vinyl records, cassette tapes, or any future technology.) It is not unusual for one party to own <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> in <b>the</b> underlying musical work while another, independent, party owns <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> to <b>the</b> phonorecord.|$|R
25|$|The {{publication}} of Just This Once raised {{questions in the}} legal profession concerning how copyright law applies to computer-generated works derived from an analysis of other copyrighted works, and whether the generation of such works infringes on <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> publications on this topic suggested that the copyright laws of the time were ill-equipped to deal with computer-generated creative works.|$|E
25|$|Boulton and Watt {{successfully}} challenged two of Murray's patents. Murray's patent of 1801, {{for improved}} air pumps and other innovations, and of 1802, for a self-contained compact engine {{with a new}} type of slide valve, were contested and overturned. In both cases, Murray had made the mistake of including too many improvements together in the same patent. This meant that if any one improvement were found to have infringed a <b>copyright,</b> <b>the</b> whole patent would be invalidated.|$|E
25|$|During Perestroika, {{the law and}} the {{administrative}} procedures were changed piece by piece, relaxing the governmental control over authors' exercises of their <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> official royalty rates were dropped, and the state monopoly on foreign trade on copyrights was abolished. Authors for the first time could legally negotiate publication contracts with foreign publishers themselves. A new, profoundly revised Soviet copyright law was passed in 1991, but the Soviet Union was dissolved before it could enter in force.|$|E
50|$|In {{determining}} whether art. 35-3(1) above applies to a use of <b>copyrighted</b> work, <b>the</b> following factors must be considered: {{the purpose and}} character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is of a non profit nature; the type or purpose of <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work; <b>the</b> amount and importance of the portion used in relation to <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work as a whole; {{the effect of the}} use of <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work upon <b>the</b> current market or the current value of <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work or on the potential market or the potential value of <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work.|$|R
50|$|When {{taken to}} its logical conclusion, {{this view of}} the law would seem to be clearly {{inconsistent}} with section 2.1(2) because to hold that <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> owner of <b>the</b> compilation has a positive right to reproduce the compilation necessarily decreases <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> in <b>the</b> constituent works. <b>The</b> <b>copyright</b> in a constituent element is decreased as soon as the compilation is created because there would come to be no copyright infringement remedy as against <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> owner of <b>the</b> compilation.|$|R

25|$|The 4-H {{name and}} emblem have U.S. federal {{protection}},under federal code 18 U.S.C. 707.

25|$|Although Kevin Sullivan's {{works were}} {{initially}} {{based upon the}} works of Montgomery, Sullivan developed most of his successful Anne-related film properties (Anne of Avonlea, Anne -the Continuing Story, Anne – A New Beginning and Road to Avonlea) based on original material, not directly adapted from Montgomery's books. Many {{questions have been raised}} in court as to the author’s heirs’ rights in her <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> heirs have tried to extend the copyright in Montgomery's unpublished works until 2017 but lost that opportunity in 2004 when the Canadian Parliament rejected the provision they had pursued so ardently for the unpublished works of dead authors.|$|E
25|$|If an {{employee}} creates a copyrightable {{work in the}} course of his duties vis-à-vis his employer, it is the employee who initially holds the <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> law stipulates, however, an automatic transfer of the economic rights to the employer, unless proven otherwise. Employers are required to pay the author royalties for each and every use of the work, but the parties are free to determine this fee and may set it arbitrarily low. If the work created is not connected with the duties of the employee, it does not fall under this special rule, even if the work was created on company time.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1961 Fundamentals, legal {{entities}} such as companies could also hold copyrights. Examples of such corporate copyright ownership included photo studios who held <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> on their photos, publishers of encyclopedias or periodicals, who held a <b>copyright</b> on <b>the</b> compilation as a whole, film studios, who owned <b>the</b> <b>copyrights</b> on movie scripts {{and the movies}} they produced, and select news agencies (TASS, on January 15, 1935, was granted <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> on all <b>the</b> information it disseminated. Novosti was later also granted this right.). In the case of compilations such as encyclopedias or periodicals, the publishing company owned only a <b>copyright</b> on <b>the</b> work in its entirety; <b>the</b> <b>copyright</b> on <b>the</b> individual contributions {{that made up the}} compilation remained with <b>the</b> individual authors. <b>Copyrights</b> held by {{legal entities}} were defined to be perpetual; if a company was reorganized, its legal successor entity took over <b>the</b> <b>copyrights,</b> and if a company ceased to exist, <b>the</b> <b>copyrights</b> passed to <b>the</b> state.|$|R
5000|$|Section 106 of <b>the</b> <b>Copyright</b> Act granted <b>the</b> {{owner of}} <b>copyright</b> [...] "in <b>the</b> case of ... motion {{pictures}} and other audiovisual works, to perform <b>the</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work publicly".|$|R
25|$|Also {{with respect}} to <b>copyright,</b> <b>the</b> American film {{industry}} helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the Motion Picture Association of America. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness {{of the position of}} the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property. These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1999, Siegel's widow Joanne Siegel, {{and their}} daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, filed a {{copyright}} termination notice. Warner Bros. contested this copyright termination, making {{the status of}} Siegel's share of the <b>copyright</b> <b>the</b> subject of a legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve {{the issues raised by}} the termination notice. DC made a settlement offer to Larson and her family on October 16, 2001, and three days later, DC received a letter from Larson’s attorney accepting the offer, which included millions of dollars in payment in exchange for the copyrights. This offer was set aside by the Siegels at the last minute and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. countersued, alleging, among other arguments, that the termination notice contains defects. On March 26, 2008, Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ruled that Siegel's estate was entitled to claim a share in the United States <b>copyright.</b> <b>The</b> ruling does not affect the international rights which Time Warner holds in the character through its subsidiary DC Comics. Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel's estate and whether the claim the estate has extends to derivative works such as movie versions will be settled at trial, although any compensation would only be owed from works published since 1999. The case was scheduled to be heard in a California federal court in May 2008.|$|E
25|$|With {{the single}} {{exception}} of the Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual, by the mid to late-1950s, Boardman comics were no more and, after the 1961 issue, Buffalo Bill folded as well. Denis McLoughlin continued to illustrate book covers for Boardman Books until 1967, when the company folded. Even prior to Boardman's demise, McLoughlin turned to other publishers for work. Even though Boardman retained the <b>copyright,</b> <b>the</b> last four Buffalo Bill annuals were prepared for Dean & Son Publishing, Ltd., and printed by Purnell & Sons, Ltd., both London firms. After Boardman folded, McLoughlin helped produce several western annuals for Purnell all based on American Western TV shows: The Dakotas Annual for 1963 and 1964, Gunsmoke Annual for 1965–1967, and Bonanza Annual for 1969.|$|E
