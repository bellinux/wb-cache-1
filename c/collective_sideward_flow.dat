INTRODUCTION The knowledge of the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon cross sections is of great interest for the numerical simulation of heavy ion collisions [1 [...] 7]. At intermediate energies {{of the order of}} 100 MeV/nucleon a transition from a mean field regime to a hydrodynamic collective motion occurs.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a relativistic transport model (ART 1. 0) for heavy-ion collisions at AGS energies, we study the transverse flow of pions with respect to that of nucleons using two complementary approaches. It is found that in central collisions pions develop a weak flow {{as a result of the}} flow of baryon resonances from which they are produced. On the other hand, they have a weak antiflow in peripheral collisions due to the shadowing of spectators. Furthermore, it is shown that both pion flow and antiflow are dominated by those with large transverse momenta. 1 A major highlight of recent experiments at Brookhaven’s AGS is the discovery of <b>sideward</b> <b>collective</b> <b>flow</b> of nucleons in reactions of Au+Au at pbeam/A= 10. 8 GeV/c [1, 2]. In view of the large number of pions created in these reactions and the strong coupling between the nucleon and pion, it is interesting to know if pions also have a collective flow behaviour and, if yes, how the pion flow is related to the nucleon flow. These questions have recently been addressed in experiments by the E 877 collaboration by studying the correlation between pion transverse momentum distributions in the reaction plane and the direction of nucleo...|$|R

40|$|Azimuthal {{correlations}} {{have been}} studied in heavy ion reactions {{over a wide range}} of beam energies. At low incident energies up to 100 MeV/nucleon where collective effects like the directed <b>sidewards</b> <b>flow</b> are generally small, azimuthal correlations provide a useful tool to determine the reaction plane event by event. In the energy regime of the BEVALAC (up to 1 GeV/nucleon for heavy ions) particular emission patterns, i. e. azimuthal correlations of nucleons and light nuclei with respect to the reaction plane, have been associated with the so called squeeze out and sidesplash effects. These effects are of particular interest because of their sensitivity to the equation of state at the high baryon density which is build up during the collision process. Angular distributions similar to the squeeze out have been observed for pions at the SIS in Darmstadt {{as well as from the}} EOS - collaboration. Recently also the <b>sideward</b> <b>flow</b> was measured for pions and kaons. However, the origin of the signal in the case of produced mesons is thought to be of a different nature than that for the nucleon flow. At the AGS, azimuthally anisotropic event shapes have been reported from the E 877 collaboration for the highest available heavy ion beam energy (11. 4 GeV/nucleon). Using a Fourier analysis of the transverse energy distribution measured in calorimeters, it was concluded that <b>sideward</b> <b>flow</b> is still of significant magnitude.

40|$|The nuclear {{equation}} of state (EoS) is investigated by flow phenomena in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both in transverse and radial direction, in comparison to experimental data from 150 A MeV to 11 A GeV. To this aim the collective dynamics of the nucleus-nucleus collision is described within a transport model of the coupled channel RBUU type. There are two factors which dominantly determine the baryon flow at these energies: the momentum dependence of the scalar (U_S) and vector potentials (U_μ) for baryons and the resonance/string degrees of freedom for energetic hadron excitations. We fix the explicit momentum dependence of the nucleon-meson couplings by the nucleon optical potential up to 1 GeV and extrapolate to higher energy. When assuming the optical potential to vanish identically for E_kin≥ 3. 5 GeV we simultaneously describe the <b>sideward</b> <b>flow</b> data of the PLASTIC BALL, FOPI, EoS and E 877 collaborations, the elliptic flow data of the E 895 and E 877 collaborations and approximately the rapidity and transverse mass distribution of protons at AGS energies without employing any explicit assumption on a phase transition in the EoS. However, the gradual change from hadronic to string degrees of freedom with increasing bombarding energy {{can be viewed as}} a transition from hadronic to string matter, i. e. a dissolution of hadrons at high energy density.
