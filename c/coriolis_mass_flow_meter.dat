40|$|Most {{two-phase}} {{applications for}} <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> are for low Gas Void Fraction (GVF) conditions, i. e. where the process fluid is essentially liquid with relatively {{low levels of}} entrained air or gas. There are particular challenges associated with metering wet gas, where the GVF exceeds 95 %. Established wet gas metering techniques are typically based on a differential pressure-type device (for example an orifice plate or V-cone). It is well-known that such devices over-read compared to a dry gas calibration; equations to correct the reading are available if the degree of gas "wetness" is known. For <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> of wet gas, two approaches are described. The natural extension of the low GVF techniques is to map the observed <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> and density readings onto estimates of the flow rates of the gas and liquid components.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{described}} the use of <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> for two-phase (gas/liquid) flow. As the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>meter</b> provides both <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> and density measurements, {{it is possible to}} resolve the <b>mass</b> <b>flows</b> of the gas and liquid in a two-phase mixture if their respective densities are known. To apply Coriolis metering to a three-phase (oil/water/gas) mixture, an additional measurement is required. In the work described in this paper, a water cut meter is used to indicate what proportion of the liquid flow is water. This provides sufficient information to calculate the <b>mass</b> <b>flows</b> of the water, oil and gas components. This paper {{is believed to be the}} first to detail an implementation of three-phase <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> using Coriolis technology where phase separation is not applied. Trials have taken place at the UK National Flow Standards Laboratory three-phase facility, on a commercial three-phase meter based on the Coriolis meter/water cut measurement principle. For the 50. mm metering system, the total liquid flow rate ranged from 2. 4. kg/s up to 11. kg/s, the water cut ranged from 0 % to 100 %, and the gas volume fraction (GVF) from 0 to 50 %. In a formally observed trial, 75 test points were taken at a temperature of approximately 40. °C and with a skid inlet pressure of approximately 350. kPa. Over 95 % of the test results fell within the desired specification, defined as follows: the total (oil+water) liquid <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> error should fall within ± 2. 5 %, and the gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> error within ± 5. 0 %.

This paper presents a new method of solid-liquid flow metering, in which the Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is used in combination with a commercial Electromagnetic Flow Meter (EMF) to measure the volumetric flow rate of each phase.

40|$|The use of Coriolis {{mass flow}} {{metering}} for two-phase (gas/liquid) flow is an emerging theme of both academic research and industrial application. The key issues are maintaining flow-tube operation, and modelling and correcting for the errors induced {{in the mass}} flow and density measurements. Experimentally-derived data is used to illustrate that these errors vary most notably with gas void fraction (GVF) and liquid flow rate, but other factors such as flow-tube geometry and orientation, and fluid properties such as viscosity are also influential. While undoubtedly a universal two-phase flow correction model is the ultimate research goal, there is currently no obvious candidate to explain the range of behaviours observed. This paper describes and demonstrates an empirical methodology that has proven effective in developing good correction models for a given choice of Coriolis flow-tube and flow mixture. A growing proportion of the world's oil reserves may be described as "heavy", implying high density and high viscosity. Of the various metering challenges heavy oil poses, {{one of the most}} significant is its ready entrainment of gas, and the difficulties entailed in separating gas from the oil. Accurate two-phase measurement of heavy oil is therefore an especially desirable technical goal. Trials were carried out at the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL), Scotland on a 75  mm flowmeter using a high viscosity oil. Flowrates from 1  kg/s to 10  kg/s were examined, with gas void fraction (GVF) up to 80 %. The resulting models were tested online in a commercial <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and demonstrated good performance for both steady and slugging two-phase flows, with the corrected measurements typically within 1 %- 5 % of the nominal mass flow and density. Field trials in Venezuela have confirmed the performance of this two-phase solution. While research continues into the development of a generic two-phase correction, this case study demonstrates that the current state of the art can provide, for economically important fluids, tailored models with good two-phase flow performance. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Gas lift is a {{means of}} {{enhancing}} oil recovery from hydrocarbon reservoirs. Gas injected at the production riser base reduces the gravity component of the pressure drop and thereby, increases the supply of oil from the reservoir. Also, gas injection {{at the base of a}} riser helps to mitigate slugging and thus, improving the performance of the topside facility. In order to improve the efficiency of the gas lifting technique, a good understanding of the characteristics of gas-liquid multiphase flow in vertical pipes is very important. In this study, experiments of gas/liquid (air/water) two-phase flows, liquid/liquid of oil/water two-phase flows and gas/liquid/liquid (air/oil/water) three-phase flows were conducted in a 10. 5 m high 52 mm ID vertical riser. These experiments were performed at liquid and gas superficial velocities ranging from 0. 25 to 2 m/s and ~ 0. 1 to ~ 6. 30 m/s, respectively. Dielectric oil and tap water were used as test fluids. Instruments such as <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> single beam gamma densitometer and wire-mesh sensor (WMS) were employed for investigating the flow characteristics. For the experiments of gas/liquid (air/water) two-phase flow, flow patterns of Bubbly, slug, churn flow regimes and transition regions were identified under the experimental conditions. Also, for flow pattern identification and void fraction measurements, the capacitance WMS results are consistent with those obtained simultaneously by the gamma densitometer. Generally, the total pressure gradient along the vertical riser has shown a significant decrease as the injected gas superficial velocity increased. In addition, the rate of decrease in total pressure gradient at the lower injected gas superficial velocities was found to be higher than that for higher gas superficial velocities. The frictional pressure gradient was also found to increase as the injected gas superficial velocity increased. For oil-water experiments, mixture density and total pressure gradient across the riser were found to increase with increasing water cut (ranging between 0 - 100 %) and/or mixture superficial velocity. Phase slip between the oil and water was calculated and found to be significant at lower throughputs of 0. 25 and 0. 5 m/s. The phase inversion point always takes place at a point of input water cut of 42 % when the experiments started from pure oil to water, and at an input water cut of 45 % when the experiment’s route started from water to pure oil. The phase inversion point was accompanied by a peak increase of pressure gradient, particularly at higher oil-water mixture superficial velocities of 1, 1. 5 and 2 m/s. The effects of air injection rates on the fluid flow characteristics were studied by emphasizing the total pressure gradient behaviour and identifying the flow pattern by analysing the output signals from gamma and WMS in air/oil/water experiments. Generally, riser base gas injection does not affect the water cut at the phase inversion point. However, a slight shift forward for the identified phase inversion point was found at highest flow rates of injected gas where the flow patterns were indicated as churn to annular flow. In terms of pressure gradient, the gas lifting efficiency (lowering pressure gradient) shows greater improvement after the phase inversion point (higher water cuts) than before and also at the inversion point. Also, it was found that the measured mean void fraction reaches its lowest value at the phase inversion point. These void fraction results were found to be consistent with previously published results...|$|E
40|$|A new {{three-phase}} (oil/water/gas) <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> {{system has}} been developed {{for use in the}} oil and gas industries, based on <b>Coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>metering.</b> To obtain certification for use in the Russian oil and gas industries, trials have taken place at the UK and Russian national flow laboratories, NEL in Glasgow and VNIIR in Kazan, respectively. The metrology of three-phase flow is complex, and the uncertainty of each measurement varies dynamically with the operating point, as well as the metering technology, and other aspects. To a limited extent this is reflected in the error limits allowed in national standards, which may vary with operating point. For example, the GOST standard allows errors in the oil flow rate of ± 6 % for water cuts of less than 70 %, which is increased to ± 15 % for water cuts between 70 and 95 %. The provision of online uncertainty for each measurement, for example in accordance with the British Standard BS- 7986, would be highly desirable, allowing the user to observe in real time variations in measurement quality. This paper will discuss how an online uncertainty assessment could be implemented in the Coriolis meter-based system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show how to analyze and {{correctly}} chose measuring device specially applied on <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> based on <b>Coriolis</b> principle. In the beginning short description of <b>Coriolis</b> based <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is given. Furthermore, comparison analysis of two <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> shows where are the problems of wrongly applied method in slurry fluid measurement in production of powder detergents plant. Analysis is made using RS Logix 500 program. In given diagrams which show causes of wrong measurements and position of <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> device the few malfunctions are determined Finally, using comparison measurement with new <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> shows that measurement method is applicable for slurry fluids which are specially problematic and complex for measuring...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International Diesel {{equipment}} owners often desire {{knowledge of}} the direct feasibility and impacts of different technologies, retrofits, or fuels on their fleet under their specific operating conditions. This is now possible {{with the advent of}} portable emissions measurement systems and other in-use measurement technologies. The SAE J 1321 Fuel Economy Test and Title 40 CFR 1065 in-use emissions testing procedures were adapted for use in an off-road mining haul truck environment over long time periods. Fuel consumption was directly measured using <b>coriolis</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> on two pairs of test and control trucks. Gaseous emissions were also measured with a Horiba OBS- 2200 portable emissions measurement system. Testing was completed under steady state loads analogous to laboratory dynamometer modal tests and during normal in-use operations for 12 hour test periods with real-time emissions and fuel consumption data obtained. Fuel consumption and nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbon emissions correlated well with typical levels and the manufacturer’s certifications for this engine family. Analysts also compared engine control module fuel consumption data to coriolis meter fuel consumption data, and found reasonable agreement at high power settings. The in-use data also allowed evaluation of fuel consumption and emissions profiles over entire vehicle duty cycles. This provides indicators to help train operators and plan mine layouts to minimize driving conditions where high emissions or fuel consumption occur...|$|R
