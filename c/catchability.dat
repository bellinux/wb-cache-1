For the same reason, inferring the Natural mortality of a fish stock from surveys’ estimates, require some assumption of the survey <b>catchabilities</b> at age. The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay has been closed since 2005 up to 2010, due to low biomass levels. In the mean time, and since 1989, the population has been directly monitored by two independent surveys, acoustic and egg (DEPM) surveys, which supplied the basic information {{for the assessment of}} this stock carried out by ICES. The closure of the fishery supposes a major contrast on total mortality levels affecting the population in comparison with the former period of exploitation, suitable to get estimates of Natural and Fishing mortalities, under the assumption of no major changes in M occurring between both periods. Log linear models and a seasonal integrate catch at age analysis were tuned to the fishery and two series of surveys under the assumption of constant <b>catchabilities</b> across ages for the two surveys’ population estimates. An analysis of the period 1987 - 2009, searching for a single and constant natural mortality at age, results in minimum residual SSQ for an M around 0. 8. But a better result is obtained when a pattern of increasing natural mortality at age is allowed, a possibility suggested since a long time for this type of short living species.

40|$|Abstract The {{reliability}} of estimations of catches of pelagic longline fisheries is especially worrying {{in the case}} of non-target species such as the sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) and spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), because they are often recorded aggregated in onboard maps. For this reason, generalized linear models were used to identify a number of important explanatory variables and their effect on sailfish and spearfish proportions. The response variable (number of sailfish in the aggregate capture) is assumed as binomial using the logit link function. The explanatory variables used were foram year, qrt (quarter), fleet, de (distance from equator) and d (distance from areas above sea level). The selected models showed that the equatorial and coastal regions presented higher densities or <b>catchabilities</b> of sailfish when compared to spearfish, as in the case for fleets of China Taipei and the United States. The lowest mean proportion of sailfish [sailfish/(sailfish + spearfish) ] of the third quarter were driven mostly by the low estimations calculated for Japan and Brazil...|$|R

Our model indicates that strong fishery selection against male perch apparently triggered a population collapse, highlighting that sex-selective fisheries can be harmful even at a reasonable exploitation rate (here ≤ 30 %). Recruitment (R) increased with the abundance of spawners (S) in both species, but it also responded to both abiotic and other biotic factors. In particular, increased predator (pike) abundance induced a change from compensation to depensation in the prey (perch) SR relationship, thus favouring the occurrence of an Allee effect.

40|$|International audienceThe global {{overexploitation}} of {{fish stocks}} is endangering many marine food webs. Scientists and managers now {{call for an}} ecosystem-based fisheries management, able {{to take into account}} the complexity of marine ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services they provide. By contrast, many fishery management plans only focus on maximizing the productivity of harvested stocks. Such practices are suggested to affect other ecosystem services, altering the integrity and resilience of natural communities. Here we show that while yield-maximizing policies can allow for coexistence and resilience in predator–prey communities, they are not optimal in a multi-objective context. We find that although total prey and predator maximum yields are higher with a prey-oriented harvest, focusing on the predator improves species coexistence. Also, moderate harvesting of the predator can enhance resilience. Furthermore, increasing maximum yields by changing <b>catchabilities</b> improves resilience in predator-oriented systems, but reduces it in prey-oriented systems. In a multi-objective context, optimal harvesting strategies involve a general tradeoff between yield and resilience. Resilience-maximizing strategies are however compatible with quite high yields, and should often be favored. Our results further suggest that balancing harvest between trophic levels is often best at maintaining simultaneously species coexistence, resilience and yield...|$|R
40|$|Unsustainable {{bushmeat}} {{hunting is}} {{a major threat to}} mammal species, particularly in West/Central Africa. We developed a multispecies dynamic simulation model of hunter behaviour, parameterized using data from the Ashanti region, Ghana. The model distinguishes between two hunting techniques, snaring and gun hunting. We analyse the impact of key economic parameters on off-takes. Economic incentives determine the effort devoted to hunting, the choice of hunting technique, and the species that are consumed domestically or traded in markets. These factors, together with the growth rates and <b>catchabilities</b> of hunted species, determine the ecological impact of hunting. The results suggest that increased bushmeat prices are likely to lead to a switch from snaring, which is cheaper but less efficient, to gun hunting, with a consequent impact on vulnerable species. Increases in agricultural prices have an ambiguous effect on hunter behaviour, depending on the balance between incentives to invest in agriculture and increased consumption as incomes improve. Penalties are more effective if they target bushmeat sales, rather than the act of hunting. This model represents a step forward because it explicitly considers bushmeat as a component of the household economy. This has important implications as regards the development of policies to conserve species hunted for bushmeat...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty {{coming from}} {{assessment}} models leads to risk {{in decision making}} and ignoring or misestimating it can result in an erroneous management action. Some parameters, such as selectivity or survey <b>catchabilities,</b> can present {{a wide range of}} shapes and the introduction of smooth functions, which up to now have not been widely used in assessment models, allows for more flexibility to capture underlying nonlinear structures. In this work a simulation study emulating a sardine population is carried out to compare 3 different methods for uncertainty estimation: multivariate normal distribution, bootstrap (without and with bias correction) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In order to study their performance depending on the model complexity, five different scenarios are defined depending on the shape of the smooth function of the fishing mortality. From 100 simulated data sets, performance is measured in terms of point estimation, coefficients of variation, bias, skewness, coverage probabilities and correlation. In all approaches model fitting is carried out using the a 4 a framework. All three methods result in very similar performance. The main differences are found for observation variance parameters where the bootstrap and the multivariate normal approach result in underestimation of these parameters. In general MCMC is considered to have better performance, being able to detect skewness in posterior distributions, showing small bias and reaching expected coverage probabilities. It is also more efficient in terms of time consumption in comparison with bootstrapping. JRC. D. 2 -Water and Marine Resource...|$|R
50|$|Many centuries ago, fish {{production}} was mainly {{by a few}} fisherfolk communities living by the lakesides who bartered fish for other food commodities. Fishing activities were characterised by use of traditional gears such as spears, arrows, fish-pots, and the capture of fish by hand in shallow waters of lakes, rivers and swamps or fish poisoning with local herbs. However, these types of gears and methods still exist in minor lakes, the River Nile Basin and shallower areas of Lake Victoria. The fishing activity was relatively at a subsistence level. In the mid-1950s, foreign traders introduced Japanese nylon gillnets which proved more effective in the fishery than the cotton, hemp and flax gillnets. Nylon gillnets gave higher <b>catchability</b> characteristics than any other gears mainly because of higher tensile strength, mesh-size constancy, resistance to abrasion and durability of the nylon fibre material. The introduction of new fish scpecies also boosted fish production. Fish production increased by six times in 30 years rising from 60,000 tons in 1961 to 245,000 tons in 1990 {{partly as a result}} of higher productivity of the lakes but also because of the increased catch effort. In 1983 when {{production was}} estimated at 78,000 tons p.a., potential production or Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 150,000 tons, yet by 1990 production had exceeded this level by 55,000 tons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Sex ratio {{data can}} provide {{information}} about mortality rates, which may be especially useful for sex-specific fisheries when little other information is available. In this paper, we develop a theory and methods relating sex ratio to mortality rates and apply them to data for lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus on the southern Newfoundland Shelf. If the sexes have different mortality rates, and the rates as well as recruitment are constant with age and time, the sex ratio of the population provides {{an estimate of the}} ratio of the instantaneous mortality rates of the sexes. If a cohort can be followed over time, changes in the sex ratio provide an estimate of the ratio of the survival rates of the sexes or the difference in the instantaneous mortality rates. With the latter approach, it is not necessary for the sexes to have equal <b>catchabilities</b> in the survey nor for recruitment to be constant over time. This approach involves fewer assumptions and is of greater general interest, but it requires that cohorts be identified either by aging or tagging the fish. For lumpfish, we used sex ratio data from a research survey to estimate the change in the mortality rate of females, which are the subject of a sex-specific roe fishery. Unfortunately, {{it is not possible to}} follow cohorts of lumpfish over time because lumpfish caught in the survey are not aged.

40|$|Production {{models have}} proven for {{long to be}} very useful {{assessment}} tools. But two main problems make difficult their use for investigating the status of tropical tuna stocks. The first problem is the calculation of the effective fishing effort. Indeed, many different fleets with heterogeneous and changing <b>catchabilities</b> are often exploiting the same population. Consequently, scientists in charge of tropical tunas stock assessment are seldom {{in a position to}} estimate accurately a standardized effective fishing effort (e. g. an effort proportional to the fishing mortality) which is targeting the considered stock. The other important problem concerning the use of production models for tropical tunas stock assessment is the fluctuation of the overall size of the exploited area. Indeed, for tuna fisheries, the estimated production curve and its associated MSY are closely linked to the exploited surface and the stock biomass located in the fished area interacts more or less strongly with a “cryptic ” part of the population located outside the fishing area. In this paper, our goal is to address both categories of problems by formulating different multi-fleet non equilibrium production models incorporating or not the fished surface. A maximum likelihood approach is provided to estimate the models parameters in a bayesian context. Once parameters have been estimated, the model can be used to estimate the overall effective effort and the stock status. The comparison of different formulations of the model may help to better understand the fishery dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{estimates}} of population size are fundamental in many ecological studies and biodiversity conservation.

Most studies concerning {{the reliability of}} different estimators used simulation data based on assumptions about capture variability that {{do not necessarily reflect}} conditions in natural populations. Here, we used data from an intensively studied closed population of the arboreal gecko Gehyra variegata to construct reference population sizes for assessing twelve different population size estimators in terms of bias, precision, accuracy, and their 95 %-confidence intervals. Two of the reference populations reflect natural biological entities, whereas the other reference populations reflect artificial subsets of the population. Since individual heterogeneity was assumed, we tested modifications of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, a set of models in programs MARK and CARE- 2, and a truncated geometric distribution. Ranking of methods was similar across criteria. Models accounting for individual heterogeneity performed best in all assessment criteria. For populations from heterogeneous habitats without obvious covariates explaining individual heterogeneity, we recommend using the moment estimator or the interpolated jackknife estimator (both implemented in CAPTURE/MARK). If data for capture frequencies are substantial, we recommend the sample coverage or the estimating equation (both models implemented in CARE- 2). Depending on the distribution of <b>catchabilities,</b> our proposed multiple Lincoln-Petersen and a truncated geometric distribution obtained comparably good results. The former usually resulted in a minimum population size and the latter can be recommended when there is a long tail of low capture probabilities.

40|$|Le peuplement ichtyologique d'un marais {{littoral}} endigué, géré en eau douce, a été étudié sur une zone de 2 700 ha, située au nord du marais Breton-Vendéen (Loire-Atlantique, France). Le réseau hydraulique, qui représente près de 16 % de cette surface, se compose, d'environ 91 m de linéaire de fossés par ha (en tout 234 km) et de bassins présents uniquement dans la partie d'origine salicole du marais. Les hauteurs d'eau, l'envasement et le recouvrement par la végétation aquatique dépendent de la gestion humaine et sont très variables (moyennes respectives : 42 cm; 43 cm; 70 %). Cela se traduit par un morcellement spatial de l'habitat pour les poissons. La stratégie d'échantillonnage adoptée, qui tient compte de cette hétérogénéité, a permis de décrire un peuplement comportant 21 espèces. Dominé par les poissons-chats et par les anguilles, {{ce dernier}} est caractéristique de la zone à brèmes des cours d'eau. Les abondances sont relativement élevées (en moyenne 315 kg/ha et 11 460 poissons/ha), mais elles sont très hétérogènes. L'évolution qualitative et quantitative de la répartition spatio-temporelle est décrite à l'aide d'une analyse factorielle des correspondances portant sur 74 échantillons prélevés par pêche électrique entre 1987 et 1989. Bien que l'approche de ce milieu soit complexe et les références bibliographiques relativement rares, l'analyse des premières données permet d'ores et déjà d'identifier quelques problèmes de gestion ayant des répercussions directes sur le peuplement piscicole de cette zone. The dammed up marshes of the French Atlantic coast cover about 200 000 ha between River Vilaine and the « Bassin d'Arcachon ». Eighty eight % are managed with freshwater. They constitute original environments initially created for agriculture or for salt production, {{and they are}} now threatened by land abandonment within the next decade. Concurrently to aquaculture (in created or existing ponds), exploitation of the fish stocks in the ditchweb is likely to encourage a diversification of agricultural activities. Unfortunately, bibliographic analysis reveals the relative scarceness of research about sampling methods and qualitative or quantitative characteristics of these fish communities. This is quite surprising {{considering the importance of}} the ditchwed of this kind of environment outlined by several authors. In the Netherlands, BELTMANN (1984) assessed that there is a total of 400 000 km of ditches. In France, the littoral dyked marshes of the Atlantic coast couid comprise 20 000 km of ditches and about 24 000 ha of open water. The present work provides for the first data on the fish community of Bourgneuf marsh. The northern part of the marsh of Bourgneuf, 2 700 ha provided whith f reshwater, contains nearly every kind of landscapes found throughout the whole Breton-Vendéen marsh. The pattern of the ditch network strongly changes from a zone to another (fig. 1)  : presence of former salt pans in the western part, regular geometric shapes in the recently created polders next to the River Falleron, irregular ditchweb pattern in the eastern part. The average density of the ditch network is 91 m of ditches per ha, totalizing 234 km in the study area. The total surface of open water, composed of ditches and basins (former salt pans), covers 411 ha (over 15 % of the study site). Diversity of ditch types occurs at fine scales (< 1 000 m 2), they vary according to their widths (0, 3 to 7 m), depths (average, 42 cm; SD, 20, 4), thickness of silt layer (average, 43 cm; SD, 42) and their hydrophyte vegetation cover (average, 70 %; SD, 60 %). As a consequence of this heterogeneity, available habitats are scattered over the marsh (mosaïc distribution). A nested sampling (FRONTIER, 1983) was carried out to take into account this high heterogeneity : 5 sampling areas were selected randomly. In each one, 3 to 5 ditches were chosen according to their characteristics (see above). Sampling stations were delimited by 2 stop nets (5 mm mesh) settled 30 m apart, in order to avoid fish migration. Field work was conducted using « Heron » electric fishing material (see LAMARQUE et al., 1978). In each ditch-section, we carried out as many successive catches as necessary to apply the maximum likelihood weighted estimation method of CARLE and STRUB (1978). Nine to 19 stations were sampled at 5 periods, between 1987 and 1989. A total of 74 samples were collected. The fish community was composed of 21 species (table 1) and corresponded to the bream zone of Verneaux's classification (1977). The densities and biomass were quite high (on average 315 kg/ha and 11 460 fishes/ha) but very variable (0 to 2 120 kg/ ha and 0 to 39 300 fishes/ha). The catfish, Ictalurus nebulosus (170 kg/ha), the eel, Anguilla anguilla (47 kg/ha) and the tench, Tinca tinca (28 kg/ha), represented on average 77, 5 % of the standing crop, but their spatial distribution was very irregular. These estimates are assumed to be reliable considering that the data used for the calculations were provided by a sampling design which permits to respect the basic assumptions of the removal method. (f) The population size could only change because of the fishings (no migration because of the stop nets; no recruitment/death because of the short duration of the fishing sequences). (ii) The standard sampling design permitted to reduce the variations of the catch probabilities between the successive removals. Several studies have shown that this removal method under-estimates by about 20 % the true size of the fish populations (e. g. BOHLIN and SUNDSTROM, 1977; MAHON, 1980). But they were based on Zippin's method, and the estimator of CARLE and STRUB (1978), that we used, was shown to be more robust (COWX, 1983; GERDEAUX, 1987). Nevertheless, we assume that the values presented in this paper provide for an approached information on the sizes of the studied fish populations. To assess the fish-habitat relationship, a correspondence analysis (fig. 2) was performed on the 74 samples X 17 species matrix (excluding the sticklebacks, Gaslerosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius, which population size estimations failed because of their low <b>catchabilities).</b> Four groups of samples were ordinated according to their specific richness and the species they contained. Several habitat parameters were projected on F 1 -F 2 factorial map (fig. 3). Hydrophyte cover, thickness of silt layer, water depth (fig. 3 and 4), which are directly controlled by human maintenance, appeared to be the major structuring habitat parameters for the fish community. In the deepest and less silted stations, the communities were rich (on average 11 species; group 4, fig. 2). Predators such as pike-perch, Stizostedion lucioperca, and perch, Perca fluviatilis, occurred, and cold water species were found, such as minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus, or chub, Leuciscus cephalus. When the silt layer was thicker and the water level was intermediate, the specific richness decreased (average, 6, 2 species) and the community was either dominated by the cattish (group 2, fig. 2) or by the rudd, Scardinius erythrophtalmus (group 3, fig. 2), according to the importance of the aquatic vegetation cover. Habitats with thickest silt layers, shallowest waters and maximum aquatic vegetation cover contained the poorest communities (average 3, 9 species) dominated by eel (group 1, fig. 2). There is also evidence that the diversity of the community has progressively decreased since 1987 (fig. 5). The most stenothermous species disappeared, and the importance of the catfish increased : it doubled between May 1987 and September 1989 (fig. 6). Although the eel is the species most adapted to this environment, we emphasize the diminution of its biomass (fig. 7). These phenomena could be partly due to the climate (cold winter in 1987, important swelling in January 1988 and 2 droughts in summers 1988 and 1989). But they are mainly caused by the water management policy which is intended to favour agriculture by keeping stable water levels (evacuation of swellings) and by preventing the freshwater part from the marine influence (collective sluice gates). This does mot permit an optimal breeding of the species that have to spawn on flooded meadows, neither a proper colonisation of the marsh by elvers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Catchability</b> is {{a concept}} in fishery biology which {{reflects}} the efficiency of a particular fishery. Its quantitative magnitude is expressed by the <b>catchability</b> coefficient, which relates the biomass abundance to the capture or fishing mortality. This paper is {{a comprehensive review of}} <b>catchability</b> including the development of our knowledge, interpretation and estimation. <b>Catchability</b> patterns indicate that the <b>catchability</b> coefficient has been used in two main lines: (a) increased efficiency of fishing effort and (b) its relation to population fishery processes for assessment and management purposes. It involves various aspects of the fishery, such as individual and population biology, characteristics of the fishing gear, amount of fishing, fishing strategies, and environmental fluctuation, among others. The concept is proposed of an integrated model of the <b>catchability</b> coefficient, which incorporates various of the aspects mentioned above. It is illustrated with two examples of its application: the red grouper (Epinephelus morio) fishery from the Campeche Bank, Gulf of Mexico, and the sardine (Sardinops caeruleus) fishery from the Gulf of California...|$|E
40|$|For {{most of the}} year, the size-frequency {{distribution}} of trap-caught southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii, reflected size-specific <b>catchability</b> rather than the size-frequency {{distribution of}} the population in a scientific reserve in Tasmania, Australia.

During moulting and mating, size-specific <b>catchability</b> and relative selectivity of larger animals were similar to or lower than for smaller animals. The relative pattern of <b>catchability</b> throughout the year was similar for most size classes within each sex.

40|$|<b>Catchability</b> is {{estimated}} indirectly as a 'nuisance' {{variable in the}} spatially explicit stock assessment model of the southern rock lobsters Jasus edwardsii in Tasmania, Australia. This study attempted to identify the key mechanisms influencing <b>catchability</b> to enable direct independent estimates of monthly <b>catchability.</b> Seasonal variation in <b>catchability</b> of the southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii was estimated in a scientific reserve in southeast Tasmania by comparing estimates of lobster density based on direct visual observations underwater with concomitant estimates from trapping surveys. Underwater density estimates of undersized and legal-sized male and female lobsters greater than 80 mm carapace length did not change significantly over the 14 month study period {{with the exception of}} undersized males (smaller than 110 mm carapace length). Sex ratios remained constant at approximately 1 : 1. In marked contrast, catch rates of males and females and the sex ratio of trapped lobsters varied strongly with season, implying that <b>catchability</b> varies seasonally and with sex. Impact of capture on subsequent <b>catchability</b> appeared to be weak, since the ratios of tagged animals in the population observed underwater generally reflected recapture rates of tagged animals in trap catches. Size-specific <b>catchability</b> generally increased with size, but also varied with sex and season. During moulting and mating, size-specific <b>catchability</b> and relative selectivity did not increase, and sometimes decreased for larger animals. The size-frequency distributions of lobsters captured in traps therefore rarely reflected the size-frequency distribution of the population on the ground. Negative associations between small and large lobsters in traps were stronger in winter than in summer, indicating strong behavioural interactions. These interactions can account for the lower <b>catchability</b> of smaller lobsters. Relative selectivity estimates using tag-recapture and size-specific <b>catchability</b> data provided similar results. Seasonal variation in <b>catchability</b> of legal-sized males and females in the scientific reserve was described by modelling the effects of water temperature, moulting and mating.

40|$|Electrofishing catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) data are {{commonly}} used to index temporal trends in abundance in fish monitoring programs, but the reliability of this index requires {{the assumption that the}} fraction of fish stock caught per unit effort (<b>catchability,</b> q) is relatively precise and constant through time. A wide range of biological, environmental, and technical factors can affect <b>catchability,</b> potentially violating these assumptions. To understand if CPUE data can be used to index abundance through time for Florida lakes, I evaluated how electrofishing <b>catchability</b> varies temporally with different biotic and abiotic factors in five small lakes in north central Florida. I also evaluated the influence of variable electrofishing <b>catchability</b> on the ability of a monitoring program to detect a true change in abundance in response to a perturbation, such as could occur following changes in water levels or disruption to vegetation via hurricane using a simulation. Lastly, I evaluated the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation on mean electrofishing <b>catchability</b> using a series of hatchery ponds. Electrofishing <b>catchability</b> in the lakes study varied season, lake, and species. <b>Catchability</b> was higher but substantially more variable for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and lake chubsucker Erimyzon sucetta than for bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. <b>Catchability</b> was highly variable between years in the same season for both largemouth bass and lake chubsucker in some of the lakes, which could preclude the use of CPUE as a reliable index of abundance. <b>Catchability</b> for bluegill was low but precise; indicating that electrofishing CPUE could monitor abundance for this species. Simulation results revealed that statistical power decreased and the Type-I error rate (i. e., the probability of detecting a difference when in fact no difference occurred) increased substantially if q varies through time as I observed for largemouth bass and lake chubsucker. Type-I error rates were well above the expected value of 0. 05, reaching as high as 0. 7 for largemouth bass and 0. 6 for lake chubsucker at high sample sizes. This resulted because increasing sample size improves the ability to detect real changes, but also increases the probability of detecting spurious changes due to variable q (i. e., Type-I error). Thus, variable <b>catchability</b> hinders our ability to use CPUE data to index trends in fish abundance. Mean electrofishing <b>catchability</b> in the hatchery pond study showed no difference between the pond treatments, indicating that relatively high coverages of submersed aquatic plants had no substantial influence on average electrofishing <b>catchability.</b> Mean <b>catchability</b> was higher for largemouth bass than bluegill, similar to the lake results. Mean <b>catchability</b> was more variable for both largemouth bass and bluegill in ponds with abundant vegetation than in those with low aquatic plant abundance. This suggests that abundant vegetation does not influence average q values, but it does increase the variability in electrofishing <b>catchability</b> and thus could increase the uncertainty in CPUE data used to index fish abundance. These results indicated that variable electrofishing <b>catchability</b> hinders our ability to detect trends in abundance using CPUE data for two of the three species I evaluated. Further research should evaluate the temporal variability in electrofishing <b>catchability</b> and explore alternate sampling methods and data sources for their reliability for monitoring fishery trends...|$|E
40|$|Inter-Research 2014. <b>Catchability,</b> a key {{parameter}} {{in stock}} assessment, is often considered constant {{in time and}} space. However, when fishing with passive gears like traps or gillnets, fish behavior determines the odds of encounter with the fishers and thus <b>catchability.</b> Few studies have presented comprehensive empirical evidence {{of the link between}} behavior measured in the wild and <b>catchability</b> from a life-history strategy perspective. Here, a suite of different variables, including environmental cues, physiological states, fish activity, home range and <b>catchability,</b> were modeled using a sinusoidal function to describe their seasonality over the year and the degree of coupling among them in a sedentary coastal fish (Labrus bergylta). All the variables except the home range size showed a significant variation over the year, following a sinusoidal pattern. The models showed a tight match between the seasonality of <b>catchability</b> and fish activity, with high values of both variables occurring in late spring to early summer, when the highest levels of feeding and the period of reproductive inactivity occurred. Lower <b>catchability</b> values were predicted in late autumn to early winter, coinciding with the spawning season and the associated reduced activity. This integrative research shows that the spatio-temporal dimension of fish life-history strategy has a key role in shaping <b>catchability</b> even in highly sedentary species. Time-varying <b>catchability</b> needs to be incorporated into stock assessment models that aim to accurately describe fish population health and to estimate abundance indices. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The index-removal method {{provides}} {{estimates of}} abundance, exploitation rate, and <b>catchability</b> coefficient. Estimates {{from the original}} method suffer from poor precision. Recent work has improved the precision of model estimates; however, the method still includes the strong assumption of constant survey <b>catchability</b> over years and seasons. This assumption is not tenable in many fisheries. This work introduces a new multiyear model, 2 qIR, that allows <b>catchability</b> to differ between surveys of the same year. Simulations were performed {{to examine the effects}} of variability in (1) the exploitation rate among years, (2) survey <b>catchability,</b> and (3) the number of years of data on model performance. The 2 qIR model estimates were always more accurate and precise than those of the other models examined and other model scenarios in which there was moderate contrast in exploitation among years, regardless of the seasonal difference between survey <b>catchability</b> coefficients. The ratios of survey <b>catchability</b> tested ranged from 0. 1 to 10, but the model worked best at <b>catchability</b> ratios greater than 0. 3. The 2 qIR model performance improved slightly when a third year was added to the data set, but performance was similar with 3 or 5 years of data. In all types of simulations, the 2 qIR model estimates were usable (i. e., not negative, infinite, or made with a convergence error) a greater proportion of the time than were annual model estimates. The 2 qIR model produced reasonable results when applied to data from a population of southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii in Tasmania, whereas the models that assume constant <b>catchability</b> among surveys sometimes predicted exploitation rates exceeding 100 %. The results from both the simulations and the lobster data suggest that the 2 qIR model can be reliably applied in more situations than models that assume constant survey <b>catchability...</b>|$|E
