40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{effect of}} <b>cerium</b> <b>sulphate</b> tetrahydrate on the corrosion of steel in 3. 5 % NaCl solutions at 25 ± 1 °C was investigated by using electrochemical frequency modulation EFM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS, potentiodynamic polarization and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that, under the chosen experimental conditions <b>cerium</b> <b>sulphate</b> tetrahydrate offers sufficient inhibition against steel corrosion in 3. 5 % NaCl solutions. EFM {{can be used as}} a rapid and non destructive technique for corrosion rate measurements without prior knowledge of Tafel constants. The results of EIS indicate that the value of constant phase element, CPE tends to decrease and both charge transfer resistance and inhibition efficiency tend to increase by increasing the inhibitor concentration. Tafel polarization studies have shown that the <b>cerium</b> <b>sulphate</b> tetrahydrate suppresses both the cathodic and anodic processes and thus it acts as mixed-type inhibitor. AFM analysis shows that the steel surface roughness is 123. 08 nm before immersion in the solution, increases to 564. 78 nm after immersion in uninhibited solution,. In the presence of the <b>cerium</b> <b>sulphate</b> tetrahydrate, the height profiles of the steel surface decrease to 65. 34 nm owing to the protective formation of an inhibitor layer...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: One titrimetric and two {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods are}} described for {{the determination of}} ciprofloxacin in bulk drug and in formulations using <b>cerium</b> (IV) <b>sulphate</b> as the oxidimetric agent and methyl orange and indigo carmine as chromogenic agents. In titrimetry (method A), ciprofloxacin is treated with a measured excess of <b>cerium</b> (IV) <b>sulphate</b> in acid medium and the unreacted oxidant is back titrated with standard ammonium ferrous sulphate using ferroin indicator. In spectrophotometric methods, ciprofloxacin is treated with a known excess of <b>cerium</b> (IV) <b>sulphate</b> and the residual oxidant is determined by treating with a fixed amount of either methyl orange, and measuring the absorbance at 520 nm (Method B) or indigo carmine, and measuring the absorbance at 610 nm (Method C). In all the three methods, the amount of <b>cerium</b> (IV) <b>sulphate</b> reacted corresponds {{to the amount of}} ciprofloxacin. Titrimetry is applicable over 2 - 12 mg range and in the spectrophotometric methods, calibration curves are linear over the concentration ranges of 0. 5 - 3. 5 µg ml- 1 (method B) and 1. 0 - 7. 0 µg ml- 1 (method C).

40|$|Catalysts {{have been}} used on cars since 1974 to reduce {{tailpipe}} emission levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. Initially, oxidation catalysts were used that operated under very lean air/fuel conditions and gave rise to increased sulphate particulate emissions. These sulphate emissions could fortunately be reduced by better air/fuel control. However, the introduction of more active catalyst compositions, in particular the use of cerium oxide components on the wash coat, led to bad odour complaints from motorists. In the report it is shown that under fuel-lean conditions, sulphur, originating from the fuel, is stored as aluminium and <b>cerium</b> <b>sulphates</b> onto the washcoat. Upon a rapid change to fuel-rich engine operation the stored sulphates are released as hydrogen sulphide and is the cause for the smell observed. The sulphur storage/release process results in hydrogen sulphide emissions many times higher than is possible from steady-state conversion from the fuel sulphur level. By using a catalyst/engine combination on a testbed the experiments {{have shown that the}} hydrogen sulphide release is a kinetically limited reaction and, apart from the air/fuel control, depends mainly on the catalyst temperature...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{investigated}} the possibility to decrease the corrosion rate in neutral salt solutions of two Mg based MMCs (AZ 80 A and ZK 60 A MMC) by silane treatment. Only a silane molecule with a long aliphatic chain (e. g. n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane, OctadecS) forms very protective layers, whose efficiency and persistency can be markedly increased by proper pre-treatments (i. e. <b>Cerium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution and HF pickling). In the case of Ce(III) + OctadecS double treatment the anodic process is almost blocked. The pre-treatments, by alone, do not produce very positive results and their influence depends on {{the composition of the}} matrix. In the case of Zn and Zr rich Mg matrix (ZK 60 A MMC), HF pickling leads to the formation of an incoherent, powder layer...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the future}} ban of chromium-containing {{corrosion}} protection coatings, there is a worldwide scientific effort to find a replacement for chromium as a corrosion inhibitor that also exhibits self-healing properties in scratches but without the negative effects like health and environmental hazards.

De Beers boron-doped diamond electrodes, manufactured by chemical vapour deposition and containing varying amounts of boron, were therefore investigated {{in order to determine}} their suitability for future electrochemical applications. These electrodes were initially characterised using techniques such as SEM, LA-ICP-MS, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The electrochemical behaviour of these electrodes was investigated in two redox systems (potassium iron (III) cyanide and <b>cerium</b> (III) <b>sulphate)</b> and two biological systems (dopamine and ascorbic acid). These results were compared against that of the conventional glassy carbon electrode. Porous boron-doped diamond, a novel electrode material, was used for the electrochemical detection of thyroid hormones (L-T 3 and L-T 4). These hormones have never previously been investigated using a boron-doped diamond electrode. The De Beers boron-doped diamond electrode was found to outperform the conventional glassy carbon electrode, which fouled very easily, in the detection of dopamine. Peak separation between dopamine and the interfering ascorbic acid was attained at a pretreated boron-doped diamond electrode.

The deposit exhibited a maximum cerium content of 6. 2 ± 0. 1 wt. % when the cerium chloride concentration was 2 g/L. The {{result of the}} Pd stability test showed that {{the stability of the}} bath was reduced due to Ce salt addition. The microhardness measurements made on both as-plated and heat treated samples exhibited a peak hardness of 1006 ± 11 VHN for cerium concentration of 1. 5 g/L. The concept of kinetic strength analysis was proved to be applicable only for binary and not for ternary alloys due to multistep deposition mechanism with different kinetic energies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-plated and heat treated samples revealed peaks corresponding to Ni (1 1 1) and nickel phosphide (Ni 3 P). Higher amount of Ce incorporation in NiP matrix increased the crystallisation temperature of the deposit which could be due to the suppression of nickel crystallisation prior to Ni 3 P compound formation and thus increasing the activation energy for the formation of stable phases. Surface compositional analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) carried out on as-plated NiCeP- 2 deposit showed a prominent peak of P existing in + 1 oxidation state as higher alkalinity favoured hypophosphite deposition in the ternary alloy coating.
