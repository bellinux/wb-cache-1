However, no population-specific <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> have been calibrated for children with intellectual disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to calibrate and cross-validate the first population-specific accelerometer intensity <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for children with intellectual disabilities. Fifty children with intellectual disabilities {{were randomly assigned to}} the calibration (n = 36; boys = 28, 9. 53 ± 1. 08 yrs) or cross-validation (n = 14; boys = 9, 9. 57 ± 1. 16 yrs) group. Participants completed a semi-structured school-based activity session, which included various activities ranging from sedentary to vigorous intensity. Direct observation (SOFIT tool) was used to calibrate the ActiGraph wGT 3 X+, which participants wore on the right hip. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses determined the optimal <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for sedentary, moderate, and vigorous intensity activity for the vertical axis and vector magnitude. Classification agreement was investigated using sensitivity, specificity, total agreement, and Cohen's kappa scores against the criterion measure of SOFIT. The optimal (AUC =. 87 -. 94) vertical axis <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> (cpm) were ≤ 507 (sedentary), 1008 - 2300 (moderate), and ≥ 2301 (vigorous), which demonstrated high sensitivity (81 - 88 %) and specificity (81 - 85 %). The optimal (AUC =. 86 -. 92) vector magnitude <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> (cpm) of ≤ 1863 (sedentary), 2610 - 4214 (moderate), and ≥ 4215 (vigorous) demonstrated comparable, albeit marginally lower, accuracy than the vertical axis <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> (sensitivity = 80 - 86 %; specificity = 77 - 82 %).

40|$|Objective. The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} {{accelerometer}} <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> to classify physical activities (PA) by intensity in preschoolers and to investigate discrepancies in PA levels when applying various accelerometer <b>cut</b> <b>points.</b> Methods. To calibrate the accelerometer, 18 preschoolers (5. 8 +/- 0. 4 years) performed eleven structured activities and one free play session while wearing a GT 1 M ActiGraph accelerometer using 15 s epochs. The structured activities were chosen based on the direct observation system Children's Activity Rating Scale (CARS) while the criterion measure of PA intensity during free play was provided using a second-by-second observation protocol (modified CARS). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses {{were used to determine}} the accelerometer <b>cut</b> <b>points.</b> To examine the classification differences, accelerometer data of four consecutive days from 114 preschoolers (5. 5 +/- 0. 3 years) were classified by intensity according to previously published and the newly developed accelerometer <b>cut</b> <b>points.</b> Differences in predicted PA levels were evaluated using repeated measures ANOVA and Chi Square test. Results. <b>Cut</b> <b>points</b> were identified at 373 counts/ 15 s for light (sensitivity: 86 %; specificity: 91 %; Area under ROC curve: 0. 95), 585 counts/ 15 s for moderate (87 %; 82 %; 0. 91) and 881 counts/ 15 s for vigorous PA (88 %; 91 %; 0. 94).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Adolescent and adult measures of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were collected in 365 Australian, 1185 Finnish, and 273 US subjects participating in 3 population-based prospective cohort studies. Lipoprotein variables in adolescence were classified according to NCEP and NHANES <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> and compared for their ability to predict abnormal levels in adulthood.

We examined the prevalence of overweight/obesity, using lower BMI <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Asians, and diabetes in Asian American subgroups in California. Method: Secondary analysis of the 2009 adult California Health Interview Survey (n= 45, 946) of non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), African Americans, Hispanics and Asians (Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, South Asian and Japanese). WHO Asian BMI <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> (overweight= 23 - 27. 5 kg/m 2; obese≥ 27. 5 kg/m 2) were used for Asian subgroups.

DATA: A large (n = 114, 925) state wide administrative data set of preschool children (aged 48 - 60 months) in South Australia including measured height and weight, collected at various points in the fifth year of life by the Children, Youth and Women's Health Service (CYWHS) between 1995 and 2003. METHODS: Prevalence of overweight and obesity were calculated for each year of the data set between 1995 and 2003. The international mid-year <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> were compared to <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for each month of age throughout the fifth year of life.

40|$|Background: Recommended {{levels of}} youth {{physical}} activity (PA) should emerge from data related to important health outcomes. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to establish criterion-referenced standards for PA (using pedometer-assessed steps/day) related to healthy body composition. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of an existing data set (including pedometer-assessed PA and objectively measured BMI) of 1, 954 children (995 girls, 959 boys; ages 6 - 12 years) from the USA, Australia, and Sweden. The contrasting groups method [M. J. Sarif, Introduction to Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science, St. Louis, MO: Mosby College Publishing; 1986] for establishing criterion-referenced <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> was used to identify optimal age- and sex-specific standards for steps/day related to international BMI <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for normal weight and overweight/obesity. Results: The selected <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for steps/day for 6 - 12 year olds were 12, 000 steps/day for girls and 15, 000 steps/day for boys. Conclusions: The analytical process undertaken in this study illuminated the difference in previously used norm-referenced standards vs. criterion-referenced standards based on BMI categories. The steps/day <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> established herein, using an international sample, are higher than previously suggested normative standards but are not inconsistent with recent advances in our understanding of PA needs in youth.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdLow {{cardiorespiratory}} fitness (CRF) is {{an independent}} risk factor for cardio-vascular disease (CVD), especially in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Age-predicted, sex-stratified, and maximal MET <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> {{have been developed to}} determine the risk of CVD events and mortality in low CRF categories. We examined the proportion of Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes (HART-D) participants above these <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> before and after 9 months of aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), or a combi-nation of both (ATRT). RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdParticipants from the HART-D study (n = 196) who were randomly assigned to exercise training (AT, RT, or ATRT) or to a nonexercise control group between April 2007 and August 2009 were used in this ancillary study. <b>Cut</b> <b>points</b> were previously established for age-predicted METs (. 100 % and. 85 %, mean and increased CVD risk, respectively), age- and sex-stratified METs (Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study), and clin-ically discernible METs (men. 8. 0, women. 6. 5). RESULTSdBaseline prevalence of participants above these <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> was similar for all in-tervention groups (P. 0. 50) and ranged from 11. 9 % (. 100 % age predicted) to 55. 1 % (. 85...|$|R
40|$|Objective To define {{accelerometer}} <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> {{for different}} walking speeds in {{older adults with}} mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease. Method A volunteer sample of 30 older adults (mean age 73; SD 5. 4 years) with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease walked at self-defined brisk, normal, and slow speeds for three minutes in a circular indoor hallway, each wearing an accelerometer around the waist. Walking speed was calculated and used as a reference measure. Through ROC analysis, acceler-ometer <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for different levels of walking speed in counts per 15 seconds were gener-ated, and a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed followed by a quadratic weighted Cohen’s Kappa, to test the level of agreement between true and cut point–predicted walking speeds. Results Optimal <b>cut</b> <b>points</b> for walking speeds 1. 0 m/s were 328 and 470 counts/ 15 sec; fo...|$|R
