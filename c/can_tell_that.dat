A study of tree rings in Vietnam, produced a record of early monsoons that passed through this area. From this study, we <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> during the 14th-15th centuries monsoons were weakened and eventually followed by extreme flooding. Their inability to adapt their flooding infrastructure may have led to its eventual decline. Recent research by Australian archaeologists suggests that the decline may have been due to a shortage of water caused by the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. LDEO dendrochronological research has established tree-ring chronologies indicating severe periods of drought across mainland Southeast Asia in the early 15th century, raising the possibility that Angkor's canals and reservoirs ran dry and ended expansion of available farmland.|$|E

500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies {{that the only way}} you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad."

The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> I {{was really}} going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs."

As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...

500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous".

However, most of the office does {{not want him to}} work there due to his previous behavior, and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in particular is horrified at the idea. Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) gives him a job as a salesman, forcing Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to leave his desk and move to the annex. Todd repeatedly offends everybody with his jokes, especially Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), although Kevin pretends to play along. Only Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Packer's longtime friend, is not offended by Todd. Holly, who was at first excited to have Todd in the office per Michael's recommendations, discovers how insensitive Todd is and asks Michael to get him under control. Michael and Todd have coffee in the lobby, where Todd says {{he wants to be a}} better person. Michael gets Todd to apologize, but everyone <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> the apologies are insincere. Dwight and Jim scheme to get rid of Todd.

[...] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children." [...] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is [...] "a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year." [...] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit." [...] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film. Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's [...] "greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics".

2500|$|Beyond its {{rejection}} by Zamfirescu, Nemțeanu's work was also given poor ratings by other {{critics of the}} period.

[...] Lovinescu finds that only the [...] "chocolate-cow" [...] lyrics showed an ability to meet modernist standards, but that they came too late in Nemțeanu's life.
