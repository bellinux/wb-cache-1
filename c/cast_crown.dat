This study investigated the influence of compressive cyclic loading on the physical retention of <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings cemented to implant abutments. METHODS: <b>Cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings were cemented to Straumann synOcta titanium implant abutments with three different readily used and available cements.

RESULTS: The mean retention values for crown copings cemented with Panavia-F cement were statistically significantly greater than both KetacCem and TempBond non-eugenol cements at each compressive cyclic loading quantity. KetacCem and TempBond non-eugenol cements produced relatively low mean retention values that were not statistically significantly different at each quantity of compressive cyclic loading. Compressive cyclic loading had a statistically significant effect on Panavia-F specimens alone, but increased loading quantities produced no further statistically significant difference in mean retention.

40|$|Summary Background The {{cementation}} of crowns to {{dental implant}} abutments is an accepted form of crown retention that requires {{consideration of the}} properties of available cements within the applied clinical context. Most current dental cements were developed primarily for use with natural tooth crowns, but must act in a different manner with implant components. Cements are exposed {{to a number of}} stressors that may reduce crown retention in vivo, {{not the least of which}} is occlusal loading. This study investigated the influence of compressive cyclic loading on the physical retention of <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings cemented to implant abutments. Method <b>Cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings were cemented to Straumann synOcta titanium implant abutments with three different readily used and available cements. Specimens were placed in a humidifier, thermocycled and subjected to one of four quantities of compressive cyclic loading. The uniaxial tensile force required to remove the <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings was then recorded. Data analysis was conducted using two-way ANOVA and paired post tests. Results Statistical analysis arising from post tests following two-way ANOVA testing revealed the mean retention values for crown copings cemented with Panavia-F cement (5. 103, 2. 681, 3. 178, 2. 986 MPa) were statistically significantly greater than both KetacCem (0. 646, 0. 701, 1. 083, 0. 914 MPa) and TempBond non–eugenol (0. 074, 0. 181, 0. 190, 0. 303 MPa) cements at each compressive cyclic loading quantity. KetacCem and TempBond non–eugenol cements produced relatively low mean retention values that were not statistically significantly different at each quantity of compressive cyclic loading. Compressive cyclic loading had a statistically significant effect on Panavia-F specimens alone, but increased loading quantities produced no further statistically significant difference in mean retention. Compressive cyclic loading had no overriding statistically significant effect on the retention of all specimens as a population. Conclusions Within the limitations of the current in vitro conditions employed in this study, the retention of <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings cemented to Straumann synOcta implant abutments with Panavia-F, KetacCem, and TempBond non-eugenol was significantly affected by cement type but not compressive cyclic loading. Panavia-F is the cement of choice for the definitive non-retrievable cementation of <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> copings to Straumann synOcta implant abutments out of the three cements tested.

40|$|Introduction. If {{patients}} have remained {{only a few}} teeth in one jaw, these teeth can be retained and specifically prepared to bear mobile supradental prosthesis i. e. overdenture (OD). The patients are usually very motivated to preserve remained teeth. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the plan, the preparation procedure and the treatment protocol for the remaining teeth that will bear full mobile OD. Material and Methods. Study included 12 patients and 23 remaining teeth. Treatment plan considered: radiological analysis and selection of the remaining teeth, reduction of the clinical crown of the teeth, endodontic and periodontal treatment and finally conservative or prosthodontic restoration of these teeth. Fifteen teeth were restored using <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> build-up (cap) and eight teeth were restored with amalgam restorations. Patients who received twelve lower mobile full OD were observed for one year to assess the integrity of the extra alveolar tooth structure. Results. After observation period of one year, the integrity of crown restorations was maintained as well as the alveolar bone height. Conclusion. The restoration of the remaining teeth using <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> build-up (cap) and amalgam is very important for maintaining extra alveolar tooth structure and successful treatment with overdentures...|$|E
40|$|Trauma {{may result}} in craze lines on the enamel surface, one or more {{fractured}} cusps of posterior teeth, cracked tooth syndrome, splitting of posterior teeth, and vertical fracture of root. Out of these, management of some fractures is of great challenge and such teeth are generally recommended for extraction. Literature search reveals attempts to manage such fractures by full <b>cast</b> <b>crown,</b> orthodontic wires, and so forth, in which consideration was given to extracoronal splinting only. However, due to advancement in materials and technologies, intracoronal splinting can be achieved as well. In this case report, longitudinal fractures in tooth # 27, tooth # 37, and tooth # 46 had occurred. In # 27, fracture line was running mesiodistally involving the pulpal floor resulting in a split tooth. In teeth 37 and 46, fractures of the mesiobuccal cusp and mesiolingual cusp were observed, respectively. They were restored with cast gold inlay and full <b>cast</b> <b>crown,</b> respectively. Longitudinal fracture of 27 was treated with an innovative approach using intracanal reinforced composite with Ribbond, external reinforcement with an orthodontic band, and full cast metal crown to splint the split tooth...|$|E

40|$|Glass ionomer cements (GICs) are {{commonly}} used for cementing full <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> restorations. Regrettably, although the dental cements fill {{the gap between the}} tooth and the crown, bacterial microleakage may occur, resulting in secondary caries. As microleakage cannot be completely prevented, GICs possessing antibacterial properties are in demand. In the present study the antibacterial activity of insoluble, cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (QPEI) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 % w/w in two clinically available GICs were studied. The antibacterial activity was tested against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei using the direct contact test (DCT) and the agar diffusion test (ADT). Using the direct contact test, antibacterial activity (< 0. 05) was found in both tested GICs with incorporated QPEI nanoparticles, the effect lasting for at least one month. However, the ADT showed no inhibition halo in the test bacteria, indicating that the antimicrobial nanoparticles do not diffuse into the agar. The results show that the incorporation of QPEI nanoparticles in glass ionomer cements has a long-lasting antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei. Changing the antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements by incorporating QPEI antibacterial nanoparticles may prolong the clinical performance of dental crowns...|$|E
40|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{can increase}} {{the volume of the}} tongue. A large tongue between the upper and lower teeth may be a serious obstacle, especially for tapping during occlusal adjustments in prosthetic treatment. We developed a tongue retractor to eliminate interference by the tongue. This study assesses the effect of the tongue retractor on occlusal adjustment time and describes two patients in which the tongue retractor was used. Methods The study involved five patients and two dentists. Measurements were performed during occlusal adjustment of the molars. The time from when the dentist took hold of the articulating paper to the first tap was compared in situations with and without the tongue retractor. Results The mean occlusal adjustment time was significantly shorter (p < 0. 05) than without the tongue retractor for both dentist A and B in all patients. Conclusion Use of the tongue retractor considerably shortened occlusal adjustment times under general anesthesia. Clinical reports We have been using the tongue retractor in clinical practice for 7 years. Two individual patients are described. One was a 34 -year-old woman with cerebral palsy who underwent full mouth reconstruction, consisting of prosthetic appliances (full <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> and resin facing crown) for 26 teeth.

40|$|Crown {{and bridge}} have {{life span of}} many years but they fail {{for a number of}} reasons. Over the years, many devices have been {{designed}} to remove crowns and bridges from abutment teeth. While the removal of temporary crowns and bridges is usually very straightforward, the removal of a definitive <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> with unknown cement is more challenging. Removal is often by destructive means. There are a number of circumstances, however, in which conservative disassembly would aid the practitioner in completing restorative/endodontic procedures. There are different mechanisms available to remove a failed crown or bridge. But there is no information published about the classification of available systems for crown and bridge removal. So it is logical to classify these systems into different groups which can help a clinician in choosing a particular type of system depending upon the clinical situation. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a classification for various crown and bridge removal systems; describe how a number of systems work; and when and why they might be used. A PubMed search of English literature was conducted up to January 2010 using the terms: Crown and bridge removal, Crown and bridge disassembly, Crown and bridge failure.

40|$|Provisional cements are {{commonly}} used to facilitate retrievability of cement-retained fixed implant restorations; but compromised abutment preparation may affect the retention of implant-retained crowns. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of abutment design and type of luting agent on the retentive strength of cement-retained implant restorations. Two prefabricated abutments were attached to their corresponding analogs and embedded in an acrylic resin block. The first abutment (control group) was left intact without any modifications. The screw access channel for the first abutment was completely filled with composite resin. In the second abutment, (test group) the axial wall was partially removed to form an abutment with 3 walls. Wax models were made by CAD/CAM. Ten cast copings were fabricated for each abutment. The prepared copings were cemented on the abutments by Temp Bond luting agent under standardized conditions (n= 20). The assemblies were stored in 100 % humidity for one day at 37 °C prior to testing. The <b>cast</b> <b>crown</b> was removed from the abutment using an Instron machine, and the peak removal force was recorded. Coping/abutment specimens were cleaned after testing, and the testing procedure was repeated for Dycal luting agent (n= 20). Data were analyzed with two- way ANOVA (α= 0. 05). There was no significant difference in the mean transformed retention (Ln-R) between intact abutments (4. 90 ± 0. 37) and the abutments with 3 walls (4. 83 ± 0. 25) using Dycal luting agent. However, in TempBond group, the mean transformed retention (Ln-R) was significantly lower in the intact abutment (3. 9 ± 0. 23) compared to the abutment with 3 walls (4. 13 ± 0. 33, P= 0. 027). The retention of cement-retained implant restoration can be improved by the type of temporary cement used. The retention of cast crowns cemented to implant abutments with TempBond is influenced by the wall removal...|$|E

Purpose: This study will evaluate the influence of different convergence angles and tooth preparation heights on the marginal adaptation and retention of allceramic CAD/CAM crowns. Materials 2 ̆ 6 Methods: Seventy two typodont teeth (Ivorine teeth; Columbia Dentoform Corp, Long Island City, NY) were prepared using milling burs (Brasseler, USA) and a parallometer (PFG 100, Cendres and Metaux, Switzerland) with 1. 0 mm rounded shoulder finish lines. Specimens were divided into 3 groups (n= 24) according to 3, 4. 5 and 6 mm occluso-gingival (O-G) heights. The teeth within each group were then subdivided into 3 subgroups (8 in each sub-group) according to total occlusal convergence (TOC) of 8, 16 and 22 degrees. Using the intra-oral camera wand of the Cerec AC machine (Sirona, Germany), optical impressions were made of each tooth. This data was then transferred to the Cerec MC XL milling unit for fabrication of all-ceramic crowns using IPS Empress II (Ivoclar Vivadent, US). The crowns were cemented on typodont teeth with glass ionomer cement. The marginal discrepancy was measured at 6 points with optical microscopy. Retention was evaluated by measuring the tensile force required to dislodge or break the crown from the corresponding tooth preparation in a universal testing machine. Data were analysed using Shapiro-Wilke tests for normality and Leven 2 ̆ 7 s tests for equal variances. To look for differences between groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD test was performed. Results: Mean marginal gap was 35. 9 ± 18. 4 ìm to 81. 4 ± 61. 3 ìm. 2 - way ANOVA shows no significant difference in marginal gap among the groups (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The height mean retentive force 183. 84 ± 27. 0 N, was measured for 6 mm height and 8 ° group and lowest force 86. 01 ± 10. 75 N, was measured for 3 mm and 22 ° group. 2 - way ANOVA with turkey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD test shows significant difference among the groups (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Conclusion: Marginal adaptation of the CAD/CAM all-ceramic crowns is comparable to conventional cast crowns. The preparation recommendation for conventional porcelain fused to metal crowns can be applied to CAD/CAM crown restorations.

40|$|Aim: to {{investigate}} regularities {{of the spread}} of oral microflora during manipulations performed by the dental orthopedist and evaluate the individual protection equipment and measures {{to prevent the spread}} of infections used by dentists and to improve them. Objectives 1. To investigate the formation of a spray and its spreading during preparation of the solid dental tissues. 2. To investigate the distribution of the mixture formed of the fluid of the oral cavity and cooling fluid in the work zone of the dentist’s in the course of preparation of solid dental tissues; to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of suction systems. 3. To investigate the contamination of the plaster teeth models with oral microflora through alginate and silicon impressions and suggest the most optimal method of their disinfection. 4. To evaluate the efficacy of exposure to 0. 12 % chlorhexidine gluconate aqueous solution as a prophylactic agent used before starting dental procedures. 5. To determine changes in microbial contamination of the dentist’s protective face shield after preparation of the solid dental tissues. 6. To determine the level of usage of the individual protection equipment and measures {{to prevent the spread of}} infections among Lithuanian dentist. Novelty and practical significance of the research work. The following results characterize the novelty and practical significance of this research; - an original methodology has been developed for evaluation of quantitative, qualitative and vectorial parameters of the spray cloud formed of the oral cavity and cooling fluids during the preparation of solid dental tissues; - the fact that qualitative and quantitative distribution of the oral cavity and cooling fluids in the work place of the dentist during the preparation of solid dental tissues depends mainly on the effectiveness of the suction system has been shown objectively; - effectiveness of different suction systems has been assessed an d an original extra-oral aspirator has been developed and proposed by the doctoral candidate; its application permits to optimally reduce the contamination in the dentist‘s work zone; - it has been determined that plaster teeth models are being infected with microflora of the oral cavity through impressions used for their formation; - it was determined that the level of contamination of the alginate impressions with oral microflora was by 54 % higher than analogues level of the silicon impressions. Washing with running water alone diminished the contamination of the alginate impressions by 15 % and that of the silicon impressions by 52 % and that a disinfectant METASYS Green & Clean AD has been an effective agent for disinfection of impressions; - it has been proved that rinsing of the oral cavity with 0. 12 % aqueous solution of chlorhexidine decreases the amount of microorganisms on dental impressions more than 10 times, therefore it is recommended to rinse the oral cavity before every manipulation by the dentist - it has been objectively proved that the largest part of the spray during the preparation of the teeth of the lower jaw, settles on the breast of the patient while during the preparation of teeth of the upper jaw, on the patient’s face and dentist’s clothing and face; therefore it is recommended to apply protective measures taking into account the se findings of the study; - it was found that microbial contamination of the dentists, face protective shield increases 10 times during preparation of solid dental tissues, therefore the usage of the protective shield is indispensable in the dentist‘s practice; - it has been found that Lithuanian dentists insufficiently use the individual protection equipment and measures to prevent the spread of the oral infections. Conclusions 1. During preparation of solid dental tissues, the spray cloud formed from the fluid of the oral cavity and cooling fluid, about 1. 5 m in diameter, potentially containing pathogen microorganisms, contaminates the face of the dentists and of the patient, and contaminates the close workplace environment. The greater part of the spray settles on the breast of the patient during the preparation of the mandibular the teeth, and on the patient’s face and doctor’s clothing and face during the preparation of the maxillary teeth. 2. The nature of the spray formed from the fluid of the oral cavity and cooling fluid in the work zone of the dentists in the course of the preparation of solid dental tissues depends on the used suction system. The best effectiveness of the safety system is achieved by using a small-size suction pump and the extra-oral aspirator proposed by us. 3. Plaster teeth models are being infected with oral microflora through impressions, the level of their contamination dependents on the type of impression material and the method of impression disinfection. The microbial contamination of plaster models made from the alginate impressions was by 54 % higher than contamination of the models made from silicon impressions. After washing the alginate impressions with running tap water the contamination of plaster models declined by 15 % whereas after analogous washing of the silicon impressions, by 52 %. Both plaster teeth models became not infected with microorganisms of oral cavity after their disinfection with a disinfectant METASYS Green & Clean AD. 4. Rinsing of the oral cavity with 0. 12 % aqueous solution of chlorhexidine gluconate diminishes the amount of microorganisms on teeth impressions more than 10 times. 5. Our study has shown that after preparation of solid dental tissues for <b>cast</b> <b>crown,</b> the microbial contamination of the dentist’s protective face shield increased 9. 4 times. Therefore it is a very important reason to use equipment for individual protection from the oral infection. 6. Lithuanian dentists use individual protection means insufficiently in their everyday dental practice. Protective glasses are not used at all in their dental practice even by 16 % of dentists, protective masks, by 6 % of dentists. Protective glasses are being used irregularly by 22 % of the dentists; whereas protective masks, even by 19 % of dental doctors...|$|E
