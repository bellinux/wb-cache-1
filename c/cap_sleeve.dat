50|$|In the 1930s, the LDS Church built Beehive Clothing Mills, {{which was}} {{responsible}} for manufacturing and selling garments. This led to a more standardized design. During this time women's garments were one-piece designs that ended just above the knees and had a <b>cap</b> <b>sleeve.</b> In the 1970s, the first two-piece garment became available and Mormons generally accepted the change. Today, garments are made in both styles {{with a variety of}} different fabrics. Feminine styles are sold with either a rounded or a sweetheart neckline with cap sleeves. Sweetheart necklines usually follow the line of the bra, which is usually worn over the garment. There are also two styles of necklines for men.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: For my collection, I went on {{a journey}} of self-discovery to find my {{personal}} design aesthetic. I reflected upon my personal fashion sense and drew inspiration from a recent fascination with swag pop music, which is a side genre of pop music utilizing upbeat drums, catchy melodies, top- 40 hooks, and rap-style bridges. In my closet, I have a cheetah print trench coat, which I bought before starting college. I wore the coat so much that I became known as “cheetah girl. ” This jacket and newfound persona were {{a major source of}} inspiration for this piece. Process: “Cheetah Girl“ is my rendition of the little black dress with a fun and sexy twist. I wanted the piece to be very structured; I love structured dresses because they are classic and figure flattering. I used the pop of cheetah print in the waistband, bow, and <b>cap</b> <b>sleeve</b> to keep the piece fun and young. The low back adds subtle sex appeal while still maintaining a sense of modesty. I added the studs at the shoulders for an unexpected edge. I think the piece is a perfect mix between sexy, sweet, and edgy. It is the perfect look for a girl who wants to stand out in a crowd. Techniques: This piece was created using the draping technique. Draping is the smoothing, contouring, and the manipulation of fabric on a dress form to create a design and ultimately a pattern. From this pattern, I constructed a sample garment using sheets purchased from the Goodwill. After the sample was created, I fit it to my model and made major changes to the pattern to assure proper fit. Once the pattern was updated, I then started on the fully lined final garment. Materials: Black woven stretch satin, black woven lining, cotton blend cheetah print, invisible zipper, studs, and thread...|$|E
