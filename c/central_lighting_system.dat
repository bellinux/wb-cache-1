40|$|Ambient systems provide {{information}} in the periphery of a user’s attention. Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e. g. writing or reading). In recent years, light {{has been used to}} create ambient systems to display information. Examples of ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> range from simple notification systems such as displaying messages or calendar event reminders, to more complex systems such as focusing on conveying information regarding health activity tracking. However, for ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a broad design space that lacks guidelines on when to make use of light displays and how to design them. In this paper we provide a systematic overview of existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> over four identified information classes derived from 72 existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems.</b> The most prominent encoding parameters among the surveyed ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> are color, brightness, and their combination.

40|$|Long-term care {{facilities}} are currently installing dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> {{with the aim}} to improve the well-being and behaviour of residents with dementia. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the implementation of dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> from the perspective of stakeholders and the performance of the technology. Therefore, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the management and care professionals of six {{care facilities}}. Moreover, light measurements were conducted in order to describe the exposure of residents to lighting. The results showed that the main reason for purchasing dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> lied in the assumption that the well-being and day/night rhythmicity of residents could be improved. The majority of care professionals were not aware of the reasons why dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> were installed. Despite positive subjective ratings of the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems,</b> no data were collected by the organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of the lighting. Although the care professionals stated that they did not see any large positive effects of the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> on the residents and their own work situation, the majority appreciated the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> more than the old situation. The light values measured in the care facilities did not exceed the minimum threshold values reported in the literature.

The cost comparison of solar-powered LED lighting and sodium lamps using grid was carried out.

40|$|Near-infrared images {{obtained}} with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Adaptive Optics Bonnette (AOB) {{are used to}} investigate the stellar content within 18 arcsec {{of the center of}} the Local Group spiral galaxy M 33. AGB stars with near-infrared spectral-energy distributions similar to those of giants in the solar neighborhood and Baade’s Window are detected over most of the field. Neither the peak brightness nor the color of the AGB sequence on the (K, J − K) color-magnitude diagram changes with distance from the galaxy center. The bolometric luminosity function (LF) of these stars has a discontinuity near Mbol = − 5. 25, and comparisons with evolutionary tracks suggest that most of the AGB stars formed in a burst of star formation 1 − 3 Gyr in the past, indicating that the star formation rate near the center of M 33 has varied significantly during the past few Gyr. The images are also used to investigate the integrated near-infrared photometric properties of the nucleus and the <b>central</b> <b>light</b> concentration. The nucleus is bluer than the <b>central</b> <b>light</b> concentration, in agreement with previous studies at visible wavelengths. The near-infrared photometric properties of the nucleus are reminiscent of relatively young clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, while the photometric properties of the <b>central</b> <b>light</b> concentration {{are similar to those of}} globular clusters.
