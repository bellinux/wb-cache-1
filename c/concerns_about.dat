40|$|Cardiac {{screening}} {{programs are}} ineffective when participants with abnormal findings fail to seek treatment and, {{to a lesser}} extent, when participants with normal findings use medical facilities unnecessarily because of continuing <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> heart disease. Age, sex, measure of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms and life stress, and abnormal test results were used to predict the use of physician services in the 3 months following screening. Abnormal test results predicted the use of physician services after screening, as did being older, and having life stress and <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms. Being older, male, and <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms predicted having at least one abnormal test result. Participants with normal findings {{and high levels of}} <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms were as likely to see a physician after the screening as were persons with abnormal findings and low levels of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms. Emphasizing participants' <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> symptoms of heart disease or feelings of stress failed to produce an increase in followup for persons who had abnormal screening outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that gait patterns in older people may be affected by <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling and physiological falls risk on gait performance using a paradigm in which <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling was experimentally induced. Methods. Forty-four community-living older adults (17 men, 27 women) with a mean age of 76. 8 (standard deviation = 5. 2) years walked at self-selected speeds on the floor and on a 60 -cm elevated walkway in normal and dim lighting conditions. Temporal and spatial gait parameters, muscle activity, measures of physiological arousal, physiological falls risk, and <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falls were assessed. Results. Physiological falls risk was associated with slower walking speeds in all conditions including the optimal (floor) condition (p =. 029). In the elevated walkway conditions, <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falls (both self-report and as indicated by physiological arousal) was increased and participants walked more slowly, took shorter steps, decreased their cadence, and spent more time in double support (p <. 005). Disproportionately large reductions in walking speed were evident in participants with greater <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling (p =. 018). Conclusions. These findings suggest that walking performance is influenced by both physiological and psychological factors. Physiological falls risk appears to determine walking speed under optimal conditions, whereas <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling elicits greater (possibly excessive) gait adjustments under conditions of postural threat...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify developmental differences in the value priorities for individuals who spontaneously expressed a <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> nuclear war and those who did not. The Rokeach Value Survey rtnd the Spontaneous <b>Concern</b> <b>About</b> the Nuclear Threat Scale were administered to a sample of over 5, 000 adolescents and over 900 adult community members in the rural inland northwest. About one in four of the adolescents and older adults expressed <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> nuclear war. A significantly smaller proportion of the younger adults expressed <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> a nuclear war than the adolescents and older adults. Value priorities were found to differentiate significantly the two concern groups across the age span. Adolescents and adults who expressed <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> a nuclear war placed higher priorities on tle social values of a world at peace. Respondents who did not exp. :ess a <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> nuclear war placed higher priorities on the individual values of an exciting life and pleasure.
