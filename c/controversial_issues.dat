5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes.

This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{theological}} and ethical treatises were original written works, {{as compared to}} many of his other writings that were taken from his talks. They cover his positions on various <b>controversial</b> <b>issues</b> of theology. Many of them were directed at Stephen, his main antagonist in the church, along with other church officials whom Symeon saw as taking an overly theoretical approach to Christianity. In these pieces Symeon defended {{the traditions of the}} early Byzantine mystical theologians from the teachings of the church officials of his own time. Central to this defense was Symeon's view that the revelation of scripture could only be understood through the experience of divine grace given to the pure of heart during contemplation.|$|E

5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of <b>controversial</b> <b>issues.</b> He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} <b>controversial</b> <b>issues</b> confronting the delegates {{was that of}} slavery. Slavery was {{widespread}} in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{uses the}} {{standard}} setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons scope is larger {{than that of a}} regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment {{on the state of the}} environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or <b>controversial</b> <b>issues</b> in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.|$|E

5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the <b>controversial</b> <b>issues</b> subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
