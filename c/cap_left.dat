5000|$|The poem Little Red Cap {{begins with}} [...] "At childhood's end" [...] informing its {{audience}} {{of the characters}} transition out of childhood. She is narrating the story, as she explains that once the wolf came {{to the edge of}} the woods her childhood ended. Little Red Cap examines the wolf, and found herself excited about his large ears, eyes, and teeth!The wolf is portrayed as an older character by the reference of alcohol used in his description"his hairy paw, red wine staining his bearded jaw". Little Red Cap, only 16 years old pursues the older wolf. That became the start of her transition to adulthood. Being younger than the wolf, he buys Little Red Cap her first drink. The reason: poetry. Little Red Cap was prepared for what was to come. She knew that the wolf would lead her into the woods. Little Red Cap was prepared to leave home, and go into the woods with the wolf. This was the beginning of the love story and relationship of Little Red Cap and the wolf. She discovered an abundance of books within the Wolf's lair. The two grew close as their relationship blossomed. After 10 years passed from when Little Red Cap wandered into the woods with the Wolf she left the woods without him, ending their relationship. When she met the wolf she was only a child, but after 10 years passed Little Red <b>Cap</b> <b>left</b> the woods as an adult.|$|E
50|$|This Airport was {{originally}} {{built in the}} 1930s by a local aviator {{by the name of}} J. Howard Wilcox. The Airport got the addition of the Beacon in 1938 and is still in use today. In December 1941 J. Howard Wilcox was asked to head the Kansas Wing of the Newly organized Civil Air Patrol. Wilcox flew to Washington D.C. and was briefed on the Organization and returned to Anthony. Upon returning he set up a town meeting and had attendees from several towns in the area. At this meeting he informed the locals of CAP and met with officials to use the Airport as the location of the Headquarters. This was approved and the Anthony Airport became the Kansas Wing Headquarters of the Civil Air Patrol on December 21, 1941. This airport was taken a further step by turning it into a CAP Training base for the State of Kansas. The Army took notice of this little airport and stationed several Boeing B-17s at the Airport. In the late 1950s the CAP Wing Headquarters moved from Anthony to a larger city, and Wilcox began to further his career in Law. <b>CAP</b> <b>left</b> Anthony and was only a story that Wilcox would tell the local children about. CAP returned to Anthony in 2008 as a Color Guard in the Anthony Balloon Fest Parade. Although CAP has not yet been re-established in Anthony, CAP has made several Appearances in the Harper County Fair Parade in Harper, KS and in the Anthony Christmas Parade. The Civil Air Patrol squadrons that have performed in the parades are Emerald City Composite Squadron out of Wichita, Kansas, and Cunningham Composite Squadron out of Cunningham, Kansas. These appearances were, and still are, arranged through a local Harper County youth, Cadet Second Lieutenant Trenton Seipel, that is an active member in the Civil Air Patrol.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-season premiere [...] "What Happened and What's Going On," [...] Tyreese {{goes with}} the {{remaining}} survivors to Noah's home but discover his gated community to have been destroyed and overrun with walkers. Tyreese talks to a grieving Noah who tells him about Karen and how he almost killed himself by throwing himself at the walkers at the prison, but regained his will to live and saved Judith, telling Noah {{that he needs to}} be able to recover without letting the grief go to his head. Tyreese helps clear Noah's house so he can see his family's bodies but while Tyreese is looking at photos of Noah's brothers he is bitten by Noah's younger brother who had become a walker. Tyreese begins to bleed out from the infection but is taunted by hallucinations of Martin and the Governor criticizing him for his inability to act in the face of danger, and make him believe that his lack of trying may have led to other group members being killed. However Tyreese is comforted by hallucinations of Bob, Beth, Lizze and Mika who assure him that his actions were the right ones and it's not his fault what happened to them, and assure him that it's ok for him to let go. When the Governor especially criticizes him for his inability to kill Carol despite killing Karen, Tyreese confronts him criticizing him for all the actions he committed and all the people that died because of them. After scolding him Tyreese proudly defends his actions and knows that he made the right calls and that people like him, they do get to live. Tyreese hallucinates Lizzie and Mika holding his hand, which in reality it is Rick and Michonne attempting to save him by chopping off his infected arm and carry him to the car to get back to the others to save him. On the way however Tyreese blood loss becomes severe and he decides to let go as he sees Bob, Beth, Lizzie and Mika in the car one last time assuring him it's ok now and looks around to see their faces, now no longer with their wounds, smiling at them and passes away peacefully. After dying Michonne puts him down to prevent reanimation and he is buried by Rick, with his <b>cap</b> <b>left</b> on his cross while his funeral is presided over by Gabriel during which a grief-ridden Sasha is barely able to stand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} radiation exposure across the cranium of cardiologists and the protective ability of a nonlead, XPF (barium sulfate/bismuth oxide) layered cap (BLOXR, Salt Lake City, Utah) during fluoroscopically guided, invasive cardiovascular (CV) procedures. BackgroundCranial radiation exposure and potential for protection during contemporary invasive CV procedures is unclear. MethodsInvasive cardiologists wore an XPF cap with radiation attenuation ability. Six dosimeters were fixed across the outside and inside of the <b>cap</b> (<b>left,</b> center, and right), and 3 dosimeters were placed outside the catheterization lab to measure ambient exposure. ResultsSeven cardiology fellows and 4 attending physicians (38. 4 ± 7. 2 years of age; all male) performed diagnostic and interventional CV procedures (n = 66. 2 ± 27 cases/operator; fluoroscopy time: 14. 9 ± 5. 0 min). There was significantly greater total radiation exposure at the outside left and outside center (106. 1 ± 33. 6 mrad and 83. 1 ± 18. 9 mrad) versus outside right (50. 2 ± 16. 2 mrad; p < 0. 001 for both) locations of the cranium. The XPF cap attenuated radiation exposure (42. 3  ±  3. 5 mrad, 42. 0 ± 3. 0 mrad, and 41. 8 ± 2. 9 mrad at the inside left, inside center, and inside right locations, respectively) to a level slightly {{higher than that of}} the ambient control (38. 3 ± 1. 2 mrad, p = 0. 046). After subtracting ambient radiation, exposure at the outside left was 16 times higher than the inside left (p < 0. 001) and 4. 7 times higher than the outside right (p <  0. 001). Exposure at the outside center location was 11 times higher than the inside center (p <  0. 001), whereas no difference was observed on the right side. ConclusionsRadiation exposure to invasive cardiologists is significantly higher on the left and center compared with the right side of the cranium. Exposure may be reduced similar to an ambient control level by wearing a nonlead XPF cap. (Brain Radiation Exposure and Attenuation During Invasive Cardiology Procedures [BRAIN]; NCT 01910272...|$|E
