5|$|Obama {{was born}} in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{two years after the}} {{territory}} was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago.

Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.|$|E

Rethinking Race in Post-Racial America, and utilizes their insights to both explore {{the challenges that}} face {{the next generation of}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> lawyers and offer suggestions on how this next generation of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> lawyers can overcome these difficulties. Overall, this Book Review highlights one similarity in the roles of black <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorneys</b> past and present: the need for lawyers in both generations to perform their identities in ways that make them racially representative of Blacks and racially palatable to Whites. Thereafter, this Book Review shows how the performance of black <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorneys</b> as the representatives of individuals, groups, and communities has become more complicated over time by highlighting the differences between the challenges encountered by early black <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> lawyers and today 2 ̆ 7 s and the next generation 2 ̆ 7 s <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> lawyers. Finally, this Book Review offers suggestions for strategies that the next generation of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorneys</b> may use to rechannel the study and practice of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> law in more experimental, activist directions that attend to the complexities of how race is understood in today 2 ̆ 7 s society as well as the complexities of how racial discrimination is practiced today...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Fees Award Act of 1976 {{is a law}} of the United States.

It allows a Federal court to award reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in certain <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> cases.

During this period, Walker also worked as writer-in-residence at Jackson State College (1968–69) and Tougaloo College (1970–71), and was a consultant in black history to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program.

25|$|In 1967, Johnson {{nominated}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorney</b> Thurgood Marshall to be {{the first}} African American Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. To head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development, Johnson appointed Robert C. Weaver—the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration. In 1968 Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement, the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King,Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King's death. On April 5, Johnson {{wrote a letter to the}} United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill (which was previously stalled) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10.|$|E

500|$|In June 1987, Philip Elman, a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorney</b> {{who served}} as an {{associate}} in the Solicitor General's office during Harry Truman's term, claimed he and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter were mostly responsible for the Supreme Court's decision, and stated that the NAACP's arguments did not present strong evidence. Elman {{has been criticized for}} offering a self-aggrandizing history of the case, omitting important facts, and denigrating the work of civil rights attorneys who had laid the groundwork for the decision over many decades. However, Frankfurter was also known for being one of court's most outspoken advocates of the judicial restraint philosophy of basing court rulings on existing law rather than personal or political considerations. Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President George W. Bush spoke {{at the opening of the}} Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, calling Brown [...] "a decision that changed America for the better, and forever." [...] Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases hailing the ruling.|$|E
500|$|The city gained {{national}} media attention in 1998 when television {{talk show host}} Oprah Winfrey was unsuccessfully sued by local cattlemen for comments made on her show connecting American beef to mad cow disease, costing them and their industry millions of dollars. In order to attend the trial in Amarillo, she temporarily relocated her show to the Amarillo Little Theatre for nearly a year. During the trial, Winfrey hired Dallas-based jury consultant Phil McGraw to aid her attorneys on selecting and analyzing {{the members of the}} jury. McGraw would later become a regular guest on Winfrey's television show and subsequently started his own talk show, Dr. Phil, in 2002. Another notable trial in Amarillo includes the Fort Worth-area murder case of T. Cullen Davis, which involved one of the richest men in the United States, his former wife, and her daughter and boyfriend. The trial was moved from Fort Worth to Amarillo in 1977 on a change of venue. The murder of Brian Deneke also brought attention from outside of the Texas Panhandle mainly {{due to the fact that}} the crime revolved around a conflict between two different cultures. The small town of Tulia, Texas, approximately [...] south from Amarillo, was the scene of a controversial drug sting in 1999. Local <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorney</b> Jeff Blackburn took up the case of the Tulia defendants, which became a cause célèbre and resulted in the exoneration and pardon of the defendants. A federal lawsuit directed at the officials responsible for the sting operation was held in Amarillo. In the final settlement, the City of Amarillo agreed to pay $5million in damages to the former Tulia defendants; disband the Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force that it set up to oversee the sting operation; and require early retirement for two Amarillo Police Department officers who were responsible for supervising the sting's sole undercover agent.|$|E

50|$|Many {{defendants}} {{have taken}} {{the position that the}} USAO Laffey Matrix should be used instead of the Legal Service Index (LSI) update method presumably because the USAO Laffey Matrix produces lower hourly rates than the LSI-Updated Laffey Matrix. The 2015 USAO Matrix also produces hourly rates that are lower than the LSI-Updated Laffey Matrix. Some courts in the United States have used the USAO Laffey Matrix when awarding attorneys' fees under a fee-shifting statute, such as the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Fees Awards Act.|$|R
25|$|Previous {{actions by}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>attorneys</b> had {{resulted}} in changes in the Virginia process, improving their procedures. For example, although most African Americans in Virginia had been disenfranchised since the early 20th century and were thus disqualified from serving on juries, the grand jury had included black members. In addition, each of the jury pools for the six separate trials contained some African Americans. But, none was selected {{for any of the}} seven juries, as the prosecutors rejected all of them on various grounds. The juries were all white and all male.|$|R
