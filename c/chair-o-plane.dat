5000|$|You {{can also}} find a <b>Chair-O-Plane</b> at Carters Steam Fair {{which is one of}} the largest vintage {{travelling}} funfairs including some steam driven rides. Their ride's past is a little patchy but is thought to have been built in Germany in the 1920s and imported to Britain with a blank canvas. It's generally the case that British roundabouts run clockwise, whereas their Continental and American counterparts run anti-clockwise. The <b>Chair-o-Plane</b> certainly runs the right direction to be a British-built ride, but it may have been adapted by an early owner.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> premiered in Germany in 1972, {{designed}} by Zierer and built by Franz Schwarzkopf, brother of Anton Schwarzkopf. In 1974 the first portable unit debuted {{under the same}} partnership. Since then Zierer has built about 200 units. Other manufacturers have followed creating their own versions of the <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> including Zamperla, Chance Rides, Grover Watkins, Bertazzon, Preston & Barbieri, Vekoma and Sanoyas Hishino Meisho.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} <b>Chair-O-Plane</b> ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire. Set in {{a fantasy}} themed area of the park called Cloud Cukoo Land, it is themed as a giant mushroom. This was {{formerly}} themed as a prehistoric dinosaur-type ride and located in an area called Ug Land.|$|E
5000|$|Loudoun Castle Theme Park in Scotland {{claimed that}} its moon-shaped ride, [...] "The Plough", {{was the largest}} <b>Chair-O-Plane</b> in the world. The Plough was {{originally}} called Apollo 14 and was owned by the Bembom family, operating in their Ponypark Slagharen in the Netherlands during the late seventies. It had gondolas travelling around {{the outside of the}} ride. When moved to Dreamland in England (then called [...] "Bembom Brothers"), it was reconstructed into a <b>Chair-O-Plane</b> and named Heatwave. Leaving Dreamland, it opened in Lightwater Valley in 1998 where it operated until 2003 when Henk Bembom moved Heatwave to his new park, Loudoun Castle, where it was renamed [...] "The Plough" [...] and painted green. The theme park closed in 2010 and has been standing but not operating ever since.|$|E
50|$|Every July the St Lawrence Fair {{takes place}} in Hurstpierpoint. The fair was granted a royal charter in 1313 and is still an {{important}} event {{in the life of}} the village. The fair takes place on the first Saturday in July and begins with a procession of floats through the high street. These are made by groups such as playschools, primary schools, scouts and brownies and have a different theme each year. Other popular events of the day are the family fun run and the tug-o-war where the local pubs battle it out for a barrel of beer. In 2007 and 2008 it was won by the White Horse of Albourne Road. The fair is home to Harris fun fair and usually has a <b>chair-o-plane</b> amongst its rides as well as different stalls such as a coconut shy. Charities and businesses from around the area place stalls, tombolas and raffles around the centre, and on the other side is the beer tent and pig roast.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> is {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} Dave Matthews Band's 1994 album Under the Table and Dreaming. The liner note credit lists the site of this photo as Sandusky, Ohio, which is the location of Cedar Point.|$|R
5000|$|Galleon's Graveyard - Opened 1987 as [...] "Captain Caveman's Clippers." [...] Given {{the current}} name after being {{relocated}} to Transylvania, following {{the closure of}} Little Wonders Land/Hanna-Barbera Land. Similar to a scaled-down <b>Chair-O-Planes,</b> riders were instead seated in two-seater 'flying boats'.|$|R
50|$|The swing ride or chair swing ride (sometimes {{called a}} swing carousel, wave swinger, yo-yo, <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> or swinger) is a {{fairground}} ride {{that is a}} variation on the carousel in which the chairs are suspended from the rotating top of the carousel. On some versions, particularly on the Wave Swingers, the rotating top of the carousel also tilts for additional variations of motion.|$|R
5000|$|In Italy, {{most of the}} <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> {{travel with}} fairs.The ride is called Seggiolini volanti ("Flying chairs") or calcinculo which {{literally}} means [...] "kick in the bottom", from the ingenious way used to grab the high-placed [...] "tail" [...] and win a free ride.Two people sit in contiguous seats, and the one sitting behind kicks the friend higher in the air.|$|R
50|$|Many {{traveling}} carnivals {{bring with}} them an assortment of rides. Some rides are for young children and may include a carousel, ridable miniature railway, miniature roller coaster, or an inflatable bounce house. For older children and adults, there can be {{many different types of}} rides. These rides are designed to use height, speed, g-force, or centrifugal force to appeal to the riders' senses. Some examples are the <b>Chair-O-Planes,</b> Ferris wheel, Zipper ride, and the Tilt-A-Whirl.|$|R
50|$|The new larger site saw an {{increase}} in the amount of entertainment on offer for children which included a circus and indoor cinema, as well as rides such as bumper boats, bubbles of fun, <b>chair-o-planes,</b> banana boat, the big slide and dodgems. Dave Benson Phillips (CBBC/CITV/Disney Channel) performed his Guitar Music Set on the main stage. Pat Sharp introduced the evening headline acts. Up to Â£20,000 was expected to be raised for the festival's nominated charities, Wooden Spoon and The Link Foundation.|$|R
25|$|Many {{amusement}} rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel has {{a horizontal}} central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, {{at any time}} {{the orientation of the}} gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A carousel provides rotation about a vertical axis. Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In <b>Chair-O-Planes</b> the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the centripetal force. In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people in their seats.|$|R
