40|$|The {{present report}} aims at {{presenting}} basic data {{to prove the}} wetability of a <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> contaminated by scale adherence by comparing the behaviors of a water droplet on a contaminated surface and a glossy surface polished by emery paper. A water droplet (2. 3 mm in dia.) of about 18 ℃ is dropped from a height of 20 mm above the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> and the evaporation behavior on the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> is photographed by a high speed camera. The initial temperatures of the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> {{are in the range}} of 140 - 220 ℃. At temperatures of the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> above 200 ℃, {{in the case of a}} fresh surface, the residence time of a drop on the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> is about 13 ms. While in the case of a contaminated surface, even if the drop is about to rebound from the <b>heated</b> <b>surface,</b> its root is so firmly contacted with the <b>heated</b> <b>surface</b> through the thin liquid film that the residence time is longer than that of the fresh surface. This fact proves that the surface with scale has a high wetability...|$|R

40|$|The boiling heat {{transfer}} from a downward-facing, horizontal <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> to saturated or subcooled water has been studied experimentally. The <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> is {{one end of a}} copper cylinder with a diameter in 20 mm, which is heated by an electric heater wound around it. Heat flux at the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> may be increased up to about 1. 7 × 106 W/m 2. The system pressure was changed in the range from 0. 01 MPa to 0. 3 MPa and the subcooling in the range from 0 ℃ to 70 ℃. The experiments are performed under two conditions; (1) the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> is kept stationary in water and (2) the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> can be moved reciprocally between the vapor and the liquid at a period of 0. 67 sec to 2 sec and cooled intermittently. Boiling curves are obtained for these two cases. From the observations, it is seen that, on the downward-facing <b>heating</b> <b>surface,</b> bubbles formed beneath the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> can easily coalesce and form a large blanket of vapor which prevents primary bubbles from separating on the <b>heating</b> <b>surface.</b> In such a case, the boiling curves obtained become discontinuous in the nucleate boiling region and, at low heat flux, they are shifted to the film boiling region. The burn-out heat fluxes are lower in comparison with that for an upward-facing, horizontal surface. The intermittent cooling due to the reciprocal motion of the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> and the pressures less than atmospheric pressure may reduce the value of burn-out heat fluxes...|$|R

The testing measurement module with enhanced <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces</b> was used for pool boiling research. Pool boiling experiments were conducted with distilled water at atmospheric pressure in the vessel using an enhanced sample as the bottom <b>heating</b> <b>surface.</b> The samples are soldered to a copper heating block of the round cross-section.

40|$|Subcooled flow boiling is {{generally}} characterized by high heat transfer capacity and low wall superheat, which {{is essential for}} cooling applications requiring high heat transfer rate, such as nuclear reactors and fossil boilers. In this study, subcooled flow boiling on copper and stainless steel <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces</b> was experimentally investigated from both macroscopic and microscopic points of view. Flow boiling heat flux and heat transfer coefficient were experimentally measured on both surfaces under different conditions, such as pressure, flow rate and inlet subcooling. Significant boiling heat transfer coefficient {{differences were found between}} the copper and the stainless steel <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> To explain the different flow boiling behaviors on these two <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> nucleation site density and bubble dynamics were visually observed and measured at different experimental conditions utilizing a high-speed digital video camera. These two parameters are believed to be keys in determining flow boiling heat flux. Wall superheat, critical cavity size and wall heat flux were used to correlate with nucleation site density data. Among them, wall heat flux shows the best correlation for eliminating both pressure and surface property effects. The observed nucleation site distribution shows a random distribution. When compared to the spatial Poisson distribution, similarity between them was found, while the measured nucleation site distribution is more uniform. From experimental observations, for the two surface materials investigated, which have similar surface wettability but sharply different thermal properties, bubble dynamics displayed fairly similar behavior. The obtained experimental results indicate that thermal conductivity of <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> material plays an important role in boiling heat transfer. This is due to thermal conductivity having a significant impact on the lateral heat conduction at the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> and consequently temperature uniformity of the <b>heating</b> <b>surface.</b> A model was then developed and solved numerically for heat conduction at the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> when bubbles are present. Several key parameters which impact lateral <b>heat</b> conduction and <b>surface</b> temperature profile were studied. These parameters include material thermal conductivity, bubble size, <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> thickness, etc. Numerical results show that, temperature profile on the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> tends to be more uniform and have a lower average value on a <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> with higher thermal conductivity, which agrees well with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} of thermal power plants is the contamination of <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces</b> that arises during the boiler unit operation while combusting the solid fuel.

Therefore, boiler requires higher fuel consumption to maintain the operating conditions. Violation of the thermal conditions of <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces</b> in consequence of contamination causes the negative effects on metal pipes right up to failure. This problem is urgent due to the fact that information about the process of slagging and its effect on the thermal conditions of the <b>heating</b> <b>surface</b> operation enables the possibility to minimize the negative consequences.

A layer of indium tin oxide was used as the heater material and holes of various patterns were incorporated onto the <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The hole sizes and positions were controlled for precision using conventional microelectromechanical fabrication processes. Four types of <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces</b> were considered: (1) plain (i. e., no holes), (2) 9 -hole, (3) 49 -hole, and (4) 225 -hole surfaces. For the 9 hole, 49 hole, and 225 hole patterned surfaces, and as compared to the plain <b>heating</b> <b>surface,</b> the CHF was enhanced by 16. 7, 27. 3, and 33. 1 %, respectively and heat transfer coefficients enhanced by 9. 8, 26, and 26 %, respectively. For the hole-patterned <b>heating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> distinct temperature distributions were observed consistently in the high heat flux regions &# 8211; that is to say, the patterned areas exhibited lower temperature fields than the non-patterned areas. This indicates that heat was transferred more efficiently at the hole-patterned regions than at the neighboring non-patterned regions. The CHF and BHT performances were enhanced at the patterned surfaces because the high-temperature regions were well dispersed resulting in an increased effective heat transfer area.
