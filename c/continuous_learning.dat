Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a <b>continuous</b> <b>learning</b> process.|$|E

During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used {{students}} as assistant teachers and it was called [...] "Learning half and teaching half". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a <b>continuous</b> <b>learning,</b> and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in [...] "" [...] that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, {{and all of the}} people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of [...] "Kun" [...] but never [...] "Teacher" [...] or [...] "Professor".|$|E

40|$|Objective Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) {{eliminates}} cognitive biases towards negative {{information and}} is efficacious in reducing depression recurrence, but the mechanisms behind the bias elimination {{are not fully}} understood. The present study investigated, through computer simulation of neural network models, the neural dynamics underlying the use of CBM in eliminating the negative biases {{in the way that}} depressed patients evaluate facial expressions. Methods We investigated two new CBM methodologies using biologically plausible synaptic <b>learning</b> mechanisms, <b>continuous</b> transformation <b>learning</b> and trace learning, which guide learning by exploiting either the spatial or temporal continuity between visual stimuli presented during training. We first describe simulations with a simplified one-layer neural network, and then we describe simulations in a biologically detailed multi-layer neural network model of the ventral visual pathway. Results After training with either the <b>continuous</b> transformation <b>learning</b> rule or the trace learning rule, the one-layer neural network eliminated biases in interpreting neutral stimuli as sad. The multi-layer neural network trained with realistic face stimuli was also shown {{to be able to use}} <b>continuous</b> transformation <b>learning</b> or trace learning in order to reduce biases in the interpretation of neutral stimuli. Conclusions The 19 simulation results suggest two biologically plausible synaptic <b>learning</b> mechanisms, <b>continuous</b> transformation <b>learning</b> and trace learning, that may subserve CBM. The results are highly informative for the development of experimental protocols to produce optimal CBM training methodologies with human participants. </p...|$|R

For development and testing in robotic virtual environments, Soar interfaces to a variety of robotic simulators and a simple mobile robot.

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{improvement}} and <b>learning</b> are popular concepts in management literature and practice. Often they are situated {{in an environment}} where the work is of a repetitive nature. However, {{there are a lot of}} organisations where (part of) the primary processes are carried out by means of projects. An example is organisations involved in management of infrastructure. A survey into the state-of-the-art of <b>continuous</b> {{improvement and}} <b>learning</b> in this sector was carried out at the end of 1997. The sector is part of the construction industry, which has some very distinctive characteristics that are not necessarily conducive to <b>continuous</b> improvement and <b>learning.</b> The survey results sketch a picture of organisations that have sufficient capabilities for carrying out and managing projects, but are not really oriented towards improvement and learning. They are struggling with these concepts, do not use available tools and techniques, and hence are depriving themselves of possibilities to improve their performance. ...|$|R
