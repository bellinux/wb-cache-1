30|$|The {{thickness}} of deformed layer {{and the surface}} recovery height when cutting on various lattice planes are measured in this study. Since the machined surface is not flat because the form of three-dimensional tool would print as the cut mark, the {{thickness of}} deformed layer {{is defined as the}} distance from the lowest position of the surface, namely, the middle of the cut mark, to the deepest location of the deformed layer in workpiece. Assume the bottom of the tool contact closely to the materials, the surface recovery height is defined as the distance {{from the bottom of the}} tool during cutting to the middle position of <b>cut</b> <b>groove</b> after machining. In order to obtain the details of subsurface deformation when cutting along different orientations, the thickness of deformed layer and surface recovery height of machined surface are measured from 17 equally spaced cross sections of machined surface, which are perpendicular to the cutting direction.|$|E

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} involves {{removing a}} thin layer at the surface of hardened PCC using closely spaced diamond saw blades. The level surface is achieved by running the blade assembly at a predetermined level across the pavement surface, which produces saw <b>cut</b> <b>grooves.</b> The uncut concrete between each saw cut breaks off more or less at a constant level above the saw <b>cut</b> <b>grooves,</b> leaving a level surface (at a macroscopic level) with longitudinal texture. The result is a pavement that is smooth, safe, quiet and pleasing to travel.|$|R
40|$|Material {{process in}} {{grinding}} involves three phenomena namely: rubbing, ploughing and cutting. Rubbing and ploughing, which usually occur {{before or after}} cutting, essentially mean the energy is being applied less efficiently in terms of material removal. It is therefore important to identify {{the effects of these}} different phenomena experienced during grinding. To identify the different phenomena, two channel Acoustic Emission (AE) signals were extracted by two AE sensors which would give verified energy information relating to the horizontal groove profile in terms of the material plastic deformation and material removal. With the use of a Fogale Photomap Profiler, accurate material surface profile measurements of the <b>cut</b> <b>groove</b> would be made and compared against the corresponding AE signal scratch hit data. A combination of filters, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) would provide the salient components for comparison and classification of the three different levels of Single Grit (SG) processing phenomena.

40|$|The use of FRP {{bars and}} strips as near-surface mounted (NSM) {{reinforcement}} {{has become an}} emerging technique for the strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) members. The bond between NSM FRP reinforcements and concrete is a crucial factor affecting the efficiency of this technique. Many factors involving the interaction between FRP reinforcement, adhesive and concrete can affect the bond behaviour and failure load of the NSM strengthening system. In this paper, the modified pullout test (adapted to NSM reinforcement) is used to study the effect of groove surface (pre-formed and saw <b>cut),</b> <b>groove</b> geometry (dimensions and shapes), FRP bar type (material and surface treatment), bond length; and also of the incorporation, in the groove-concrete system, of different construction details that modify the NSM-concrete interaction (transverse interlocking with or without shear connectors, covering plate with shear connectors and confinement of surrounding concrete). The tested specimens had different bond behaviours and modes of failure: bar-epoxy interface failure, epoxy failure with concrete splitting, concrete-epoxy interface failure and tensile failure of the concrete specimen.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIDuring {{the unit}} event of {{material}} iteraction in grinding three phenomena are involved, namely: rubbing, ploughing and cutting. Where ploughing and rubbing essentially mean the energy is being applied less efficiently {{in terms of}} material removal. Such phenomena usually occurs before or after cutting. Based on this distinction, {{it is important to}} identify the effects of these different phenomena experienced during grinding. Acoustic emission (AE) of the material grit interaction is considered the most sensitive monitoring process to investigate such miniscule material change. For this reason, two AE sensors were used to pick up energy information (one verifying the other) correlated to material measurements of the horizontal scratch groove profiles. Such material measurements would display both the material plastic deformation and material removal mechanisms. Accurate material surface profile measurements of the <b>cut</b> <b>groove</b> were made using the Fogale Photomap Profiler which enables the comparison between the corresponding AE signal scratch data. By using short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) and filtration, the salient features for identifying and classifying the phenomena were more distinct between the three different levels of singlegrit (SG) phenomena. Given such close data segregation between the phenomenon data sets, fuzzy clustering/genetic algorithm (GA) classification techniques were used to classify and verify the demarcation of SG phenomena. After the cutting, ploughing and rubbing gave a high confidence in terms of classification accuracy, the results from the unit/micro-event to the multi/macro-event, both 1 -μm and 0. 1 -mm grinding test data, were applied to the named classifier for classification. Interesting output results correlated for the classifier signifying a distinction that there is more cutting utilisation than both ploughing and rubbing as the interaction between grit and workpiece become more involved (measured depth of cut increases). With the said classifier technique it is possible to get a percentage utilisation of the grit and material interaction phenomena. In addition, optimised fuzzy clustering was verified against a classification and regression tree (CART) rule-based system giving transparent rule classification. Such findings were then realised into a Simulink model as a potential control system for a microgrinding simulation or, for real-time industrial control purpose...|$|E

40|$|In 1941 {{the remains}} of a chain mail were {{discovered}} in a cinerary barrow that once formed {{part of a group of}} around twenty barrows near Fluitenberg (municipality of Hoogeveen). It was not realized at the time that the remains represented such a remarkable object. When the find was published, in 1992, it was assumed to date from the Roman period. The 45 iron nails found in the burial pit were at that time interpreted as deriving from a (small) chest. Two 14 C dates recently obtained for the cremated remains from this burial have however yielded the surprising results of 2170 ± 35 BP and 2145 ± 45 BP. The latter date was obtained for burned bone with some adhering caked iron rings of the chain mail. The average of the two dates is 2160 ± 30 BP; calibrated this corresponds to 355 - 95 BC (2 σ). This makes the find a pre-Roman period chain mail – highly unusual in a northern Dutch context, but indeed also in a European context, for the number of Iron Age chain mails known in western Europe is extremely small. It is also suggested that the small nails derive from a shield, of which no further remains were found. An iron eye with an attached hook bent at right angles may have formed part of the chain mail – for example part of the fastening, but if so, it was of a very simple design. The cremated remains that could not be traced in 1992 have now been analysed and have been found to derive from an adult. The condyle of the lower jaw and the greater sciatic notch suggest a female rather than a male. The amount of cremated remains is too small (230 grams) to allow a definite sex identification. Among the cremated remains was also a piece of burned animal bone with a <b>cut</b> <b>groove.</b> The (assumed) Fluitenberg warrior belongs in a long row of martial occupants of the province of Drenthe.
