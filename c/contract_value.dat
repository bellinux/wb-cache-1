40|$|We {{study the}} {{modelling}} and valuation of surrender and other behavioural options in life insurance and pension. We place ourselves {{in between the}} two extremes of completely arbitrary intervention and optimal intervention by the policyholder. We present a method {{that is based on}} differential equations and {{that can be used to}} approximate <b>contract</b> <b>values</b> when policyholders exhibit optimal behaviour. This presentation includes a specification of sufficient conditions for both consistency of the model and convergence of the <b>contract</b> <b>values.</b> When not going to the limit in the approximation we obtain a technique for balancing off arbitrary and optimal behaviour in a simple, intuitive way. This leads to our suggestions for intervention models where one single parameter reflects the extent of rationality among policyholders. In a series of numerical examples we illustrate the impact of the rationality parameter on the <b>contract</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R
