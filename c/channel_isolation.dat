Several high-end head set manufacturers have created some units specifically for the playback of binaural.

40|$|A {{modified}} Fabry-Perot etalon {{termed a}} virtually-imaged phased-array (VIPA) was recently introduced as an optical spectral disperser. One important {{application of the}} spectral disperser is {{in the area of}} wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) fiber communication. Current WDM is operated at channel spacing of tens of GHz (standard is 50 GHz or 100 GHz), which is referred as dense WDM (DWDM). Hyperfine WDM (HWDM) has been proposed by the industry to utilize the optical communication band more efficiently at channel spacing of several GHz. Such a narrow channel spacing is a big challenge for DWDM wavelength demultiplexers. In experiment using a solid VIPA at a 50 GHz free spectral range (FSR) and a single mode fiber array with eight ports, we have implemented an eight-channel hyperfine wavelength demultiplexer at 1. 55 um, and we obtain a channel spacing around 3 GHz, more than or equal to 23 dB adjacent <b>channel</b> <b>isolations</b> and more than or equal to 30 dB nonadjacent <b>channel</b> <b>isolations.</b> Firstly, using the eight-channel wavelength demultiplexer, we test data detection at 622 Mbps (OC- 12) in a HWDM system configuration. The single channel filtering effects as well as the adjacent channel crosstalk are studied in detail. ^ DWDM transmitter consists of multiple laser diode array sources, which have a stable range of several GHz. The DWDM transmitter can 2 ̆ 7 t be used in HWDM as HWDM system requires highly stable channel sources. Here, we demonstrate a novel HWDM transmitter via sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM), where multiple RF/microwave sub-carriers are modulated on to an optical carrier for fiber transmission. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate a 4 -user, around 3 GHz-spaced hybrid SCM-HWDM system on a 50 -km fiber link, in which the SCM is used to generate closely spaced channels in the transmitter, while a hyperfine wavelength demultiplexer is used at the receiver to separate the sub-carrier channels for optical direct detection. A hyperfine blocking filter is employed in the transmitter to realize optical single sideband (O-SSB) modulation with strong carrier suppression. This work is the first demonstration of a multiple-user HWDM system at the narrowest channel spacing around 3 GHz. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Voltage-dependent {{membrane}} currents {{were investigated}} in enzymatically dissociated photoreceptors of L/ma scabra using the whole-cell clamp technique. Depolarizing steps to voltages more positive than- 10 mV elicit a transient inward current {{followed by a}} delayed, sustained outward current. The outward current is insensitive to replacement of a large fraction of extracellular C 1 - with the impermeant anion glucoronate. Superfusion with tetraethylammonium and 4 -aminopyridine reversibly abolishes the outward current, and internal perfusion with cesium also suppresses it, indicating that it is mediated by potassium <b>channels.</b> <b>Isolation</b> of the inward current reveals a fast activation kinetics, the peak amplitude occurring as early as 4 - 5 ms after stimulus onset, and a relatively rapid, though incomplete inactivation. Within the range of voltages examined, spanning up to + 90 mV, reversal was not observed. The inward current is not sensitive to tetrodotoxin at concentrations up to 10 v,M, and survives replacement of extracellular Na with tetramethylammonium. On the other hand, it is completely eliminated by calcium removal from the perfusing solution, and it is partially blocked by submillimolar concentrations of cadmium, suggesting that it is entirely due to voltage-dependent calcium channels. Analysis of the kinetics and voltage dependence of the isolated calcium current indicates the presence of two components, possibly reflecting the existence of separate populations of channels. Barium and strontium can pass through these channels, though less easily than calcium. Both the activation and the inactivation become significantly more sluggish when these ions serve as the charge carrier. A large fraction of the outward current is activated by preceding calcium influx. Suppression of this calcium-dependent potassium current shows a small residual component resembling the delayed rectifier. In addition, a transient outward current sensitive to 4 -aminopyridine (la) could also be identified. The relevance of such conductance mechanisms in the generation of the light response in Lima photoreceptors is discussed...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. This thesis, {{devoted to}} fibre optics, is {{primarily}} concerned with the utilization of fibre Bragg gratings and optical couplers to realize optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs). A comparative study regarding various OADM configurations is undertaken {{on the basis of}} manufacturing and the performance in terms of insertion loss, <b>channel</b> <b>isolation,</b> tuning ranges, stability and cost. The heart of most of the OADMs is fibre Bragg gratings. The Runge-Kutta numerical integration method is used to solve the coupled-mode equations in order to simulate the spectral dependence of Bragg gratings numerically. Properties such as the grating strength, the grating length and the grating index profile governing the spectral dependence of Bragg gratings are investigated. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the dispersive properties of Bragg gratings. We investigate methods to limit the amount of dispersion induced by fibre Bragg gratings. The tuning of Bragg gratings for dynamic OADMs is also reviewed. High <b>channel</b> <b>isolation</b> Bragg gratings are theoretically and experimentally investigated. DC-apodized gratings were designed and manufactured by using the phase mask method {{through the use of a}} preconditioning technique. Bragg gratings with channel isolations of up to 24. 61 dB have been realized by using this technique. The spectral dependence of DC-apodized gratings on the amount of preconditioning and the smoothness of the index envelope is simulated and in agreement with the experimental results. An athermal Bragg grating was designed and manufactured, exhibiting an average wavelength-temperature sensitivity of 2. 76 pm/oC.
