25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a <b>chordwise</b> direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

50|$|Adolf Busemann {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the swept wing and presented this 1935 at the 5. Volta-Congress in Rome. Sweep theory in general was a subject of development and investigation throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but the breakthrough mathematical definition of sweep theory is generally credited to NACA's Robert T. Jones in 1945. Sweep theory builds on other wing lift theories. Lifting line theory describes lift generated by a straight wing (a wing in which the leading edge is perpendicular to the airflow). Weissinger theory describes the distribution of lift for a swept wing, but does not have the capability to include <b>chordwise</b> pressure distribution. There are other methods that do describe <b>chordwise</b> distributions, but they have other limitations. Jones' sweep theory provides a simple, comprehensive analysis of swept wing performance.|$|E
50|$|The Gurney flap {{increases}} lift {{by altering}} the Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The wake behind the flap {{is a pair}} of counter-rotating vortices that are alternately shed in a von Kármán vortex street.In addition to these spanwise vortices shed behind the flap, <b>chordwise</b> vortices shed from in front of the flap become important at high angles of attack.|$|E
50|$|Early {{aircraft}} designers {{appreciated that}} whilst low take-off speeds required wings with high lift, high camber sections, more symmetric, low camber sections produced less drag at speed. One {{solution was to}} make a wing sufficiently flexible <b>chordwise</b> that the section could be altered in flight. This was the approach taken by Adolphe Lachassagne; his AL 3 was the first French monoplane with such a wing.|$|E

50|$|Its {{straight}} tapered, high {{cantilever wing}} has forward sweep on the trailing edge alone. It {{is built around}} a single spar with a D-shaped torsion box formed by the corrugated leading section, the ridges running <b>chordwise.</b> The wing is fabric covered aft of the spar, apart from an outer, metal skinned area carrying Frise ailerons. The all moving V-tail, with 90° separation and fitted with anti-balance tabs, has similar construction and plan as the wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfoil section}} was a {{modified}} bi-convex type with the maximum thickness at 4% of the chord. This section {{was chosen as}} being representative of the type likely to be adopted for a supersonic transport. It had a favourable <b>chordwise</b> distribution of cross-sectional area and hence a low wave drag in supersonic flight. A unique plywood leading edge was employed wherein new sections of different degrees of camber could be substituted, although in practice this feature was never used.|$|E

5000|$|To produce lift, air {{below the}} wing is {{at a higher}} {{pressure}} than the air pressure above the wing. On a wing of finite span, this pressure difference causes air to flow from the lower surface wing root, around the wingtip, towards the upper surface wing root. This spanwise flow of air combines with <b>chordwise</b> flowing air, causing a change in speed and direction, which twists the airflow and produces vortices along the wing trailing edge. The vortices created are unstable, and they quickly combine to produce wingtip vortices. [...] The resulting vortices change the speed {{and direction of the}} airflow behind the trailing edge, deflecting it downwards, and thus inducing downwash behind the wing.|$|E

50|$|The LFU 205 {{is a single}}-engined, low-winged {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} appearance apart from slight, 7° forward sweep on the moderately tapered wing. This carries Fowler flaps along the whole trailing edge inboard of the Frise ailerons. The tail surfaces are also straight tapered, with the vertical surfaces slightly swept. The tailplane is a single piece, all moving surface. There are two pairs of side by side seats under a large curved, rearward sliding, canopy. Fuselage and flying surfaces are monocoque structures using a grp sandwich with a smooth outer surface bonded to a corrugated inner skin, the latter formed from parallel 10 mm (0.4 in) tubes wrapped in glass fibre. The corrugations run <b>chordwise,</b> rib-like, in the wings and tail and circumferentially in the fuselage. The tail structures have a foam plastic core.|$|E

5000|$|Warren truss {{construction}} {{has also been}} used in airframe construction for aircraft since the 1920s, mostly for smaller aircraft fuselages, using chrome molybdenum alloy steel tubing, with popular aircraft such as the Piper J-3 Cub. Two of the earliest uses for the Warren truss in aircraft design was for both the 1914-era, Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.I biplane flying boat designed by Claudius Dornier, with four [...] "inverted-pyramid" [...] structures per side for its interplane struts, giving it Warren trusses running in both spanwise and <b>chordwise</b> directions—and by 1916-17, the interplane wing strut layout, as seen in a nose-on view, on the Italian World War I Ansaldo SVA series of fast reconnaissance biplanes, which were among the fastest aircraft of the First World War era. Warren truss construction is still used today for some homebuilt aircraft fuselage designs, that essentially use the same 1920s-era design philosophies in the 21st century.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{differences}} between the Veltro and the Strale were in the wing, even though these had a similar straight tapered plan and used the same laminar flow NACA airfoil sections. The Starle's wing was constructed, {{like that of the}} Veltro, around a forward main box spar and a lighter secondary spar aft but was in two rather than three parts. The outer span washout and the tip bodies were discarded. The span was increased by 1080 mm, which raised the aspect ratio from 18 to 19.3. [...] Each aileron of the Strale was shortened by 900 mm and plywood covered, and the combined flaps/airbrakes of the Veltro were discarded, replaced by spoilers. These were similar to those used on the CVT M-100S: mounted immediately behind the main spar at about one third span, each set consisted of five plates that rotated about <b>chordwise</b> axes out of the wing, each plate projecting both above and below. The two sets rotated in opposite directions and proved to be very effective.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} used welded strip-steel angle {{stock and}} I-beam sections {{along with some}} steel tubing to form its main internal structure, with 42 cm wide sheet steel panels wrapped around the fuselage to form its covering. The innovative cantilever structure for the wings were also covered in <b>chordwise</b> sheet steel panels. The wing root had a depth of about 75% of {{the height of the}} fuselage at the root's thickest point, and the wing had at least three airfoil changes, along with tapering of the leading and trailing edge angles between the wing's root and the wingtip. These changes in wing section would become a Junkers design hallmark on the later 1918 Junkers D.I. single-seat all-metal fighter design, which was covered with corrugated duralumin. The J 1 also relied on steel panels with span-wise corrugations running from root to tip as a structural element hidden under the smooth outer metal covering to increase the wing's strength. This particular design element of the J 1 was used on later all-metal aircraft, such as the wings of the American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber design of 1935.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was mounted at its centre on a <b>chordwise</b> circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed hinge rod, providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of telescopic, sprung struts from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, pilot operated ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|E
50|$|The Seafire F Mk III was {{the first}} true carrier {{adaptation}} of the Spitfire design. It was developed from the Seafire Mk IIC, but incorporated manually folding wings allowing more of these aircraft to be spotted on deck or in the hangars below. Supermarine devised a system of two straight <b>chordwise</b> folds; a break was introduced immediately outboard of the wheel-wells from which the wing hinged upwards and slightly angled towards the fuselage. A second hinge at each wingtip join allowed the tips to fold down (when the wings were folded the wingtips were folded outwards). This version used the more powerful Merlin 55 (F Mk III and FR Mk III) or Merlin 55M (L Mk III), driving the same four-bladed propeller unit used by the IIC series; the Merlin 55M was another version of the Merlin for maximum performance at low altitude. Other modifications that were made on the Spitfire {{made their way to}} the Seafire as well including a slim Aero-Vee air filter and six-stack ejector type exhausts. The shorter barrelled, lightweight Hispano Mk V cannon were introduced during production as were overload fuel tank fittings in the wings This Mark was built in larger numbers than any other Seafire variant; of the 1,220 manufactured Westland built 870 and Cunliffe Owen 350. In 1947 12 Mk IIIs were stripped of their naval equipment by Supermarine and delivered to the Irish Air Corps.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 Handley Page and his {{aerodynamicist}} R.O. Bothwell started wind-tunnel experiments {{intended to}} combine the low drag of high aspect ratio wings with the delayed stall at high angles of attack of a low aspect ratio wing. The first attempts involved using a wing divided into separate square panels by slots running <b>chordwise,</b> but this produced no significant result. The idea of a wing divided into two sections by a narrow spanwise slot was then tried, and the first experiment, using a slot at 25% chord in a RAF 15 section wing gave an increase in lift of 25%. The shape and position of the slots {{was found to be}} critical, and a series of wind-tunnel test were made during 1918-19 under conditions of great secrecy, since Handley Page realised the commercial value of the idea and consequently wanted it kept secret until it could be patented. He delayed doing this until he was able to file a patent for a controllable device in which the slot could be opened and closed by the pilot. This was granted on 24 October 1919. The principle had been independently arrived at by Gustav Lachmann, a German pilot and engineer: Lachmann attempted to patent the idea a few weeks before Handley Page, but his patent application was initially refused. When his patent was retroactively granted, he contacted Handley Page but rather than getting involved in a legal dispute the two men arrived at a mutually satisfactory arrangement, with the patents being shared and Lachmann accepting a post as a consultant for Handley Page. He was later to become the company's head of design and later director of research.|$|E
5000|$|The Tu-144 {{prototype}} was {{a full-scale}} demonstrator aircraft {{with the very}} different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and <b>chordwise</b> camber. They also added two small retractable surfaces called Moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted LE slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315 - 333 km/h, still faster than that of Concorde. The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315 - 335 km/h. An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 km/h, as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 km/h, based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies. It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL [...] "final approach speed... {{on the order of}} 360 km/h depending on fuel weight." [...] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 - 296 km/h. The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance - a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.|$|E
