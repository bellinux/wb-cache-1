5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the {{official}} exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate {{was used by the}} government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting to buy or sell foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E
25|$|Ledley {{began the}} 2007–08 season in great form and earned several {{man of the}} match awards {{in the first four}} months and in October 2007 he signed a two-year {{extension}} to his current contract at Cardiff City. In December 2007, Wolverhampton Wanderers offered a reported £2.5 million, which <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to as much as £3.5 million with add-ons, to Cardiff City for Ledley. Cardiff City offered the deal to Ledley who turned the move down in order to stay with the Bluebirds. Premier League side Everton were also known to have taken an interest in him, reportedly considering making an offer of £3.5 million. At the time, Cardiff City valued him at a reported £5 million. Despite the speculation about his transfer Ledley himself stated that he was desperate to stay at Cardiff but concedes that he may have no choice should a high offer be made. Everton attempted a second move for Ledley {{at the end of the}} January transfer window, reportedly beating Wolves' previous £3m move, but the move was rejected by Cardiff. His form continued into February and early March before a hamstring injury forced him to miss several games, including Cardiff's 2–0 FA Cup quarter final victory over Middlesbrough. He returned to the side in time for the Semi Final against Barnsley where he scored the only goal to send Cardiff to their first Final since 1927, a goal which later earned him 'Player of the Round'. Cardiff went on to lose in the Final to Portsmouth. As well as his exploits in the FA Cup, the year was also Ledley's most prolific goalscoring year for the club as he finished joint top scorer with a total of 11 goals in all competitions.|$|E

500|$|According to Zee News, {{before its}} {{official}} release The Oath of the Vayuputras had about 350,000copies for pre-order, {{with an initial}} print-run of 500,000copies. On {{the first day of}} the release itself, the book sold the initial print-run breaking the record for the fastest selling book in India. This prompted Westland to pay Tripathi an advance amount of [...] for the next series that he would pen, even though Tripathi confessed that he did not have any idea regarding the subject that he would pursue for his next endeavor. Padmanabhan clarified that the advance included the book, audio and e-publishing rights for Tripathi's next series, and was only for the South-Asian region and [...] "It's the largest advance we've ever paid, and the largest Indian deal". Anuj Bahri, who was the first publisher for The Immortals of Meluha, said that the deal <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to US$4million once they acquire the film, foreign and translation rights for the books. As of June 2015 over 2.5 million copies of the Shiva Trilogy have been sold with gross retail sales of over , making it the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing.|$|E
500|$|Sales {{were very}} good, and Ziff-Davis was {{sufficiently}} impressed {{to move the}} magazine from a quarterly to a bimonthly schedule after only two issues, and to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest-size to match Fantastic. [...] Shortly afterwards the decision was taken to eliminate Fantastic Adventures: the March 1953 issue was the last, and the May–June 1953 issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue. [...] Payment started at two cents per word for all rights, but <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to ten cents at the editor's discretion; this put Fantastic in the second echelon of magazines, behind markets such as Astounding and Galaxy. The experiment with quality fiction did not last; circulation dropped, which led to budget cuts, and in turn {{the quality of the}} fiction fell. [...] Browne had wanted to separate Fantastic from Amazings pulp roots, but now found he had to print more science fiction (sf) and less fantasy in order to attract Amazings readers to its sister magazine. [...] Fantastics poor results were probably a consequence of the overloaded sf magazine market; far more magazines appeared in the early 1950s than the market was able to support. [...] Ziff-Davis sales staff were able to help sell Fantastic and Amazing along with the technical magazines that it published, and the availability of a national sales network, even though it was not focused solely on Fantastic, undoubtedly helped the magazine to survive.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E
