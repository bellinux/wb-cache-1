40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} some of the problems in making <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> reports.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} main {{findings}} of a research project carried out {{on behalf of the}} Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards Board. The purpose of the research is to inform standard setters about implementation issues that had been encountered in the not-for-profit (NFP) public sector when applying the control concept in AASB 127, <b>Consolidated</b> and Separate <b>Financial</b> Statements. The intention is to use the findings to inform proposed implementation guidance for AASB 10, <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Financial</b> Statements. <b>Data</b> were collected via a literature review and meetings with various NFP public sector constituents. Identified issues were either conceptual in nature (for example, who are the relevant users of NFP public sector general purpose financial statements and what are their needs?) or related to implementation concerns (for example, is the power exerted by one NFP public sector entity over another of an ‘ownership’ or a ‘regulatory’ form?). The findings give rise to several suggested actions that standard setters could take in providing useful guidance to NFP public sector constituents. Bryan Howieso...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Offer an {{alternative}} method to assess operational performance of companies in transport infrastructure {{of a region}} by making a comparison between transaction costs. The method {{is supposed to be}} a cross-functional and possibly applied to an analysis of economic entities of a different order (country, region, sector, companies) while evaluating “viscosity” / complexity of the outside and the inside. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes an analysis of various methodological approaches to assess a development level of the transport infrastructure in a region. Within the author's approach and for purposed of the research, an index of transaction capacity or the transactionalness index is proposed, which determines a level of transaction costs calculated against the cost of production and revenue. The approach is piloted using the region-wise <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>data</b> of companies involved in the Russian transport infrastructure for 2005 / 2013. Findings: The proposed alternative way to measure corporate operating efficiency has proved its academic consistency. A specific comparison between the transaction costs using the transactionalness index allows first to identify companies or regions/sectors, where there is excess complexity of economical communication in bargaining. Secondly, the index does not only point out indirectly to a degree of development in the institutional environment, but also the infrastructure (the transport one in the example given). Third, the transactionalness level may say of uncertainty and risks. As an addition to theoretical and methodological aspects of transaction costs, the authors justify an approach to their size estimation, as well as their differentiation dividing them into two groups: those of a natural type and a background type. In a course of their discussion, the authors have concluded that there are such transaction costs in place, which are standard in a manner of speaking. Originality/value: There is a discussion whether it is scientifically reasonable to use an index of transactionalness. There are reasons for applicability of the alternative approach to assess operational performance of companies in transport infrastructure as an indicative criterion of favouring external conditions to execute exchange transactions. According to the authors, a high level of transactionalness is associated with a low development level of transport infrastructure in a region. This says that their competitiveness is specifically less. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the recent}} EU Regulation {{introducing}} the mandatory adoption of IFRS in Europe, {{this study examines}} accounting quality in Italy from 2002 to 2007. An empirical analysis is carried out by using <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statement <b>data</b> and stock prices information from a sample of 552 firm-year observations concerning a cohort of 92 Italian non-financial companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange. Accounting quality is investigated by focusing on three dimensions, namely: a) earnings management, expressed as both earnings smoothing and managing earnings towards a target; b) timely loss recognition; c) value relevance. Each dimension is evaluated by using appropriate metrics introduced in previous literature. Relevant changes in the measurements deriving from these metrics, evaluated by contrasting results obtained for firms operating in the pre-adoption period (i. e., from 2002 to 2004) with those of firms operating in the post-adoption one (i. e., from 2005 to 2007), are interpreted as changes of accounting quality in Italy. Research findings are mixed.
