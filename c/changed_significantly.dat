5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road {{was removed from the}} highway system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981–82, but it was not part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> since.|$|E

The road that became MS 454 was constructed in 1940 and opened the next year. MS 454 was designated in 1953, and has not <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> since.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{extensively}} redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included {{the construction of}} large tower block estates, such as Castle Vale.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Chopra, the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series, the original cast—which <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> as the series progressed—included Jake McLaughlin, Yasmine Al Massri, Johanna Braddy, Tate Ellington, and Graham Rogers as her fellow recruits and Josh Hopkins and Aunjanue Ellis as their trainers at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The series' first season was primarily produced in Montreal, with downtown Montreal and Sherbrooke standing in for New York and Quantico; production moved to New York {{during the second}} season.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state map in 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it was not included in the most recent reiteration of the route.|$|E

It was Welensky's first experience in international politics. In {{the aftermath of the}} Suez debacle British colonial policy <b>changed</b> <b>significantly,</b> which would have adverse effects for the federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E

This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including {{a stint in the}} Peace Corps.|$|E

From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours <b>changed</b> <b>significantly,</b> with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours. However, with the main line station's opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> according to analysis of the strontium–niobium–palladium elemental ratios. The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years, with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period, followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment of the chain, totaling 85 million years.

5|$|The {{main area}} of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic {{minorities}} in Somalia {{has historically been}} in village enclaves in the south, particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys {{as well as the}} Bakool and Bay regions. Beginning in the 1970s, more Bantus began moving to urban centres such as Mogadishu and Kismayo. The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities migrating to urban areas. As a consequence of these movements, Mogadishu's traditional demographic makeup <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> over the years.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had <b>changed</b> <b>significantly,</b> from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E

The area had <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had <b>changed</b> <b>significantly</b> since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from {{deposits}} located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
