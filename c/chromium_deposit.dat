A side-effect of this is increased tool wear and thus higher costs in terms of exchanged tools and down-time.

40|$|Chromium {{electrodeposition}} is nowadays {{considered as}} one of the most imporomt electrodeposition processes. Chrome deposits are used both for decorative and for functional applications. A thin, hlue-tinged chrome deposit is normally applied on nickel undercoats in the decorative nickel-chromium finish. Such nickel-chromium decorative finishes are applied on a number of decorative articles like cycle components, automobile components, household articles, office furnitures, etc. In industry a thick <b>chromium</b> <b>deposit</b> is used as hard chromium and is used to coat on a numher of components which are resistant to wear and tear. The high hardness of chromium resists wear and tear and improves the service life of the components. Such an industrially important chromium is normally deposited from conventional chrome hath consisting of 250 g/l chromic acid and 2. 5 g/l sulphuric acid and operated at 323 K and at a current density of 15. 5 and 46. 5 A/dm 2 â€¢ Chromium is deposited from hexavalent chromium using insoluble anodes. However, during the normal working of the bath, there is a gradual increase in Cr 3 + concentration in the hath due to the incomplete oxidation of Cr 3 + and Cr 6 + at the anode. Buildup of Iron(III) in chrome bath occurs in a number of ways. They are a) carry over from previous operations due to poor washing of the components d) dissolution of substrate when jobs are allowed to be in chrome bath without current, c) due to anudic etching from the plating bath itself and d) etching of fallen articles remaining in the hath. Thus the entry of Cr 3 + and Fe 3 + are inevitahle in the chromium bath. In order to study tbe effect of iron and trivalent chromium in the production of chrome deposit the study was undertaken and the results on the nature of the deposit, current efficiency, rate of build up, hardness and porosity are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was concerned with}} the effects of pulsed current on the electrodeposition of chromium and copper. In the case of the latter metal, a novel application has been studied and a theory proposed for the ability to improve throwing power by the joint use of organic additives and pulsed reverse current. During the course of the research, several improvements were made to the pulse plating unit. Chromium. A study was made of the effect of square wave pulsed current on various physical properties of deposits from three hard chromium plating electrolytes. The effect of varying frequency at a duty cycle of 50 % on the mean bulk internal stress, visual appearance, hardness, crack characteristics and surface topography of the electrodeposits was determined. X-ray diffraction techniques were used to study the phases present in the deposits. The effect of varying frequency on the cathodic efficiencies of the electrolytes was also determined. It was found that pulsed current reduced the internal stress of deposits from the sulphate catalysed electrolyte. It also reduced or eliminated cracking of deposits and reduced deposit brightness. Under certain conditions, pulsed current was found to induce the co-deposition of hydrides of <b>chromium.</b> <b>Deposit</b> hardness was found to be reduced by the use of pulsed current. Cathodic efficiencies of the high efficiency electrolytes were reduced by use of pulsed current although this effect was minimised at high frequencies. The sulphate catalysed electrolyte showed an increase in efficiency over the frequency range where hydrides were co-deposited. Copper. The polarisation behaviour of acid copper solutions containing polyethers, sulphopropyl sulphides and chloride ions was studied using both direct and pulse reverse current. The effect of these additives on the rest potentials of copper deposits immersed in the electrolyte was also studied. Hole Throwing Power on printed circuit boards was determined using a specially designed test cell. The effect of pulsed reverse current on the hole throwing power of commercially produced printed circuit boards was also studied. Polyethers were found to have an inhibiting effect on the deposition of copper whereas the sulphopropyl sulphides produced a stimulating (i. e. depolarising) effect. Studies of rest potentials made when both additives were present indicated that the sulphopropyl sulphide was preferentially adsorbed. The use of pulsed reverse current in solutions containing both polyether and sulphopropyl sulphide was found to cause desorption of the sulphopropyl sulphide at the cathode surface. Thus, at higher current densities, the inhibiting effect of the polyether produced an increase in the cathodic polarisation potential. At lower current densities, the depolarisation effect of the sulphopropyl sulphide could still occur. On printed circuit boards, this effect was found to produce an increase in the `hole throwing power' due to depolarisation of the holes relative {{to the surface of the}} boards. Typically, using direct current, hole/surface thickness ratios of 40 % were obtained when plating 0. 6 mm holes in a 3. 2 mm thick board at a current density of 3 A/dm 2 whereas using pulsed reverse current, ratios of 80 % could be obtained at an equivalent rate of deposition. This was observed both in laboratory tests and on commercially plated boards...|$|E
40|$|Several {{electrochemical}} deposition parameters affect grain orientations, which in turn, affect coating quality and coating performance. An enhanced x-ray pole figure technique {{has been applied}} to study grain distribution anisotropy in electrolytic high contraction and low contraction chromium.

Production high contraction (HC) <b>chromium</b> <b>deposited</b> on steel at low temperature and low current density exhibited strong 4 1 l> fiber texture, while low contraction (LC) <b>chromium</b> <b>deposited</b> on steel at high temperature and high current density exhibited near random crystalline orientation. The drastic transition of grain orientation from strongly textured HC chromium to randomly orientated LC chromium on steel is accompanied by marked differences in crack density, hardness, deposition rate, microstructure, thermal behavior upon heating and cooling, and improved wear and erosion performance.

40|$|Chemical {{fractionation}} {{is generally}} {{used to assess}} the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals present in solid environmental samples.

Attention was focused on the evaluation of the effect of drying and grinding of sediments. Fractionation was carried out according to the procedure of Tessier which makes it possible to divide total chromium content into five fractions of different mobility and bioavailability (ion-exchange, carbonate, oxide, organic and residual fractions). It has been found that sediment grinding is not an appropriate method of sample pretreatment, because it significantly changes fractionation results and thus it can lead to an incorrect assessment of mobility and bioavailability of <b>chromium</b> <b>deposited</b> in river sediments.
