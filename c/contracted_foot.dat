40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to observe the anatomical structure of horse hooves collected from the Laboratory of Anatomy FKH IPB. Twenty five hoof specimens, consisting of ten fore hooves and fifteen hind hooves were used as research materials. The external morphology such as color, angle, structure and condition of the hoof wall were described. The observation on external morphology showed that the hooves have two basic colors, black and white. Generally, all of the hoof specimens showed abnormalities in such aspect as angle, structure and condition of the wall. The structures of fore hoof and hind hoof from this study are classified into 8 categories, they are: flat foot, flared foot, knol hoef, fever rings, sand crack, club foot, <b>contracted</b> <b>foot</b> and bull nosed foot. </div...|$|E
40|$|Transgene of MIF induces podocyte {{injury and}} {{progressive}} mesangial sclerosis in the mouse kidney. BackgroundRecent {{evidence suggests that}} macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pathogenic role in glomerulonephritis. Renal expression of MIF is up-regulated in infiltrating and intrinsic renal cells, which include glomerular epithelial cells. The aim {{of the current study}} was to further clarify the role of MIF produced by podocytes in the process of renal disease. MethodsWe generated transgenic mice carrying a murine MIF cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus enhancer and β-actin/β-globin promoter, a hybrid promoter transactivated in podocytes in vivo. ResultsMIF expression was markedly up-regulated in podocytes in neonatal and adult transgenic kidneys. A longitudinal study of the MIF transgenic mice demonstrated a progressive matrix increase in mesangium accompanied by collagen IV accumulation, representing no significant glomerular cell hypercellularity. The glomeruli in transgenic kidney were not accompanied by influx of macrophages and T cells at the early stage of disease progression. Although a significant number of the mice showing higher expression of MIF died from renal failure at 8 weeks, most of them survived with significant proteinuria and progressive renal failure. Podocytes of transgenic mice frequently underwent characteristic ultrastructural changes, such as cell flattening, <b>contracted</b> <b>foot</b> processes, and villous transformation. In addition, immunohistochemical expression of synaptopodin, an actin-associated protein distributed in differentiated podocyte foot process, was significantly attenuated in transgenic kidney. ConclusionOur results indicate that podocyte-expressed MIF could induce an injury of podocytes themselves, thereby accelerating the progression of glomerulosclerosis and leading to end-stage renal failure...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Selective {{neurotomy}} {{is generally}} a safe, effective, and long-lasting treatment {{for patients with}} spastic equinovarus foot deformity. We retrospectively analyzed the results of microsurgical selective tibial neurotomy (STN) for spastic feet in adults and children. Methods: A neurosurgeon selected 32 patients with 45 spastic feet (adults: 13, children: 32) to undergo microsurgical STN between October 1998 and September 2007. A physician of rehabilitation assessed spasticity pre- and postoperatively, {{that was based on}} the Ashworth scale, ankle clonus, and the amplitude of ankle dorsiflexion. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 36. 7 months in adults and 42. 5 months in children. Results: Spastic components of the feet were corrected immediately after surgery in both the adult and child groups. The mean Ashworth’s grade changed from 3. 6 ± 0. 40 to 1. 6 ± 0. 70 in adults and from 3. 7 ± 0. 69 to 1. 4 ± 0. 49 in children. Mean ankle clonus decreased markedly, from 1. 6 ± 0. 79 to 0. 3 ± 0. 42 in adults and from 1. 7 ± 0. 65 to 0. 3 ± 0. 56 in children. The mean amplitude of ankle dorsiflexion was improved, but eight (adults: 4, children: 4) <b>contracted</b> <b>feet</b> needed complementary orthopedic correction for acceptable results. Conclusion: STN can be effective in the long-term for improving lower limb function and reduction of equinovarus deformity. Our results demonstrate that STN might be an effective procedure for treating localized harmful spastic feet in adults and children...|$|R
50|$|One way to <b>contract</b> athlete's <b>foot</b> {{is to get}} a fungal {{infection}} somewhere else on the body first. The fungi causing athlete's foot may spread from other areas of the body to the feet, usually by touching or scratching the affected area, thereby getting the fungus on the fingers, and then touching or scratching the feet. While the fungus remains the same, the name of the condition changes based on where on the body the infection is located. For example, the infection is known as tinea corporis ("ringworm") when the torso or limbs are affected or tinea cruris (jock itch or dhobi itch) when the groin is affected. Clothes (or shoes), body heat, and sweat can keep the skin warm and moist, just the environment the fungus needs to thrive.|$|R

6000|$|Even if {{no single}} fact {{had been known}} {{with respect to the}} {{inheritance}} of disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample {{in the case of the}} horse. And this might have been expected, as horses breed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising. Authors who have had wide experience give in detail many singular cases, and assert that <b>contracted</b> <b>feet,</b> with the numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French veterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing and ill-temper, are all plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying [...] "there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;" [...] and M. Bernard adds that the doctrine [...] "that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day." [...] (12/21. These various statements are taken from the following works and papers:--Youatt on 'The Horse' pages 35, 220. Lawrence 'The Horse' page 30. Karkeek in an excellent paper in 'Gard. Chronicle' 1853 page 92. Mr. Burke in 'Journal of R. Agricul. Soc. of England' volume 5 page 511. 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 279. Girou de Buzareingues 'Philosoph. Phys.' page 215.

50|$|A breach by anticipatory {{repudiation}} (or simply anticipatory breach) is an unequivocal {{indication that}} the party will not perform when performance is due, or {{a situation in which}} future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place) For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15 A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the <b>contract</b> continue on <b>foot,</b> but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|R

40|$|A {{basic problem}} in insect {{metamorphosis}} is {{the means by}} which insects change shape. This can be studied by examining the shape changes of individual epidermal cells. I have found that removal of the basal lamina from the epidermis allows the shape and basal surfaces of these cells to be seen by scanning electron microscopy. In the 5 th larval stage of Calpodes ethlius the cells extend basal processes or feet. Feet develop in three phases. Just after ecdysis they are short and randomly oriented. The cells are closely packed and their bases have punctate hemidesmosomes. The hemidesmosomes become elongated and axially oriented before commitment to pupation. The feet then also extend, and orient axially. The <b>feet</b> <b>contract</b> late in the stadium, disappearing as the cells move to their pupal positions. This cell rearrangement is facilitated by the formation of wide intercellular lymph spaces. Filopodia span and presumably aid closure of the spaces between the cells at pupation. The changes in the feet suggest that they are prime movers in epidermal morphogenesis.;The disposition of the cytoskeleton is related to the control of cell shape. For example, orientation of the feet may be controlled by selective stabilization of dynamically unstable microtubules. My work on epidermal cells suggests that cytoskeletal shape may also be influenced by somatic inheritance. The cells contain apical bundles of F-actin (shown using rhodaminyl phalloin labeling) which survive for about 36 hours after the 4 th- 5 th larval ecdysis and associate with a transverse cuticle component. The number of bundles is paired in adjacent cells which are presumed to be siblings. The maintenance of cytoplasmic continuity through midbodies connecting siblings may preserve the paired patterns. These patterns are a result of sibling similarity, either in ploidy or by the inheritance of transient determinants for bundle pattern and position.;I have found that the secretory cell of the dermal gland is another epidermal cell whose shape is partly determined by the arrangement of its microfilament skeleton. The cell is distended during the intermoult by accumulation of secretion in vacuoles encapsulated by F-actin. At ecdysis the microfilament capsules collapse while the secretion is discharged and the cell shrivels. The microfilaments form into storage bundles which are then redistributed into capsules. This cycle repeats in each stadium until the cell atrophies in the pupa...|$|R
