30|$|As can be observed, the inertia {{response}} obtained has small implications on the <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> of the insulated-gate {{bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) switches {{used in the}} VSC. The current through the devices has increased by less than 15  % for 1  s compared to their <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> for the operating condition used. Normally, semiconductor devices have a short-term over-current rating which is larger than their <b>continuous</b> <b>rating.</b> Since the inertia response lasts for a few seconds, nominal current-rated IGBTs will be capable of withstanding this short-term over-current without {{the need to be}} overrated. This implies that there is no increase in the cost of the devices.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of high voltage cables are sized {{and operated by}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> {{which is based on}} the worst-case assumptions. However, the load on the cables themselves may vary significantly depending upon the time and season. In this paper, a dynamic thermal model for a cable in air installation is built using the finite difference method. The real-time load current and ambient conditions are accessible to allow improved cable modelling. This model is then used to support the rating calculations, the accuracy of which is compared with results obtained from laboratory experiments. A prediction system has been developed to predict the rating from any point forward within the next 24 hours...|$|R
40|$|CD-ROM includedCableAmp, a Windows based {{software}} {{has been}} developed to calculate the cable ampacity of medium voltage power cables laid in free air or directly buried in the ground. The highly graphical user interface allows easy usage. The user inputs the required data of the cable design {{as well as the}} cable installation method. CableAmp then calculates the <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> (at 100 % load factor) of the power cables laid in free air or directly buried in the ground. It is applicable to extruded solid insulation, rated from 6 kV to 33 kV. An increased peak <b>current</b> <b>rating,</b> called the cyclic <b>current</b> <b>rating,</b> can also be obtained from the software package for a specified load profile. The calculation procedure is in accordance with International Standard IliC 287. The report presents the theory for the software, and also validates the results obtained b> the software by comparison with manufacturers current ratings for standard cables...|$|R
5000|$|Another way to {{mitigate}} arc flash {{is to use}} a triggered current limiter or commutating current limiter which inserts a low <b>rated</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> current limiting fuse that melts and interrupts the arc flash within 4 ms. The advantage of this device is that it eliminates the arc flash at the source and does not divert it to another section of the system. A triggered current limiter will always be [...] "Current Limiting" [...] which means it will interrupt the circuit before the first peak current occurs. These devices are electronically controlled and sensed and provide feedback to the user about their operational status. They can also be turned ON and OFF as desired. These devices must be replaced after an operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{current-carrying}} capacity (CCC), or ampacity, of highly-conductive, light, and strong carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers {{is characterized by}} measuring their failure current density (FCD) and <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> (CCR) values. It is shown, both experimentally and theoretically, that the CCC of these fibers {{is determined by the}} balance between current-induced Joule heating and heat exchange with the surroundings. The measured FCD values of the fibers range from 107 to 109 A m− 2 and are generally higher than the previously reported values for aligned buckypapers, carbon fibers, and CNT fibers. To the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} the CCR for a CNT fiber has been reported. The specific CCC value (i. e., normalized by the linear mass density) of these CNT fibers are demonstrated to be higher than those of copper...|$|R

50|$|The {{weak point}} of a gas engine {{compared}} to a diesel engine is the exhaust valves, since the gas engine exhaust gases are much hotter for a given output, and this limits the power output. Thus a diesel engine from a given manufacturer will usually have a higher maximum output than the same engine block size in the gas engine version. The diesel engine will generally have three different ratings - Standby, Prime, and <b>Continuous,</b> (UK, 1-hour <b>rating,</b> 12-hour <b>rating</b> and <b>continuous</b> <b>rating)</b> whereas the gas engine will generally only have a <b>Continuous</b> <b>rating,</b> which will be less than the Diesel <b>Continuous</b> <b>rating.</b>|$|R
