We conducted interviews with key-informants to evaluate their needs and identify the information requirements for the introduction of structured cost management approaches in a Farm Management Information System.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the issue on}} the labor <b>costs</b> <b>allocation</b> in a given company, organization. Each employee is given a rank and specific labor costs value corresponding to this rank and thus {{it is possible to}} determine dependence between labor costs and percentage of employees being assessed. Several mathematical methods are applied to determine dependence between labor costs and labor efficiency. By comparing allocation of labor costs of a particular company, organization to these mathematical models, it is easy to determine the degree of effectiveness and optimum allocation. ...|$|E

Using a revised <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> – referred to in this paper as environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> – the paper contrasts overhead <b>allocation</b> between traditional <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> and environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation.</b> In addition, production cost derived from the traditional <b>allocation</b> of waste <b>cost</b> is compared with the revised environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation.</b> Findings indicate that a revised environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> discloses more accurate overhead cost and hence production cost; and that management is motivated to make informed environmental management decisions if a product related environmental cost is made to reflect in the production cost of the polluting product. The paper highlights the practical significance of objective environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> on corporate waste management, which thus creates a valuable awareness {{on the part of}} the management and accountants of firms in developing countries for the need to fine-tune the dominant traditional costing system.

40|$|The {{debate on}} <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> in the {{management}} accounting literature {{has been dominated by}} a largely rationalistic perspective primarily informed by economic theories. However, there is growing evidence of institutional factors influencing <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices in organizations. This paper draws on neo-institutional sociology (NIS) and attempts to integrate prior research evidence of the institutional influence on <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices into an analytical framework. The core of our argument hinges on the observation that most <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> generate some degree of ambiguity. We argue that the implementation of various <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques (in terms of their coupling to operating control) reflects differences in management of such ambiguity, but that this is conditioned by the patterns in which <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques diffuse across organizations. We also address some pertinent criticisms of the NIS literature by discussing how certain intra-organizational factors and aspects of the organization's technical environment might interact with external institutional pressures in the implementation of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques. We advance six research propositions reflecting how such external institutional pressures and interaction effects influence the coupling of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices to operating control. ...|$|R

The cooperative game framework allows us to examine how the institutional and market factors influence bargaining powers of plaintiff and defendant under different rules of legal cost allocation, free from assumptions on information and sequence of moves. The American rule renders the patentee more bargaining power when the legal system favors the defendant. An increase in damage reward raises bargaining power of the plaintiff and the settlement rate. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy {{has become}} {{accepted}} {{as one of}} the most effective methods of screening patients for colorectat cancer, and is used to remove the majority of colonic adenomas. OBJECTIVE: Because of the paucity of such estimates in the literature and the significant number of candidates for this procedure, the present study was performed to estimate the direct hospital costs of both diagnostic and therapeutic (potypectomy) colonoscopy. METHODS: A microcosting methodology was used to itemize the costs of colonoscopy. Variable and fixed costs were divided into tabour, supplies, equipment and overhead costs. A. third-party payer perspective was adopted. All costs are expressed in 2007 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: The cost of a diagnostic colonoscopy was $ 157 and the cost of a therapeutic colonoscopy was $ 199. Overhead costs represented approximately 30 % of these amounts. When physician fees were added, these costs rose to $ 352 and $ 467, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because the overhead costs represent a large proportion of the total <b>costs,</b> <b>allocation</b> methods for these costs should be improved to allow for a more precise determination of the total costs of a colonoscopy. These estimates are useful when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of a strategy that uses colonoscopy when screening for colorectal cancer...|$|E

We show that known <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes are not sufficient.

This improves previous result where a 2 -approximate multicast flow is enforced. For capacitied networks, computing <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> by ignoring edge capacities will not yield correct results. We show that an edge tax scheme can be combined with a <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> to strictly enforce optimal multicast flows in this more realistic case. If taxes are not desirable, they can be returned to flows while maintaining weak enforcement of the optimal flow.

40|$|Purpose of this paper: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze and assess the {{consequences}} of applying a collaborative approach when managing material flows in a two-echelon decentralized inventory replenishment system. The analysis and assessment specifically concerns the influence of considering common order-to-deliver process <b>costs,</b> <b>allocation</b> of safety stocks between suppliers and customers and advance demand information from customers. Design/methodology/approach: Traditional inventory control methods have been enhanced and applied in a way allowing them to be used to optimize material flow efficiency from a common supplier and customer perspective. Based on these methods an analysis and assessment of consequences of using a collaborative approach to inventory control has been carried out by simulation. Findings: The result from the simulation shows that traditionally used company focused inventory control solutions are inferior to collaborative-based solutions where the effects on the customer’s as well as the supplier’s operations are considered. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) : The study is limited to dyadic relationships in supply chains. Practical implications (if applicable) : The paper provides information about possible benefits of developing and using joint optimized inventory control solutions between customers and suppliers. It also provides information about asymmetric benefits for the supplier and the customer.

In parallel, such enterprises or value added services needing mobile messaging in bulk - for spot use or for use over a prescribed period of time - want to minimize total acquisition costs, from a set of technically approved providers of messaging capacity. This leads naturally to the evaluation of auctioning for bulk SMS or MMS messaging capacity, with the intrinsic advantages therein such as reduction in acquisition <b>costs,</b> <b>allocation</b> efficiency, and optimality. The paper shows, with extensive results as evidence from simulations carried out in the Rotterdam School of Management e-Auction room, how multi-attribute reverse auctions perform for the enterprise-buyer, {{as well as for the}} messaging capacity-sellers. We compare 1 - and 5 -round auctions, to show the learning effect and the benefits thereof to the various parties. The sensitivity will be reported to changes in the enterprise's and the capacity providers utilities and priorities between message attributes (such as price, size, security, and delivery delay).

The sources of such improvement stem from the employees’ sense of urgency to improve efficiency reduce slacks in work processes, re-engineering work processes and finally distancing service provision from funding side through an internal purchaser-provider split. The study also reveals that excessive or unfair common <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> used in conjunction with strategic <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> does not change the status quo of the services provided by the monopoly segments.
