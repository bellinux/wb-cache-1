Carrots that survive overwinter {{are the source}} of inoculum for the first flush of spring aphids. The aphid transfers the virus as it feeds from host to host. Both CMoV and CRLV are typically found in infected stock and rarely found alone. It takes 30 minutes for the aphid to become a carrier. The aphid is propagative and therefore infects many plants in its lifetime. The virus is kept through the aphid molting, but does not replicate in the vector. Aphids do not feed on cilantro which means although susceptible not likely to be infected.|$|E
