25|$|In 1880 Ignatius L.

This produced a plethora of late 19th-century Baconian theorising, which developed the theme that Bacon had hidden encoded messages in the plays.|$|E

Cox indicated that each new track was worthy of being a single; one music critic characterized the EP as being less [...] "dreamy" [...] than <b>Cryptograms.</b> When <b>Cryptograms</b> was released on vinyl as a double album, the Fluorescent Grey tracks took up the fourth side.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike <b>Cryptograms,</b> Fluorescent Grey {{does not}} contain any ambient tracks. Lead singer Bradford Cox {{considers}} the EP's four tracks to be [...] "four singles; they're all four good. They could stand on their own." [...] The songs were recorded while <b>Cryptograms</b> was being mixed; their sound {{has been described as}} [...] "tightly song-focused, not as drifting or dreamy" [...] as <b>Cryptograms.</b> [...] Cox had considered including these tracks on the next Deerhunter record instead of releasing them on their own. However, he wanted the band's next album to be [...] "something totally different" [...] from <b>Cryptograms</b> and Fluorescent Grey.|$|R

25|$|The use of letter {{frequencies}} and frequency analysis plays {{a fundamental role in}} cryptograms and several word puzzle games, including Hangman, Scrabble {{and the television}} game show Wheel of Fortune. One of the earliest descriptions in classical literature of applying the knowledge of English letter frequency to solving a <b>cryptogram</b> is found in E.A. Poe's famous story The Gold-Bug, where the method is successfully applied to decipher a message instructing on the whereabouts of a treasure hidden by Captain Kidd.|$|E
25|$|Ciphertexts {{produced}} by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see <b>cryptogram).</b> Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, German-language operetta lost its popularity. After that, Hood supplied lyrics for individual numbers for some musicals, and a revue, Bric-a-Brac with Lionel Monckton and Arthur Wimperis, and some non-musical plays. In {{the early days of}} the war, he took up a post with the Cryptography Division of the War Office. Despite the heavy demands of his wartime work, he wrote a patriotic light opera, Young England, with music by G. H. Clutsam and Hubert Bath, starring Walter Passmore, which ran at Daly's Theatre and then the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1916–17 before going on tour. In his final years, Hood developed an obsession with Shakespeare's Hamlet, which he believed contained a <b>cryptogram</b> that he worked to decipher. His companion of later years was Doris Armine Ashworth; she died about 1958.|$|E

She portrayed Claire, a paralysed woman who wants to die, in the West End drama revival of Whose Life Is It Anyway?. In October 2006, {{she appeared}} in a West End production of David Mamet's The <b>Cryptogram</b> at the Donmar Warehouse in London.

In July 2006, a commercial for Nissan cars, which featured Cattrall as Samantha Jones, was withdrawn from New Zealand television, apparently because of complaints about its innuendo. In 2006, she starred alongside Brendan Gleeson in John Boorman's 2006 film The Tiger's Tail, a black comedy that focuses on the impact of the Celtic Tiger economy on Irish people. On ITV, she starred alongside David Haig, Daniel Radcliffe and Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, the story of author Rudyard Kipling's search for his son lost in the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Carnaval, Op. 9 (1834) {{is one of}} Schumann's most {{characteristic}} piano works. Schumann begins {{nearly every}} section of Carnaval with a musical <b>cryptogram,</b> the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell Asch (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the Bohemian town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. The work comes to a close with a march of the Davidsbündler – the league of King David's men against the Philistines – in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a quotation from the seventeenth century Grandfather's Dance. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In Carnaval, Schumann went further than in Papillons, by conceiving the story {{as well as the}} musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).|$|E

500|$|Poe {{played a}} major role in popularizing cryptograms in {{newspapers}} and magazines in his time period and beyond. William F. Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, initially became interested in cryptography after reading [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] as a child—interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War II. [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] also includes the first use of the term cryptograph (as opposed to <b>cryptogram).</b>|$|E
500|$|Poe had a keen {{interest}} in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing" [...] in Graham's Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] incorporating ciphers as {{an essential part of the}} story. Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution <b>cryptogram)</b> as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution <b>cryptogram</b> can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.|$|E

He took advantage of the popularity of cryptography as [...] he was writing [...] "The Gold-Bug", and [...] the success of the story centers on one such <b>cryptogram.</b> [...] Modern critics have judged the characterization of Legrand's servant Jupiter as racist, especially because of his comical dialect speech.|$|E

500|$|Legrand {{explains}} {{that on the}} day he found the bug on the mainland coastline, Jupiter had picked up a scrap piece of parchment to wrap it up. Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a <b>cryptogram,</b> which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate [...] "Captain Kidd." [...] The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them.|$|E
