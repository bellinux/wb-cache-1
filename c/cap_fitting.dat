It was a <b>cap</b> <b>fitting</b> tight to the skull, only running across the crown {{of it was a}} stiff raised ridge, of leather perhaps, jagged and pointed something like the comb of a cock. This comb, of brilliant red, was surmounted at its highest point by a ball of black of {{the size of a small}} apple. The cap itself was yellow, except its lowest band, which stood out from it and was also black. In the centre of this band upon the forehead glowed a stone like a ruby.|$|E

The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I.

It is important to follow a strict maintenance program to minimize future deterioration. The management of moisture is important for preservation. One method {{that has been used}} to prevent absorption of water at the end grain of the wood is through the fabrication of a custom <b>fitting</b> <b>cap.</b> Caps can be made with copper sheeting or sheet lead.

He was a Japanese customs official. Had our stay been longer, I would have wept over him because he was a hybrid--partly French, partly German, and partly American--a tribute to civilisation.

50|$|The {{centrifuge}} is {{a hollow}} cylinder 6 {{inches in diameter}} and 13.5 inches long with both end caps in place. The cylinder is mounted perpendicular to the canister and supported by ball bearings housed in {{the upper and lower}} bulkheads. The rotational axis of the centrifuge is formed by shafts centrally located in the vertical plane at right angles to the cylinder, held in place by the ball bearings. Thin, shallow-domed end caps are bolted to each end of the centrifuge with intervening rubber gaskets to prevent leakage. In the center of each <b>cap</b> is a <b>fitting</b> which allows frog specimens to be fully instrumented and mounted directly to the end caps before insertion into the centrifuge, and immersion. The water serves as a cushion for the high accelerations and vibrations of launch and as a medium for gas exchange via the frogs' skin. The centrifuge is locked in position and not released until after the spacecraft orbit is fully stabilized. The motor which drives the centrifuge is mounted to the upper bulkhead. Signal amplifiers and an accelerometer are mounted on the centrifuge.|$|R

Mrs. Kearney panicked and her calls attracted her sister, Mrs. Ready, who was in the house at the time. Mrs. Ready also noticed the odor, and determined that it was coming {{from the direction of the}} bedroom window, which was open at the time. The police were contacted, but no evidence of a prowler was found. At around 12:30 am, [...] Bert Kearney, Mrs. Kearney's husband (a local taxi driver who had been absent during the time of the attack), returned home to find an unidentified man hiding close to one of the house's windows. The man fled and Kearney was unable to catch him. Kearney's description of the prowler was of a tall man dressed in dark clothing, wearing a tight <b>fitting</b> <b>cap.</b> This description was reported in the local media, and became the common description of the gasser throughout the Mattoon incident. After the attack, Mrs. Kearney reported suffering from a burning sensation on her lips and throat, which were attributed to the effects of the gas.|$|R

[...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "After six films, 13 years and 1031 minutes of accumulated running time, Peter Jackson has concluded his massively remunerative genuflection at the altar of J.R.R.

[...] Chris Tilly from IGN Movies said [...] "There's a little too much padding in the final Hobbit flick, and the best sequence is without doubt the film's first. But the central battle is indeed spectacular, and as 'The Age of Orc' approaches, it rounds out this particular story in stirring and emotional fashion." [...] Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald said The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is [...] "something less than the supposed 'defining chapter' of Jackson's time in Middle-earth as it's been billed.

60|$|The {{room where}} tea was now brought and put before her was volumed round by the {{collections}} of her grandfather, except for the spaces filled by his portrait and that of earlier ancestors, {{going back to the}} time when Copley made masterpieces of his fellow-Bostonians. Her aunt herself looked a family portrait of the middle period, a little anterior to her father's, but subsequent to her great-grandfather's. She had a comely face, with large, smooth cheeks and prominent eyes; the edges of her decorous brown wig were combed rather near their corners, and a <b>fitting</b> <b>cap</b> palliated but did not deny the wig. She had the quiet but rather dull look of people slightly deaf, and she had perhaps been stupefied by a life of unalloyed prosperity and propriety. She had grown an old maid naturally, but not involuntarily, and she was without the sadness or the harshness of disappointment. She had never known much of the world, though she had always lived in it. She knew that it was made up of two kinds of people--people who were like her and people who were not like her; and she had lived solely in the society of people who were like her, and in the shelter of their opinions and ideals. She did not contemn or exclude the people who were unlike her, but she had never had any more contact with them than she now had with the weather of the streets, as she sat, filling her large arm-chair full of her ladylike correctness, in the library of the handsome house her father had left her. The irruption of her brother's son and daughter into its cloistered quiet had scarcely broken its invulnerable order. It was right and fit they should be there after his death, and it was not strange that in the course of time they should both show certain unregulated tendencies which, since they were not known to be Lynde tendencies, must have been derived from the Southwestern woman her brother had married during his social and financial periclitations in a region wholly inconceivable to her. Their mother was dead, too, and their aunt's life closed about them with full acceptance, if not complacence, as part of her world. They had grown to manhood and womanhood without materially discomposing her faith in the old-fashioned Unitarian deity, whose service she had always attended.|$|R
