50|$|The {{granting}} of legal aid {{by the court}} requires that the applicant proves that the claimant is (a) economically not able to bear {{the costs of the}} procedures, and (b) that his lawsuit has reasonable prospects of success, and (c) that the cause of action is not frivolous. The application for legal aid is typically lodged together with the draft of the complaint with the bench of the competent court. This has the advantage for the legal aid applicant that he is provisionally relieved of the payment of the court costs while the bench not only reviews his economic status but also determines the merits of the case, i.e. as to whether the lawsuit appears to have reasonable prospect of success, based merely on the facts and arguments as presented in the draft complaint. Thus, a summary review of the cause of action is carried out by the court. Only if all conditions are met and legal aid thus granted will the court communicate the complaint to the other party and the judicial dispute thereby commences with the costs borne by the court. However, the legal aid seeking litigant can also lodge effectively the complaint together with auxiliary legal aid request but without making the pendency of the <b>case</b> <b>dependent</b> on the court granting legal aid; or the litigant requests legal aid support at a later stage but before completion of case procedures. In the latter scenarios, if legal aid is rejected by the court the litigant, who sought legal aid, will bear the counsel and court fees if he loses the lawsuit (or bears the costs partially if he loses partially). Defence cases are treated equivalently.|$|E

This is due to non-availability of observed sufficient soil moisture locations within the selected limiting distance.

It can thus be concluded that for the effective application of moving average method, several experimental trials on limiting distance and weight exponent may therefore be necessary to obtain the optimal limiting distance and the weight exponent, which may also be <b>case</b> <b>dependent.</b>|$|E
