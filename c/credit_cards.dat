40|$|Abstract. Theft of stored <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> {{information}} {{is an increasing}} threat to e-commerce. We propose a dynamic virtual <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number scheme that reduces {{the damage caused by}} stolen <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers. A user can use an existing <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> account to generate multiple virtual <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers that are either usable for a single transaction or are tied with a particular merchant. We call the scheme dynamic because the virtual <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers can be generated without online contact with the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuers. These numbers can be processed without changing any of the infrastructure currently in place; the only changes will be at the end points, namely, the card users and the card issuers. We analyze the security requirements for dynamic virtual <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers, discuss the design space, propose a scheme using HMAC, and prove its security under the assumption that HMAC is a PRF.

40|$|Traditional <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> {{payment is}} not secure against <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> frauds because an {{attacker}} can easily know a semisecret <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number that is repetitively used. Recently one-time transaction number {{has been proposed}} by some researchers and <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> companies to enhance the security in <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> payment. Following this idea, we present a practical security enhancement scheme for one-time <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> payment. In our scheme, a hash function is used in generation of one-time <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers with a secret only known to the card holder and issuer. Compared with related work, our scheme places less burden on <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuers, and can be easily deployed in on-line or off-line payment scenarios. Analysis and simulation show that the time and space complexity is affordable to the card issuer with desired security features. Ó 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This article uses a newly {{available}} {{database of}} consumer <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> agreements {{to take the}} first, in-depth empirical look at why <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuers use arbitration clauses. Based on a sample of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> agreements made available by 298 issuers under the <b>Credit</b> <b>Card</b> Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, it finds that while most <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> agreements include arbitration clauses, the substantial majority of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuers (247 of 298, or 82. 9 percent) do not use arbitration clauses in their <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> agreements. The article also finds that <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuers {{are more likely to}} use arbitration clauses when they (1) specialize in making <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> loans; (2) make riskier <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> loans; and (3) have a larger <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> portfolio. Conversely, issuers are less likely to use arbitration clauses when they are (1) mutually owned (i. e., credit unions) rather than shareholder owned (i. e., banks); and (2) are located in states in which class arbitration waivers are unenforceable. These empirical findings have potentially important implications for a number of timely policy questions, such as: What sorts of options are available to consumers who wish to obtain a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> that is not subject to an arbitration clause? How might increased regulation of arbitration (whether by Congress or by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) affect the market for <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> loans? and How are businesses likely to respond to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in AT 2 ̆ 6 T Mobility LLC v.

Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike.
