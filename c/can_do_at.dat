500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it would be unfair to the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) announces to The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) {{staff that}} Grizz Griswold (Grizz Chapman) {{will be getting}} married {{at the end of}} the month. A problem {{immediately}} ensues after Grizz cannot decide between Tracy and [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) to be his best man. Grizz then asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to help him convince Tracy that Dot Com should be his best man. The two suggest another task Tracy <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> the wedding, but Tracy insists on being the best man. Later, Liz learns that Dot Com is in love with Grizz's fiancée, Feyoncé, Grizz is not aware of this, and that the only reason Tracy wanted to be the best man was to protect Dot Com. Finally, after changing Grizz's mind about Dot Com as his best man, Grizz appoints Liz as his woman of honor at his wedding instead.|$|E

500|$|Jim is {{kicked out}} of the inner circle after {{pointing}} out what the women of the office had said, and an enthusiastic Andy (having previously denounced Deangelo after admitting that he was sexist) replaces him. Pam interrupts a mock basketball session the inner circle is having in the office in order to quiet it down, and an annoyed Deangelo reinvites Jim back into the circle. Jim instead challenges him to try a real dunk, which Deangelo claims he <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> the warehouse basketball hoop downstairs. Deangelo brings everyone down to the warehouse, including Dwight, who Deangelo finally loses his temper with and directly orders him downstairs or be fired. Deangelo then attempts to dunk from the free-throw line, only to severely injure himself by crashing down with the basketball stand on top of him. He is quickly taken to the hospital, leaving Dunder Mifflin Scranton without a manager.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{was highly}} {{critical}} of Riley's performance, claiming he [...] "...decided the game, like we know he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> Old Trafford." [...] The Arsenal manager claimed that Rooney told his players that he felt no contact, but the referee {{made the decision to}} give Manchester United a penalty which he called the turning point of the match. Wenger used statistics to question Riley's impartiality – of the referee's last eight matches at Old Trafford, he awarded eight penalties to the home team. Wenger was not surprised at United's rough treatment of Reyes – [...] "That's what they always try against us when they're in a difficult situation" [...] and accused Van Nistelrooy of being a cheat in his post-match television interview. Vieira, like his manager, was disappointed in Riley's handling of the match, but sought positives: [...] "We're still eight points clear of United and two points clear of Chelsea. We're in a really good position and all the other teams would want to be in our position." ...|$|E
