5|$|The Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> was {{weakened}} by considerable conflict between its {{organizations in the}} two provinces it controlled, Alberta and British Columbia. It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups. However, it was better financed than the CCF, due to its popularity among business groups in the West.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek is {{situated}} in the Peace River South provincial electoral district and is represented by Mike Bernier of the British Columbia Liberal Party in the provincial assembly. Bernier served as mayor of Dawson Creek between 2008 and 2013. His predecessor, Blair Lekstrom, also served as mayor of Dawson Creek, between 1996 and 2001, before being elected as the MLA for the BC Liberals. Bernier became a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 provincial election with 46% support. Before Bernier and Lekstrom, Peace River South was represented by Dawson Creek resident Jack Weisgerber. Weisgerber was first elected in 1986 {{as a member of}} the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> and served as the province's Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and Minister of Native Affairs. While the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> lost power in 1991, Weisgerber was re-elected and served as interim party leader. He joined the Reform Party of British Columbia in 1994 and won re-election in 1996 as party leader, even though Dawson Creek polls put him in third place behind the BC Liberal Party and New Democratic Party candidates.|$|E
5|$|John Brownlee, who had {{previously}} been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee's reign as government leader was troubled by {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after he was accused of sexual acts with a minor in the Attorney General's office. This and another scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat {{at the hands of the}} new Social <b>Credit</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

25|$|The provincial social <b>credit</b> <b>parties</b> of Saskatchewan and Manitoba {{won some}} ridings in the 1950s and 1960s. However, {{they were unable}} to form a government.|$|R
5|$|Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, all the Commonwealth realms {{have been}} {{sovereign}} kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting {{solely on the}} advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills. They therefore are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta's lieutenant governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart's Social <b>Credit</b> <b>party.</b> Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers. The third, the Accurate News and Information Bill, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|Dosanjh ran as the British Columbia New Democratic Party {{candidate}} in the Vancouver South riding in the 1979 and 1983 provincial elections. He lost both times to the BC Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> candidates. He ran in the 1991 provincial election in the Vancouver-Kensington riding where he won as his party came to power. He would be re-elected in that same riding in the 1996 provincial election. He spent his first few years as a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. In 1993, he chaired the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills. He served two years as caucus chair for his party until April 10, 1995, when Premier Mike Harcourt dismissed Robin Blencoe from his cabinet and replaced him with Dosanjh as Minister of Government Services and Minister Responsible for Sports. A month later, in a small cabinet shuffle upon the resignation of Moe Sihota, Harcourt added Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism and Human Rights to Dosanjh's portfolio. In another cabinet shuffle, as Sihota was re-instated into the cabinet in August, Dosanjh's portfolio was changed to Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration and he was appointed Attorney General.|$|E

50|$|In its {{earliest}} years, the Social Credit League {{took the form}} of a populist protest movement. Like other Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties</b> in Canada, it eventually became as a party of conservatism while retaining an anti-establishment message. The party's leadership was consistently anti-socialist.|$|R

25|$|While the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>party</b> {{was founded}} {{to promote the}} social credit {{theories}} of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> had learned in the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party, {{and it became a}} vehicle for those who sought to keep the CCF out of power. However, as leader of the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> of Canada's second most powerful provincial branch, he spoke for the party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he spoke for the party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC's interests.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, 1969, the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> was re-elected in {{a general}} {{election}} for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector. However, BC Hydro reported its first loss, which {{was the beginning of the}} end for Bennett and the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

50|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 1940 {{election}} he became a perennial candidate running in almost every federal election under the Social Credit banner in various federal electoral districts in Alberta until 1963. He also served as chief campaign organizer for Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties</b> on the provincial level in various elections.|$|R
50|$|He {{was first}} elected at the Labelle riding in a 31 October 1960 {{by-election}} and served for the latter portion of the 24th Canadian Parliament.

25|$|The Canadian social credit {{movement}} was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party,</b> and the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> of Canada was strongest in Alberta during this period. In 1932, Baptist evangelist William Aberhart used his radio program to preach {{the values of}} social credit throughout the province. He added {{a heavy dose of}} fundamentalist Christianity to C. H. Douglas' monetary theories; as a result, the social credit movement in Canada has had a strong social conservative tint.|$|E

50|$|For decades, the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party's</b> Quebec wing, the Ralliement créditiste, {{attracted}} many Quebec nationalists as a {{party that}} could represent Quebec's interests in the Canadian House of Commons. When Créditistes were wiped off the electoral map in 1980 federal election, the political situation seemed favourable {{for the growth of}} the Parti nationaliste.|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the UFM's [...] "anti-party" [...] philosophy, Bracken favoured non-partisan government. In 1931, his Progressives formed an {{alliance}} with the Manitoba Liberal Party, and the two parties eventually merged into one. In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government that included the Conservative, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
5000|$|McLenaghen was {{returned}} by an increased {{majority in the}} 1936 provincial election, the first in which the Conservative Party was led by Errick Willis. Four years later, he helped to bring the Conservative Party into a governing alliance with the Liberal-Progressives, along with the smaller Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties.</b> All parties were given cabinet representation, and McLenaghen was appointed as Minister of Health and Public Welfare on November 4, 1942. [...] The coalition's leader was Premier John Bracken, leader of the Liberal-Progressive Party.|$|R
25|$|Alberta's Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> {{remained}} in power for 36 years until 1971. It was re-elected by popular vote {{no less than}} 9 times, achieving success by moving from left to the right.|$|E
25|$|The Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party</b> {{remained}} in power for 36 years until 1971. It was re-elected by popular vote nine times. Its continued success was simultaneous with its ideological move {{from left to}} the right.|$|E

50|$|The Social Credit {{campaign}} {{was organized by}} Orvis A. Kennedy and Peer Paynter, who had {{been responsible for the}} British Columbia Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party's</b> upset victory in that province's 1952 election. While they managed to nominate a large number of candidates in Manitoba, they were unable to repeat their success. The party did not have an official leader.|$|R
50|$|Thompson was {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} support the national party enjoyed from the provincial Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties</b> in Alberta and British Columbia, where they formed the governments and ran powerful political machines. As well, Manning was becoming concerned with the leftward trajectory of both the federal Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. He encouraged Thompson to try to bring about a merger of the federal Social Credit and Progressive Conservative parties.|$|R
50|$|Poulin {{was asked}} for his opinion on {{abortion}} during the 1989 provincial election. Perhaps unusually, {{in light of the}} Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party's</b> general social conservatism, he declined to give an opinion and said that the issue should be decided by women alone. In the same election, Poulin said that social credit monetarist policies could not be implemented in Canada at the provincial level; he promised to instead target unemployment if elected. He was seventy-two years old at the time.|$|R

50|$|The Reconstruction Party {{nominated}} 174 {{candidates in}} the 1935 federal election. It won more votes nationally than the other new parties. The Liberal vote was 2,076,394, the Conservatives 1,308,688, and that for the Reconstruction Party 389,708; while the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties</b> garnered 386,484 and 187,045 votes respectively. Many of the votes that the party won were taken away from the Conservative Party. In 48 ridings, the margin of victory for the Liberal candidate over the Conservative candidate was less {{than the number of}} votes received by the Reconstruction Party candidate.|$|R
50|$|Both of Alberta's {{opposition}} parties, the Liberal Party and the NDP, {{boycotted the}} election in demonstration of {{their opposition to the}} process. As a result, the only candidates to contest the election were representatives of the right-of-centre Alberta Progressive Conservatives, Alberta Alliance <b>Party</b> and Social <b>Credit</b> <b>parties,</b> and a number of independents. After much pressure from the Liberal and NDP camps (who did not want their supporters to feel compelled to vote for a right-of-centre candidate), polling officers were instructed to advise voters on election day {{that they did not have}} to vote in the Senate election.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 September 1963, Lucien Plourde, MP for Quebec West, {{declared}} {{his support for}} Caouette, bringing the Ralliement caucus to 13. The Thompson faction was now reduced to 11 MPs, one less than the minimum for a party to be a recognized group in the Commons, which meant that Caouette—and not Thompson—would receive an extra $4,000 per year in compensation (worth about $29,700 in 2011 dollars), and be given priority in speaking in the House. [...] As {{a measure of how}} much the party's dynamics had changed, seven of the Social <b>Credit</b> <b>Party's</b> 11 MPs were from Quebec.|$|R
