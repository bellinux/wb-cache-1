5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints</b> and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E

25|$|As {{shown in}} the {{timetable}} from 13 December 2008, <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints</b> meant that through London Bridge there were no northbound Thameslink trains in the morning peak between 07:24 and 09:09, and no southbound Thameslink trains in the evening peak between 16:43 and 18:27.

It will improve the flow not only of Thameslink services but also of all Southeastern commuter services from Kent into Charing Cross and Cannon Street.|$|E
25|$|The road {{project was}} {{proposed}} in 1999 by then Premier Jeff Kennett, but gained prominence {{when it became}} one of the chief recommendations of the 2008 East-West Link Needs Assessment report, which warned that steady growth in port freight and population growth was rapidly taking Melbourne roads to capacity. The report's author, Sir Rod Eddington, said an alternative river crossing was also imperative to lessen the city's dependence on the West Gate Bridge, while an additional east-west link was needed to the city's north because of <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints</b> on the congested Monash-CityLink-West Gate corridor. Eddington said the benefits for the city included relieving congestion on Hoddle Street, reducing east-west rat running through suburban streets, assisting north-south traffic flows including public transport, and improving accessibility to city jobs for western suburbs residents.|$|E

The country was one of thirty candidate countries and obtained candidate status on 22 February 2008. It was then required to meet a number of obligations to do so, including committing to working with civil society and companies on EITI implementation, appointing a senior individual to lead on EITI implementation, and publishing a fully costed Work Plan with measurable targets, a timetable for implementation and an assessment of <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints.</b> However, when Equatorial Guinea applied to extend the deadline for completing EITI validation, the EITI Board did not agree to the extension.|$|E
25|$|As older trains became {{obsolete}} in the 1970s, the Class 80 slam-door diesel-electric {{multiple unit}} was introduced. BREL built these units between 1974 and 1977 to British Rail's Mk 2B design with some trailer cars rebuilt from hauled stock. The power cars were powered by an English Electric 4SRKT engine, nicknamed 'Thumpers' {{due to their}} characteristic sound, and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. These entered service on the suburban lines around Belfast, becoming a stalwart on the whole network. They remained in service until 2012, latterly primarily on the Larne-Belfast line and the Coleraine-Portrush Line. In the early 1980s, NIR purchased one of the prototype LEV Railbuses built to test the railbus concept. This was intended for the Coleraine-Portrush branch, but was withdrawn due to the <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints</b> of a single car. A plan was mooted to use it on the Lisburn-Antrim line {{to prevent it from}} being closed. This proposal failed, again because of the limited capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Relief Line is to help reduce current and {{projected}} congestion in downtown Toronto. In 2012, it was becoming apparent to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and Metrolinx that even with proposed improvements, the Yonge line and Bloor–Yonge station was facing significant <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints.</b> , the Yonge line operates 11% over its capacity south of Line 2 during the morning rush hour. The new Toronto Rocket trains operating on the line, and the future implementation of Automatic Train Control will help increase {{the capacity of the}} Yonge line. Other factors are expected to reduce demand such as the extension of the University–Spadina portion of Line 1 into Vaughan, and other local transit improvements. However, after factoring in population and employment growth and the proposed extension of the Yonge line into Richmond Hill, the Yonge line is projected to be at 96% of its capacity by 2031. The Relief Line will provide an alternate route for commuters heading downtown by allowing them to bypass the congested Yonge line and avoid transferring at Bloor–Yonge Station.|$|E

In many cases airport capacity is already fully used in meeting current demand. At Heathrow and Gatwick airports the runways are full for [...] "… virtually the whole day".

Government forecasts that year predicted that by 2030 the number of passengers could rise to between 400million passengers per annum (mppa) and 600 mppa, representing a two to threefold increase, and a figure of 500 mppa by 2030 was regarded by the government as robust. In 2006 the government reported that at 228 mppa the demand for air travel the previous year was in line with the 2003 forecast, but also revised the forecast demand for 2030 downwards to 465 mppa as a result of <b>capacity</b> <b>constraints,</b> even taking into account proposed airport developments.|$|E
