As far as ballistic soap was concerned, the dimensions of the bolt's channel were assessed by multi-slice computed tomography before cutting the blocks open. The test shots to gelatin balls and to skull-brain models were documented by means of a high-speed motion camera.

40|$|Due to {{concerns}} about {{a link between}} variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and similar prion protein-induced disease in cattle, i. e., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), strict controls are in place to exclude BSE-positive animals and/or specified risk materials including bovine central nervous system (CNS) tissue from the human food chain. However, current slaughter practice, using <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>guns,</b> may induce disruption of brain tissues and mobilize CNS tissues into the bovine circulatory system, leading to the dispersion of CNS tissues (including prion proteins) throughout the derived carcass. This project used a marker (antibiotic-resistant) strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens to model the effects of commercial <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning procedures on the movement of mobilized CNS material within slaughtered animals and the abattoir environment. The marker organism, introduced by injection through the bolt entry aperture or directly using a cartridge-fired <b>captive</b> <b>bolt,</b> was detected in the slaughter environment immediately after stunning and in the abattoir environment at each subsequent stage of the slaughter-dressing process. The marker organism was also detected on the hands of operatives; on slaughter equipment; and in samples of blood, organs, and musculature of inoculated animals.

40|$|Context: During {{commercial}} harvesting or non-commercial kangaroo culling programs, dependent {{young of}} shot females {{are required to}} be euthanased to prevent suffering and because they {{would be unlikely to}} survive. However, the current method for killing pouch young, namely a single, forceful blow {{to the base of the}} skull, is applied inconsistently by operators and perceived by the public to be inhumane. Aims: To determine whether an alternative method for killing pouch young, namely a spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun,</b> is effective at causing insensibility in kangaroo pouch young. Methods: Trials of spring-operated captive bolt guns were conducted first on the heads of 15 dead kangaroo young and then on 21 live pouch young during commercial harvesting. We assessed the effectiveness at causing insensibility in live animals and damage caused to specific brain areas. We also measured depth of bolt penetration and skull thickness. Performance characteristics (e. g. bolt velocity) of two types of spring-operated guns were also measured and compared with cartridge-powered devices. Key results: When tested on the heads of dead animals, the spring-operated <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> consistently produced a large entrance cavity and a well defined wound tract, which extended into the cerebrum, almost extending the full thickness of the brain, including the brainstem. When tested on live pouch young, the <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> caused immediate insensibility in only 13 of 21 animals. This 62 % success rate is significantly below the 95 % minimum acceptable threshold for captive bolt devices in domestic animal abattoirs. Failure to stun was related to bolt placement, but other factors such as bolt velocity, bolt diameter and skull properties such as thickness and hardness might have also contributed. Spring-operated captive bolt guns delivered 20 times less kinetic energy than did cartridge-powered devices. Conclusions: Spring-operated captive bolt guns cannot be recommended as an acceptable or humane method for stunning or killing kangaroo pouch young. Implications: Captive bolt guns have potential as a practical alternative to blunt head trauma for effective euthanasia and reducing animal (and observer) distress. However, operators must continue to use the existing prescribed killing methods until cartridge-powered captive bolt guns have been trialled as an alternative bolt propelling method...|$|E

Forty-two commercial pigs were enrolled in the lab trial and 209 in the commercial setting. Enrollment was based on weight classes, sex and skull shape. The weight classes were 2 - 3 kg, 7. 5 - 10 kg, 15 - 20 kg, 30 - 40 kg, 100 - 120 kg, 200 + kg.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using an animal model of axonal injury to study the biomechanics of the injury. The model utilises anaesthetised sheep that are mechanically ventilated and stabilised before being subjected to a single lateral impact from a <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun.</b> The impact force was measured using a load cell mounted in the striker, and the resulting head acceleration was measured by means of a 9 -accelerometer array which was rigidly mounted {{to the head of the}} sheep. Head kinematics were transformed to anatomical coordinates using stereo-radiography. High speed cine film (1000 fps) was used for the visualisation of gross head motion. After impact, each animal was allowed to survive for a predetermined period during which anaesthesia was maintained. A complement of physiological monitors was used to measure the physiological state of the animal at all times during the experiment. In one experiment, hypqxia was induced after the physical insult. After the survival period, the animal was sacrificed and the brain removed for histological processing. The brain was sectioned, processed and examined for axonal injury using the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) as an indicator of injury. The distribution of axonal injury in serial sections of the brain was mapped and quantified. Five experiments, displaying a range of injury responses, are reported on in this paper. In the future, the model will be used to study the biomechanics of axonal injury. R. W. G. Anderson, C. J. Brown, G. Scott, P. C. Blumbergs, J. W. Finnie, A. J. McLean, N. R. Jone...|$|E
40|$|For over 50 years, {{kangaroos}} {{have been}} harvested commercially in Australia for their meat and {{skin and the}} practice is often {{the subject of much}} controversy. However, the animal welfare implications—particularly the impacts on dependent young—have not been extensively studied. In this thesis I describe research to investigate the effects of harvesting on kangaroo young and ways to potentially minimise animal suffering. My study consisted of five parts: (a) observing harvesting procedures and examining carcases to assess currently used methods for killing kangaroo young; (b) testing of a spring-powered <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> for killing pouch young; (c) determining the short-term welfare impacts of maternal separation on young-at-foot; (d) studying the attitudes and behavior of kangaroo harvesters using the theory of planned behavior; and (e) profiling the Australian public using audience segmentation methodology to identify groups that have different attitudes and perceptions about the management of kangaroos. I found that: (a) currently used methods of killing pouch young can be acceptably humane when they are performed correctly, although the techniques need to be standardised and harvesters require better training; (b) spring-powered captive bolt guns do not appear to deliver sufficient force to kill or even ensure acceptable levels of stunning of pouch young and hence testing with more powerful devices is recommended; (c) separated young-at-foot exhibit behavioural changes that indicate poor welfare; (d) some harvesters exhibit inconsistencies in their beliefs, attitudes and behaviour and also deficiencies in knowledge of kangaroos and humane harvesting practices; and (e) within the Australian public, there are three distinct groups with divergent views about kangaroo management and each group responds differently to messages on the topic. The results from this research can be used to directly improve the humaneness of current kangaroo harvesting practices and to inform a range of stakeholders about the animal welfare impacts of harvesting on dependent young. The thesis delivers practical advice for the education and training of kangaroo harvesters, contributes to our knowledge on humane killing methods and provides a foundation for understanding the Australian public’s views about harvesting (and other forms of kangaroo management) and how to communicate with them on the issue...|$|E

40|$|At a {{slaughter}} plant, cattle {{are sometimes}} exposed to rough handling which may reduce animal welfare (AW). In an observational study at four Swedish commercial slaughter plants, AW-related behaviours of cattle {{and actions of}} abattoir stockpersons handling the same animals were recorded simultaneously. The objective was to estimate the occurrence of different behaviours and actions related to negative AW during driving and stunning at large-scale cattle abattoirs, assess associations between such behaviours and actions, and analyse differences between plants and animal categories (dairy cows, beef cows, adult bulls and heifers/bullocks). Direct continuous observations of focal animals were made using laptops either in {{a section of the}} driving race to the stun box (132 animals) or in the stun box (313 animals), generating a total of 14. 5 h of observations. The animals were stunned using a penetrating <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> or a rifle. Counts per animal of 14 behaviours and 16 stockperson actions were calculated. Sixteen percent of the observed animals displayed total behaviour counts > 5 in the driving race, and 2 % did so in the stun box; 32 and 8 % of the observed animals received total counts > 5 of stockperson actions in the race and stun box, respectively. We estimated that two-thirds of the animals were processed without displaying/receiving any of the behaviours/actions associated with severely negative AW. AW scores were acquired by adding together all observed behaviour counts (and action counts, separately) weighted by expert-assessed ratings denoting the degree of impaired AW. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyse associations between behaviour counts, action counts and AW scores. Only three moderate to strong correlations (ρ ≥ 0. 4, P ≤ 0. 001) between single behaviours/actions were found (“slapping rear” and “slapping front”; “prodding” and “shouting”; and “prodding” and “beating rear” in the driving race). The correlation between AW scores based on behaviours and actions was statistically significant but rather weak both in the driving race (ρ = 0. 37, P < 0. 0001) and stun box (ρ = 0. 22, P = 0. 0002). The effects of slaughter plant and animal category on behaviour counts and AW scores were estimated using standard or zero-inflated negative-binomial regression. The risks of most behaviours related to negative AW differed considerably between plants. In the stun box, adult bulls had a 2. 5 times higher risk of “struggling-kicking” (P = 0. 016) and a 2. 0 times higher risk of displaying “backing-turning” (P = 0. 016) than had dairy cows, indicating poorer welfare for the bulls...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the influence of conventional and Kosher slaughter techniques in cattle on carcass and meat quality parameters. The conventional slaughter was done using a pneumatic <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun</b> to stun the animals before sticking, while Kosher slaughter was done by sticking the animals and then stunning them with a 0. 22 calibre cash special <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>gun,</b> 20 seconds later. The animals (n= 311) were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups, namely; slaughter method (SM) (main group, sub-divided into: conventional slaughter technique (CST) and Kosher slaughter technique (KST)); electrical stimulation (ES), sub-divided into: electrically stimulated (ES) and non-stimulated (NES); gender (G), sub-divided into: male (M) and female (F); fat code (FC), sub-divided into: FC- 2 and FC- 3 (i. e. lean to medium fatness). The quality attributes evaluated were blood loss (BL), drip loss (DL), cooking loss (CL), presence of blood in the trachea (BLT), blood splash in the lungs (BS), shear force (SF), colour (L*, a* and b*), pH and temperature profile over 24 hours and the effect of subcutaneous fat thickness (SCF). Animals were mainly steers in the “A” age group with an average slaughter weight of about 400 kg. Different crossbreeds of Bonsmara, Brahman and Nguni cattle were used, which is typical of cattle slaughtered in South Africa. Blood loss, blood in trachea and blood splash were evaluated using 311 animals (CST, n= 141; KST, n= 170) but for the other parameters, smaller numbers were used because of the hectic nature of the trials. Evaluation of BL, BLT and BS were done in the abattoir and pH and temperature readings were also taken at 45 mins, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hrs post-mortem between the 10 th and 11 th rib on the m. longissimus dorsi which was where the carcasses were sampled for the meat quality analyses. The results of this study revealed that there was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in % blood loss between the conventional and the Kosher group but the conventionally slaughtered group had a slightly higher bleed-out. Fat code had a significant (p= 0. 0475) influence on %BL, with FC- 2 (2. 42 %) group bleeding out slightly more than FC- 3 (2. 24 %). For % drip loss, there were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between all the treatment groups except for fat code (p= 0. 0242), with FC- 3 (2. 95 %) samples exuding more water than FC- 2 (2. 42 %) meat samples. In terms of % cooking loss, there was a significant difference (p= 0. 0004) between the slaughter methods, with meat samples from the conventional method (22. 11 %) exuding more water than the meat from Kosher group (18. 16 %). For blood in trachea, there was a highly significant difference (p 0. 05) in all the treatments save for fat code, with FC- 3 group (6. 38) having thicker fat cover (p= 0. 0004) than FC- 2 (4. 44) which was anticipated. In terms of colour, there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between slaughter methods for the L* value (lightness). Meat samples from the Kosher-killed animals (46. 08) were lighter than the conventionally killed ones (35. 40). Samples from the females (48. 29) were also significantly lighter (p= 0. 0057) than the males’ (37. 79). For a* value (redness), there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between the slaughter methods. The conventional group meat (15. 58), were redder than the Kosher meat (10. 40). Gender effect was also significant (p< 0. 05), with meat from the males (13. 81) appearing redder than the females’ (11. 25). For b* value (yellowness), significant difference (p< 0. 0001) was also found between the slaughter methods. The Kosher meat samples (- 6. 49) appeared yellower than those from conventional slaughter (0. 26). FC- 3 samples (- 2. 36) were also significantly (p= 0. 0112) yellower than the FC- 2 samples (- 3. 05). For pH, analyses revealed a significant difference (p< 0. 0380) at 45 minutes post-mortem (pm) between slaughter methods. The kosher carcasses (pH= 6. 43) had a slightly higher pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (6. 33). The ES carcasses (pH= 6. 16) also had a significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) pH compared to the NES carcasses (pH= 6. 89). At 3 hrs pm, only electrical stimulation showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001). The ES carcasses (pH= 5. 72) were lower than the NES group (pH= 6. 49). At 6 hrs, only electrical stimulation still showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001), with the ES carcasses (5. 56) still having a faster decline compared to the NES group (pH= 6. 01). At 12 hrs, the ES group (pH= 5. 61) still had a significantly (p= 0. 0008) lower pH than the NES group (pH= 5. 82). At 24 hrs, only the slaughter method showed a significant influence (p= 0. 0314) in carcass pH, with the Kosher carcasses (pH= 5. 53) having a slightly lower pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered ones (pH= 5. 56). The latter difference is probably not of any practical significance and could be ignored. Temperature at 45 minutes pm showed a significant difference (p= 0. 0248) between the slaughter methods with the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (36. 500 C) having a slightly lower temperature compared to those slaughtered conventionally (37. 220 C). At 3 hrs pm, the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (30. 060 C) had a significantly higher (p= 0. 0005) temperature than the conventional group (27. 050 C). The female carcasses (31. 260 C) also had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) temperature compared to the male carcasses (27. 890 C). The FC- 2 carcasses (28. 190 C) also had a significantly lower temperature (p= 0. 0149) compared to FC- 3 (30. 110 C) which was anticipated due to lower temperature decline in those with lower subcutaneous fat. At 6 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (14. 710 C) still showed a significantly faster decline (p< 0. 0001) compared to those slaughtered by Kosher (20. 16). FC- 2 carcasses also showed a significantly (p= 0. 0104) lower temperature (16. 680 C) compared to FC- 3 (18. 740 C). At 12 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (4. 720 C) still had a significantly (p< 0. 0001) lower temperature compared to the Kosher group (10. 240 C). The FC- 2 group (6. 690 C) also had a significantly (p= 0. 0011) lower temperature compared to the FC- 3 group (8. 890 C). Finally at 24 hrs after slaughter, slaughter method still showed a highly significant influence (p< 0. 0001) with the conventionally slaughtered carcasses having a much lower temperature (- 0. 420 C) compared to the Kosher group (3. 060 C). The male’ carcasses (0. 620 C) also had significantly lower (p< 0. 05), ultimate temperature compared to carcasses from the females (2. 990 C). There was also a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the fat codes, with the FC- 2 carcasses (1. 010 C) showing a lower temperature, compared to the FC- 3 (1. 710 C) carcasses.

The stunning methods used were electrical whole-body and head-only stunning with different voltages (25 vs 100 V) and frequencies (50 vs 200 Hz), and mechanical <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning. Before being stunned, the broilers were restrained either by shackling them by the feet, restraining their heads while they were standing, or placing them in a cone. Convulsions during and after stunning were subjectively scored. At 1 d post-mortem, the pH, color, and the intensity and number of hemorrhages, of breast and thigh muscles were measured. Convulsions were, in order of increasing intensity, observed after whole-body stunning using 50 Hz, whole-body stunning using 200 Hz, head-only stunning, and <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning. No differences in ultimate pH were measured. A consistent difference in color was observed between whole-body and head-only stunning. Head-only stunning resulted in darker and more red (P ≤ 0. 01) breast muscles. Head-only and <b>captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning resulted in hemorrhages that were located more distal in the breast muscle than those observed after whole-body stunning. <b>Captive</b> <b>bolt</b> stunning (in a cone) resulted in fewer (P ≤ 0. 01) hemorrhages in breast and thigh muscles than whole-body stunning (100 V, 50 Hz, shackled), and in a similar level of hemorrhaging as electrical head-only stunning (25 V, 200 Hz, in a cone) ...|$|R
