A further aim is {{to assist in the}} conceptual development of a new pig model, which is more detailed, precise and accurate than currently available models. Exsisting models are generally deficient with regard to the translation of lipid and protein gain into lean and fatty tissue. Only assumed values for this translation have been used so far and the concepts underlying these values are not well understood.

The function of phenylalanine (Phe) as an inhibitor of the uptake of the precursor amino acid tyrosine (Tyr) through the blood-brain barrier {{as well as an}} inhibitor of the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain is under investigation. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a method for quantitatively determining biochemical and physiological processes in vivo. In the current pilot study, L-[1 -C- 11]-Tyr and F- 18 -fluoro-ethyl-spiperone (FESP) have been used. The metabolic pathway of carboxylic labelled Tyr is mainly incorporation into protein. From the measured tissue and plasma activity as a function of time in combination with a <b>compartimental</b> model the Protein Synthesis Rate (PSR) for Tyr can be calculated.

In patients with plasma Phe levels above the maximum therapeutic concentration (> 700 mu mol/l) the PSR for Tyr was decreased as compared to controls and patients with plasma Phe concentrations within the therapeutic range, indicating a decreased availability of Tyr for neurotransmitter synthesis, and hence explaining the reduced cerebral concentration of catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} perform {{radiological}} impact assessments of radioactive waste disposals, a <b>compartimental</b> model {{taking into account}} generic data for biosphere transfer parameters values is usually used. To improve its performance assessments calculations, Andra (French national radioactive waste management agency) decided to adapt this type of biosphere model to its sites conditions. On one hand, specific models have been developed such as model for 36 Cl based on isotopic dilution and on local stable chlorine contents. On the other hand, biosphere transfer factors values are issued from experimental studies adapted to Andra context: soil characteristics, climate, agricultural habits and species. Local maps of radionuclides mobility have thus been able to be established in terms of soils characteristics. These specific data are useful only if main factors controlling mobility have been determined previously for each radionuclide, which implicates good knowledge of environmental radionuclides behaviour. This site-specific approach allows to reduce uncertainty and range of variation of impact calculations and ensure a consistent model. It helps also to achieve scientific community approval by showing mastery of radionuclides environmental processes and public understanding by focusing demonstration on real local conditions.

40|$|In our environment, we can {{frequently}} identify {{phenomena that}} can be well studied under single input / single output representation (from now on SISO), for example {{in the fields of}} Biotechnology (case of the study of Landfills) or Geosciences (propagation of water through cracks), when researchers fill a tracer in an determined area. In the first case, many reactions take part in the area, but since a landfill is usually huge, it is diffcult to know what happens in the inside of it. The only thing that we know is that the re-circulation leachate increases the bio-reaction rates since it improves the system mixing. So, we would like to study what happens if we put an inert substrate in the leachate to understand the behaviour of this fluid. In the second case, it could be interesting to study how the water or any source propagates in an area, in order to know for instance what could happen in case of a natural disaster as a big rain or a melting of glaciers and this way to know where to install an urban settlement. So, the idea here is as before, to put an inert substrate in a source and to measure the output response. The motivation for this work is to characterize these two phenomena exposed above, assuming that initially biological interaction does not happen or considering an inert chemical tracer.

40|$|The {{curative}} {{properties of}} Cannabis sativa L. {{have been known}} for ages, {{but only in the}} last years interesting pharmaceutical properties have been reported for both synthetic and natural compounds having high affinity towards CB 1 and/or CB 2 cannabinoid receptors. In particular Rimonabant and other pyrazole derivatives have been widely studied for their CB 1 antagonism in different in vitro and in vivo models. The lead compound Rimonabant (SR 14176 A or Acomplia®) has been initially employed in human as anti-obesity drug, but unfortunately EMA was constrained to block its sales according to the evidence of related adverse effects, particularly increased incidence of depression and suicidality. However interest in cannabinoid drug discovery is actually marked, especially toward the obtainment of new CB 1 and/or CB 2 ligands. In order to evaluate structure-activity relationship due to the modification of the different substituents at both C 4 and C 5 positions of the pyrazole core, new series of cannabinoid pyrazole derivatives have been obtained. Molecular structures have been investigated by Infrared Spettroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Mass Spectrometry. Two of CB 1 antagonist compounds, NESS 014 A and NESS 006 A, were obtained and characterized by CB 1 affinity of 14. 3 and 35. 0 nM, respectively (expressed as Ki). To evaluate the effect of the chemical structure of the compounds on the blood and brain barrier permeability, bioanalytical methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) in both rat brain and blood were developed and validated.

40|$|Arterial embolisms in {{the lower}} limbs occur frequently, and are of great {{interest}} to the vascular surgeon. The authors studied 159 cases of arterial embolisms in lower limbs from January 1991 to July 1993. Ages varied from 12 to 98, with a mean of 58. Eighty patients were male and 78 were female. In most cases, etiology of the embolus was well-established, and mainly caused (78 percent) by atrial fibrillation. Occlusion was most frequent in the femoral artery (53. 4 percent). All patients presented severe lower limb ischemia, but not gangrene, on admission. The duration of ischemia, between the onset of symptoms and the liberation of arterial flow, was in most patients (67. 9 percent) less than 24 hours. All patients were submitted to lower limb embolectomy with the Fogarty catheter, of which 70. 9 percent were done through the femoral artery. Fasciotomy was performed on 48 patients due to a <b>compartimental</b> syndrome. Nineteen patients died immediately after operation; 68. 4 percent due to heart failure. Twenty-three (16. 4 percent) of the 140 surviving patients (150 operated limbs) were submitted to amputations after the occlusion of artery branches, which had undergone embolectomies. One hundred and twenty-seven limbs (84. 6 percent) were preserved in 117 patients (83. 5 percent). Eleven cases (7. 3 percent) required repeated surgery with the Fogarty catheter. The patients with muscle tenderness, paralysis, or ischemia lasting longer than 24 hours had worse results in relation to the preservation of the limb (p< 0. 05). We conclude that patients who present lower limb embolisms, are in good clinical condition, and who do not have any necrosis in the limbs, have good outcomes as to limb preservation, along with low complication rates, after embolectomy with the Fogarty catheter. Limb preservation was significantly higher in patients who did not present muscle tenderness, and who had normal motor activity and a ischemia duration of less than 24 hours...|$|E

It focusses on the representation of dispersion processes, with the goal to improve and evaluate these processes. As such it forms a first step in the revision towards a complete three dimensional description of the transport module in the EUROS model. The work is performed within the framework of a collaboration between the Flemish institute for technological research (VITO) and RIVM. In EUROS the representation of the mixing layer and horizontal advection is improved. The new EUROS version is extensively tested and mixing layer height values are evaluated with lidar measurements. Model results for ozone concentrations and accumulated exposure (AOT) are evaluated in terms of the different mixing layer representations. The revised calculation of the mixing layer gives a much better representation of the land-sea contrast, with lower mixing heights over sea than over land, during the daytime. An important outcome is that the mixing layer concept, used in EUROS, hinders the validation of modelled concentration levels. Because, in spite of the applied scientific model improvements, modelled AOT 40 levels for ozone do not show significant improvement in respect to observations. The main concern in this context is the value of the reservoir layer height in the model, which is interlaced with the mixing layer concept. Therefore, it is anticipated that a more realistic representation of the vertical exchange processes, by describing explicitly three-dimensional advection and diffusion, will improve the EUROS model results significantly, both quantitatively and qualitatively...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on the metabolism of chylomicrons and their remnants and the possible alterations in the concentrations of plasma lipids caused by the drug in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic individuals. METHODS: The metabolism of chylomicrons was tested with the method of artificial lipid emulsion of chylomicrons labeled with ³H-cholesteryl oleate. The emulsion was injected intravenously in 10 patients with mild-moderate arterial hypertension before and 45 days after treatment with captopril (50 mg/day). After injection, blood samples were collected during 60 minutes at pre-established time intervals for determining the decay curve, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR in min- 1), and the plasma residence time of the artificial lipid emulsion by analyzing different compartments. The plasma concentrations of the lipids were also assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The fractional catabolic rate (min- 1) of the lipid emulsion before and after treatment with captopril (0. 012 ± 0. 003 and 0. 011 ± 0. 003, respectively; p= 0. 85, n. s.) and the plasma residence time of the emulsion (83. 3 ± 20. 8 and 90. 9 ± 22. 5 min, n. s.) did not change, but the total cholesterol and LDL-C levels decreased by 7 % and 10 %, respectively (p= 0. 02).

Método: Doce cerdos anestesiados (4, 8 ± 0, 1 kg). El SCA fue inducido con instilación de solución coloide en cavidad peritoneal para obtener una presión intra-abdominal (PIA) de 25 ± 5 mmHg. En condiciones basales y posterior a inducción del SCA se realizó monitorización hemodinámica convencional y termodilución transpulmonar.

It {{can be caused}} by medical and surgical reasons, resulting in a high mortality rate. objective: To determine the magnitude of the initial hemodynamic and respiratory consequences triggered by the induction of ACS in an experimental model. Methods: The model consisted of twelve anesthetized pigs (4. 8 ± 0. 1 kg). The ACS was induced by instillation of colloid solution in the peritoneal cavity to obtain an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 24. 9 ± 0. 6 mmHg. In basal conditions and after the ACS induction, a conventional hemodynamic monitoring and transpulmonary thermodilution were performed. At the same time, arterial blood gases and lung mechanics analysis were measured. results: There was a reduction of cardiac output by 16 % (5. 19 ± 0. 33 to 4. 34 ± 0. 28 l/min/m², p = 0. 01) and abdominal perfusion pressure by 20 % (72. 3 ± 3. 2 to 57. 3 ± 4. 0 mmHg, p < 0. 001) without changes in heart rate, arterial or central venous pressure. In addition there was an approximately 50 % worsening of respiratory system compliance (1. 28 ± 0. 09 to 0. 62 ± 0. 04 ml/cmH 2 O/kg, p = 0. 002) associated with a significant increase in intrathoracic pressure and slight decrease in oxygenation. Discussion: In this experimental model, the early development of hemodynamic and pulmonary dysfunction could be observed. A reduction of cardiac output that was not detected by conventional monitoring and a substantial deterioration of lung mechanics, characteristic of restrictive disease, associated with mild alterations in gas exchange were reported. It is essential then to monitor the IAP in patients predisposed to develop ACS, {{especially in the case of}} organ dysfunction deterioration, as severe hypotension and hypoxemia are late signs of this complication...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{course of}} HIV {{infection}} {{is accompanied by}} a wide individual variability. The complex and large in-terplay between host and viral factors is crucial in the disease’s evolution. The lung has been recognised {{from the beginning of the}} disease as one of the main targets of infectious and non-infectious complications of AIDS. In this setting both anatomic and immunologic particularities of this organ play an important role. The hallmark of HIV is progressive immune dys-function. Despite the intensive research into the pathogenesis, several questions remain to be answered on the dynamic effects of HIV on pulmonary cells. Previous studies in which we have participated sho-wed the early presence of lymphocytic alveolitis from the asymptomatic phase of infection. Since then, many collected data has brought new insights into the immune and biochemical mechanisms involving HIV cell entry, as well as target cells, cytokines and other cellular mediators. In this context, the discovery that specific chemokine receptors could act as co-receptors for HIV, allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying viral cellular entry and tropism. On this issue several authors have reported that in addition to the CD 4 molecule, most strains of HIV use the chemokine receptor CCR 5 for viral attachment and entry into the host cells. This receptor seems to be very important in disease transmission, whereas CXCR 4 receptor tends to be used by the viral strains that emerge later in the disease in addition to or instead of the CCR 5. Aims: To evaluate the pulmonary cellular dynamics in AIDS patients regarding the viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (LLBA), as well as cellularity and tropism through CCR 5 and CXCR 4 receptors. Material: 14 AIDS patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 39 ± 14. 3 years (9 males and 5 females) all HIV 1, heterosexuals, 6 smokers and 8 non-smokers, none of them drug addicts. These patients were referred to bronchoscopy with BAL, for clinical suspicion of opportunistic lung infections. These patients were later divided into two groups: Group I (recent diagnosis) and Group II (non-recent diagnosis). While all patients had AIDS, group I had also recent diagnosis of oportunistic infections and had not received yet anti-retroviral therapy whilst group II had a long-term disease evolution with several opportunistic episodes and anti-retroviral therapeutic. Methods: BAL was performed both in the middle bronchus in diffuse or in other segmentar bronchus, depending on radiographic abnormalities. Plasma viral load was performed through PCR-RT in blood samples with EDTA, centrifuged and frozen (- 80 º Cel-sius) in the first 4 hours after being collected. The viral load in BALf was quantified in 9 patients using the automatized Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas Amplicor HIV 1 Monitor TM Test, version 1. 5 Roche Diagnostic Systems. The results were expressed in a numeric scale, with a dynamic variation of 50 - 750. 000 copies of RNA HIV 1 /cm 3 and later converted into a logarithmic scale. In 10 patients an immunological study was carried out in BALf and blood to quantify the lymphocyte populations and subsets (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, CD 56 and CD 56 CD 8) as well as the receptors CD 3 CCR 5, CD 4 CCR 5, CD 8 CCR 5, CCR 5 Mø, CXCR 4, CD 3 CXCR 4, CXCR 4 CD 14 and co-stimulatory molecule CD 28, CD 3 CD 28, CD 4 CD 28, CD 8 CD 28 through monoclonal antibodies – CD 8 FITC, CD 19 FITC, CD 3 PE, CD 56 PE, CD 4 PECY 5 -Lymphogram Cytognos; CCR 5 PE, CXCRFITC-R & D Systems; CD 8 Cy 5 and CD 3 Cy 5 -DaKo, CD 4 PE, CD 14 PE, CD 28 FITC-Immunotech; CD 4 FITC-CLB, CD 8 Percp- Beckton Dickinson and CD 3 APC – Beckton Dickinson, by flow cytometry (Facs Calibur-Be-ckton-Dickinson) with 3 or 4 fluorescences – FL 1 -FITC, FL 2 -PE, FL 3 -PECY, FL 4 -APC. In the statistical analysis, we used the Student t-test, and linear correlation. Results: Presence of HIV 1 in BALf (2. 95 log± 3. 08 log), in small levels compared with plasma viral loads (5. 89 log ± 5. 90 log) (Table IV). There was great variability of viral loads in BALf as there was in blood independent of the time elapsed between diagnosis and the exam. As for the lymphocytic populations and subsets in blood (Table V) determined in 13 patients, there was a significant fall of total lymphocytes as well as of their subsets, although more marked in CD 4 cells; 42. 9 % had CD 4 levels 250 cels/mm 3. The CD 19 was reduced with an individual distribution similar to the CD 4 subset. In most cases, the fall of CD 8 accompanied the decrease of CD 4 and CD 19 (patients-nº 7 and 8). The lymphocyte populations and subsets in BALf (10 patients) (Table VI) showed a percentual distribution similar to that observed in blood (Table VII) for CD 3, CD 19, CD 4 and CD 8 lymphocytes, although the percentage of T cells was higher than in blood (94. 5 ± 5 / 84. 1 ± 10. 4) as opposed to B cells (2. 2 ± 3 / 10. 4 ± 9. 6). In BALf CD 8 T cells were higher than in blood (77. 7 ± 17. 6 / 67. 6 ± 4. 2), which was not observed for the CD 4 lymphocytes (8. 1 ± 9. 5 BALf vs. 10. 4 ± 9. 6 in blood). The natural killer activity expressed by CD 56 T cells had important indivi-dual variations in both biological fluids: higher levels in blood than in BALf (9. 1 ± 8 / 2. 9 ± 1. 9). The cytotoxic activity of CD 56 CD 8 was similar in blood and in BALf (2. 2 ± 2 / 1. 7 ± 1. 2) while the individual distribution seemed more homogeneous in BALf (Table VI) than in blood (Table VII). The double-negative (DN) cells had slightly higher values in BALf (7. 6 ± 4. 5 vs 5. 6 ± 5. 3). Curiously, in BALf we observed a higher percentage of less differenciated cells (13 ± 13. 6) (Table VI). The analysis of the receptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4 showed in general terms different behaviour concerning the two biological means (Tables VI and VII). Thus, the CCR 5 CD 3 was hi-gher in blood (10. 9 ± 13. 2) than in BALf (8. 4 ±± 3. 5) while the CCR 5 CD 4 and CCR 5 CD 8 had an increased expression in BALf in relation to blood (2 ± 2. 3 and 4. 9 ± 3. 7 / 0. 9 ± 0. 7 and 4. 1 ± 4. 0 respectively). Concerning the expression of this receptor on monocyte macrophage lineage a marked higher value was attained in BALft (77. 8 ±± 41 in BALf vs. 18. 7 ± 15 in blood). On the contrary the total expression of CXCR 4 was higher in BALf (31 ± 19. 9) than in blood (16. 4 ±± 8. 1). This tendency extended equally to the T lymphocytes (26. 6 ± 19. 8 vs. 10. 7 ± 7. 6) and also to the monocyte-macrophage lineage in an exuberant manner (84. 5 ± 30. 2 / 4. 8 ± 4. 6). The co-stimulatory activity of CD 28 showed higher values in blood (22. 8 ± 16. 2) than in BALf (15. 9 ±± 10. 1) for total T cells, CD 4 and CD 8 lymphocytes 22. 5 ± 16. 7; 7. 8 ± 8. 3; 13. 3 ± 8. 3 / 16. 5 ±± 10. 5; 2. 9 ± 2. 8; 10. 8 ± 8. 0 respectively). Conclusions: 1. HIV infection is responsible for important and extensive abnormalities in lung host defences. 2. The complex interaction between host and aggressor as well as the immune response particularly represented by natural killer and cytotoxic activities, apoptosis, and opportunistic diseases or others, therapeutics and other factors may contibute to the difficulty in obtaining homogenous medical samples within research. There are also ethical issues that restrict a purely scientific approach to these patients. 3. These results point to a pulmonary response to HIV in a compartmentalised fashion according to the dynamic cellular elements involved and receptors in which the latter had distinct profiles related to the biological fluids. In this context, the lung <b>compartimental</b> response is particularly dependent on alveolar macrophages activity which is from the beginning the cornerstone of this process and is the last cellular defense mechanism in this territory when all others are profoundly affected. 4. The dynamics of chemokines receptors may be very important in therapeutic approach as the blockage of the CCR 5 receptor does not seem to trigger an increased expression of CXCR 4 strains. In fact, we found that CXCR 4 remained high in monocyte-macrophage cells throughout infection and its expression was increased in T-lymphocytes in Group II patients as opposed to CCR 5 behavior in BALf which significantly decreases. However, in blood, CCR 5 expression increased, unlike CXCR 4. 5. Due to high co-existing opportunistic infections (71. 4 %) we cannot ignore the hypothesis that this increased expression of CXCR 4 was a result of the modulation induced by opportunistic agents. 6. Finally, this striking individual variability undoubtly has clinical implications. This makes a case-by-case management strategy the correct approach.
