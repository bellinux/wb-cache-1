5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move {{as much as he}} <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a mid-air collision, losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy. He ejected through the canopy, parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E

What about cows, pigs, chickens and sheep? Weren't they people, too? How could we love some and eat others?" ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted patent applications for a linear accelerator in 1928, and a cyclotron in 1929. He also conceived {{the idea of an}} electron microscope. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein {{on the development of the}} Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E
5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were {{the days when the}} British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{was close}} friends with Jilly Rizzo, {{songwriter}} Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry and baseball manager Leo Durocher. In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> swam {{daily in the}} Pacific Ocean, finding it to be therapeutic and giving him much-needed solitude. He would often play golf with Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived, and liked painting, reading, and building model railways.|$|E

[...] Former Chiefs captain between 1975 and 1986, Ryder Mofokeng said [...] "he could dribble past defenders, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> pass, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> cross and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> shoot. <b>He</b> {{was one of the best}} all-round strikers South Africa had." ...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then <b>could</b> <b>he</b> be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
5|$|Without {{the benefit}} of a full senior season to show himself off to scouts, Clippard {{proactively}} sent scouts a schedule of when he was throwing and attended as many showcases as he <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> trained with Roy Silver, a retired professional baseball player, who worked with Clippard on his mechanics and his maturity. Clippard's father, Bob, teamed up with Tom Kotchman, father of Florida high school player Casey Kotchman, to form showcases with past teammates of Clippard.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E

60|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in England, Sidonia {{repaired}} to the principal Courts of Europe, that he might become personally acquainted with the monarchs and ministers of whom he had heard so much. His position insured him a distinguished reception; his personal qualities immediately made him cherished. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> please; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do more, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> astonish. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> throw out a careless observation which would make the oldest diplomatist start; a winged word that gained him the consideration, sometimes the confidence, of Sovereigns. When he had fathomed the intelligence which governs Europe, and {{which can only be}} done by personal acquaintance, he returned to this country.|$|R
5|$|Szilard {{received}} German {{citizenship in}} 1930, but was already {{uneasy about the}} political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he <b>could</b> <b>he</b> incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only <b>could</b> <b>he</b> easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented contour lines, in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|E
