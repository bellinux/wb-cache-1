40|$|U radu se objavljuju podaci o mauzoleju koji je 1930. otkriven u tupinolomu Klanac istočno od Manastirina. U njemu je pronađeno pet grobnica od kojih je jedna bila pokrivena pločom s mozaikom s natpisom dječaka Tita Aurelija Aurelijana, druga je imala ploču s dva udubljenja, a na trećoj je bio natpis koji spominje nekog Mucijana. Mauzolej se datira u kraj 3. ili početak 4. stoljeća. Do sada nije bila objedinjena i objavljena sva dostupna dokumentacija o tom mauzoleju pa se ona donosi u ovom tekstu. 1930 in Solin {{discovered}} was a Roman mausoleum {{that until}} {{now has been}} known only partially, that is, the available documentation has never been put together and published, and this is being done here. The mausoleum was discovered in the Klanac marl quarry, east of Tusculum. This is known from the note made by the Reverend Frane Bulić, that is cited here. Besides the mausoleum, in 1931 in Klanac discovered were graves under tegulae and in amphorae, as shown in three photographs, but of which presently nothing more is known. The mausoleum had thick outer walls, around 1 m thick, as it appears. This, {{and the fact that}} in it there was a mosaic made of very small stones that could not have stayed outdoors, indicate that the mausoleum was covered. It was square shaped, 6. 70 x 6. 70 in size, 4. 70 m wide inside. It was oriented north-south, the entrance being at the southern side. Immediately next to the entrance there were three graves, in particular erected tombs, and behind these there were two more, whereas along the northern wall was a bench (in the Dyggve’s drawing: Bank). The grave by the western wall (G 1) was 0. 90 m deep and 0. 55 m wide, the middle grave (G 2) was 1. 15 m deep and also 0. 55 m wide, whereas the grave next to it (G 3) was 1. 20 m deep and 0. 94 m wide. Dimensions of the two graves by the bench (G 4 and 5) are not known. While the first three graves were separated from each other, it appears that the two graves behind were mutually connected and covered with a vault a pozzetto, a part of which can be seen in a photograph. Originally, the graves were covered with stone slabs, but at the moment of discovery preserved were only three. Over the grave number 1 was a stone slab of irregular rectangular shape with an inserted mosaic. Between the slab and the mausoleum wall was a border, also made of mosaic, that, unfortunately, is not preserved. In the space towards the grave number 2 there was no border. The slab is missing its left side and a part of the mosaic. The preserved part of the mosaic presents a boy sitting on a chair and holding a rotulus in his hand. Next to him are a partridge and a herma. By the edge is the image of a stela with the inscription from which we learn that here is buried the nine-year old Titus Aurelius Aurelianus: D · M HIC POSITVS · EST T(itus) · AVRELIVS · AV RELIANVS FILIVS PIENTISSIMVS VIXIT ANNIS · VIIII By its colours, symbolic contents and the fact that right now it is the only mosaic with a sepulchral inscription from Salona, the Aurelianus’ mosaic has been constantly attracting the researchers’ attention and there is a vast literature on it. Particularly interesting is the interpretation that the boy in the mosaic is not Aurelianus but a personification of death. Since the mosaic is missing its left part, there is the opinion that there was yet another inscription there, also that there was presented the boy’s old teacher and that the mosaic shows evident influence of the Hellenistic sepulchral iconography, as well as the opinion that it probably contained the symmetric image of that at the right hand side. Opinions about the herma also disagree. Some scientists deem it presents the boy’s teacher, Apollo or Dionysus, a prominent person from artistic life, a girl, a poetess, or the poetess Sappho. Contrary to this, the monument has been dated almost unanimously to the 3 rd, late 3 rd or early 4 th century, that is, the tetrarchic period. Immediately after its discovery, the Aurelianus’ slab was taken to the Archaeological Museum in Split, where the mosaic edges were repaired with cement. In order to give it its regular shape, the slab was added the missing left part. It appears that during the Second World War the mosaic was restored by Fulvio Vettraino, who visited Split from Italy at that time. Over the grave number 2 there was a thick, rectangular stone slab that covered the grave chamber in which two adults and three children were buried. The slab had two round recesses. Ejnar Dyggve assumed the slab probably had been used as a common sacrificing table for all five graves. However, it is not impossible that the regular round recesses were made to receive small columns that carried the altar mensa, meaning the sacrificing gifts were not placed directly on the floor. This is suggested by the hole appearing like hole for insertion of a fixing iron peg, as well as the regular, symmetrical position of both recesses in the slab. It is also possible that the recess with the peg hole was to receive the table carrier, and that thelower recess was to receive the base of another piece of stone inventory. Presently, nothing further can be said because the slab has been lost or destroyed. Based on the Aurelianus’ and the Mutianus’ inscriptions, the slab has been dated to the 3 rd century. When the mausoleum was discovered, the grave number 3 had no <b>covering</b> <b>slab,</b> which should have been of the same length as that above the grave number 2, and above the grave 4 no slab was found either. Above the grave number 5, a slab was found, somewhat damaged and mentioning a certain Mucianus: QVISQVIS PETES MVCIANI MEMЄNTO QVM VIDEAS SOLVM PENDERE VIDE NEFACIAS QVOD TIBI FIERI NON VIS MVCIANS CLO(dio) SECUND[o] DEDI LOCVM The inscription is to protect the Mucianus’ grave from desecration, also containing the permission for burying also Clodius Secundus in it. Based on the uncial letter E in the word MEMENTO, it has been dated to the late 3 rd century. Between the mausoleum north wall and the graves numbers 4 and 5 there was a bench for liturgical ceremonies, running along the entire width of the mausoleum. Given the grave dimensions provided by Dyggve and the number of the deceased in the grave number 2, the graves were obviously researched, but we have no information whether there were any offerings in them that would help dating the mausoleum and provide more information on the persons buried in them. After researching {{the southern part of the}} mausoleum, its northern part was cleaned as well, the earth and stones from them being thrown into the lower graves. Since the mausoleum was found in a part of a marl quarry from which marl was being extracted, it was probably destroyed upon completion of the research. Thus, regretfully, disappeared an important monument of the Roman Salona of which today witnessing are just two capstones and a few photographs and notes that we have gathered here...|$|E

The studied artefacts were recovered from the submerged archaeological park of Baia (Naples, Italy). It includes ruins of the ancient city of Baiae, which, since the 4 th century AD, started to be submerged due to the bradyseism phenomenon. Diagnostic investigations were carried on 50 marbles specimens, collected from <b>covering</b> <b>slabs</b> of different pavements, from a specific area of the site called “Villa con ingresso a protiro”. Several techniques, including stereomicroscopy, polarizing optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and mineralogical analysis, were used to study the superficial weathering, as well as the bioerosion phenomena due to the action of marine organisms and their interaction with the substrate in relation to textural features. Results revealed that the main degradation processes can be attributable to endolithic activity, capable of excavating cavities and tunnels causing irreversible damage to the archaeological materials. In addition, samples revealed a different degree of bioerosion related to their specific intrinsic characteristics. Peer reviewe...|$|R

6000|$|... § XLI. Farther. While {{the sculptures}} of the incrusted school will thus be {{generally}} distinguished by care and purity rather than force, and will be, {{for the most}} part, utterly wanting in depth of shadow, {{there will be one}} means of obtaining darkness peculiarly simple and obvious, and often in the sculptor's power. Wherever he can, without danger, leave a hollow behind his <b>covering</b> <b>slabs,</b> or use them, like glass, to fill an aperture in the wall, he can, by piercing them with holes, obtain points or spaces of intense blackness to contrast with the light tracing of the rest of his design. And we may expect to find this artifice used the more extensively, because, while it will be an effective means of ornamentation on the exterior of the building, it will be also the safest way of admitting light to the interior, still totally excluding both rain and wind. And it will naturally follow that the architect, thus familiarized with the effect of black and sudden points of shadow, will often seek to carry the same principle into other portions of his ornamentation, and by deep drill-holes, or perhaps inlaid portions of black color, to refresh the eye where it may be wearied by the lightness of the general handling.|$|R

The 2 quarries are near San Felice Circeo town (“Guardi D’Orlando – Monticchio and “La Batteria”); “cotognino” alabaster and “a giaccione” alabaster was carried out from these 2 sites, these 2 litotypes was considered very valuable some years ago. Alabaster formation of “Monticchio” ore is made up from calcareous water circulation into the jointing of Circeo liassic limestones, it is constituted of crystalline stalactitic concretions, sometimes many zones show gradation of colour from honey to intense brown, and it is called “cotognino”. “Giaccion” alabaster take its name to be like ice, in fact it shows colours from white to bright yellow, and is into the liassic fractured limestones. By the light of this thin section analyses, X-ray diffractometry, RI determination, X-ray fluorescence and C, O and Sr isotopic analyses was carried out from each samples. A geologic characterization is defined, considering minero-petrographic, chemical and geochemical features, to solving archaeometric problems about artifacts made up to alabaster lithotypes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:Motion-robust multi-slab imaging of hippocampal inner {{structure}} in vivo at 7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Motion {{is a crucial}} issue for ultra-high resolution imaging, such as can be achieved with 7 T MRI. An acquisition protocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7 T. It relies on a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion. In order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full <b>slab</b> <b>covering</b> the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition time. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired slabs within a final 3 D-consistent high-resolution <b>slab</b> <b>covering</b> the whole hippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three groups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on three issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion artifacts and registration procedure performance. RESULTS:Overall, T 2 -weighted acquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration yielded high quality datasets in 96 % of the subjects, thus compatible with further analyses of hippocampal inner structure. CONCLUSION:Multi-slab acquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time and consequently motion artifacts for ultra-high resolution imaging of the inner structure of the hippocampus...|$|R
