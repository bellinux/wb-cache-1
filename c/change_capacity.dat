40|$|There {{has been}} little {{empirical}} analysis on the complex relationship between strategic management, organizational <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> (OCC) and performance of organizations {{in the context of}} European countries. In this thesis, the purpose is to analyse the relationship between the involvement of middle management in strategic management and OCC on the one hand, and the relationship between OCC and organizational performance on the other. Based on literature we tested the influence of involvement and autonomy of middle managers in strategic management on OCC, and furthermore the relation between OCC and organizational performance. Testable hypotheses about these relations are derived, we used data collected from a single case organization. Results of the study suggest that involvement of middle managers in strategic management positively and significantly affects the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> of the organization, but no evidence is found that autonomy has a direct commitment to the <b>change</b> <b>capacity.</b> Subsequently, <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> is found to significantly affect the performance of the organization. In other words, middle managers have influence on the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> through their involvement in strategic management, and this <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> positively effects the performance of the organization. This may suggest that top management should realise that the influence of middle managers in strategic management is an important step in generating OCC. And generating OCC is critical {{because of the fact that}} it has a significant and positive relationship with the performance of the organization. This thesis attempts to shed light on the current theoretical debate about organizational <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> and provide a practical view for people working in the top and middle management section to contribute to the organizational performance...|$|E

This is examined through a comparative analysis of two case studies, where it is used qualitative methods when interviewing five employees in Vest – and Innlandet police districts. The studies theoretical framework {{is based on}} three organizational theoretical perspectives. The instrumental perspective, cultural perspective and myth perspective. The status of knowledge on <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> as a theoretical term has basis in Meyer and Stensakers (2011) approach to <b>change</b> <b>capacity.</b> The study answers the following question; "What characterizes a selected group in the police and their understandings and perceptions of Change Capacity" The study shows that generally characterized the respondents' understanding of concepts that they are influenced by both the formal tasks they have, the status of knowledge on the area, and the culture and history of those employees are part of.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate which factors hinder or contribute to far-reaching change. These factors are sought in characteristics of organisations, and in the design and management of change processes. Altogether, we evaluate 16 aspects when assessing the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> of organisations. In addition, we explore underlying patterns in the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> of organisations. General results suggest that the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> of organisations is neither low nor high. This is counterintuitive and opposite to what we know about differences between changing organisations. Additional cluster analyses revealed a limited number of con- Þgurations in the <b>change</b> <b>capacity</b> of organisations. Five conÞgurations show distinct patterns in factors that frustrate or contribute to change. We interpreted the conÞgurations as the innovative organisation, the longing organisation, the organisation with aged technology, the organisation with a clumsy change approach, and the cynical organisation. The conÞgurations demonstrate that focusing on multiple aspects of organisations and change processes is important to fully comprehend what hinders and helps organisations change. Furthermore, results from this study suggest that a sense of urgency is not needed for change to take place, that resistance to change is related to the management of the change process, that each conÞguration requires speciÞc interventions, and that con- Þgurations may be related to organisational variables as sector and size...|$|E

This may lead to the conclusion that in general organizations and change processes run rather satisfying. This is counterintuitive. Thus, we needed to perform additional and more sophisticated analyses. A cluster analysis was performed in order to explore possible underlying configurations in the barriers to change. We found nine configurations which were interpreted as the innovative organization, the professional organization, the organization with aged technology, the longing organization, the political organization, the organization entangled in problematic technological change, the insecure organization, the organization with an awkward approach to change and the skeptical organization. In the discussion we focus on the general implications of these results and on their meaning for practitioners...|$|E

To implement these changes there are some constraints involved: atomic nature of changes; when a change is implemented then it cannot be interrupted; an application has a specific downtime, which causes timing constraint; applications that share same resources such as servers have overlapping downtime which causes conflicts among changes. In such complex system, scheduling of changes becomes a difficult optimization task. GA has the ability to optimize such constraint scheduling problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} of whether the burial of polar and nonpolar groups in the protein locale is indeed accompanied by the heat <b>capacity</b> <b>changes,</b> ΔCp, that have an opposite sign, negative for nonpolar groups and positive for polar groups. To accomplish this, we introduced amino acid substitutions at four fully buried positions of the ubiquitin molecule (Val 5, Val 17, Leu 67, and Gln 41). We substituted Val at positions 5 and 17 and Leu at position 67 with a polar residue, Asn. As a control, Ala was introduced at the same three positions. We also replaced the buried polar Gln 41 with Val and Leu, nonpolar residues that have similar size and shape as Gln. As a control, Asn was introduced at Gln 41 as well. The effects of these amino acid substitutions on the stability, and in particular, on the heat <b>capacity</b> <b>change</b> upon unfolding were measured using differential scanning calorimetry. The effect of the amino acid substitutions on the structure was also evaluated by comparing the 1 H- 15 N HSQC spectra of the ubiquitin variants. It was found that the Ala substitutions did not have a considerable effect on the heat <b>capacity</b> <b>change</b> upon unfolding. However, the substitutions of aliphatic side chains (Val or Leu) with a polar residue (Asn) lead to a significant (> 30 %) decrease in the heat <b>capacity</b> <b>change</b> upon unfolding. The decrease in heat <b>capacity</b> <b>changes</b> does not appear to be the result of significant structural perturbations as seen from the HSQC spectra of the variants. The substitution of a buried polar residue (Gln 41) to a nonpolar residue (Leu or Val) leads to a significant (> 25 %) increase in heat <b>capacity</b> <b>change</b> upon unfolding. These results indicate that indeed the heat <b>capacity</b> <b>change</b> of burial of polar and nonpolar groups has an opposite sign. However, the observed changes in ΔCp are several times larger than those predicted, based on the changes in water accessible surface area upon substitution...|$|R
