50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} composites. Its 23.00 ft diameter two-bladed rotor employs an ATI 012 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the blade root, transitioning to an ATI 008 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the tip. The dual controls include <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> mounted from the cockpit ceiling, but are otherwise conventional. The tail rotor is ring-mounted and the horizontal tailplane mounts end-fins for directional stability. A ballistic parachute was a factory option.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} {{collective}} {{pitch of the}} main rotor blades, the entire swashplate must be moved up or down along its axis without changing {{the orientation of the}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls.</b> Conventionally, the entire swashplate is moved along the mainshaft by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire swashplate. This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing.|$|E
50|$|A {{helicopter}} {{has four}} flight control inputs. These are the cyclic, the collective, the anti-torque pedals, and the throttle. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the cyclic stick or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic {{is similar to}} a joystick. However, the Robinson R22 and Robinson R44 have a unique teetering bar <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> system and a few helicopters have a <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> that descends into the cockpit from overhead.|$|R
50|$|This {{condition}} is recognizable when {{coming to a}} hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a nose-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive rearward displacement of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. In this condition, the pilot could rapidly run out of rearward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> as the helicopter consumes fuel. The pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop. In the event of engine failure and the resulting autorotation, the pilot may not have enough <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to flare properly for the landing.|$|R
50|$|In all cases, {{the pilot}} may {{compensate}} the induced roll with {{left or right}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> input (as determined by {{the rotation of the}} rotor) up to a degree. However, the rapid rate of change of blade flex and angle of attack causes uncontrolled longitudinal twist and severe vibration in later stages, resulting in total loss of <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> if left unchecked.|$|R
50|$|Flight {{controls}} allow {{pilots to}} control the collective (or throttle, on fixed pitch helicopters), the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> (pitch and roll), and the tail rotor (yaw). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective pitch control provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).|$|E
50|$|The {{swash plate}} is two {{concentric}} disks or plates. One plate rotates with the mast, connected by idle links, {{while the other}} does not rotate. The rotating plate is also connected to the individual blades through pitch links and pitch horns. The non-rotating plate is connected to links that are manipulated by pilot controlsâ€”specifically, the collective and <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls.</b> The swash plate can shift vertically and tilt. Through shifting and tilting, the non-rotating plate controls the rotating plate, which in turn controls the individual blade pitch.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> {{are used}} to change a helicopter's roll and pitch. Push rods or {{hydraulic}} actuators tilt the outer swashplate {{in response to the}} pilot's commands. The swashplate moves in the intuitively expected direction, tilting forwards to respond to a forward input, for instance. However [...] "pitch links" [...] on the blades transmit the pitch information way ahead of the blade's actual position, giving the blades time to [...] "fly up" [...] or [...] "fly down" [...] to reach the desired position. That is, to tilt the helicopter forward, the difference of lift around the blades should be maximum along the left-right plane, creating a torque that, due to the gyroscopic effect, will tilt the rotor disc forward and not sideways.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 September 2006 a Chief crashed while hovering, {{with minor}} {{injuries}} {{to the pilot}} and passenger. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated, [...] "The amateur built helicopter impacted the ground during a test flight following {{the failure of a}} welded joint at a <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> cable bracket resulting in a loss of control authority. A post impact fire ensued destroying the helicopter. The pilot reported he was in a low hover when the tail came up and the helicopter tilted. One of the skids subsequently caught the ground causing the helicopter to roll over. Examination of the helicopter revealed that a welded joint failed at a <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> cable bracket on the main rotor mast. Failure of the welded bracket caused the loss of input control authority from the <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to the main rotor." ...|$|R
50|$|An aft CG {{condition}} can {{be recognized}} by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control.</b> In this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> already applied, the rotor disc {{might not be able}} to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of large wind turbines on-shore and off-shore, interactions of their wake with helicopters become interesting. In this paper the wake is modeled as a tip vortex helix with a vortex strength estimated from the wind turbine thrust. Helicopter rotors of different size are subjected to the wake and the collective and <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> required to keep the trim are compared to the maximum available controls of the rotorcraft. In addition the blade flapping response due to the vortex influence without pilot action is computed and compared to maximum flapping angles allowed. It is found that typical onshore wind turbines could be a hazard for ultralight helicopters, but not for larger helicopters. Large offshore wind turbines, how-ever, could even be a danger for small helicopters {{that may be used}} for maintenance. In addition the results are compared to fixed-wing wake vortex interaction with a helicopter as given in the literature...|$|E

The nacelle actuator bandwidth required to achieve Level 1 handling qualities in hover and the feasibility of additional longitudinal <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to augment low bandwidth nacelle actuation were investigated. A frequency-domain handling qualities criterion characterizing TRC response in terms of bandwidth and phase delay was proposed and validated against a piloted simulation conducted on the NASA-Ames Vertical Motion Simulator. Seven experimental test pilots completed evaluations in the ADS- 33 E-PRF Hover Mission Task Element (MTE) for a matrix of nacelle actuator bandwidths, equivalent rise times and control response sensitivities, and longitudinal <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> allocations. Evaluated against this task, longitudinal phase delay shows the Level 1 boundary is around 0. 4 0. 5 s.

An analytical model representing rotor flapping and lead-lag degrees of freedom and body pitch, roll, longitudinal and lateral motion is developed.

The influence of various feedback states, feedback gain, and weighting between the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> is studied through stability and response analyses. It is shown that blade cyclic inplane motion, roll rate and roll acceleration feedback can add considerable damping to the system and eliminate ground resonance instabilities, which the feedback phase is also a powerful parameter, if chosen properly, it maximizes augmentation of the inherent regressing lag mode damping. It is shown that rotor configuration parameters, like blade root hinge offset, flapping stiffness, and precone considerably influence the control effectiveness.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate at the Ames Research Center has been {{conducting}} tests on isolated hingeless rotors in hover and forward flight. The primary objective is to generate a database on aeroelastic stability in trimmed flight for torsionally soft rotors at realistic tip speeds. The rotor test model has four soft inplane blades of NACA 0012 airfoil section with low torsional stiffness. The collective pitch and shaft tilt are set prior to each test run, and then the rotor is trimmed in the following sense: the longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch controls are adjusted through a swashplate to minimize the 1 /rev flapping moment at the 12 percent radial station. In hover, the database comprises lag regressive-mode damping with pitch variations. In forward flight the database comprises cyclic pitch controls, root flap moment and lag regressive-mode damping with advance ratio, shaft angle and pitch variations. This report presents the predictions and their correlation with the database. A modal analysis is used, in which nonrotating modes in flap bending, lag bending and torsion are computed from the measured blade mass and stiffness distributions. The airfoil aerodynamics {{is represented by the}} ONERA dynamic stall models of lift, drag and pitching moment, and the wake dynamics is represented by a state-space wake model. The trim analysis of finding, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> and the corresponding, periodic responses is based on periodic shooting with damped Newton iteration; the Floquet transition matrix (FTM) comes out as a byproduct. The stabillty analysis of finding the frequencies and damping levels is based on the eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the FTM. All the structural and aerodynamic states are included from modeling to trim analysis. A major finding is that dynamic wake dramatically improves the correlation for the lateral cyclic pitch control. Overall, the correlation is fairly good...|$|E
40|$|Combustion of {{hydrocarbon}} fuels {{using the}} concept of chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a novel approach projected to have higher energy efficiency than conventional CO 2 capture technologies. For CLC technologies to become commercially relevant, {{it is important to}} optimize the design of CLC reactor systems for high efficiencies for CO 2 capture and power generation. From an engineering point of view, CLC is a complex system with a large number of candidate materials and reactor configurations that need to be considered for process improvement. In this work, a model-based methodology was proposed as a formal framework to guide in developing novel technologies, using CLC as an exemplary case study. This framework deals with the development and validation of process models, optimization of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> strategy for batch systems, and elimination process bottlenecks through the intensification of chemical reactors. As a first step, modelling and simulation was integrated with bench-scale CLC experiments to understand the phenomenological changes inside the CLC reactor and identify sources of model uncertainty. Optimal experimental design techniques were used to determine statistically-rich kinetic networks and parameters, in order to obtain kinetic models that are valid for prediction and extrapolation to large-scale systems. Optimization problems were formulated to maximize the efficiency of the CLC reactors with respect the cycle operation, to seamlessly integrate CLC into advanced power cycles. It was found that the process efficiency of conventional CLC reactor configurations was limited by an upper bound due to restrictions originating from poor gas/solid contact and low bed utilization. To improve upon the existing reactor designs, a novel reverse-flow reactor was proposed as a process intensification option for CLC. From a theoretical analysis, the reverse-flow process is shown to be a potentially disruptive technology, which offers the ability to reach higher plant efficiencies, while minimizing the process footprint. The feasibility of this structured methodology is demonstrated, as a means to enable faster deployment of novel technologies...|$|E

First published July 3, 2012; doi: 10. 1152 /physiolgenomics. 00067. 2012. -The aims {{of this study were}} to 1) identify the earliest transcriptional response of the bovine endometrium to the presence of the conceptus (using RNAseq), 2) investigate if these genes are regulated by interferon tau (IFNT) in vivo, and 3) determine if they are predictive of the pregnancy status of postpartum dairy cows. RNAseq identified 459 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pregnant and cyclic endometria on day 16. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of selected genes revealed PARP 12, ZNFX 1, HERC 6, IFI 16, RNF 213, and DDX 58 expression increased in pregnant compared with cyclic endometria on day 16 and were directly upregulated by intrauterine infusion of IFNT in vivo for 2 h (P < 0. 05). On day 13 following estrous endometrial expression of nine genes increased [ARHGAP 1, MGC 127874, LIMS 2, TBC 1 D 1, FBXL 7, C 25 H 16 orf 71, LOC 507810, ZSWIM 4, and one novel gene (ENSBTAT 00000050193) ] and seven genes decreased (SERBP 1, SRGAP 2, AL 7 A 1, TBK 1, F 2 RL 2, MGC 128929, and WBSCR 17; P < 0. 05) in pregnant compared with cyclic heifers. Of these DEGs, significant differences in expression between pregnant and cyclic endometria were maintained on day 16 for F 2 RL 2, LIMS 2, LOC 507810, MGC 127874, TBC 1 D 1, WBSCR 17, and ZSWIM 4 (P < 0. 05) both their expression was not directly regulated by IFNT in vivo. Analysis of the expression of selected interferon-stimulated genes in blood samples from postpartum dairy cows revealed a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in expression of ZXFX 1, PARP 12, SAMD 9, and HERC 6 on day 18 following artificial insemination in cows subsequently confirmed pregnant compared with <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls.</b> In conclusion, RNAseq identified a number of novel pregnancy-associated genes in the endometrium of cattle during early pregnancy that are not regulated by IFNT in vivo.
