40|$|The {{incidence}} of alcoholism and the {{incidence of}} other neuropsychiatric diagnoses were compared between the 767 house painters and the 1212 house carpenters, born in 1925 or later, {{who were members of}} the Stockholm branches of their respective trade unions in 1965 and who had been members for at least 10 years before 1970. Four different outcome registers were used: (1) the alcohol <b>crime</b> <b>register,</b> which contained all persons who had broken any law regulating the handling and consumption of alcohol (follow up period 1972 - 6). (2) The register of diagnoses at early retirement (follow up period 1971 - 84). (3) The register of diagnoses at discharge from inpatient psychiatric care (follow up period 1968 - 83). (4) The register of causes of death (follow up period 1965 - 86). Exposures to solvents and consumption of alcohol were evaluated by interviews with samples of the cohorts. A high average cumulative exposure to solvents was found among the painters. The mean consumption of alcohol was similar in the two cohorts. The incidence of diagnoses of neuropsychiatric disorders was higher in painters than in carpenters in all registers. Alcoholism was the most common neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosed and showed the highest relative risk. The excess of alcoholism among the painters was, however, due singularly to painters who had several registrations in the alcohol <b>crime</b> <b>register</b> or diagnoses of alcoholism in multiple registers. Thus the study implies that excessive alcohol consumption or severe damage due to alcohol, or both, but not less severe problems, were more common in painters than in carpenters. This suggests an interaction between exposure to solvents and intake of alcohol causing an increase in diagnosis of alcoholism among painters...|$|R

40|$|Count {{data from}} {{registers}} {{are likely to}} exhibit underreporting and thus it is of high relevance to obtain {{an estimate of the}} true number of cases. One approach is to model counts as binomial variables with both parameters unknown. Estimation of the binomial denominator n is known to be problematic even in the simple random sample case, if Їy/s 2 is small. Several methods of stabilization, including a beta-binomial model, have been proposed to circumvent this. We suggest to use a regression model for n in the binomial and the beta-binomial case, and to estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood. Applying the proposed models to real data from the Austrian <b>crime</b> <b>register</b> we obtain estimates of the unknown total number of crimes, the so-called dark figure.

40|$|Underreporting in {{register}} {{systems can be}} analyzed using a binomial approach, where both the size and the probability parameter have to be estimated. Parameter estimation fails when overdispersion is present. Extensions of the binomial model are derived by randomizing the parameters, i. e. considering mixed models. Among these models are the beta-binomial, which results from allowing for a random reporting probability; the negative-binomial, that is the marginal when the size parameter is randomized; and the beta-Poisson model, where both binomial parameters are considered random. The performance of these models is studied in simulation experiments and found to work well, safe for two exceptions. One is the Poisson limit, where the probability parameter approaches zero, {{and the second is}} the perfect system limit, where this probability approaches one.
