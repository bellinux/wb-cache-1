40|$|Many service firms acquire {{customers}} {{by offering}} free-trial promotions. A crucial {{challenge is to}} retain customers acquired with these free trials. To address this challenge, firms {{need to understand how}} free-trial customers differ from regular customers in terms of their decision making to retain the service. This article conceptualizes how a <b>customer’s</b> <b>retention</b> decision is driven by marketing communication and usage behavior, and develops hypotheses about the impact of free-trial acquisition on this process. To test the hypotheses, the authors model a <b>customer’s</b> <b>retention</b> and usage decisions, distinguishing between usage of a flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service. The model allows for unobserved heterogeneity and corrects for selection effects and endogeneity. Based on household panel data from a digital TV service, the authors find systematic behavioral differences which make the average customer lifetime value (CLV) of free-trial customers 59 % lower than that of regular customers. However, free-trial customers are more responsive to marketing communication and usage rates, which offers opportunities to target marketing efforts and enhance retention rates, CLV, and customer equity...|$|R

25|$|Financial {{services}} such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> {{is an essential part}} of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn.|$|E

2500|$|When {{companies}} are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make {{the distinction between}} gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition {{is the loss of}} existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Recurring Monthly Revenue (or RMR). [...] In the 2000s, there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.|$|E
