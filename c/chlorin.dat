25|$|Coordination {{compounds}} have uses in both {{nature and}} in industry. Coordination compounds {{are vital to}} many living organisms. For example, many enzymes are metal complexes, like carboxypeptidase, a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion. This enzyme consists of a zinc ion surrounded by many amino acid residues. Another complex ion enzyme is catalase, which decomposes the cell's waste hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme contains iron-porphyrin complexes, {{similar to those of}} heme in the hemoglobin molecule. Chlorophyll contains a magnesium-porphyrin complexes (<b>chlorin),</b> and vitamin B12 is a complex with cobalt and corrin.|$|E

[...] Coordination compounds are therefore found both in nature and in industry (in, especially, color-rich ways). Some common complex ions include such substances as vitamin B12, the heme group in hemoglobin and the cytochromes, and the <b>chlorin</b> group in chlorophyll (which are dark red or cherry colored, blood red, and green in color respectively), and some dyes and pigments.

40|$|Photosystem II {{reaction}} {{centers have}} been studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.

After excitation of either P 680 or the other <b>chlorins,</b> the excitation energy is observed to equilibrate between the majority of these pigments at a rate of 100 +/- 50 fs- 1. This energy-transfer equilibration takes place before any electron-transfer reactions and must therefore be taken into account in studies of primary electron-transfer reactions in photosystem II.

40|$|Long chain alkenones and {{photosynthetic}} pigment derivatives (<b>chlorins)</b> {{are commonly}} employed biomarkers {{in the reconstruction}} of past sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and organic carbon export from the surface to the deep ocean. For these studies, marine sediment samples are often available which have been air dried or freeze-dried, given that these are common methods for removing water from sediments prior to microfossil analysis. We compared both drying procedures by analysing samples from two sediment cores (ODP 1087, southeast Atlantic and M 36 / 2 -MC 435, North Atlantic). We found that significant losses of <b>chlorins</b> (> 25 %) and alkenones (up to 75 %) occur with air-drying relative to freeze-drying. Changes {{in the composition of}} pigments are also likely. The alkenone unsaturation index View the MathML source is sensitive to the drying method, showing an increase of up to 0. 02 units relative to freeze-drying. However, this represents a maximum increase in SST estimates of only 0. 5 °C. The tests suggest that freeze dried samples, rather than air dried sediments, should preferably be used to determine the sedimentary concentration of biomarkers.

40|$|A {{relatively}} well documented record of intermediate and late chlorophyll diagenesis in marine sediments now exists. Intermediate diagenetic stages include conversion of <b>chlorins</b> to DPEP-series porphyrins and subsequent chelation with nickel, vanadyl, and, in special cases, copper. Increasing thermal stress leads to etio-series generation and transalkylation (Baker, 1969; Baker and Smith, 1975; Baker et al., 1977; Palmer and Baker, in press). In contrast, the early transformations of clorophyll are still largely unknown. Very early diagenetic reactions must certainly include loss of magnesium, deesterification, decarboxylation, reduction of ring-conjugating groups, and finally, oxidative-aromatization of carbons 7 and 8 in ring IV to yield free-base porphyrins (Baker and Smith, 1973; Smith and Baker, 1974). <b>Chlorins</b> (7, 8 -dihydroporphyrins) {{are very difficult}} to isolate and identify, because of hydrocarbon impurities which absorb in the blue to violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum and which co-chromatograph with the pigments.
