40|$|The <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the world’s {{exclusive}} economic zones (EEZs), which collectively harbour {{the vast}} majority of marine-living resources, is the primary responsibility of coastal States. As the effects of failures by coastal States to protect those stocks from the impacts of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may extend beyond domestic boundaries, this paper questions whether and how coastal States may be made accountable in respect of their regulatory deficits. With the proliferation of non-legal conduct rules to guide the regulatory role of States and their agencies, non-judicial mechanisms have the potential to foster coastal State stewardship of domestic fisheries. Outlining a number of international, transnational and domestic approaches, this paper gives consideration to the opportunities and limitations they present in order to strengthen coastal State accountability for IUU fishing control deficits...|$|E
40|$|Overexploitation {{and severe}} {{depletion}} of marine fisheries resources in Southeast Asia {{continue to be}} a source of great concern to many regional fisheries managers. The fact that ASEAN countries bordering these waters are highly depended upon marine fisheries as the main source of revenue, employment, and food security, it is crucial for them to address these fisheries problems. This is especially the case with respect to the management and conservation of commercially important shared pelagic fish stacks, particularly in the South China Sea and Celebes Sea As the spatial migratory range of these stock transcends across many politically draw maritime zones of littoral States, it is highly impossible for one State, acting independently, would be able to manage these fisheries effectively within its own national jurisdiction Perhaps the best approach in dealing with this problem is through collective management and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Hence, this paper examines interstate cooperative arrangement for the management of shared fishery stocks among ASEAN countries. It begins by providing brief definition, biological and migratory profile of transboundary shared stocks. The second part covers existing international legal and policy framework that embraces the principle of interstate cooperation for managing such stocks. Finally, the paper provides recommendations of how ASEAN member States can address the issues and challenges of managing shared fish stocks in a more holistic and coordinated manner within the framework of interstate cooperation...|$|E

40|$|Fish {{captured}} by recreational anglers are often released either voluntarily {{or because of}} harvest regulations in a process called ‘‘catch-and-release’’. Catch-and-release angling {{is thought to be}} beneficial for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{based on the premise that}} most of the fish that are released survive. However, expanding interest in animal welfare has promoted debate regarding the ethics of catch-and-release angling. There is a growing recognition that fish can consciously experience nociception and that they have some capacity to experience pain and fear. Indeed, empirical anatomical, physiological, and behavioural evidence supports the notion that fish could experience these two forms of suffering (i. e., pain and fear). Based on that premise, we examine existing catch-and-release research from a welfare perspective to determine the extent to which potential pain and suffering could be caused. There are numerous studies that provide analyses of the consequences of catch-and-release on the individual demonstrating physical injury, sublethal alterations in behaviour, physiology, or fitness, and mortality. Collectively, this research suggests that all recreational fishing results in some level of injury and stress to an individual fish. However, the severity of injury, magnitude of stress, and potential for mortality varies extensively in response to a variety of factors. Interestingly, this information can be used to identify strategies that anglers may adopt that minimize these effects throug...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{genes and}} gene {{expression}} have been connected to physiological traits linked to effective production and broodstock selection in aquaculture, selective implications of commercial fish harvest, and adaptive changes reflected in non-commercial fish populations subject to human disturbance and climate change. Gene mapping using {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) to identify functional genes, gene expression (analogue microarrays and real-time PCR), and digital sequencing technologies looking at RNA transcripts present new concepts and opportunities in support of effective and sustainable fisheries. Genomic tools have been rapidly growing in aquaculture research addressing aspects of fish health, toxicology, and early development. Genomic technologies linking effects in functional genes involved in growth, maturation and life history development have been tied to selection resulting from harvest practices. Incorporating new and ever-increasing knowledge of fish genomes is opening a different perspective on local adaptation that will prove invaluable in wild fish conservation and management. <b>Conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> is rapidly incorporating research on critical adaptive responses directed at the effects of human disturbance and climate change through gene expression studies. Genomic studies of fish populations can be generally grouped into three broad categories: 1) evolutionary genomics and biodiversity; 2) adaptive physiological responses to a changing environment; and 3) adaptive behavioral genomics and life history diversity. We review current genomic research in fisheries focusing on those that use microarrays to explore differences in gene expression among phenotypes and within or across populations, information that is critically important to the conservation of fish {{and their relationship to}} humans [Current Zoology 56 (1) : 157 – 174, 2010]...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{long-term}} conservation and sustainable use <b>of</b> straddling <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> the 1995 United Nations <b>Fish</b> <b>Stock</b> Agreement {{calls for the}} establishment of regional fisheries management organizations to manage them. This article studies the potential for cooperation in straddling stock fisheries when the cooperative coalition of countries acts as a Stackelberg leader against the remaining singleton countries. Within the Stackelberg fishing game with several interested parties, the result shows that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state <b>fish</b> <b>stock,</b> but also in the total rent of the fishery. Further, the outlook for cooperation is better within the Stackelberg game, where the cooperative coalition acts as a leader, than in the Cournot game. At the stable equilibrium of a Stackelberg game, not only is the steady-state <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> higher, but also the total resource rent, participantsâ€™ rent, and non-participantsâ€™ rent are higher than those of the Cournot-Nash stable equilibrium. The new-entrant issue is a problem for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> in the Stackelberg game. Self-financed transfers with commitments of the initial stable coalition will increase the level of cooperation.

40|$|Fishing {{has a great}} {{importance}} to the socioeconomic development of the Amazonian riparian communities, which have a local knowledge on the environment, its fauna and flora. This knowledge {{is of paramount importance}} for the management and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> and species that interact with the fishing activity, such as the populations of gray porpoises (Sotalia sp.) and pink porpoises (Inia geoffrensis). Therefore, to register local ecological knowledge and the interaction of porpoises with fishing on the coast of the state of Para, Brazil, 82 semi-structured interviews were carried out in 3 different colonies of fishermen: colony Z- 1 (Soure), colony Z- 7 (Maracana), and colony Z- 23 (Colares). The species Sotalia sp. had a strong social structure, it can be observed in the region both during the dry and rainy seasons, while the species I. geoffrensis didn’t present a social structure, it’s observed in the region especially during the rainy season. The pink porpoise showed a larger interaction with fishing than the gray porpoise, however, this interaction was particularly detrimental to the activity, while the gray porpoise showed both a beneficial and a harmful interaction with fishing. The incidental capture of porpoises primarily occurred through nets and trawls, harming their populations. Captured animals were mostly released, however, there were records of consumption for food, use as bait, and selling of the animal’s eyes. This information will constitute the basis for further studies on the biology, ecology, and estimate of the mortality of porpoises on the Amazon coast.

Genetic {{homogeneity}} among {{breeding grounds}} and nursery areas of an exploited Lake Malawi cichlid fish. Freshwater Biology, 53 (9), 1823 - 1831. 1. Nursery areas are commonly recognized as important habitats {{for the management}} and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Here we report the use of nursery areas by an exploited offshore cichlid in Lake Malawi, Rhamphochromis longiceps. 2. Like all haplochromine cichlids that have been studied, the species is a maternal mouthbrooder that broods eggs for several weeks following spawning. We found evidence that during this brooding period females migrate from open water to release juveniles in three shallow peripheral waterbodies (Chia Lagoon, Unaka Lagoon, Lake Malombe). However, {{it was unclear whether}} there is geographical population structuring within the species, which could indicate stock differences in their use of these nursery habitats, or if the lake contains a genetically panmictic population that employs nursery habitats opportunistically. 3. To investigate spatial and temporal population structuring within the lake we genotyped populations at seven microsatellite DNA loci. Overall, we found no significant spatial structuring among juveniles from the peripheral lagoons or among breeding males within the main lake body. Moreover, we found no evidence of temporal structuring among males on the breeding grounds within Lake Malawi or females entering Chia lagoon. Together, these results suggest that Lake Malawi contains a genetically homogeneous population of R. longiceps. 4. At present we know little of the distribution of juvenile R. longiceps elsewhere in the Lake Malawi basin, but their absence from surveyed rocky and sandy littoral habitats makes it possible that the species is dependent upon a small number of nearshore nursery areas, including these lagoons. As such, conservation of lagoon habitats and monitoring of exploited fish stocks within them may be important for effective preservation of biodiversity within the catchment. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The Canal da Piracema is {{the longest}} (nearly 10 km) fish pass system in the world. The {{construction}} of this fish pass was somehow controversial, because it connected two distinct ichthyofaunistic provinces. This study evaluated the ichthyofauna present in the Canal da Piracema and the abundance and distribution of long-distance migratory fish species along this fish pass system (evaluated possible selectivity). The Canal da Piracema was shown {{to be difficult to}} sample because of its environmental heterogeneity: artificial ponds, ladders and nature-like fish pass. To solve this problem, we used several fishing gears, adequate for the several biotopes present (unstructured and structured littoral were sampled with seining nets and electrofishing; lentic were sampled with gillnets and longlines (deeper areas); and rapid water areas were sampled with cast nets). The ichthyofauna of the Canal da Piracema followed the pattern for South America and the Paraná River, with a predominance of Characiformes and Siluriformes. The most representative families were Characidae, Anostomidae, Pimelodidae and Loricariidae. We captured 116 species (17 were long-distance migratory) during the period studied. Small-sized species were predominant in unstructured and structured littoral areas, especially Bryconamericus exodon and Apareiodon affinis. The most abundant species was Hypostomus spp. in lentic areas, followed by Iheringichthys labrosus. Hoplias aff. malabaricus predominated in deeper lentic areas. Long-distance migratory species were abundant in rapid waters; they were Prochilodus lineatus and Leporinus elongatus. The sharp {{reduction in the number of}} species, including migratory ones, is an indication that the Canal da Piracema is selecting the species that ascend it. Therefore, the search for information on the efficiency of the various fish passes present in the Canal da Piracema is fundamental, to facilitate upward movements of fish.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in contemporary global environmental governance is the future of marine biodiversity. Over the years, increased fishing efforts in previously remote areas drove many fish stocks to scarcity. The Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) emerged to solve the international fishery crisis, on the assumption that they would provide a forum where Member States may agree and discuss binding rules for the conservation and management of fish stocks within its geographical area of responsibility. Although some agreements existed for more than 60 years, many authors agree that they have not been fully effective in promoting the maintenance and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> There are many reasons that might explain the lack of effectiveness, one of them being that science is not very often listened to in the political decision-making process. In this research, the influence of knowledge and science in shaping policy decisions will be observed and analyzed. Therefore, the use of the epistemic communities theory, that which forms part of the constructivist turn in international relations [...] was used to answer the main question posed here: when does power listen to science? When it does, does it bring more effectiveness in terms of knowledge, input from epistemic communities, does it induce states to change their behavior, and do these influences lead to policies, which can credibly improve biomass? Using process tracing, through elite interviews, and with a systematic compilation and study of meeting reports from three RFMOs: the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR); the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the final conclusion is that they may listen to science, but their strategy, allies, {{and the ways in which}} it occurs differ case-by-case. Um dos maiores desafios na governança ambiental global contemporânea é o futuro dos ecossistemas e da biodiversidade marinha. Ao longo dos anos, o aumento do esforço de pesca nas áreas anteriormente remotas levou muitas populações de peixes à escassez. As Organizações Regionais para o Ordenamento Pesqueiro (OROPs) surgiram para resolver a crise internacional de pesca, através um fórum onde os Estados-Membros podem acordar e discutir regras vinculativas para a conservação e gestão dos recursos pesqueiros no âmbito da sua área geográfica de responsabilidade. Embora alguns acordos existam há mais de 60 anos, muitos pesquisadores concordam que os mesmos não têm sido totalmente eficazes para promover a manutenção e conservação dos recursos pesqueiros. Muitas razões podem explicar a falta de eficiência no manejo, uma delas é que, o aconselhamento cientifico não é muitas vezes considerado nas decisões políticas. Nesta pesquisa, a influência do conhecimento e da ciência na tomada de decisões políticas serão avaliadas. Para isso, a teoria das comunidades epistêmicas, que faz parte da veia construtivista em Relações Internacionais, foi usada para responder à principal questão colocada aqui: quando é que o poder ouviu a ciência?

40|$|The {{sex ratio}} in the catches of megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, Walbaum) varied {{systematically}} with depth on three independent trawl survey series off {{the west coast}} of Ireland. Female megrim dominated the shallow catches, while males were more common in catches from deeper waters. The size difference between the sexes alone cannot explain this pattern because it remained evident when fish length was taken into account. Therefore size-specific habitat preferences or size-selective fishing mortality cannot fully explain the observed trend in the sex ratio of megrim. Female megrim grow to a larger size, at a faster rate than males and it is likely that their differences in habitat preferences are related to this. Shallower waters are warmer during the growing season and are likely to provide better conditions for fast growth.

The lessons were extensively used for the elaboration of a strategy and a programme, which will seek to consolidate gains in and expansion of community based management linked to institutional and legal reform and a recognition and strengthening of the roles of civil society and the private sector. The Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock adopted the National Fisheries Strategy in January 2006. It had been developed by the Department of Fisheries {{over an extended period}} through a consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders. The strategy sets out to guide the implementation of the National Fisheries Policy, the PRSP and the Road Map for PRSP. The strategy covers eight areas (ôsub-strategiesÃ¶); inland capture fisheries, marine capture fisheries, aquaculture, aquaculture extension, shrimp culture, quality control, human resources development, and monitoring and evaluation. The strategy has a pro-poor focus and guiding principles are peopleÃ†s participation for community based resource management, decentralization of planning and decision making, <b>conservation</b> and enhancement <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> protection against habitat destruction, pollution, and degradation of bio-diversity. The strategy emphasizes the need for reform of access rights (lease systems) and institutional development for decentralization and effective public sector service delivery.

40|$|Effective <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> marine <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{involves}} {{understanding the}} impact, on population dynamics, of intra-specific variation in nursery habitats {{use at the}} juvenile stage. In some regions, {{an important part of}} the catching effort is concentrated on a small number of marine species that colonize coastal lagoons during their first year of life. To determine the intra-specific variation in lagoon use by these fish and their potential demographic consequences, we studied diet spatiotemporal variations in the group 0 juveniles of a highly exploited sparid, the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L), during their similar to 6 months stay in a NW Mediterranean lagoon (N = 331, SL = 25 - 198 mm) and traced the origin of the organic matter in their food webs, at two lagoon sites with contrasted continental inputs. This showed that the origin (marine, lagoonal or continental) of the organic matter (OM) available in the water column and the sediment can vary substantially within the same lagoon, in line with local variations in the intensity of marine and continental inputs. The high trophic plasticity of S. aurata allows its juveniles to adapt to resulting differences in prey abundances at each site during their lagoon residency, thereby sustaining high growth irrespective of the area inhabited within the lagoon. However, continental POM incorporation by the juveniles through their diet (of 21 - 37 % on average depending on the site) is proportional to its availability in the environment and could be responsible for the greater <b>fish</b> sizes (<b>of</b> 28 mm SL on average) and body weights (of 40. 8 g on average) observed at the site under continental influence in the autumn, when the juveniles are ready to leave the lagoon. This suggests that continental inputs in particulate OM, when present, could significantly enhance fish growth within coastal lagoons, with important consequences on the local population dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> species that use them as nurseries. As our results indicate that continental OM can represent up to 62 % of the flesh of the juveniles originating from these ecosystems, particular care should be taken to preserve or improve the chemical quality of riverine inputs to coastal lagoons...|$|R
40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} <b>conservation</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing <b>of</b> netting for <b>fishing</b> nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R
