2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} the main {{industry}} in Cordova. Half of all households in Cordova {{have at least one}} person involved in commercial fishing or processing. The fishing fleet mainly fishes the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. There are various fisheries in the area, the most economically important of which is the salmon fishery. All Pacific salmon species except for the <b>cherry</b> <b>salmon</b> are caught. Fishermen use either a purse seine, drift gillnet, or set gillnet to catch the fish. All fisheries are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The fisheries in Alaska have a limited entry permit system. The first fish processing plant near Cordova opened in 1887. In 2009 there were 159 purse seine, 511 drift gilnet, and 27 set gillnet permits fished in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. Wild fish stocks are augmented by hatcheries where fish are produced and released as fingerlings into rivers. [...] Eventually they migrate to the ocean where they grow to breeding age and then return as adults to be caught by the fishermen or to spawn.|$|E

The {{study was conducted to}} evaluate nutritionally fertigated gerbera plants with increasing levels of electrical conductivity (EC), using portable meters nitrate and potassium, and chlorophyll. For this, two experiments were conducted. A randomized block design with five levels of EC (0. 5, 2. 0, 3. 5, 5. 0 and 6. 5 dS m- 1) and four replications was used. Cherry cultivar was used in the first experiment. In the second experiment, two cultivars (<b>Cherry</b> and <b>Salmon</b> Rose) were used. In the first experiment, the sap of the leaves was subjected to rapid testing of N-NO 3 - (equipment Cardy Horiba C - 141). N-NO 3 - and K+ (C- 131) were determined in the substrate solution. The intensity of the green leaf, in the second experiment was evaluated with portable Chlorophyll Meter. The N content in the indicator leaf in the first and N and K contents in the plant in the second experiment were determined. Rapid tests are presented as good indicators of the level of N-NO 3 - and K+ in plant tissue, with the advantages of convenience and speed of determination, facilitating monitoring of fertilization of the substrate by producers and technicians...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality and}} the {{profitability}} on floriculture are intimately linked to the adequate plant nutrition. In the present research we aimed to evaluate the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the substrate solution on four different gerbera cultivars subjected to fertigation, with two nutritive solutions. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a greenhouse, from May to July 2006, on the Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, São Paulo state, Brazil. The experiment was carried out under an experimental design of random blocks, in 4 × 2 factorial arrangement, with four Gerbera cultivars (<b>Cherry,</b> Golden Yellow, <b>Salmon</b> Rose and Orange) and two nutritive solution concentrations: 0. 92 and 1. 76 dS m- 1 EC) during the vegetative stage, and 1. 07 and 2. 04 dS m- 1 during the reproductive stage (S 1 and S 2, respectively). The nutrients were applied through fertigation, manually performed every day. The EC and pH values of the substrate solution were evaluated weekly, using the 'pourthru' method. Orange and Cherry cultivars had, respectively, the highest and the lowest electrical conductivity of the substrate solution, and Cherry was the most efficient on the nutrient uptake. The solution S 2 showed a trend to accumulate salts in the substrate, but without visual symptoms of plant toxicity, leading to the lowest pH values. The 'pourthru' method was efficient when compared to the 1 : 2 method and can be adopted for substrate solution analysis in gerbera culture...|$|R

5000|$|Oncorhynchus masou, {{known as}} the masu salmon, masu, or the <b>cherry</b> <b>salmon,</b> is a species of salmon found in the Western Pacific Ocean along East Asia, ranging from the Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, and Primorsky Krai south through Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. A number of {{subspecies}} are known, including the anadromous, widespread masu Oncorhynchus masou masou (e.g. in Korea, Japan), the critically endangered, landlocked Taiwanese or Formosan salmon Oncorhynchus masou formosanus found in certain freshwater systems of Taiwan, the Biwa trout endemic of Lake Biwa, and the anadromous or stream-dwelling amago Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus restricted to western Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Varying {{scientific}} nomenclature {{has been}} used of {{the various forms of}} <b>cherry</b> <b>salmon.</b> The vermilion-spotted amago has been referred to alternatively as O. m. ishikawae Jordan & McGregor, 1925, in Japanese media.

50|$|A {{vascular}} anomaly {{is a kind}} of birthmark {{caused by}} a disorder of the vascular development, although it is not always present at birth. A vascular anomaly is a localized defect in blood vessels that can affect each part of the vasculature (capillaries, arteries, veins, lymphatics or a combination of these). These defects are characterized by an increased number of vessels and vessels that are both enlarged and sinuous. Some vascular anomalies are congenital and therefore present at birth, others appear within weeks to years after birth and others are acquired by trauma or during pregnancy. Inherited vascular anomalies are also described and often present with a number of lesions that increase with patients’ age. Vascular anomalies can also {{be a part of a}} syndrome and, occasionally, they can be acquired by trauma. The estimated prevalence of vascular anomalies is 4.5%. Vascular anomalies can occur throughout the whole body (skin, bone, liver, intestines, i.e.), but in 60% of patients vascular anomalies are localized in the head and neck region.Vascular anomalies can present in various ways. Vascular anomalies that are situated deep below the skin, appear blue and are often called cavernous. Superficial vascular anomalies appear as red-coloured stains and are associated with vascular anomalies affecting the dermis. Historically, vascular anomalies have been labeled with descriptive terms, according to the food they resembled (port wine, strawberry, <b>cherry,</b> <b>salmon</b> patch). This imprecise terminology has caused diagnostic confusion, blocked communication and even caused incorrect treatment, as it does not differentiate between various vascular anomalies. However, in 1982, Mulliken introduced a classification that replaced these descriptive terms and gave direction to the management of various vascular anomalies. This classification, based on clinical features, natural history and cellular characteristics, divides vascular anomalies into two groups: vascular tumors and vascular malformations.Although the appearance of both vascular tumors and vascular malformations can resemble, there are important differences between both.|$|E
