5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigation, metal fatigue was ultimately {{blamed for the}} failure of the number five <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> in the number two Rolls-Royce 508 Conway turbofan engine, starting the rapid chain of failures. [...] The crew's omitting to shut off the fuel to the engine was blamed for the rapid growth of the fire and the loss of the aircraft. Check Captain Moss had accidentally cancelled the fire warning bell instead of the undercarriage warning bell. Moss had also issued orders to Captain Taylor, in breach of the normal protocol for his duties. However, the report on the accident also stated that Captain Taylor had briefed Moss to act as an extra set of eyes and ears inside and outside the cockpit. Moss's actions therefore could be seen as acting within that remit. Although Moss had alerted the crew to the fire, none of them were aware that the number 2 engine had fallen off until after the evacuation on the ground.|$|E

The net result is an improvement in engine fuel economy. The electric turbocompound system provides added control flexibility because it is capable of varying the amount of power extracted from the exhaust gases, thus allowing for control of engine boost.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{generation of}} relatively {{large quantities of}} electrical energy in vehicles is becoming an increasingly important issue, {{as a result of}} increasing demands of ancillary equipment and the emergence of hybrid power-train vehicles. An attractive solution to meeting these demands is to extract the electrical energy by means of a generator driven by a high-speed exhaust mounted turbine, a technology that is beginning to emerge commercially. This thesis is concerned with the design of a system, which extends this concept to enable both electrical generation and highly flexible air-management. The heart of the system is a high-speed switched reluctance machine, the rotor of which is located on a common shaft with the turbine and <b>compressor</b> <b>wheels</b> of a standard commercial turbocharger. The design synthesis of a -switched reluctance machine capable of meeting the required performance specification is particularly onerous given the harsh environment in which it operates, specifically in terms of the restricted space envelope, the high ambient temperature and the very high rotational speeds. This thesis describes the design of a switched reluctance machine for a prototype system, a procedure that encompasses the detailed analysis of centrifugal stress in the rotor, aerodynamic losses, iron loss, rotordynainic performance and dynamic performance. The design and analysis of the system is supported by experimental evaluation at both component and system level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{titanium}} alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is used very often for highly stressed components like <b>compressor</b> <b>wheels</b> {{because of its}} excellent mechanical and thermal properties. However, when machining components made of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, their high tensile strength in combination with a low Young's modulus and a low thermal conductivity leads to high thermal and mechanical stresses in the cutting tools, which in turn lead to a particularly fast tool wear. Thus, optimization of the manufacturing process is required. However, to obtain this goal the mechanisms of tool wear were studied numerically and some results are presented in this article. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V forms segmented chips for {{the whole range of}} cutting velocities. The mechanical and thermal load variations due to the segmentation are taken into consideration during these investigations. A FEM model using a self-developed continuous remeshing method to form segmented chips was developed. Thus resulting state variables like stresses, temperatures and relative velocities between the tool face and the chip along the cutting tool can be investigated, which are well known for influencing tool wear in machining. The distributions of these state variables along the cutting tool, especially {{in the area of the}} cutting edge, are analyzed and related to experimentally caused tool wear. In order to evaluate the developed simulation model, orthogonal cutting experiments have been conducted with uncoated carbide (WC/Co) cutting tools. Simulated results are compared with experimentally obtained data for different process parameters...|$|R

50|$|The {{turbocharger}} {{is basically}} a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which {{is driven by the}} piston engine's exhaust gas. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a centrifugal <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a wastegate or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing's geometry (as in a VGT turbocharger).It mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine boost.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being called}} twins, the B4's {{turbocharger}}s are not identical. The primary turbocharger is an IHI VF33 unit, {{which uses a}} 46.5 / 35.4 mm 9-blade turbine wheel and a 47.0 mm / 35.4 mm 6 + 6 blade compressor. At idle, the turbo spins at around 20,000 rpm and it can go on to a maximum speed of 190,000 rpm. It has a 17 mm diameter wastegate opening to bypass excess exhaust gas. The secondary turbocharger is an IHI VF32. On the exhaust side it uses a 46.5 / 35.4 mm 9-blade turbine wheel, teamed with a 52.5 / 36.6 mm 10-blade <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel.</b> It's rated at 180,000 rpm. Both the primary and secondary turbochargers use a floating metal centre bearing - not ball bearings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Turbochargers {{have become}} common in {{passenger}} cars {{as well as}} commercial vehicles. They have an excellent mechanism to effectively increase fuel efficiency and engine power, but they unfortunately cause several noise problems. Its noise are mainly classified as structure-borne noises, generated from the vibration of rotating shaft modules (cartridges), and air-borne noises, from air flow inside turbochargers or their coupling ducts. In this study an attempt to reduce the pulsation noise generated from the <b>compressor</b> <b>wheels,</b> whose frequency {{is the same as}} the whine noise is presented. This attempt is based on using the compact high frequency side branch resonators to develop low intake noise system. The design of such system, which is mainly based on the developed 1 D linear acoustic theory and theoretical investigations to use more than one resonator connected to the main duct in series and/or in parallel are introduced. An optimization strategy to choose the appropriate resonator axis offset is presented. In case of complex unsymmetrical geometry in real resonators, a 3 D finite element is used. The presented models are validated via comparison with the measured results at room temperatures. The validated models are used to improve the acoustic performance of the real resonators. Based on the developed models and the optimization results, the internal design of resonators improves its acoustic performance; the serial arrangements increase the damping at the same peak frequency while the parallel arrangements make it wider. The amount of extra damping added to the intake system depends on the resonators geometry and their axis offset which can be around 50 dB a...|$|R

5000|$|Blowoff valves {{are used}} to prevent {{compressor}} surge, a phenomenon that readily occurs when lifting off the throttle of an unvented, turbocharged engine. The sound produced is called turbo flutter ( [...] the slang term ' choo-choo' is sometimes used [...] ). When the throttle plate on a turbocharged engine closes, the high pressure air in the intake system is trapped by the throttle and a pressure wave is forced back into the compressor. The <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> slows rapidly and can sometimes stall, and the driver will notice a fluttering air sound. The effect is similar to how planes' wings stall if not enough air is flowing past them. The rapid slowing or stalling stresses the turbo compressor and can impart severe turbo lag depending on how fast the driver accelerates immediately after the surge event and how much psi the turbocharger is set up for.|$|E

50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{relies on}} the volume and velocity of exhaust gases to spin (spool) the turbine wheel, which {{is connected to the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> via a common shaft. The boost pressure made can be regulated by a system of release valves and electronic controllers. The chief benefit of a turbocharger is that it consumes less power from the engine than a supercharger; the main drawback is that engine response suffers greatly because it takes time for the turbocharger to come up to speed (spool up). This delay in power delivery is referred to as turbo lag. Any given turbo design is inherently one of compromise; a smaller turbo will spool quickly and deliver full boost pressure at low engine speeds, but boost pressure will suffer at high engine RPM. A larger turbo, on the other hand, will provide improved high-rev performance at the expense of low-end response. Other common design issues include limited turbine lifespan, due to the high exhaust temperatures it must withstand, and the restrictive effect the turbine has upon exhaust flow.|$|E

50|$|As the {{successor}} of the BMW N55 engine, the B58 also displaces 3.0 litre (though is slightly larger at 2998cc compared to 2979cc for the N55). It has a larger turbocharger with a 6 {{percent increase in}} turbine wheel size and 10 percent increase in <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter, resulting in a 20 percent increase in boost pressure. The B58 uses a water-to-air intercooler integrated into the intake plenum, thus reducing the charged air volume between the compressor and the intake. This increases performance by maintaining more even temperatures inside the intake. BMW has also incorporated an engine-mounted encapsulation system, which allows the engine to retain much of its heat for up to 36 hours which helps to reduce emissions and wear and tear during start-up, especially in colder climates.As a part of BMW's new modular engine family, the crankcase is a completely new design identically with the B57 diesel version, engineered as both a gasoline and diesel engine in one common part. The closed deck crankcase {{is equipped with a}} completely new structure which can be identified by a complex array of ribs on the exhaust and intake side and an additional reinforcement frame on the oil pump side.|$|E
50|$|In May 1998 a NEO {{head was}} fitted, which enabled {{the engine to}} be {{classified}} as a low emission vehicle (LEV) engine due to their lower fuel consumption and emission output. The NEO head featured solid lifters rather than hydraulic, revised camshafts, with on/off solenoid Variable VCT, used a hotter 82 Â°C thermostat, model-specific coil packs and a revised inlet manifold (the runner diameter is reduced from 50mm to 45mm to increase air velocity and low end torque) in particular the RB25DE NEO which had two inlets going into the inlet manifold. The combustion chamber of the head is smaller so GT-R spec connecting rods are used to compensate as well as model-specific pistons. The turbo received the larger OP6 turbine which some came with steel compressor and turbine wheels, where others had the nylon plastic <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> and ceramic turbine wheel. Some also used an N1 type oil pump and had the oil pump drive collar on the crank revised to help cope with the breakage problems associated with fast, high revs.All in all they are quite a different engine {{in their own right}} - a culmination of 20 years of Nissan RB engine building rolled into one.|$|E

From 1995,(Series 2 Engines) both the RB25DE and RB25DET had a revised electrical system and the turbocharger on the RB25DET(S2) had a ceramic <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rather than aluminium. The most obvious change to the system was the introduction of ignition coils with built in ignitors, therefore the coil ignitor that was on previous models was not used. Other changes were, different air flow meter, engine ECU, cam angle sensor and throttle position sensor. Mechanically Series 1 and Series 2 are very similar, the only mechanical difference would be the camshafts as the Series 2 Cam Angle Sensor's shaft {{that goes into the}} exhaust cam is slightly different.
