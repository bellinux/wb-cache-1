In addition to gas {{flow metering}}, the RTU also provides some local, self-contained, site control such as well shut-in in the event of abnormal gas flow conditions. However the bulk of the RTU's function is to provide the host with site specific data which includes the above-mentioned gas flow metering data, plus process related data including pipeline and/or well pressure, condensate tank levels etc.|$|E

40|$|A classic {{method of}} {{measuring}} energy delivered {{is to use}} an Orifice meter run and a <b>circular</b> <b>chart</b> recorder to obtain an integrated value for the flow. This flow measurement is combined with an average caloric value to obtain energy delivered. This method can be based when changes in the calorific value correlate with changes in the flow. This classic method is next compared with two newer methods of measuring energy delivered. The first method uses a flow computer which has as inputs the pressure, temperature, and pressure differential from an Orifice meter. This method also uses continuous measurements of relative density and calorific value. The output from the flowcomputer is the instantaneous energy flow. The second method uses a new energy flowmeter that is under development. It directly measures energy flow without measuring either calorific value or volumetric flow. ...|$|E

Of {{particular interest to}} her recently has been the mathematics of mechanical devices such as astrolabes and planimeters, which are also great fun to collect. When not doing math, she enjoys cycling and sewing stuffed dragons for her daughter. A classic example of Green’s theorem in action is the planimeter, a device that measures the area enclosed by a curve. Most familiar may be the polar planimeter (see Figure 1), for which a nice geometrical explanation {{can be found in}} the book by Jennings [4] and a direct constructive proof using Green’s theorem is given by Gatterdam [2]. Other types include the rolling planimeter, which is particularly suited to a vector calculus course for both ease of use and simplicity of proof, and radial planimeters that integrate functions plotted on circular charts (that is, the function is in polar form, r = f(θ)). In this article, we present simple proofs using Green’s theorem for the rolling and polar planimeters, followed by an analysis of how to design radial planimeters that calculate a desired integral, such as that of the square root of a function marked on a <b>circular</b> <b>chart.</b> These proofs are suitable for use in a vector calculus course and avoid the awkward trigonometric and algebraic calculations required by proofs like that in [2]. While the proofs in this article are probably not new (though the author has not seen them elsewhere), they are not readily available, and so these planimeter proofs are presented with the aim of providing calculus instructors a wonderful supplement for their courses. Other planimeter proofs can be found on the web. For example, see [6] for a geometric analysis and [5] for a vector analysis of the polar planimeter, and see [1] for an explanation of the radial planimeter. Both rolling and polar planimeters are available in mechanical and electronic versions for commercial use (a quick web search will reveal several manufacturers). For classroo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new system}} that analyses tachograph <b>charts.</b> These <b>circular</b> <b>charts</b> are legal records {{of information on the}} different types of driver activity (driving, other duty, standby and rest) and vehicle data (speed and distance travelled). As each driver of each passenger and goods vehicle over a certain capacity must use a chart for every 24 -hour period, there is a significant need for automated analysis (currently, tachograph charts are analysed manually). The system starts by determining the shape parameters of the chart (location of the centre and radius). The position of the start of the 24 -hour period (radius from centre to 24 hour tick mark) is then estimated. Finally the driver activity trace (recorded in a circular manner) is extracted, converted into a linear representation and recognised. Results from the evaluation of the system against professionally prepared ground truth indicate at least 94 % accuracy in reading the driving time even on difficult (with scratches and marks) charts. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{speaks to}} a common problem {{in a lot of}} {{industrial}} and institutional boilerhouses. Most boilerhouses do an excellent job at collecting information. <b>Circular</b> <b>chart</b> recorders churn out pressures, temperatures, and flows for everything from steam to natural gas to city water consumption. If your facility is like most, this stuff all gets chucked into a drawer or file cabinet daily. Have you ever wondered why you collect and record what you do? What were people thinking when the existing logs were set up? This paper attempts to challenge the original thought process and hopes to evoke in you and your staff a renewed vision of what should be collected, how, and then what can be done with it. It seems that most "good old days" data collection efforts were centered around identifying equipment operability and reliability problems. If a line suddenly jumped off the chart, hopefully someone would notice and react in just the right way to keep the plant operating. However, 99 % of the time when things change slightly over days or when things seem normal, no one gets excited about anything. This is because action points or things to care about (TCA's) for energy savings are few and far between. This paper hopes to help you define lots of energy cost-related TCA's. This is all about data mining. It's all about finding gold buried in what you thought was waste. This paper can't give you specifics. It can however point you to appropriate TCA concepts. TCA's must be individually tailored to a particular boilerhouse's equipment, people, needs, utility costs, maintenance patterns, {{and a number of other}} critical factors. The goal of this paper is not to define new and expensive data acquisition or control system projects, It is instead to show you how to develop systems that only require paper, pencils, and people who are motivated and care. These people are probably already being paid by you to do most of this work. Our experience is that if these people are treated with respect and given some simple tools they will do amazing things beyond what you thought was possible. This is a low tech humanistic approach that has a fabulous rate of return. It's also something that can be immediately implemented...|$|E
40|$|Custody {{transfer}} of gaseous fuels are normally based on energy delivered to large customers. Since energy transfer cannot be measured directly, other measurements are normally {{used to make}} this calculation. One classical technique to quantify the energy flow is to measure the volumetric flow rate and multiply by suitably determined heating value of the gas. If orifice meters are used to determine volumetric flow rate, the output is often on <b>circular</b> <b>charts</b> which must be integrated. Another technique is to supply pressure, temperature, relative density and flow meter output (differential pressure for an orifice meter) and heating value measurements continuously to a flow computer. The computer then provides the instantaneous and integrated energy flow. The Gas Research Institute (GRI) has funded {{development of a new}} device which measures energy flow rates directly. This paper describes the development and testing of this new device and compares its performance with the above mentioned techniques. ...|$|R

The star chart contains the brightest stars, constellations and (possibly) deep-sky objects visible from a particular latitude on Earth. The night sky that one sees from the Earth depends on whether the observer is in the northern or southern hemispheres and the latitude. A planisphere window is designed for a particular latitude and will be accurate enough for a certain band either side of that. Planisphere makers will usually offer them in a number of versions for different latitudes. Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer's latitude; stars below the horizon are not included.|$|R

The fragile Himalayan terrain often faces significant problems of geoenvironmental imbalance due to landslides. A major landslide occurred in 1986 near Harmony village on left bank of Pinder River, along Karnaprayag- Gwaldam road in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand state. The Harmony landslide caused traffic blockade and consequent economic and environmental losses. Moreover, this slide was reactivated almost every year causing disruption of traffic along this important hill route, which is the only hill route, connecting Garhwal and Kumaun physiographic divisions of the state in upper hills. In view of importance of this landslide, detailed Engineering Geological investigations were carried out incorporating relevant Geotechnical parameters. The entire landslide area had been mapped on 1 : 1000 scale and three Geological sections were prepared. The shear strength parameters were obtained with the help of in-situ samples collected from the site.

40|$|To {{comply with}} {{insolation}} requirements of some countries, recommendations {{have been made}} on several graphical methods for estimating {{the shadow of a}} building or its features cast by sunlight on other features or buildings on the drawing paper. These methods use a series of graphs for estimating the solar shadow. To many architects, these methods are not easy to apprehend and are time-consuming for implementation. Furthermore, many projection lines will have to be drawn on the drawing paper, causing likely confusion and difficulty in identifying each line. There is now software developed for architects and students to help them design for sunlight impinging onto and into buildings. In the learning process of a person, however, physical tools do maintain their contribution, and complement learning with the computer software. Also in the hand sketch design process of an architect, a simple physical tool speeds up his understanding of sunlight directions and helps him compare quickly options of solar design. In pursuing this complementing contribution of the physical tools, a physical plotter has been invented. This tool comprises a <b>circular</b> solar <b>chart</b> of a selected latitude, a rotatable annular angular scale of glass orientation, and a rotatable instantaneous sunlight path line, all inscribed on thin transparent plastic plates. It enables an efficient plotting of sunlight penetration into buildings, and the shadow of an object, such as the corner of a house, cast by sunlight on the ground, with minimum calculations to be made and lines to be drawn.
