40|$|Abstract The {{use of a}} gouging {{abrasion}} test to evaluate the wear of jaw crushers is revised {{in terms of its}} procedures, considering the effects of the most significant variables, such as the minimum amount of crushed material and the minimum opening between the jaws during the <b>crushing</b> <b>cycle</b> (minimum discharge aperture). A correlation between the work hardening of jaws and the amount of crushed material is presented. The wear of stationary and movable jaws is compared, being the results dependent on the jaw's material and the discharge aperture. The abrasiveness of several rocks was evaluated, showing a good correlation with their Mohs hardness...|$|E
40|$|Thin walled {{tubes are}} often used as impact {{absorbing}} elements in automobiles and other transport vehicles. Round cylindrical and conical shells made of composite material prove to be popular energy absorber as they provide reasonably constant operating force, which is the primary characteristics of an ideal absorber. Based on experimental observations, a theoretical procedure is established to predict the post collapse load-compression characteristics of the composite shells. Analytical expressions were obtained to predict the average crush load and the crush length in a <b>crush</b> <b>cycle</b> for the composite conical shells {{as well as for}} the cylindrical tubes. The results so obtained were compared with the experimental values available from the literature...|$|R
50|$|In {{this test}} the four {{scavengers}} entered the waste crusher inside {{which was a}} large amount of debris typically to waist height, and a full complement of ten fuel rods. Scavengers had four minutes to retrieve these before the <b>crusher</b> completed its <b>cycle</b> and killed them.|$|R
25|$|During {{the ensuing}} ice ages a lobe of glacial ice, the Superior lobe, moved into Minnesota through the agate-filled Superior trough. The glacier picked up surface agates and transported them south. Its <b>crushing</b> action and <b>cycle</b> of {{freezing}} and thawing {{at its base}} also freed many agates from within the lava flows and transported them, too. The advancing glacier acted like an enormous rock tumbler, abrading, fracturing, and rough-polishing the agates.|$|R
40|$|Nordberg, {{a capital}} {{equipment}} manufacturer, performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study on its rock crusher {{to aid in}} making decisions on product design and energy improvements. LCA {{is a relatively new}} cutting edge environmental tool recently standardized by ISO that provides quantitative environmental and energy data on products or processes. This paper commences with a brief introduction to LCA and presents the system boundaries, modeling and assumptions for the rock crusher study. System boundaries include all major life cycle stages except manufacturing and assembly of the crusher. Results of the LCA show that over 99 % of most of the flows {{into and out of the}} system may be attributed to the use phase of the rock crusher. Within the use phase itself, over 95 % of each environmental inflow and outflow (with some exceptions) are attributed to electricity consumption, and not the replacement of spares/wears or lubricating oil over the lifetime of the crusher. Results tables and charts present selected environmental flows, including CO 2 NOx, SOx, particulate matter, and energy consumption, for each of the rock <b>crusher</b> life <b>cycle</b> stages and the use phase. This paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of adopting a rigorous scientific approac...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{loading of}} embankment, {{foundation}} and pavement structures results in particle breakage of the constituent granular materials, when the stresses imposed on their particles exceed their strength. This paper {{presents the results}} of a number of drained cyclic triaxial tests on loose, uniformly graded samples of Dogs bay carbonate sand. It is observed that particle breakage is dependent on stress level, cyclic stress ratio, and creep and is directly related to volumetric strain. Drained cycling increases volumetric strain and therefore more breakage occurs when larger numbers of cycles are imposed. The increase in particle breakage from one cycle to the next indicates that while particles may not be loaded to their full capacity in a given cycle, they can be <b>crushed</b> in subsequent <b>cycles</b> without any variation in the amplitude of cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|Insight {{into the}} stimuli-responsive {{behaviour}} of biological materials with hierarchical microstructures {{is essential for}} designing new sustainable materials and structures. Shape memory, self-healing and self-repairing will become valuable characteristics of advanced materials. Here we report the water-triggered shape recovery of a natural biological material, the luffa sponge. The longitudinally crushed luffa sponge column can recover up to 98 % of its original shape after it is immersed in water. The mechanical properties of the luffa sponge can also be recovered, to a large extent, after a subsequent drying process. The effects of strain rate, <b>crushing</b> strains, loading <b>cycles,</b> and temperature/duration of water treatment of the drying process on the shape recovery ratio and the energy dissipation recovery ratio have been investigated. The {{results from this study}} have demonstrated that the luffa sponge material possesses remarkable shape memory effects and mechanical recovery features which could be exploited or biomimicked for the design of water-responsive smart materials undergoing large deformations...|$|R
40|$|Using {{indentation}} {{experiments on}} freshwater ice {{as a starting}} point, numerical models for ice damage, clearing and flexure have been developed together with a mechanical model of ice-induced vibration. Indentation speeds were such as to cover a range of ice behaviour, from essentially pure crushing to situations where both flexural failure and crushing took place. Modelling of the damage process was used to estimate the thickness and equivalent viscosity of the crushed layer under various circumstances, and also to demonstrate the change in pressure distributions at different stages in the loading <b>cycle.</b> <b>Crushing</b> {{is complicated by the}} presence of spalling as well as distributed damage. Analysis of these effects and associated local high pressure zones is important for determining when crushing failure occurs. With regard to flexural failure, important issues that are dealt with are the influence of local crushing, the effect of speed and the hydrodynamic effect on the distance at which circumferential cracks are formed. The distance to primary flexural cracks was predicted successfully using analytical plate bending solutions and an equivalent beam model was calibrated. Hydrodynamic effects did not account for observed secondary cracks at shorter distances. A simple mechanical model was developed to integrate the above behaviour with regard to crushing and flexure. The model includes the structural and far field ice responses, and was successful in simulating peak forces and the frequency of dynamic loading cycles in a variety of ice and loading conditions.

40|$|The credit crisis, {{which began}} {{reaching}} its peak last summer {{with the central}} banks around the world pumping some $ 323 billion into the system to keep it liquid[1], intensified further {{in the last few}} weeks, with stock exchanges’ values falling and the most important central banks in the world jointly and massively intervening in the intra-bank market. Thus, the US Federal Reserve on 12 December entered into an agreement with the European Central Bank and the national banks of Canada, Switzerland and Britain to auction $ 40 billion during these last two weeks of December, supposedly, to help <b>crush</b> the “vicious <b>cycle</b> in its tracks” by lessening the fear of cash availability[2]. Of course, this is also a chance to get US dollars at bargain basement prices, and if it proves successful more auctions are expected in January in an attempt to smooth over structural fault lines of neoliberal deregulation: free markets produce the best profits and little government interference. However, despite these increasingly desperate attempts to avoid a more serious crisis, or at least to minimise the effects of the present crisis, today, some analysts already refer to the possibility of the collapse of the banking system to be followed by a world recession similar to the Great Recession {{in the aftermath of the}} 1929 US stock exchange crash, whereas even conservative analysts talk about the strong possibility of another stagflation, similar to the well known stagflation crisis of the 1970 s in the aftermath of the oil crisis. Finally, those in the reformist Left who never understood the systemic character of globalisation keep maintaining the untenable thesis of the non-existence of a New World Order and “interpret” the present reality as just a simple condition of “disorder” and “de-structuring” of the Old Order (i. e. the order of socialist statism prevailing during the social democratic consensus). Still others in the Left adopt the faulty thesis supported by Castoriadis, which also suffers from the lack of a theoretical analysis on globalisation, that what we face today is simply a regression to a capitalist “planetary casino”. [3] So, what are the real causes and the implications of the new crisis and what are the general conclusions we can draw from it...|$|R
