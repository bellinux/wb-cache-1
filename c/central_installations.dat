40|$|Reducing CO 2 {{emissions}} {{in order to}} abate climate change {{is one of the}} biggest challenges currently facing societies. The efficient and sustainable use of biomass conversion technologies for energy purposes is one important means of mitigating CO 2 emissions while simultaneously reducing the need to import energy. However, compared to fossil fuels, biomass conversion per se suffers from lower energetic conversion efficiencies. New well-designed, deeply heat and material-integrated processes can help to overcome this obstacle. As an abundant but widely scattered resource, biomass should primarily be used locally or else upgraded before transport to <b>central</b> <b>installations.</b> Biomass-based, combined heat and power (CHP) production is an established and efficient technology that has proved it can compete with the conventional methods of energy generation under current tax regimes. However, increased use of biomass raises the price for limited biomass feedstock, and, in the future, it might hamper the affordability of municipal biomass-fired CHP plants. In order to react to the expected increase in competition for restricted biomass resources, communal CHP plants should be integrated with biomass upgrading processes that add valuable products to the portfolio. The objective of the thesis is to investigate the influence of integrating three different biomass upgrading processes, pelletising, torrefaction and fast pyrolysis, with a municipal CHP plant. In particular, their influence on important operational parameters, the energetic and environmental performance of the plant as well as the plant's finances, should be taken into account. With respect to the latter aspects of system's performance, a concise and significant assessment methodology that makes it easy to compare the processes yielding multiple products is developed and assessed in this study. The study shows that all three integration options are quite possible within the operational limits of the CHP plant. By utilising free boiler capacity during times of low district heating demand, high bio-product yields and greater district heating output can be realised, which in turn leads to improved primary energy (PE) efficiency and reduced CO 2 emissions. Despite its lower energetic and exergetic efficiency, the integration of fast pyrolysis demonstrated the best economic performance. The thesis also concludes by arguing that the results obtained via thermal efficiency analysis do not add any new information to the results obtained via exergy and PE analyses. Exergy and PE analyses should be the preferred means for process assessment...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to study a system, which covers both the demands for heating and cooling of a building. The system is {{designed}} to be one large <b>central</b> <b>installation</b> for storage and distribution. Such systems obviously reveal a large cost-competitiveness. The design foresees solar collectors for heating and radiative cooling panels, which could be combined with an external electric fan, for cooling the water in the storage. In the present system design, the heat storage tank is divided in several sections in order to allow domestic hot water heating and cooling (summer) or DHW- and space heating (winter). It was investigated how well the heating- and cooling gains could be separated for the demand during typical days during summer. The stratification has been studied in particular in this thesis, and especially with respect to energy considerations when using the system for cooling. The results of the experiments indicate that there are potential benefits of using this type of solar system for cooling.

40|$|Foundation piles {{are being}} {{increasingly}} equipped with heat exchangers to efficiently harvest shallow geothermal energy. For buildings {{in urban areas}} continuous flight auger (CFA) piles are common due to their speed, cost efficiency and low noise levels. To construct a thermo?active CFA pile usually requires separate <b>central</b> <b>installation</b> of the heat exchanger. However the energy performance {{of this type of}} pile has not been investigated systematically, with most studies focused on rotary piles where the heat exchanger is attached to the reinforcing cage. In this work, insights are provided about the main influences on the energy efficiency of thermo?active CFA piles, with a focus on the implications of using CFA construction techniques rather than rotary boring. An innovative 3 D numerical model, able to capture the different aspects of transient heat transfer, is employed together with analytical methods to evaluate the transient and steady?state behaviour of energy piles in a number of design situations. Attention is given to understanding the role of possible pipe to pipe interaction, which cannot be systematically investigated with standard methods. Finally, practical guidelines on the optimal choice of design parameters to maximise the energy efficiency of CFA piles, without altering the geotechnical arrangements, are provided...|$|R
