The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states.

In addition, the EU’s directive on Type Approval (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for national type approval requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU. This directive aims at the clarification of the type approval procedure for motor vehicles, separate technical units (i.e., trailers), and components.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> for {{alternative}} fuel conversion systems and also offers {{other forms of}} premarket registration of conversion kits for use in vehicles more than two model years old. Use of alternative fuels such as ethanol, natural gas, and propane are encouraged by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) produce emissions-certified vehicles capable of using alternative fuels, and several alternative fuel conversion system manufacturers produce EPA-approved conversion systems {{for a variety of}} alternative fuels and vehicle types. To date, only one manufacturer (Flex Fuel U. S.) has received EPA certifications for ethanol fuel (E 85) conversion kits. This report details an independent evaluation of a vehicle with a legal installation of a Flex Fuel U. S. conversion kit. A 2006 Dodge Charger was baseline tested with ethanol-free certification gasoline (E 0) and E 20 (gasoline with 20 vol % ethanol), converted to flex-fuel operation via installation of a Flex Box Smart Kit from Flex Fuel U. S., and retested with E 0, E 20, E 50, and E 81. Test cycles included the Federal Test Procedure (FTP or city cycle), the highway fuel economy test (HFET), and the US 06 test (aggressive driving test). Averaged test results show that the vehicle was emissions compliant on E 0 in the OEM condition (before conversion) and compliant on all test fuels after conversion. Average nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions exceeded the Tier 2 /Bin 5 intermediate life NO{sub X} standard with E 20 fuel in the OEM condition due to two of three test results exceeding this standard [note that E 20 is not a legal fuel for non-flexible-fuel vehicles (non-FFVs) ]. In addition, one E 0 test result before conversion and one E 20 test result after conversion exceeded the NOX standard, although the average result in these two cases was below the standard. Emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde increased with increasing ethanol, while nonmethane organic gas and CO emissions remained relatively unchanged for all fuels and cycles. Higher fraction ethanol blends appeared to decrease NO{sub X} emissions on the FTP and HFET (after conversion). As expected, fuel economy (miles per gallon) decreased with increasing ethanol content in all cases...|$|R
