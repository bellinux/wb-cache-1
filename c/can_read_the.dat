5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{are also used}} within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the Zhuang, have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Zhuang logograms than the alphabetic script.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E

25|$|When an {{operating}} system is {{running on a}} system without file encryption, access to files normally goes through OS-controlled user authentication and access control lists. However, if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, this barrier can be easily circumvented. One way, for example, would be to remove the disk {{and put it in}} another computer with an OS installed that <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> filesystem; another, would be to simply reboot the computer from a boot CD containing an OS that is suitable for accessing the local filesystem.|$|E
25|$|Pervasive PSQL v11 was {{released}} in September 2010. One of the key drivers of the engineering effort behind Pervasive PSQL v11 was the redesign of the database engine to increase performance and scalability on multi-core CPU's. Pervasive PSQL v11 optimizes parallel threads performing similar activities, allowing the database to engage multiple cores during task execution. PSQL v11 also provides enhancements to the low-level synchronization mechanisms in the navigational interface. Multiple users <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> same cached file pages simultaneously and their operations can proceed on independent cores. Non-user activity such as checkpoints and log management can run on separate cores and multiple users accessing independent files can proceed on different cores.|$|E
25|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer.|$|E

25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of what he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
25|$|Lucario is a canid-like Pokémon {{that is a}} bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws, {{while its}} chest and the {{exterior}} of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, thighs shaped like baggy shorts, and four small appendages {{on the back of}} its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur that is slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. Lucario has the ability to sense and manipulate , a form of energy emitted by all living things, and is able to understand human speech. As a result, Lucario <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, {{to the point that it}} can even see otherwise invisible foes. When properly trained, it can identify the feelings of others even if they are over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, a baby Pokémon that is also able to sense Aura. Compared to Lucario, Riolu is a pure Fighting-type Pokémon, rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon, and it cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario.|$|E

[...] Fensch marks Mulberry Street as the start of what he calls [...] "escalating sequences or escalating action", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, [...] "The rhythm gallopsthe pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{disappearance}} {{has been}} cited as [...] "the first crime mystery of the social media age," [...] and generated speculation from {{the media and the}} public, specifically on the internet, in online forums and message boards.

But when Maura Murray disappeared, the social Web was in its infancy. There was no YouTube and no Twitter. On the day Maura went missing, Facebook was five days old. And so you <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> history of her case as a parable about the evolution of online sleuthing." [...] In November 2004, a second cousin of Murray created the website [...] [...] In 2005, active discussion of Murray's disappearance was documented on websleuths.com, and in 2007, Facebook and Myspace pages were created dedicated to helping find her.|$|E
500|$|The {{home button}} on the iPhone 5S {{incorporates}} a fingerprint recognition system known as Touch ID, based on technology from AuthenTec, a company which Apple had acquired in 2012. The sensor uses a capacitive CMOS-based sensor which can detect the [...] "sub-epidermal layers" [...] of fingers at 500 pixels per inch, and uses a 360-degree design that <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> print at any angle. The sensor itself is activated by a touch-sensitive metallic ring surrounding the button. Touch ID {{can be used for}} various authentication activities within the operating system, such as unlocking the device or authenticating App Store and iTunes purchases instead of an Apple ID password. The sensor can be trained to recognize the fingerprints of multiple fingers and multiple users. Fingerprint data is stored in an encrypted format within a [...] "secure enclave" [...] of the A7 chip itself, and is not accessible to any other apps or servers (including iCloud).|$|E

She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become {{infected}} following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is {{in trouble with the}} Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' [...] "sheriff," [...] arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to his cage. Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying they are here to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, [...] "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us". Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean." ...|$|E
