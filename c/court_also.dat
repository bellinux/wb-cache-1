5|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>also</b> {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>court</b> <b>also</b> {{found the}} {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter {{to comply with}} the terms of the statute. However, even if the district attorney had brought the action and the affidavit had been sufficient, the Supreme Court still would have denied mandamus as a matter of law.|$|E
5|$|Because of her {{position}} as Secretary of HHS, Burwell was the named party in multiple lawsuits {{related to the}} Affordable Care Act.

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The <b>court</b> <b>also</b> encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opačić, General Ljubomir Bajić, {{commander}} of the 5th Aviation Corps, and Colonel Božidar Martinović, head of the Yugoslav Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade in absentia for the attack.

The <b>court</b> <b>also</b> ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 Euros. In a 2008 interview, Šišić said he regretted {{the deaths of the}} crew but felt no remorse for his actions.|$|E

These three law schools, Willamette University College of Law, University of Oregon Law School, and Lewis & Clark Law School, use the visits as educational tools.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The <b>Court</b> <b>also</b> may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{was then}} {{appointed}} {{as an associate}} justice of the Territorial Supreme Court in 1853 by United States President Franklin Pierce. Pierce appointed him to a second term in 1857. At this time justices of the <b>court</b> <b>also</b> rode circuit, presiding over trials in designated counties in addition to serving as an appellate court judge for the Supreme Court. Deady {{was assigned to the}} southern counties of the territory, holding court in each county twice per year.|$|E

5|$|The European Court of Auditors (ECA), {{despite its}} name, has no {{judicial}} powers. It ensures that taxpayer {{funds from the}} budget of the European Union have been correctly spent.

The <b>Court</b> <b>also</b> gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.|$|E
5|$|The High <b>Court</b> <b>also</b> {{held that}} the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
5000|$|Finance <b>courts</b> (...) , <b>also</b> called tax law courts or fiscal courts, hear only tax-related {{cases and}} exist on two levels. The Federal Finance Court (...) {{is the highest}} tax law court.|$|R

5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>also</b> {{decided whether}} foreign {{corporations}} are also within {{the jurisdiction of}} a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court {{in which it was}} not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E
5|$|The colony's most {{powerful}} executive was its Governor, who was originally {{elected by the}} freemen but was later appointed by the General Court in an annual election.

They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, {{and a host of other}} duties.|$|E
5|$|The <b>court</b> <b>also</b> {{ruled that}} {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges.

But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
