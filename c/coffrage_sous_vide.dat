40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the microbiological, physical and physico-chemical quality parameters of <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> preparation of pen-reared tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). To prepare the tambaqui <b>sous</b> <b>vide,</b> 200 g of fillet, 50 g of basil sauce (1 : 4 fish fillet:sauce ratio) and 10 mL of 5 % sodium lactate were used. The product was then vacuum-packaged, pasteurized at 65 ºC for 12. 5 min and refrigerated. The presence of Salmonella spp., sulfite-reducing Clostridium and Listeria monocytogenes was not detected in the samples analyzed. The coliform count at 45 ºC and coagulase-positive staphylococci were below the limit (103) permitted by the law in vigor. Water retention capacity and chloride content analyses revealed that the tambaqui fillet differed significantly (P 0. 05), but the red color (a*) decreased in the <b>sous</b> <b>vide,</b> which is related to the addition of basil sauce. The chroma (C*) and hue angle (ho) differed significantly (P< 0. 05), and the fillet samples were lighter in color, whereas the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> was characterized by yellow color. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratios found for the fillet and the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> are within the recommended values, which is important for human metabolism.

40|$|Consumers now demand {{higher quality}} {{in all aspects}} of life. This has had a {{particular}} effect on the food industry where the need for quality encompasses both food safety and sensory characteristics. The <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> process was developed to produce food on a large scale but with superior sensory qualities compared to the products of cook-chill and cook-freeze systems. This research aimed to determine whether the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> process could produce meals with superior sensory properties as claimed. A literature survey indicated that craft-based assessors (chefs) claimed improved qualities in <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> products which were not consistently supported by sensory analysts (scientists). Empirical studies were conducted to test whether <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> and conventionally processed dishes could be distinguished by untrained assessors in a controlled laboratory environment and with assessors in an ecologically valid environment, a restaurant. In the laboratory, the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> meals were easily distinguishable from and less acceptable than the conventionally produced dish. In the restaurant, few significant differences were found. Thus the ecologically valid environment of the restaurant where the many extrinsic factors affect consumers' perceptions, effectively masked differences between the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> and conventionally prepared meals. To explore the reasons for this, a survey (n 188) was conducted to determine the relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the acceptability of foods when eating out. Results included a factor analysis which clearly showed components of 'customer care' had the greatest influence on the pleasure of eating out, followed by 'drink', and the absence of 'entertainment'. The factor which included 'enjoyment of food' was eleventh in the level of influence. Two scales were also devised to assess consumers' attitudes towards complaining about problems with meals and towards the technology used to produce them. This work has demonstrated that although consumers assume that the intrinsic qualities of food are the most important facator giving them pleasure when eating out, many extrinsic factors will have a much greater influence on affecting their overall pleasure from the experience...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chicory stems, {{appreciated}} both raw and cooked, {{represent a}} nutritious and refined food. In this study {{the effects on}} the quality of stems cooked by conventional (boiling, steaming and microwaving) and innovative (<b>sous</b> <b>vide)</b> methods were analysed. Several physical, chemical and sensory traits were compared using two local varieties (Galatina and Molfettese) of southern Italy (Puglia region). RESULTS: Independently of the variety, the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> method did not significantly affect (redness, yellowness and hue angle) or had the least impact on (lightness and total colour difference) quality parameters among the four methods as compared with the raw product. Following sensory analysis, the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> product always showed the highest score among the cooking methods. Moreover, this innovative method did not affect total phenol (TP) content and antioxidant activity (AA) compared with uncooked stems of both varieties. Microwaving increased TP content and AA (though associated with higher weight loss), while different responses depending on the chicory variety were observed after boiling and steaming. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the <b>sous</b> <b>vide</b> technique as optimal to preserve several traits, including organoleptic ones, for the quality of cook-chilled chicory stems. They also provide product-specific information usually required for cooking process strategies in the industrial sector of ready-to-eat vegetables...|$|R
