40|$|Este trabalho avaliou a influência do uso de telas anti-insetos nas laterais de ambientes protegidos sobre a temperatura do ar de um cultivo de tomate. O experimento foi realizado em Itajaí, SC (27 º 34 ' S; 48 º 30 ' W), no período de 17 / 03 a 25 / 07 / 2003, onde foram instalados quatro ambientes cobertos com filme plástico de PEBD, sendo que um deles não possuía revestimento lateral e três estavam revestidos lateralmente, cada um com um tipo de tela anti-insetos. As telas anti-insetos utilizadas foram: <b>clarite</b> (5 fios por cm), citros (10 fios por cm) e antiafídeo (20 fios por cm). O ambiente revestido com tela antiafídeo nas laterais apresentou maiores valores de temperatura máxima do ar durante o outono-inverno, o que ocasionou aumento médio de 2, 0 °C na temperatura média diária, quando comparado com o ambiente sem tela nas laterais. A variação da temperatura do ar nos ambientes com tela citros e <b>clarite</b> foi semelhante, apresentando ganho térmico diário de 0, 4 °C em relação ao ambiente sem tela anti-insetos e possibilitou condições mais estáveis entre as temperaturas noturna e diurna para o cultivo do tomateiro nessa época do ano. This study aims {{to assess}} the {{influence}} of insect-proof screens installed in plastic greenhouses cultivated with tomato on the air temperature and crop yield. The experiment was conducted in Itajaí, SC, Brazil (27 º 34 ' S; 48 º 30 ' W), from 17 / 03 to 25 / 07 / 2003. Four greenhouses cultivated with tomato and all covered with polyethylene of low density (PEBD) in the superior part were used. Three of these environments were covered laterally, each one with {{a different kind of}} screen: <b>clarite</b> insect-proof screens (12 meshes per cm), citros insect-proof screens (25 meshes per cm) and afideo insect-proof screens (50 meshes per cm). The fourth environment did not receive any side coverage. The covered environment with afideo insect-proof screens on sides presented the highest maximum air temperatures during the autumn-winter period, causing a mean increase of 2. 0 °C, in the daily mean temperature, compared with the environment without insect-proof screens. Variations of the air temperature in protected environments with citros insect-proof and <b>clarite</b> afideo insect-proof screens were similar, and showed 0. 4 °C thermal gains in comparison with the without insect-proof screens, so promoting more regular thermal conditions during nights and days for cultivation of tomato during the autumn-winter period...|$|E
30|$|Petrographic {{study of}} the Karharbari coal shows that these coals are {{vitrinite}} rich, followed by liptinite and inertinite. Secondary liptinite macerals are observed in significant amount. The microlithotype analysis shows the dominance of vitrite followed by vitrinertite, <b>clarite</b> and inertite. The vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and volatile matter (d.a.f) values rank the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to ‘B’. The microscopic constituents of Karharbari coal indicate peat accumulation in the forest mire under fluctuating oxic to anoxic conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
40|$|Petrographic {{analysis}} and rank determination {{were carried out}} on coals from a Jurassic sequence in eastern Surat Basin, Australia. The coals consist mainly of exinite-rich <b>clarite,</b> with desmocollinite as dominant maceral of the vitrinite group. Petrographically {{there is no significant}} variation in the composition of the coals. A herbaceous swamp type, free from severe oxidation/ dehydration, {{appears to have been a}} dominant depositional environment during the peat accumulation. The coal rank ranges from sub-bituminous B to high-volatile bituminous C/B. Vitrinite reflectance/ depth profile shows a uniform increase in coalification with depth of burial...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study an attempt {{has been made to}} carry out the {{detailed}} petrographic characterization of the Karharbari coals of Talcher coalfield and to reconstruct the paleoenvironment conditions of coal formation using macerals and microlithtotypes as a tool. For these purposes a large number of samples were collected following the pillar sampling method and were subjected to detailed petrographic study. The petrographic observation shows that these coals are vitrinite rich followed by the liptinite and inertinite group of macerals. On microlithotype scale, these coals shows the dominance of the vitrite followed by <b>clarite,</b> vitrinertite and inertite. The concentration of liptite, clarodurite, duroclarite and vitrinertoliptite are insignificant. The vitrinite reflectance ranks the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to high volatile ‘B’ bituminous. Coal petrography based depositional models suggest peat accumulation in forested telmatic swamp. Moreover, during the time of their evolution, there were alternate phases of oxic and anoxic moor conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
30|$|Heidaigou coal is a {{low-rank}} {{bituminous coal}} {{with a high}} ash content. The sulfur content is low and dominated by pyritic sulfur. The Al 2 O 3 content is high while SiO 2 is relatively low in the ash. This results a high ash fusion temperature. The mine {{is located at the}} north edge of the carboniferous-permian coal accumulation basin in Northern China. The vitrinite content is lower than the average of the area while the inertinite and liptinite contents are higher (Han 1996). The dominant vitrinite macerals are telocollinite and desmocollinite. A small amount of telinite is also present. The liptinite group is mainly represented by sporinite, which disperses in the desmocollinite and in the matrix of the inertinite in the bedding direction. Fragmental fusinite usually mixes with semifusinite. The main microlithotypes are vitrite, trimacerite and durite while a small amount of <b>clarite,</b> inertrite and vitrinertite are present. Vitrite is usually uniform while trimacerite is fragmental or of lineation shape. Durite is composed of an inertinite matrix and a clastic texture.|$|E
40|$|The {{major oil}} and gas fields in Australia produce from coal measure sediments, in {{contrast}} to the giant oil fields of the Northern Hemisphere which are associated with the marine rocks. The organic matter in the Australian fields is present both as coal seams and fragments of coaly material dispersed through the adjacent sediments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons. The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia. In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated. AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter. Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals. Exinite (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, Exinite (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with vitrite plus <b>clarite</b> and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin. Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and durite plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin. The microlithotype compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the microlithotype compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their microlithotype compositions. Those coals with the highest vitrite plus <b>clarite</b> contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest durite plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps. Given that exinite is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments. If inertinite has the least potential as a source for hydrocarbons, then the sequences in areas dominated by coal swamps have the lowest potential as source rocks for hydrocarbons...|$|E
30|$|Petrographically, {{vitrinite}} {{group of}} macerals dominate followed by inertinite and relatively in lesser concentration are macerals of the liptinite group. Among the vitrinites, collotelinite record the highest followed by vitrodetrinite and collodetrinite. In the studied coals, inertinite {{also has a}} major presence indicating dry episodes {{in the development of}} the peat. Among the microlithotypevitrite followed by inertite, <b>clarite</b> and durite are major entities in the coals. The rank of the coal as per the volatile matter is between sub-bituminous ‘B’ and sub-bituminous ‘A’. Hydrocarbon generation potential is low as indicated by rock–eval pyrolysis. Based on HI and OI plots and elemental H/C and O/C ratio, the investigated coals have been characterized as kerogen Type III, suggestive of dominantly terrestrial and lacustrine organic matter. The peat development on basis of microlithotype composition suggest their evolution in limno-telmatic zones having floral inputs characteristic of forest moor with intermittent hydrological conditions. The Gelification Index and Tissue Preservation Index are suggestive of terrestrial origin with high tree density. Further, moderately high GI and exceedingly high telovitrinite based TPI along with high ash content are indicative of their origin in intermittent dry forested swamps. The Ground Water Index suggests that these coals have evolved in bogs under ombrotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index values are indicative of preponderance of herbaceous plants in the formation of the coals. The plots on a depositional model given by Smyth (1979) indicate their deposition under fluvio-lacustrine control with the development of upper deltaic and lower deltaic conditions near the fresh water lacustrines.|$|E
40|$|The Early Permian coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from the Vasse Shelf, southern Perth Basin, located approximately 200 km south- west of Perth. The selected coal samples {{for the study}} were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures. The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of microlithotype group, the predominance of inertite over vitrite suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence. The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low exinite and mineral matter. The very low to low semifusinite ratio and low to medium vitrinite content of ++the coal indicate that the coal was formed under aerobic dry to wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is categorized as sub-bituminous according to the Australian classification. The domination of inertite and durite over vitrite and <b>clarite</b> contents in the coal reflects the deposition under drier conditions with fluctuations in the water table. On the basis of the interpretations of macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements distribution, the depositional environment of the coal is lacustrine, braided to meandering fluvial system, without the influence of any marine influx. The maceral composition of the Irwin River coal consists predominantly of vitrinite and inertinite, and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal has very low semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, suggesting the coal was deposited in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub-bituminous of the Australian classification. The predominance of vitrite and <b>clarite</b> over inertite and durite contents in the coal indicates that the coal was formed in wetter conditions and in high water covers with a low degree of oxidation. Based on macerals and microlithotypes contents, the depositional environment of the coal is braided fluvial to deltaic, which is in accordance with the interpreted non- marine and mixed marine environment of deposition in the sub-basin. The petrological comparisons of Vasse Shelf, Collie and Irwin River coals show that the average vitrinite content of the Irwin River coal is highest (49. 1 %) and of the Collie coal is lowest (37. 3 %) of the three. The inertinite content is highest in Collie coal (49. 1 %), followed by Vasse Shelf (46. 4 %) and Irwin River (39. 2 %) coals. The exinite content is low in Irwin River coal (6. 3 %) as compared with Vasse Shelf (9. 0 °/,) and Collie (8. 3 %) coals. The mineral matter content ++is relatively low for all the three coals. The rank of the Vasse Shelf coal is high as compared with the Collie and Irwin River coals, either due to tectonic uplift after the deposition in post-Permian in the southern Perth Basin, or due to the average depth of burial over Vasse Shelf which is much greater than that of Collie and Irwin River coals. The comparisons of the coal from Western Australia with the selected Gondwana coals show that the predominance of inertinite over vitrinite occurs in the Western Australian coals (Vasse Shelf and Collie Basin). On the other hand, the Brazilian, eastern Australian, Indian and Western Australian (Irwin Sub-basin) coals are dominated by vitrinite over inertinite. The exinite content is highest in the Indian coals and lowest in the eastern Australian coals. The mineral matter content is highest in the Brazilian and Indian coals, and lowest in Western Australian (Vasse Shelf) and eastern Australian (Sydney Basin) coals. The rank of the coals ranges from sub- bituminous to medium volatile bituminous according to the Australian classification...|$|E
40|$|The Early Jurassic coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from CRA Exploration Pty Ltd. (CRAE), drilled in the Gairdner and Mintaja Blocks, Gairdner Range of the Hill River Area, northern Perth Basin, Western Australia. The area is located approximately 280 km north of Perth. The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, {{and it has a}} range from 10. 4 % to 24. 8 %. The exinite group varies between 7. 2 % to 20. 8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite. The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The microlithotype analyses shows that the vitrite plus <b>clarite</b> content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus durite content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification. On the basis of carbon and hydrogen content, the coal is categorised as per-hydrous meta- to ortho-lignitous type. The trace elements As, B, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, V, Y, Zn, and Zr, are spectrographically analysed in the coal ash. The B content in the coal supports the presence of marine influence during peat deposition in the basin. On the basis of lithotype, maceral, microlithotype, trace element distribution, pyrite and total sulphur in the coal, the depositional environment for coal and the coal measures, is interpreted as an upper to lower delta type within a regressive phase of marine transgression...|$|E
