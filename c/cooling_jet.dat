Finite volume based computations using CD-adapcofs STAR-CCM+ are performed in this study. One {{of the advantages of}} this commercial code is its ability to tackle problems involving multi-physics and complex geometries. Generic models with fixed and reciprocating moving discs are used in the first stage of this study to investigate the thermal characteristics of the jet impingement. Subsequently, the information that has been acquired from the first stage is used to successfully simulate a full-scale engine and estimate the temperature profile and heat dissipation from the pistons with and without a cooling oil jet. The computational results show that the radial extent of the stagnation region beneath the jet is not uniform as stated in the literature, but {{is a function of the}} radial velocity gradient (Ýu_r) ⁄Ýr in this region. Correlations describing the stagnation zone and local Nusselt numbers have been developed, applicable over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Prandtl numbers. The effect of nozzle geometry is found to be insignificant on thermal characteristics for long jets. For jet impingement onto a moving boundary, an innovative methodology to accelerate the computational solution and reduce the cost in term of CPU time has been developed and implemented. Finally, the piston cooling process due to oil jet impingement is evaluated for the Fiat-Chrysler full-scale 2. 0 L Tigershark Inline 4 -Cylinder gasoline engine.

They are significant to understand energy and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Recently, the high-speed transition region jets are reported from the observation.

Driven by the supergranular convection motion, the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open flux occurring in the transition region is simulated with a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model. The simulation results show that not only a fast hot jet, much resemble the found transition region jets, but also a adjacent slow <b>cool</b> <b>jet,</b> mostly like classical spicules, is launched.

The simulations {{were based on}} the magnetic reconnection model, in which the plasma of an X-ray jet is accelerated and heated by reconnection between the emerging flux and a pre-existing coronal field. Many observed characteristics of X-ray jets could be successfully reproduced. Morphologically, the two observed types of jets, two-sided-loop type and anemone-jet type, were well reproduced. Here, the two-sided-loop type is a pair of horizontal jets (or loops), which occurs when an emerging flux appears in a quiet region where the coronal field is approximately horizontal. In contrast, the anemone-jet type is a vertical jet, which takes place when an emerging flux appears in a coronal hole where the coronal field is vertical or oblique. Quantitatively, the velocity, temperature, thermal energy, kinetic energy, and other parameters obtained in the simulation are in good agreement with the observations.
