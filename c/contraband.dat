5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the {{settlers}} chose to move further {{east to the}} old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for <b>contraband.</b> The settlers did not have authorization to move, and no troops were assigned to protect the new location until 1795.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of <b>contrabands</b> flooding into Alexandria during the Union occupation included many who were destitute, malnourished and in poor health. Once in Alexandria, the <b>contrabands</b> were housed in barracks and hastily assembled shantytowns. In the close quarters with poor sanitation, smallpox and typhoid outbreaks were prevalent and death was common. In February 1864, after hundreds of <b>contrabands</b> and freedmen had perished, {{the commander of}} the Alexandria military district, General John P. Slough, seized a parcel of undeveloped land at the corner of South Washington and Church Streets from a pro-Confederate owner {{to be used as a}} cemetery specifically for burial of <b>contrabands.</b> Burials started in March that year.|$|R

5|$|The second season, {{along with}} its ongoing {{examination}} of the drug problem {{and its effect on}} the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by stevedores in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other <b>contraband</b> inside the shipping containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.|$|E

50|$|Because the escaped {{slaves were}} still legally {{property}} until {{the abolition of}} slavery, they were labeled as <b>contrabands</b> to prevent their being returned to their masters. <b>Contrabands</b> took positions with the army as construction workers, nurses and hospital stewards, longshoremen, painters, wood cutters, teamsters, laundresses, cooks, gravediggers, personal servants, and ultimately as soldiers and sailors. According to one statistic, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000 {{by the fall of}} 1863 - an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were <b>contraband.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by British authorities on 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully inspecting the ship for any <b>contraband,</b> the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered <b>contraband</b> in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E
50|$|Near Fort Monroe, {{but outside}} its {{protective}} walls, the pioneering teacher Mary S. Peake began to teach both adult and child <b>contrabands</b> {{to read and}} write. She {{was the first black}} teacher hired by the American Missionary Association, which also sent numerous Northern white teachers to the South to teach. This area of Elizabeth City County later became part of the campus of Hampton University, a historically black college. Defying a Virginia law against educating slaves, Peake and other teachers held classes outdoors under a certain large oak tree. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was read to the <b>contrabands</b> and free blacks there, for which the tree was named the Emancipation Oak. For most of the <b>contrabands,</b> full emancipation did not take place until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolishing slavery was ratified in late 1865.|$|R

5|$|Christof, Pink, and Lily {{travel to}} New York City aboard a <b>contraband</b> ship, rescue the Nosferatu Samuel from the Sabbat, and {{infiltrate}} a warehouse storing the Vyšehrad <b>contraband.</b> There they encounter Wilhem, {{who is now}} a Sabbat under Ecaterina following the collapse of their group. Wilhem reveals that Pink is an assassin working for Vukodlak. Pink escapes and Wilhem rejoins Christof, hoping to reclaim the humanity he has sacrificed during the previous 800 years. Together, Christof, Wilhem, Lily, and Samuel discover that Vukodlak is hidden beneath a church within his Cathedral of Flesh and that Anezka is still in his servitude. In the cathedral they find that Vukodlak has awoken; he tries to influence Christof by offering him Anezka then revealing that she is completely dependent on Vukodlak's blood and will die without him. Christof refuses and Vukodlak drops the group into tunnels beneath the cathedral. Christof finds the Wall of Memories, which hold Anezka's memories of the last millennia, showing she continued to hope as Vukodlak found new ways to defile and torment her. She eventually sacrificed her innocence to gain Vukodlak's trust, using her position to delay his resurrection over hundreds of years until, with no options left, she prayed for Christof's return. The group returns to the Cathedral and battles Vukodlak.|$|E
5|$|Dainty was {{assigned}} to search for <b>contraband</b> being shipped across the Mediterranean throughout October and November, before undergoing a refit at Malta from 8–30 December. On its completion she {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Destroyer Division, based in Freetown, Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders operating in the South Atlantic. The ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in April and was given another refit at Malta from 21 April to 2 June 1940. On its completion, Dainty {{was assigned}} to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the island's {{location}} made it {{an ideal}} base for smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft {{on the north side}} of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of <b>contraband,</b> mainly tea and brandy.|$|E
25|$|Escaped African American slaves {{poured into}} Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, {{the cities of}} Alexandria and Washington offered {{comparative}} freedom and employment. Alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the Union army. Until the Emancipation Proclamation, escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners. Therefore, they were labeled <b>contrabands</b> to avoid returning them to their masters. <b>Contrabands</b> worked the Union army in various support roles. By the fall of 1863, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.|$|R
5000|$|Although usually {{thought of}} as a spiritual, the {{earliest}} recorded use of the song was as a rallying anthem for the <b>Contrabands</b> at Fort Monroe sometime before July 1862. Early authorities presumed it was composed by them. Sheet music was soon after published, titled [...] "Oh! Let My People Go: The Song of the Contrabands", and arranged by Horace Waters. L.C. Lockwood, chaplain of the <b>Contrabands,</b> stated in the sheet music the song was from Virginia, dating from about 1853. The opening verse, as recorded by Lockwood, is: ...|$|R

5|$|In December 1915, Tubantia again made {{news when}} the Overseas News Agency in Berlin {{released}} a report saying that the British had seized all South America mail and parcels from the ship. After the United States expressed concerns about related seizures from two other Dutch ships in service to the United States— and —the British Foreign Office issued a statement that reported that <b>contraband</b> intended for Germany—which included four packages of rubber, and seven containers of wool—had been found among Tubantias mail.|$|E
5|$|Larrea's {{business}} prospered, and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo {{appointed him}} to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of <b>contraband.</b> This {{gave him an}} opportunity to put his nautical skills to use. He also participated in the secret meetings of patriots who promoted political change, and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga, which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta. The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not {{take part in the}} discussions at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.|$|E
5|$|Provence {{was then}} sent to Casablanca, where she joined Force Y. The unit {{conducted}} several fruitless sweeps into the Atlantic. While in Gibraltar, she was damaged and forced to return to Toulon for repairs. While en route, she intercepted the Italian passenger ship Oceania; Provence dispatched her to Marseilles so she could be inspected for <b>contraband.</b> Provence sailed for Oran on 24 January 1940, {{and then returned to}} Force Y in Dakar. Force Y was transferred to Oran on 11 April; they arrived five days later. On 27 April, Provence, her two sisters, and several cruisers were moved to Alexandria. On 18 May, Provence and Bretagne returned to Mers El Kébir.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cemetery}} {{operated under}} General Slough's command. Its oversight was supervised by Alexandria’s Superintendent of <b>Contrabands,</b> the Rev. Albert Gladwin, who made arrangements for burials. Each grave was {{identified with a}} whitewashed, wooden grave marker. [...] In 1868, after Congress ended most functions of the Freedmen's Bureau, the cemetery was closed; and the property was returned to its original owners. Eventually, after the grave markers had rotted and ownership had transferred several times, the property was redeveloped for commercial use. During its five years of operation, about 1800 <b>contrabands</b> and freedmen were buried in the cemetery.|$|R

5000|$|In 1861, Baker {{published}} the first [...] "sheet-music publication of any black spiritual", Song of the <b>Contrabands.</b> His efforts were later criticized as betraying {{a lack of}} knowledge of black music, for having [...] "turned the slave song into a parlor ballad in 6/8 time".|$|R
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating <b>contraband.</b> This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{strongly}} {{approved of}} the book and several thousand copies of it were bought by the War Ministry and Naval Ministry who by the beginning of 1934 were distributing the books for free to foreign journalists and officials. By contrast, the Nationalist Government of China responded by banning Townsend's book throughout China from 1935. Even so, the journalist George Moorad reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed <b>contraband</b> copies of the book to American China Marines in the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China.|$|E
5|$|When World War II began, Friedrich Ihn was {{initially}} {{deployed in the}} Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields.
