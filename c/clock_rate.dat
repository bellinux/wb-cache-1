5|$|Type B: This {{connector}} is 21.2mm × 4.45mm and has 29 pins, carrying six differential pairs {{instead of}} three, {{for use with}} very high-resolution displays such as WQUXGA (3,840×2,400). It is electrically compatible with dual-link DVI-D, but {{has not yet been}} used in any products. With the introduction of HDMI 1.3, the maximum bandwidth of single-link HDMI exceeded that of dual-link DVI-D. As of HDMI 1.4, the pixel <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> crossover frequency from single to dual-link has not been defined.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession of innovative Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development of the Mark I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the vacuum tube diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b> To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum pixel <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E
25|$|Typical SDR SDRAM <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> are 66, 100, and 133MHz (periods of 15, 10, and 7.5ns). <b>Clock</b> <b>rates</b> up to 200MHz were available.|$|R

50|$|A Core i7 940 system {{running at}} stock <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> has {{obtained}} a 3DMark Vantage benchmark CPU score of 17,966.

25|$|Note {{that because}} {{internal}} operations are at 1/2 the <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> DDR2-400 memory (internal <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 100MHz) has somewhat higher latency than DDR-400 (internal <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 200MHz).|$|E
25|$|Certain arcade games (such as Steel Gunner {{and others}} based on Namco System 2) use a dual 68000 CPU {{configuration}}, and systems with a triple 68000 CPU configuration also exist (such as Galaxy Force and others {{based on the}} Sega Y Board), along with a quad 68000 CPU configuration, which {{has been used by}} Jaleco (one 68000 for sound has a lower <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> compared to the other 68000 CPUs) for games such as Big Run and Cisco Heat; a fifth 68000 (at a different <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> compared to the other 68000 CPUs) was additionally used in the Jaleco arcade game Wild Pilot for I/O processing.|$|E
25|$|With data being {{transferred}} 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate)</b> × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600MB/s.|$|E

The bit rate of the incoming and outgoing TDM signals of the line concentrators is 278. 528 Mc/s. The <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> for routing and switching the TDM signals in the line concentrators are approx. 70 Mc/s and 8 Mc/s; these <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> exceed the corresponding <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> of digital exchanges hitherto known.

A manufacturer has produced calculators to estimate the power used by various types of RAM.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clock</b> <b>rate</b> of a {{processor}} chip {{refers to the}} frequency at which the central processing unit (CPU) is running.

For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range.|$|E
25|$|The Pilot ACE has binary floating-point arithmetic, and {{it became}} {{operational}} in 1950 at National Physical Laboratory, UK. Thirty-three were later sold commercially as the English Electric DEUCE.

The R12000 used a 0.25 {{micrometre}} process to shrink the chip and achieve higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates.</b> The revised R14000 allowed higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> with additional support for DDR SRAM in the off-chip cache.

25|$|The 68000 {{and video}} {{controller}} took turns accessing DRAM every four CPU cycles during {{display of the}} frame buffer, while the 68000 had unrestricted access to DRAM during vertical and horizontal blanking intervals. Such an arrangement reduced the overall performance of the CPU as much as 35% for most code as the display logic often blocked the CPU's access to RAM. This made the machine run more slowly than several of its competitors, despite the nominally high <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Core {{microarchitecture}} {{returned to}} lower clock rates and improved {{the usage of}} both available clock cycles and power {{when compared with the}} preceding NetBurst microarchitecture of the Pentium 4/D-branded CPUs. The Core microarchitecture provides more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses, reducing the power consumption of Core 2-branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity. Intel's CPUs have varied widely in power consumption according to <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> architecture, and semiconductor process, shown in the CPU power dissipation tables.|$|E
25|$|Most 32-bit PCI cards will {{function}} {{properly in}} 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> {{will be limited}} to the clock frequency of the slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3, 66-MHz peripheral is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133MHz, the entire bus backplane {{will be limited to}} 66MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.|$|E
50|$|After QED was {{acquired}} by PMC-Sierra, the RM52xx and RM52x1 families were continued as PMC-Sierra products. PMC-Sierra introduced two RM52x1 derivatives, the RM5231A and RM5261A, on 4 April 2001. These microprocessors were fabricated by TSMC in its 0.18 μm process and differ from the previous devices by featuring higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> and lower power consumption. The RM5231A was available at <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> of 250 to 350 MHz, and the RM5261A from 250 to 400 MHz.|$|R
50|$|The Mendocino {{also came}} in a mobile variant, with <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> of 266, 300, 333, 366, 400, 433 and 466 MHz.|$|R

25|$|When {{combining}} the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift, the discrepancy is about 38 microseconds per day, {{a difference of}} 4.465 parts in 1010. Without correction, errors in the initial pseudorange of roughly 10km/day would accumulate. This initial pseudorange error is corrected {{in the process of}} solving the navigation equations. In addition the elliptical, rather than perfectly circular, satellite orbits cause the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift effects to vary with time. This eccentricity effect causes the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> difference between a GPS satellite and a receiver to increase or decrease depending on the altitude of the satellite.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} some {{similarities}} between the SPI bus and the JTAG (IEEE 1149.1-2013) protocol, they are not interchangeable. The SPI bus is intended for high speed, on board initialization of device peripherals, while the JTAG protocol is intended to provide reliable test access to the I/O pins from an off board controller with less precise signal delay and skew parameters. While not strictly a level sensitive interface, the JTAG protocol supports the recovery of both setup and hold violations between JTAG devices by reducing the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> or changing the clock's duty cycles. Consequently, the JTAG interface {{is not intended to}} support extremely high data rates.|$|E
25|$|The 68HC000, {{the first}} CMOS {{version of the}} 68000, was {{designed}} by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985. Motorola's version was called the MC68HC000, while Hitachi's was the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 was eventually offered at speeds of 8–20MHz. Except for using CMOS circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS MC68000, but the change to CMOS greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS MC68000 consumed around 1.35watts at an ambient temperature of 25°C, regardless of clock speed, while the MC68HC000 consumed only 0.13watts at 8MHz and 0.38watts at 20MHz. (Unlike CMOS circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with <b>clock</b> <b>rate.)</b> Apple selected the 68HC000 {{for use in the}} Macintosh Portable.|$|E
40|$|Accurate branch {{prediction}} {{is an essential}} component of a modern, deeply pipelined microprocessors. Because the branch predictor is on the critical path for fetching instructions, it must deliver a prediction in a single cycle. However, as feature sizes shrink and <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> increase, access delay will significantly decrease the size and accuracy of branch predictors that can be accessed in a single cycle. Thus, there is a tradeoff between {{branch prediction}} accuracy and latency. Deeper pipelines improve overall performance by allowing more aggressive <b>clock</b> <b>rates,</b> but some performance is lost due to increased branch misprediction penalties. Ironically, with shorter clock periods, the branch predictor has less time to make a prediction and might have to be scaled back to make it faster, which decreases accuracy and reduces the advantage of higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

25|$|Memory {{manufacturers}} {{stated that}} it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400MHz (i.e. 400 MT/s and 200MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.|$|R
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature it is unrealistic to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E
25|$|Tools such as XPostFacto and patches {{applied to}} the {{installation}} media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems {{that can be made}} to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 867MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing, the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} device performing the computations is synced with a clock that is running at frequencies {{on the order}} of mega-hertz (MHz) to giga-hertz (GHz). However, due to hardware pipelining, and complexity of some instructions, some operations take multiple clock cycles to complete. Therefore, it is not always necessary to sample the signal at such a high <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b> It is often possible to get information on all or most of the operations while sampling {{on the order of}} kilo-hertz (kHz). Different devices leak information at different frequencies. For example, Intel’s Atom processor will leak keys during RSA and AES encryption at frequencies between 50MHz and 85MHz. Android version 4.4’s Bouncy Castle library implementation of ECDSA is vulnerable to key extraction side channel attacks around the 50kHz range.|$|E
