We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|When Asche {{reached the}} major leagues, he was {{regarded}} as having decent potential at the plate, perhaps comparable to Mariners' third baseman Kyle Seager. While he hit for power in the minor leagues, his big league power {{was expected to be}} adequate, perhaps averaging 12–14 home runs per season. Baseball Prospect Nation reported that he [...] "gets pull happy when he sells out for power and ultimately swings too hard at times." [...] Like most left-handed hitters, Asche performed better against right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers, hitting [...]238 off the former and [...]219 off the latter in the major leagues during 2013. FanGraphs columnist Michael Barr summarized Asche's offensive potential by writing, [...] "He's <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a world beater, but having double digit home run and speed potential while hitting something in the [...]275 range is likely the kind of hitter than many of you could use at third base." ...|$|E

The aristocratic {{ruling class}} of Britain inhabiting {{their homes and}} castles were <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be regulated by some lowly civil servants. This view was exemplified in 1911 when the immensely wealthy Duke of Sutherland acting on a whim wished to dispose of Trentham Hall, a vast Italianate palace in Staffordshire. After failing to offload the house onto a local authority, he decided to demolish it. The small, but vocal, public resistance to this plan caused the Duke of Rutland to write an irate letter to The Times accusing the objectors of [...] "impudence" [...] and going on to say [...] "....fancy my not being allowed to make a necessary alteration to Haddon without first obtaining the leave of some inspector". There was an irony in the Duke of Rutland's words, as this same duke was responsible for resurrecting {{one of his own}} country houses, Haddon Hall, from ruin. Thus, despite money being no problem for its owner, Trentham Hall was completely obliterated from its park, which the Duke retained and then opened to the public. Thus it was that country houses were left unprotected by any compulsory legislation.|$|E

The {{following}} year, McCleery signed Derry’s first legend. Jimmy Kelly, born in Ballybofey, schooled in the Derry and District FA, and polished in the Anfield training grounds, returned to Derry and played his first game on 26 October 1930 against Linfield at Windsor Park. It took him four matches to get on the scoresheet. That goal against Glenavon F.C. was the first of 363 for Derry City in a career spanning almost 21 years. During that time he was capped by the IFA, the FAIFS, the Irish League and the League of Ireland. His arrival though did not inspire Derry who ended the 1930-31 league campaign in seventh place.|$|R

So aggrieved was Willie that he {{immediately}} offered a challenge to Vardon to play him over 72 holes, 36 holes at his home course of Musselburgh and 36 holes at a golf course of Vardon's choosing, for a wager of £100 per side. Willie Park, Jnr was not adverse to offering such challenges. Some years earlier he had met and defeated Ben Sayers at Musselburgh and North Berwick, and in 1897 Park defeated J.H. Taylor over two venues, also for £100 per side. Vardon refused Park's challenge. Besides the £100 per side, Vardon had nothing to gain from such a match, and he most <b>certainly</b> was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play Park at Musselburgh, where fan partisanship was less than courteous to rival players.|$|R

You almost <b>certainly</b> are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> think about the Aspen Institute’s 2014 report, Rising to the Challenge: Re-Envisioning Public Libraries. Nevertheless, these three things—beer, libraries, Rising to the Challenge—all came {{together}} in a digital collection created by Multnomah County Library called Portland Brew Stories. The Portland Brew Stories project was a community-focused effort to gather and share images and other primary documents that celebrate beer culture in Portland and Multnomah County. Planning began in 2014, {{the bulk of the}} project work took place in 2015, and the collection went live to the public in February 2016.

Finally, the article reflects briefly on how this project embodies the ideas and strategies in Rising to the Challenge...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} nowadays {{have made}} strict rules (and rightly so) for collectors, partly {{for the protection}} of the flora and fauna and to thwart unscrupulous exterminators of butterflies and orchids, partly, we suspect, also as a check on industrial espionage. Obviously, administrators behind their desks have no inkling of what dedicated botanists (and zoologists) are doing in the forest. Especially when the scientists come from the so-called ’rich’ countries the civil servants ask themselves why anybody would like to exchange a nice chair in an air-conditioned office with a lot of paper work for a most uncomfortable, hard log under a leaky fly in an insect-infested, humid, scary forest. Since they themselves <b>certainly</b> are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a look there for themselves, they suspect other motives, and until they find out what these are, scientists are under suspicion and should be kept on a leash.
