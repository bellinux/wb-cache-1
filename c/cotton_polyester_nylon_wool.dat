40|$|The dyeing {{processes}} can be reformulated {{to reduce}} the environmental pollution with economic advantages by the substitution of most auxiliary products with low cost, non-toxic and biodegradable products derived from natural sources. In a previous work a chemical substitution study was carried out with ethanol and the results showed a favorable effect of ethanol addition, at about 1 - 3 % v/v, on the dye uptake, with some differences depending on fiber nature and dye class. In the present study glycerol was considered as alternative to ethanol due to the very low volatility and high boiling point which make safer its use in industry. The effect of glycerol introduction without other additives in isothermal dyeing of various fiber yarns (<b>wool,</b> <b>cotton,</b> <b>polyester,</b> <b>nylon</b> 6 and acrylic) was experimented and {{compared with that of}} ethanol. Moreover the equilibrium data obtained were correlated with contact angle measurements of water-glycerol solutions on the yarns. Glycerol, like ethanol, is able to improve the dye uptake. In the case of synthetic fibers the wetting effect was confirmed by a minimum of interfacial tension in the range 1 - 3 % v/v of glycerol in water. However in the case of wool and cotton other effects should be considered, involving the glycerol penetration into the fiber structure favored by hydrogen bonds formation. Finally environmental benefits and cost savings arising from substitution of auxiliary agents with glycerol were considered and some advantages of glycerol in comparison with ethanol were highlighte...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{resistances}} {{of clothing}} assemblies comprising {{up to eight}} dry layers, in series, of a single fabric (either woven <b>cotton,</b> <b>polyester</b> or <b>nylon)</b> in air at atmospheric pressure have been measured and compared with other materials. Application of a compressive loading led typically to the resistance of a stack of eight polyester cloth layers falling from 46 x 10 - 3 Km 2 W- 1 under zero loading to 32 x 10 - 3 Km 2 W- 1 under 31 Nm- 2. The percentage reduction in resistance for an additional equal increment of loading would be considerably smaller. Under load, the thermal behaviour of multiple layer assemblies is identical {{to that of a}} single layer of the same material and overall thickness and so it was concluded that contact resistances between successive layers are usually of secondary importance for clothing fabrics in air at atmospheric pressure and that the insulation provided by such an assembly is primarily dependent upon the volume of air held stagnant within the matrix, provided that no thermal radiation [`]windows' are present. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of a textile requires several stages of mechanical processing such as spinning, weaving, knitting, and garment production, which seem to be insulated from the wet treatment processes like pretreatment, dyeing, printing, and finishing operations. Тhere is a strong interrelation between treatment processes in the dry state and consecutive wet treatments. Most of the processes and products {{have a negative impact}} on the environment. Laws and standards for environmental protection and prescribed strict criteria, in accordance with the laws of the European Union, forced this to be in the spotlight of the textile industry. The textile industry emits a wide variety of pollutants in all stages in the processing of fibres and textile materials. They are: liquid effluent, solid waste, hazardous waste, emissions in the air and noises. Most of the textile waste is composed of natural and synthetic polymeric materials such as: <b>cotton,</b> <b>polyester,</b> <b>nylon,</b> and polypropylene. Recovery from the waste stream includes re-use of a product in its original form and recycling to convert the waste into a new product. Textile recycling is one of the categories for waste management in the textile industries. Typically, recycling technologies are divided into: primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary approaches. Primary approaches involve recycling a product into its original form. Secondary recycling involves melt processing a plastic product into a new product that has a lower level of physical, mechanical and chemical properties. Tertiary recycling involves processes such as: pyrolysis and hydrolysis, which convert the plastic wastes into basic chemicals or fuels. Quaternary recycling refers to burning the textile solid waste and utilizing the heat generated. The predominant method of solid textile waste managment is landfilling. The processes of {{production of}} textiles or wet treatments and finishing processes of textile materials (finishing, dyeing, printing, etc [...] ) are huge consumers of water with high quality. As a result of these various processes, considerable amounts of polluted water are released. There is no single effective treatment of wastewater from the textile industry and it is necessary using a combination of methods in order to achieve the required standards. End-of-pipe technologies are used for wastewater treatment and include sequential application of a set of methods: coagulation / flocculation, flotation, adsorption, evaporation, oxidation, combustion, usе of membranes, etc., that have been adapted to the particular situation of a textile plant. As a result of the extreme variety of textile processes and products, it is impossible to develop a realistic concept for an effective treatment of wastewater without a detailed analysis of the actual situation in the textile plant. It is important to explore all aspects of reducing emissions and waste products from the textile industry because it will result not only in improved environmental performance, but also in substantial savings on individual textile companies. ...|$|R
40|$|Wet textile {{colouration}} has {{the highest}} environmental impact of all textile processing steps. It consumes water, chemicals and energy and produces liquid, heat and gas waste streams.

Polyester fibres had the lowest impact on the environment with lowest water and energy consumption in dyeing, good dye bath exhaustion, the lowest salinity levels in their effluent, relatively neutral pH effluent and low energy in drying. The <b>wool</b> and <b>nylon</b> had similar dye bath requirements and outputs however the nylon could be dyed at far lower liquor ratios and hence provided better energy and water use figures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{improved}} (up-to-date) insight into the environmental burden of textiles made of the base materials <b>cotton,</b> <b>polyester</b> (PET), <b>nylon,</b> acryl, and elastane. The research question is: Which base material and which life cycle stage (cradle-to-gate as well as cradle-to-grave) have the biggest impact on the environment? Methods: Life cycle inventory (LCI) data are collected from the literature, life cycle assessment (LCA) databases, and emission registration database of the Dutch government, as well as communications with both manufacturing companies of production equipment and textile companies. The output of the calculations is presented in four single indicators: Ecocosts 2012 (a prevention-based indicator), CO 2 equivalent (carbon footprint), cumulative energy demand (CED), and ReCiPe (a damage-based indicator). Results and discussion: From an analysis of the data, it becomes clear that the environmental burden is not only a function of the base materials (cotton, PET, nylon, acryl, and elastane) but also of the thickness of the yarn (for this research, the range of 50 – 500 dtex is examined). The authors propose that the environmental burden of spinning, weaving, and knitting is a function of 1 /yarn size. The cradle-to-grave analysis from raw material extraction to discarded textile demonstrates that textiles made out of acryl and PET have the least impact on the environment, followed by elastane, nylon, and cotton. The use phase has less relative impact than it is suggested in the classical literature. Conclusions: The impact of spinning and weaving is relatively high (for yarn thicknesses of less than 100 dtex), and from the environmental point of view, knitting is better than weaving. LCA on textiles can only be accurate when the yarn thickness is specified. In case the functional unit also indicates the fabric per square meter, the density must be known. LCA results of textile products over the whole value chain are case dependent, especially when dyeing and finishing processes and the use phase and end-of-life are included in the analysis. Further LCI data studies on textiles and garments are urgently needed to lower the uncertainties in contemporary LCA of textile materials and products...|$|R
