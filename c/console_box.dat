5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary <b>console</b> <b>box</b> connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E

5000|$|GMK Camina — the {{successor}} of the Chevrolet 1700 based on Holden Torana and introduced in March 1976. The car {{shared the same}} chassis with the Chevrolet 1700 but had a downsized 1,495 cc engine producing [...] and 11.2 kgm Nm. GMK also attempted to make car more luxurious adding <b>console</b> <b>box,</b> new door trims and adjustable bucket seats. However, the smaller engine was underpowered and couldn't balance out the car's weight very well. The Camina was discontinued in January 1978 with only 922 cars sold.|$|E
50|$|In April 1976, {{the third}} {{generation}} Minicab was introduced. In keeping with the changes in vehicle tax regulations, the Minicab 5 (L012) featured an increase in length, and adopted the enlarged 471 cc Vulcan S engine from the car line, still with the same max power as the 360. It also incorporated new features like a windscreen defroster, a central <b>console</b> <b>box</b> and a central ventilation system. This engine did not {{take full advantage of}} the new regulations, which allowed up to 550 cc, and was only used in a short-lived group of interim models.|$|E

A special edition of the Executive was also developed, featuring a specially designed [...] "mobile office" [...] themed <b>console</b> <b>box,</b> a 6.5 inch LCD TV and a VCD player. Additionally, two Proton Perdana V6 Limousine variants were released offering extended wheelbases of 66 cm (26 in) and 91 cm (36 in) respectively over the original Perdana V6, and sported far more luxury equipment compared to the Executive variant.|$|E
50|$|Many {{traditional}} {{network television}} shows, movies and other video content {{is now available}} online, either from the content owner directly or from third party services. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Synaptop, Amazon Video, FlickRocket and other Internet-based video services allow content owners to let users access their content on computers, smart phones, tablets or by using appliances such as video game <b>consoles,</b> set-top <b>boxes</b> or Smart TVs.|$|R
50|$|When {{using an}} Ethernet or ADSL home {{backhaul}} connection, an Access Point Base Station must either share the backhaul bandwidth with other services, such as Internet browsing, gaming <b>consoles,</b> set-top <b>boxes</b> and triple-play equipment in general, or alternatively directly replace these functions within an integrated unit. In shared-bandwidth approaches, {{which are the}} majority of designs currently being developed, the effect on quality of service may be an issue.|$|R

5000|$|Dodge {{introduced}} the Ram's all-new [...] "big-rig" [...] styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly polarizing looks, exposure was also gained by {{usage of the}} new truck on the hit TV show Walker, Texas Ranger starring Chuck Norris. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a <b>console</b> <b>box</b> {{big enough to hold}} a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins turbo-diesel remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned in the same vein for 1997, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive [...] "face" [...] that set them apart from the competition.|$|E
50|$|After {{the trouble}} between worker unions at the Maruti Suzuki Plant in India, plans {{are being made}} to {{transfer}} the building plant to Indonesia, {{as most of the}} orders are from that country. The versions of that county's Ertiga is also different. It has five versions, the GA (standard), GL (more equipped than GA), GX (mid-range), Elegant (GX with aerokit and interior luxuries), and Sporty (GX-based limited edition with special body kit, similar to Suzuki Swift Sport). All version comes in 5-speed manual or 4-speed auto, while GA only have manual option. In January 2013, Ertiga with double blower AC was introduced. Though was based from Swift, the second AC blower was placed on the interior platform like other pickup-based MPVs, such as the Toyota Kijang Innova or the Isuzu Panther, unlike another non-pickup-based MPV such as Nissan Grand Livina which its second AC blower was placed in rear <b>console</b> <b>box.</b> On May 2013, Ertiga with automatic transmission was introduced for GL & GX type.|$|E

40|$|A new {{surgical}} simulator {{is developed}} for spine needle biopsy, that provides realistic visual and force feedback to a trainee in the PC environment. This system {{is composed of}} four parts: a 3 D human model, visual feedback tool, force feedback device, and an evaluation section. The 3 D human model includes multi-slice XCT images, segmentation results, and forcefeedback parameters. A block-based technique is adopted for efficient handling of large amounts of data and for easy control of rendering parameters such as opacity. For visual feedback, we implement a virtual CT <b>console</b> <b>box</b> and a 3 D visualization tool providing MIP, MPR, summed voxel projection, and realistic 3 D color volume rendering view. The visualization tool is for interactive 3 D path planning. A haptic device is used to provide force feedback to the biopsy needle during simulation. The interactive force is generated in a voxel-based manner. After each simulation, the evaluation section provides a performance analysis to the trainee. We implemented the system by attaching a 3 DOF PHANToMTM device to a PC with 600 MHz Pentium III Dual CPUs and 5 1 2 Mbyte RAM...|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the Capitol Theatre Center {{underwent}} a seven-year restoration that {{was completed in}} 2003. The name of the theatre was changed to Capitol Theatre Center and was envisioned {{to be the main}} theater in Chambersburg. The Capitol Theatre Center now featured an improved stage and a completely renovated auditorium. The main floor was leveled and resurfaced; the stage was enlarged and extended, and the dressing rooms were redecorated. A hydraulic lift was added for the organ <b>console,</b> lighting <b>boxes</b> were installed in the auditorium, and 524 new seats were installed, including 8 wheelchair spaces. In the balcony of the theatre, walls were repainted and the seating platforms were reconstructed. On the first floor, wheelchair accessible bathrooms were built and offices were added for the Capitol Theatre Center management.|$|R

50|$|The term box art (also {{called a}} game cover or cover art) {{can refer to}} the artwork {{on the front of}} PC or <b>console</b> game packaging. <b>Box</b> art is usually flashy and bombastic, in the vein of movie posters, and serves a similar purpose. Additionally, {{screenshots}} {{on the back of the}} box often mix in-game sequences with pre-rendered sections. Historically, art featured on the box has been in excess of what the computer or console was technically capable of displaying. Veteran San Francisco box art illustrator Marc Ericksen, who produced nearly 100 illustrations for video games from 1982 to 2003, including games like Tengen's Tetris, Capcom's Megaman 2, Atari 7800's Galaga, Data East's Bad Dudes, and SNK's Guerrilla War contends that there was very little in the screen graphics to sell the games. The sales arms needed illustrations to introduce a visual construct to acquaint young gamers to the gameplay concepts. The graphics were exciting when in motion, but offered very little to engage a prospective purchaser's attention when static. Illustrators were less frequently required beyond the year 2000, when screen graphics reached parity with illustrations and could be utilized as cover art.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1986-1993 model years, {{there were}} mainly three trim levels {{available}} in North America: Base, SE-5, LX, and LE-5. The base model came with standard 14-inch steel wheels {{and not much}} else besides the basics (this did not include a rear step bumper). The SE-5 was the [...] "sporty" [...] trim level, with added features such as a tachometer, side-mounted truck mirrors, a rear step bumper, an AM/FM stereo, sporty white/black wheels, white-lettered Bridgestone SF Radial tires (which have long since been discontinued), and a prominent stripe graphic kit, the latter being the most easily distinguishable feature of the SE-5. The LX was the more luxurious trim level, with standard features that made it the most well-equipped trim line of the bunch. Such added features included air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with cassette deck and equalizer, center <b>console,</b> locking glove <b>box,</b> and chrome trim throughout (interior door handles and window cranks, taillight bezels, chrome added trim {{on the sides of the}} body, a chrome rear step bumper, a chrome strip on the front bumper, and the same steel wheels that came with the SE-5 but with a chrome finish). For the 1990 model year, the LX trim level was replaced with the LE-5, which combined a hybrid of styling and features from both the LX and SE-5.|$|R
50|$|The first AFRS {{stations}} established {{under the}} Central Pacific Command {{were set up}} on the Tarawa Atoll and islet of Makin, both located in the Gilbert Islands, in November 1943. Three more stations, on Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands and one on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, went on the air in February 1944. Teams of military broadcast specialists were trained at AFRS' headquarters in Los Angeles to operate radio stations. Later, they traveled to Hawaii, where they picked up equipment and briefed on their assignment and local conditions, and then proceeded to their posts by whatever means they were able to travel. Some of the teams carried complete radio transmitting equipment: 50-watt transmitters, turntables, a tiny mixing <b>console</b> and several <b>boxes</b> of records. A few teams were provided with short-wave receivers so they could monitor AFRS newscasts from San Francisco. Each team usually consisted of an officer and five or six enlisted men. Upon reaching its destination, a team operated by whatever means they could. Electrical generators were often hard to acquire, and a station often had to provide its own independent power source. In the Central Pacific, once a station had been set up and broadcasting, locally based servicemen were trained to operate the outlet. Usually, after the team was sure that the station could be run by the local GIs, they returned to Honolulu for reassignment to another location. This connected conglomerate of military stations became known as the Pacific Ocean Network (PON).|$|R
