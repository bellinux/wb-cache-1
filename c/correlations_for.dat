40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to correlate metabolic and hormonal parameters before and after 8, 16, and 24 weeks (wk) of moderate aerobic training in individuals with chronic primary insomnia. Method. Four male and sixteen female volunteers (adults, sedentary, and healthy) performed exercise training for 24 weeks. Blood and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was obtained at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 [*]wk of training. Results. PSQI scores decreased after 8, 16, and 24 [*]wk of training regarding baseline values. Indeed, total sleep time (TST) increased after 16 and 24 [*]wk of exercise training regarding baseline values. The correlations were analyzed using the delta (Δ) values (Δ 1 = 8 [*]wk less baseline; Δ 2 = 16 [*]wk less baseline; Δ 3 = 24 [*]wk less baseline). We have observed a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> Δ 1 between TST and cortisol, a positive <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> Δ 3 between TST and growth hormone, a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> Δ 1 between TST and VLDL, a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> Δ 1 between TST and triacylglycerols, and a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> Δ 1 and Δ 2 between TST and thyroid-stimulating hormone.

2500|$|Twin {{studies have}} also been {{important}} {{in the creation of}} the five factor personality model: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> identical twins were [...]50, while for fraternal they were about [...]20. It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.|$|E
