A major inflow of Jewish immigrants, as well as foreigners from Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, China and Japan, invigorated the industry and helped to make Barranquilla a modern city. Of these immigrants, the Arab and Jewish from the Midde East immigrants were prominent, referred to wrongly as [...] "Turks" [...] by the Colombian people. As a result, during the first half of the twentieth century, Barranquilla became one of the fastest growing cities of Colombia, growing at rates well above other Colombian cities, which was maintained until the 1970s.
