5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, <b>cordwood</b> and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E
25|$|Cob-like mixes {{are also}} used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, <b>cordwood,</b> and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary {{ingredient}} of natural building.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cordwood</b> {{construction}} {{can save}} significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space {{was at a}} premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In <b>cordwood</b> construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had {{to be used to}} allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of <b>cordwood</b> construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{integrated}} circuits, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used {{by a number of}} computer vendors including Control Data Corporation. The <b>cordwood</b> method of construction was used only rarely once semiconductor electronics and PCBs became widespread.|$|E
25|$|Fernow's {{plan called}} for clearcutting the tract {{at the rate of}} several {{thousand}} acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and <b>cordwood</b> from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a -long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the <b>cordwood</b> into methanol and charcoal, through a process called destructive distillation.|$|E
25|$|After a while, the {{expressway}} {{passes the}} North Wantagh Park, and {{connects to the}} Southern State Parkway at exit4. There, the expressway makes a curve to the northeast, crossing over <b>Cordwood</b> Lane on an overpass. The direction of the expressway begins to straighten, until exit5, where it encounters NY107. Soon after, the expressway comes upon exit6, which is for Boundary Avenue (CR 97), a connector to the nearby Bethpage State Parkway. From there, the expressway turns {{to the north and}} begins to parallel the Bethpage Parkway as it meets NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike).|$|E
25|$|The second, in October 2004, was {{the killing}} of 84 Muslim demonstrators at Tak Bai, when the Army broke up a {{peaceful}} protest. Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like <b>cordwood.</b> The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims {{were reported to have}} been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.|$|E
25|$|The dock {{allowed the}} mainland’s {{hardwood}} forest to be harvested. Kelderhouse bought land and began processing <b>cordwood</b> {{to sell to}} passing ships for firewood. He built a sawmill near the John Burfiend farm. Port Oneida grew considerably over the next 30 years to include many commercial enterprises. Among these were a general store, a post office, a blacksmith shop and a boarding house. There were also two large barns built by other farmers. Kelderhouse owned most of the commercial buildings at Port Oneida and {{about half of the}} land on Pyramid Point. He built his home at Port Oneida. Kelderhouse also bought a gristmill on the Crystal River from John Fisher in 1866 to process grains.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1800, the tenders Pickle and Garland recaptured the {{schooner}} Hero. She had a crew {{of seven}} men and was 136 tons burthen (bm). She was out of Guadeloupe, sailing from Pointe Petre to Saint Bartholomew with a load of <b>cordwood.</b> A week later, the same two vessels captured the Dutch schooner Maria. She had {{a crew of}} 19 men, armed with small arms, and was of 35 tons burthen (bm). She was from Curaçao, sailing from Curaçao to Guadeloupe with a cargo of dry goods. Then on 9 May, Pickle alone took the schooner Jack, of Boston, sailing from Boston to Martinique with a cargo of cattle. Pickles commander is given as Mr. William Black.|$|E
25|$|Clay {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} materials on Earth, among other ancient, naturally-occurring geologic materials such as stone and organic materials like wood. Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. Also a primary ingredient in many natural building techniques, clay is used to create adobe, cob, <b>cordwood,</b> and rammed earth structures and building elements such as wattle and daub, clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay paints and ceramic building material. Clay was used as a mortar in brick chimneys and stone walls where protected from water.|$|E
25|$|They {{continued}} down river, hitting more rapids and cutting wood from {{trees along the}} bank for fuel. Captain Miller sent two men ahead in a boat to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them. They ran a particularly hazardous stretch at the Mountain Sheep section in Seven Devils Canyon. The boat was sucked into a whirlpool, and a huge wall of water came aboard, breaking into and nearly flooding the engine room, washing big chunks of <b>cordwood</b> all about the engine room floor. As {{the men in the}} engine room dodged these hazards, the Shoshone ran through a passage so narrow that {{there were only a few}} inches clearance between the rock walls on both sides of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{first signs}} of decline {{appeared}} in 1880 and became obvious {{toward the end of}} the year. Promising mining booms in Butte, Montana; Tombstone, Arizona; and Utah lured men away from Bodie. The get-rich-quick, single miners who came to the town in the 1870s moved on to these other booms, and Bodie developed into a family-oriented community. In 1882 residents built the Methodist Church (which still stands) and the Roman Catholic Church (burned about 1930). Despite the population decline, the mines were flourishing, and in 1881 Bodie's ore production was recorded at a high of $3.1 million. Also in 1881, a narrow-gauge railroad was built called the Bodie Railway & Lumber Company, bringing lumber, <b>cordwood,</b> and mine timbers to the mining district from Mono Mills south of Mono Lake.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the cover}} of fog, an advance force of 4,000 men {{under the command of}} General Henry Clinton was landed on Throgs Neck. [...] To their dismay, they found they were not on a peninsula, but on an island, {{separated}} from the mainland by a creek and a marsh. [...] There were two ways to get to the mainland: a causeway and bridge at the lower end, and a ford at the other. [...] The Americans were guarding both. [...] Col. Edward Hand and a detachment of 25 men from the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment positioned themselves behind a length of <b>cordwood</b> along the causeway, after having removed the planks of wood from the bridge. They surprised the British troops, who fell back and made an attempt to cross at the ford, which was guarded by another detachment. [...] The Americans guarding both positions were quickly reinforced, and the defenders soon numbered over 1,800 men. [...] Howe decided {{it would be better to}} retreat and land somewhere else. [...] He made camp on Throgs Neck and remained there for six days while supplies and reinforcements, including 7,000 Hessian soldiers under the command of Gen. Wilhelm von Knyphausen, were brought up from New York. [...] Just after midnight on October 18, Howe embarked his army again and decided to land at Pell's Point near the town of Pelham, a few miles to the north.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cordwood</b> {{construction}} {{is a term}} used for a natural building method in which [...] "cordwood" [...] or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall. The <b>cordwood,</b> thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a timber frame structure. <b>Cordwood</b> masonry can be combined with other methods [...] (e.g., rammed earth, cob or light clay) to produce attractive combinations. <b>Cordwood</b> masonry construction provides a relatively high thermal mass, which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The Phoenix reached Manitowoc, Wisconsin {{just before}} midnight on 20 November. [...] The ship took on <b>cordwood</b> for fuel and {{unloaded}} cargo {{while waiting for}} the weather to improve. [...] The Phoenix departed Manitowoc at 1 am on 21 November.|$|E
2500|$|Both Northwestern and Langley {{were still}} wood-burners {{at the start}} of the 1947 season. [...] They {{depended}} on Native Alaskans to cut and sell <b>cordwood</b> to them. [...] Prices for the marten furs trapped and sold by Native Alaskans had dropped to $15 a pelt, down from the 1946 high of $100. [...] With fur prices down, to earn money the Native Alaskans supplied wood in 1947 in such supply that owners of Northwestern and Langley were able to postpone conversion to oil-firing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{materials}} {{common to}} {{many types of}} natural building are clay and sand. [...] When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form cob or adobe (clay blocks). [...] Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as rammed earth or earth bag), wood (<b>cordwood</b> or timber frame/post-and-beam), straw, rice-hulls, bamboo and stone. A wide variety of reused or recycled non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1800, the tenders [...] and Garland recaptured the {{schooner}} Hero. Hero had a crew {{of seven}} men and was 136 tons burthen (bm). She was out of Guadeloupe, sailing from Pointe Petre to Saint Bartholomew with a load of <b>cordwood.</b> A week later, Pickle and Garland captured the Dutch schooner Maria. Maria had {{a crew of}} 19 men, armed with small arms, and was of 35 tons (bm) burthen. She was from Curaçao, sailing from Curaçao to Guadeloupe with a cargo of dry goods.|$|E
2500|$|Oregon {{shipping}} interests {{had been}} pressing {{for a government}} takeover of the Willamette Falls Locks. [...] This would act in effect as a subsidy to the shipping interests, as the government would operate the locks on a toll-free basis. [...] In 1915, the government did purchase the locks at Willamette Falls, but the prospect of increased business for steamers never materialized. [...] In 1915, the only vessels regularly using the locks, aside from some <b>cordwood</b> barges coming downriver, were the O.C.T.C. boats, Grahamona, Pomona, and Oregona.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{numbers of}} illegal {{immigrants}} die in car accidents and other accidental causes. According to a December 2006 cover story in the San Diego Reader, [...] "...traffic fatalities involving immigrants {{have more than doubled}} since 2003 as coyotes, or polleros – the guides leading migrants across the border – try other methods. On August 7, nine migrants died in a crash in the Yuma sector when the driver of a Chevrolet Suburban – in which 21 Mexicans were [...] "stacked like <b>cordwood</b> – lost control after crossing a Border Patrol spike strip at high speed. This year the number killed in traffic accidents during illegal crossings is about 50." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lytton was {{a typical}} Columbia River steamer. She had three decks, the first one being {{reserved}} for freight, machinery and crew quarters, the second for passengers, including cabins and an observation saloon. Down {{the center of the}} passenger deck was a dining room with raised clerestory windows At the front of the top deck was placed the pilot house. Just behind the pilot house was a small structure called the [...] "", which contained cabins for the officers. Behind the [...] was the vessel's single funnel, and {{on the front of the}} funnel was the steamer's whistle. In the case of Lytton, the funnel flared out in cone near the top, and may have been fitted with a spark arrestor. This detail was somewhat unusual and allows Lytton to be more readily identified in photographs of the period. The foredeck was open, and was often heavily loaded with <b>cordwood</b> fuel or cargo.|$|E
2500|$|The Erie Canal {{opened in}} 1825, {{allowing}} settlers from New England and New York to reach Michigan by water through Albany and Buffalo. This route opening and {{the incorporation of}} Chicago in 1837, increased Great Lakes steamboat traffic from Detroit through the straits of Mackinaw to Chicago. [...] While the coastal areas were travelled, practically nothing was known about the interior parts of Northern Michigan. When Michigan became a state in 1837, one of its first acts was to name Douglass Houghton as {{the lead of the}} Michigan Geological Survey, an effort to understand the geological and mineralogical, zoological, botanical, and topographical aspects of the lesser known parts of Michigan. [...] Early settlers came to the coasts along Northern Michigan, including fishermen, missionaries to the Native Americans, and participants in early Great Lakes maritime industries such as fishing, lighthouses, and cutting <b>cordwood</b> for passing ships. In 1835, Lieutenant Benjamin Poole of the 3rd U.S. Artillery. surveyed a former Indian path between Saginaw and Mackinac that would become known as the Mackinac Trail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{property}} {{that became the}} Buckner farm was originally settled by William (Bill) Buzzard. [...] It is located several miles north of Lake Chelan along the Stehekin River. [...] When Buzzard arrived in 1889, his [...] parcel was the farthest homestead from the Stehekin settlement {{at the head of}} the lake. [...] Buzzard built a one-story log cabin on the site, and cleared some land for pasture and cultivation. [...] In 1892, Buzzard shipped 1,000 pounds of potatoes [...] down Lake Chelan to the town of Chelan, Washington and sold the rest of his crop to local miners. [...] By 1895, Buzzard had planted a small apple orchard and was growing cabbages as well as potatoes. [...] Buzzard also cut <b>cordwood</b> on his property and sold it to the steamboat company that operated on Lake Chelan. [...] According to a 1902 United States Forest Service report on [...] "agricultural settlement" [...] in the Stehekin area, William Buzzard had a three-room house, log barn, and [...] of cultivated land. [...] On 9 November 1903, Buzzard officially purchased his homestead from the United States Government. [...] He later sold [...] to a neighbor.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the other}} Great Lakes, Lake Ontario {{used to have}} an {{important}} commercial fishery. It has been largely destroyed, mostly by over-fishing. [...] Consider the Lake Sturgeon as but one example. Lake sturgeon are huge fish—they can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190kg in weight. [...] The females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity. It was once an abundant species in Lake Ontario. [...] "In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer." [...] It was even stacked like <b>cordwood</b> and used to fuel steamboats. [...] Once its value was realized, [...] "They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets, poundnets and gillnets." [...] Over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the lake sturgeon is rare now, and is protected in many areas. Populations in the Oswego River are being actively managed for recovery.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, siree," [...] Tarwater {{declared}} emphatically. [...] "But there's always post-holes to dig, and <b>cordwood</b> to chop, and the climate's fine [...] " ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when the}} Kid laughed harshly {{and turned on}} his heel, Davy flung himself upon the piles and began frantically to toss the <b>cordwood</b> back from the bank.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but it's {{my duty to}} try. When {{you have}} helped Frank up, {{you can take the}} extra team and haul in the <b>cordwood.</b> I'll be back from the {{railroad}} about dark to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|But, my dear fellow, this is preposterous. Why, {{these are}} the very things I had bought for you. If you won't take any of these, I shall {{have to give you}} factory cotton and <b>cordwood.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "By attacking {{that with}} the {{heaviest}} sticks of <b>cordwood</b> after the brute is killed, {{we should be able}} to pound our way through in a very few seconds. Now come on, and work lively after we are in the yard." ...|$|E
60|$|But Davy {{fell upon}} the <b>cordwood.</b> Donald stalked {{back to the}} cabin, buckled on his money belt and Davy's, {{and went out to}} the point of the island where the ground was highest and where a huge pine towered above its fellows.|$|E
6000|$|But he {{softened}} when {{he looked}} at the accounts and saw that I had actually booked the unparalleled number of thirty-three new subscribers, and had the vegetables to show for it, <b>cordwood,</b> cabbage, beans, and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{this time}} they had arrived at what {{appeared}} to be little more than a clearing in the woods, where was situated a rude log house of two stories, around which was piled a complete circle of <b>cordwood</b> not less than six feet high.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "a fellow {{like the}} one you speak of came in here about an hour ago. His team looked pretty used up {{and he wanted to}} hire another, but I couldn't deal. Keep my horses hauling <b>cordwood</b> through the winter, and the only team I have in the stable is ordered by a drummer for to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harry laughed. [...] "If she {{has come}} down from Seattle they'd get plenty <b>cordwood</b> or, if they wanted it, stove coal there, and I guess a skipper wouldn't waste a fair wind like this one to save two or three dollars. The thing's mighty curious. That vessel's been seen twice, anyway, and nobody seems to know where she comes from or where she goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I kin prove a alybi," [...] {{answered}} the little man, calming down somewhat. [...] "I kin prove my ol' woman had me {{locked up in}} the chicken-coop thet night 'cause I wouldn't split a lot o' <b>cordwood</b> thet were full o' knots." [...] He cast a half fearful glance over his shoulder toward {{the interior of the}} cottage. [...] "Next day I split 'em," [...] he added, mildly.|$|E
6000|$|... "So no extravagance. You {{are taking}} three hundred men down with you. The {{chances are that}} twice as many more will go down {{as soon as the}} river freezes. You'll have a {{thousand}} to feed through the winter. Put them on rations,--working rations,--and see that they work. <b>Cordwood,</b> six dollars per cord, and piled on the bank where steamers can make a landing. No work, no rations. Understand?" ...|$|E
