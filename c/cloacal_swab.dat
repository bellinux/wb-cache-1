40|$|Background: The rapidly {{expanding}} availability of de novo sequencing technologies {{can greatly facilitate}} efforts to monitor the relatively high mutation rates of influenza A viruses and the detection of quasispecies. Both the mutation rates and the lineages of influenza A viruses are likely {{to play an important}} role in the natural history of these viruses and the emergence of phenotypically and antigenically distinct strains. Methodology and Principal Findings: We evaluated quasispecies and mixed infections by de novo sequencing the whole genomes of 10 virus isolates, including eight avian influenza viruses grown in embryonated chicken eggs (six waterfowl isolates- five H 3 N 2 and one H 4 N 6; an H 7 N 3 turkey isolate; and a bald eagle isolate with H 1 N 1 /H 2 N 1 mixed infection), and two tissue cultured H 3 N 2 swine influenza viruses. Two waterfowl cloacal swabs were included in the analysis. Full-length sequences of all segments were obtained with 20 to 787 -X coverage for the ten viruses and one <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab.</b> The second <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> yielded 15 influenza reads of, 230 bases, sufficient for bioinformatic inference of mixed infections or quasispecies. Genomic subpopulations or quasispecies of viruses were identified in four egg grown avian influenza isolates and one cell cultured swine virus.

None belonged to common serotypes isolated from humans or animals {{in recent years in}} Canada. Tests for antimicrobial drug resistance among 187 commensal Escherichia coli isolates from the <b>cloacal</b> <b>swabs</b> indicated that < or = 5 % were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. This contrasts with the frequently high resistance rates among E. coli isolates from poultry. Pharyngeal swabs from DCC were negative for Pasteurella multocida. Culture of <b>cloacal</b> <b>swabs</b> from 100 ground-nesting DCC chicks resulted in the recovery of 19 Salmonella isolates, all of which were S. enterica serotype Typhimurium. None of these isolates were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. Altogether, these findings suggest that DCC from this region are not being colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria from agricultural or human sources and that enteric bacteria isolated from these birds are unlikely to contribute to a gene pool of antimicrobial drug resistance.

40|$|Objective: To {{standardize}} an ELISA {{protocol to}} quantify total immunoglobulin A (IgA) from different biological samples. Methods: Two independent experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, total IgA levels were quantified from the lachrymal fluid, tracheal swab, and <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> at various time points from Days 30 to 89 in white Leghorn chickens. Experiment 2 {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of 50 or 500  ppb of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) on total IgA quantified in samples from the lachrymal fluid, tracheal swab, gut content and <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> in broiler chickens at 21 days of age. Results: Lachrymal fluid contained {{the highest level of}} IgA; however, the sampling procedure was time consuming and stressful to the bird, and the sample volume depends largely {{on the size of the}} chicken. Cloacal swabs also contained a high concentration of IgA; this sampling procedure was faster than lachrymal fluid sampling and was not affected by the age of the bird. Tracheal sampling was more difficult than cloacal sampling; the age of the bird limited the sampling, and the IgA concentration was the lowest detected at all sampling ages. 500  ppb of AFB 1 significantly reduced total IgA concentration in the gut content compared with control or 50  ppb of AFB 1 treated groups. Interestingly, a significant reduction in total IgA was also observed in those chickens that received 50  ppb of AFB 1 in gut rinse when compared with cloacal swabs.

In this study, a faster, real-time PCR approach was validated in comparative and collaborative trials, based on recommendations from the Nordic system for validation of alternative microbiological methods (NordVal). The comparative real-time PCR trial was performed in comparison to two reference culture protocols on naturally contaminated samples (99 shoe covers, 101 cloacal swabs, 102 neck skins from abattoirs, and 100 retail neck skins). Culturing included enrichment in both Bolton and Preston broths followed by isolation on Preston agar and mCCDA. In one or both culture protocols, 169 samples were identified as positive. The comparative trial resulted in relative accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98 %, 95 %, and 97 %, respectively. The collaborative trial included nine laboratories testing neck skin, <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab,</b> and shoe cover samples, spiked with low, medium, and high concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni. Valid results were obtained from six of the participating laboratories. Accuracy for high levels was 100 % for neck skin and <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> samples.

Samples from carcasses of the family Corvidae have been used in the surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) since the virus was detected in the United States in 1999 (1). Various laboratories have used organs such as brain, kidney, and spleen to isolate the virus in cell culture, or to detect the virus by using a variety of techniques, or both (2). WNV surveillance efforts (3, 4) have reported 50 %– 70 % of corvids as WNV positive. Postmortem oral and cloacal swabs, along with the brain, are suitable for detecting the virus in experimentally infected birds (5). Previous studies have shown that WNV may be isolated from feather pulp of experimentally infected crows (National Wildlife Health Center, unpub. data).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{incidence}} of the psittacine beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) {{was investigated in}} Brazilian native parrots with normal feathering arriving at rescue and triage centers for wild animals (CETAS, IBAMA) {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. BFDV DNA was investigated by previously described PCR technique for the partial amplification of BFDV ORF- 1 in DNA extracts from blood, <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> or liver of psittacines. Some birds provided more than one sample. Nine species of psittacines were sampled between January 2009 and October 2010. Blood (n= 46) or <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> (n= 128) samples were obtained from psittacines immediately upon arrival at the triage centers. Liver samples were collected from necropsied birds dead on arrival (n= 167). All swab samples were negative, except for one Ara ararauna individual (n= 3) which blood presented the BFDV DNA. On the other hand, 11 liver samples were positive for BFDV DNA, with a prevalence of 7. 8 % in Amazona aestiva (n= 140). No BFDV DNA was detected in the liver of Amazona amazonica (n= 11), A. vinacea (n= 5), A. rhodochorytha (n= 4), Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus (n= 3), Ara ararauna, (n= 3), Aratinga leucophtalma (n= 2), Guarouba guarouba (n= 1) and Pionus maximiliani (n= 1). In most cases, alopecia was not associated with BFDV detection in liver, and liver histopathology was inconclusive. Although all <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> samples were negative, a few psittacines (n= 19) that died at CETAS-Belo Horizonte were retested, and 21 % were detected as positive in liver. A group of psittacines (n= 16) was clinically evaluated, and despite showing feather dystrophy, all birds were negative in the cloacal swabs, except for one, which blood sample was positive (A. ararauna). The obtained sequences of the BFDV strains BH 215 and BH 732 were deposited in the GenBank (JQ 649409 and JQ 649410). A 98 % similarity with strain sequences described in Australia, Japan, and New Zealand was observed. It is possible that these strains arrived in Brazil through the legal and illegal trade of parrots. However, {{it was not possible to}} associate BFDV infection with the geographical origin of birds and no local marker was detected. The rates of detection, although similar to other studies, indicate the tendency of a high {{incidence of}} the disease, possibly associated with stress, and high bird density and wide transmission in captivity conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceProventricular {{dilatation}} disease (PDD) is a fatal {{infectious disease}} of birds that primarily affects psittacine birds. Although a causative agent {{has not been}} formally demonstrated, the leading candidate is a novel avian Borna virus (ABV) detected in post-mortem tissue samples of psittacids with PDD from the USA, Israel and recently Germany. Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD {{as well as in}} clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD. In two ABV positive post-mortem cases the tissue distribution of ABV was investigated by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Viremia was observed in a PDD affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the not PDD affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19 / 59 (32. 2 %) tested positive for ABV RNA in <b>cloacal</b> <b>swabs,</b> providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative <b>cloacal</b> <b>swabs.</b> ABV RNA-positive, clinically healthy birds demonstrated the same serological response as the animal with confirmed PDD. These results indicate that ABV infection may occur without clinical evidence of PDD and suggest that <b>cloacal</b> <b>swabs</b> can enable the non-invasive detection of ABV infection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Wild aquatic birds, {{reservoir}} of low-pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIVs), congregate in huge numbers in Western Siberia wetlands, where major intra- and inter-continental bird flyways overlap. In 2005 and 2006, highly pathogenic (HP) AIV H 5 N 1 epizootics affected wild and domestic {{birds in the}} Novosibirsk Region. In 2012, we evaluated AIV persistence in Siberian natural and anthropic ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: In Novosibirsk Region, 166 wild birds ecologically linked to aquatic environments and 152 domestic waterfowl were examined for AIV isolation in embryonating chicken eggs. Biological samples were obtained by integrating the conventional <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> collection with the harvesting of samples from birds ’ plumage. Haemagglutinating allantoic fluids were further characterized by serological and molecular methods. In August-September 2012, 17 AIVs, including three H 3 N 8, eight H 4 N 6, two H 4 N?, one H 2 N?, one H?N 2, and two unsubtyped LPAIVs, were isolated from 15 wild ducks. Whereas comparable proportions of wild Anseriformes (n. 118) tested virus isolation (VI) -positive from cloaca and feathers (5. 9 % vs 8. 5 %) were detected, the overall prevalence of virus isolation, obtained from both sampling methods, was 2. 4 times higher than that calculated on results from <b>cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> examination only (14. 4 % vs 5. 9 %). Unlike previously described in this area, the H 4 N 6 antigenic subtype {{was found to be}} the prevalent one in 2012. Both cloacal and feather samples collected from domestic waterfowl tested VI-negative...|$|E
40|$|The high {{population}} of waterfowl subsequently {{with the high}} case fatality of poultry and people in West Java regency caused by HPAI H 5 N 1 can raise possibility that waterfowl was a natural reservoir. This research aimed to prove that waterfowl in West Java served as reservoir of AI virus (primarily H 5 N 1) and also identify the virus pathotype based on cleavage site of amino acid sequence. <b>Cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> sample was obtained from healthy and unvaccinated waterfowl from Sukabumi and Bogor Regency. <b>Cloacal</b> <b>swab</b> was propagated in 9 days old embryonic chicken eggs. Allantoic fluid was harvested at the 4 th day of incubation and then tested for hemagglutination, and positive isolate continued with virus sub-typing using PCR method. H 5 gene from H 5 N 1 isolate then sequenced using dideoxy termination method. Multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences were analysed using MEGA- 3. 1 program. Sub-typing using PCR method indicated the existence of 25 strain H 5 N 1, 16 strain HxN 1, 4 strain H 5 Nx and 9 virus ND. Characterization of cleavage site amino acid sequence indicated that all H 5 N 1 sample were pathogenic with sequence QRERRRKKR (23 sample) dan QRESRRKKR (2 sample). Waterfowl was HPAI H 5 N 1 virus reservoir. Asymptomatic infection in waterfowl, but the virus shedding gradually occurred and therefore it became potential source of H 5 N 1 virus infection. Our findings suggest that immediate action is needed to prevent the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from the apparently healthy waterfowl into terrestrial poultry or human. ...|$|E
