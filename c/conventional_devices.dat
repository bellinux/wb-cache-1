2500|$|The overall {{efficiency}} {{of this approach}} is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4MJ of infrared power to create ignition that releases about 20MJ of energy. This corresponds to a [...] "fusion gain" [...] —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30MJ, a gain of about 100. Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72. Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an order of magnitude less expensive than <b>conventional</b> <b>devices</b> like NIF.|$|E
