25|$|So {{rather than}} treat {{the issue as}} a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E

While reading the script, the <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> [...] "Dwigt" [...] appears. Pam explains to the camera that originally, Michael based his incompetent sidekick on Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), but later changed the name with a search and replace. Unfortunately, the search and replace mechanism failed to change Dwight's misspelled name. Dwight is upset and quickly shuts down the exercise to invite everyone to set off fireworks outside, but only Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) follows.|$|E

5000|$|In the HZ {{encoding}} system, the <b>character</b> <b>sequences</b> [...] "~{" [...] and [...] "~}" [...] act as escape sequences; anything {{between them}} is interpreted as Chinese encoded in GB2312 (the most significant bits are ignored).

2500|$|Hayes added a {{requirement}} of his own, that the modem {{be able to}} automatically detect what speed the computer's serial port was set to when first powered on. This was not simple unless the modem [...] "knew" [...] what data were initially being sent, allowing it to time the bits and thereby guess the speed. Heatherington eventually suggested {{the use of a}} well-known <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> for this purpose, recommending AT for [...] "attention", which is prefixed on all commands.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{language}} construct is the unit. A unit {{may be a}} formula, an enclosed clause, a routine text or one of several technically needed constructs (assignation, jump, skip, nihil). The technical term enclosed clause unifies some of the inherently bracketing constructs known as block, do statement, switch statement in other contemporary languages. When keywords are used, generally the reversed <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> of the introducing [...] keyword is used for terminating the enclosure, e.g. ( [...] if ~ then ~ else ~ fi, case ~ in ~ out ~ esac, for ~ while ~ do ~ od [...] ). This [...] syntax was reused by Stephen Bourne in the common Unix Bourne shell. An expression may also yield a multiple value, which is constructed from other values by a collateral clause. This construct just looks like the parameter pack of a procedure call.|$|E

40|$|An SQL query is a <b>sequence</b> of ASCII <b>characters,</b> but {{not every}} <b>sequence</b> of ASCII <b>characters</b> is a valid SQL query.

The Standard defines an SQL character set that includes letters a-zA-Z, digits, the space, and these special characters: "%&’() *+,-. /:;?_|. (2) Extended character sets (with national characters) can be used. • There are various formalisms for specifying clearly and unambiguously the subset of all <b>character</b> <b>sequences</b> which are legal in a language like SQL.

50|$|The {{standard}} requires {{operations to}} convert between basic formats and external <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> formats. Conversions {{to and from}} a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> must be such that conversion back using round to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external <b>character</b> <b>sequence</b> may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.|$|E

We propose a character composition model, tweet 2 vec, which finds vector-space representations of whole tweets by learning complex, non-local dependencies in <b>character</b> <b>sequences.</b> The proposed model outperforms a word-level baseline at predicting user-annotated hashtags associated with the posts, doing significantly better when the input contains many out-of-vocabulary words or unusual <b>character</b> <b>sequences.</b> Our tweet 2 vec encoder is publicly available.
