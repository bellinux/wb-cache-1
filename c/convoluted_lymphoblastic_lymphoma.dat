All cases were stained with monoclonal antibodies, {{directed to the}} leukocyte common antigen (LCA), B- and T-cell markers as well as Calla.

40|$|Background: T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{comprises}} approximately 85 - 90 % of all <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> It often arises as a mediastinal mass, {{and with}} bone marrow involvement. Presentation at other sites without nodal or mediastinal localization is uncommon. Case report: We describe clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of two cases of primary T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> arising respectively in uterine corpus and testis. The tumors were composed by medium to large cells, exhibiting a diffuse {{pattern of growth}} but sometimes forming indian files or pseudo-rosettes. The neoplastic cells strongly expressed TdT and T-cell markers in both uterine corpus and testis. However, the testis case also showed aberrant expression of B-cell markers, thus molecular biology was necessary to achieve a final diagnosis. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis identified a T-cell origin. Conclusions: To {{the best of our}} knowledge, only one doubtful previous case of primary uterine T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and no previous cases of primary testicular T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> have been reported. Due to the morphology of neoplastic cells, a challenging differential diagnosis with all the tumors belonging to the so-called small round blue cell tumor category is mandatory. In ambiguous lineage cases, molecular biology may represent an adequate tool to confirm diagnosis.

40|$|Cytosine arabinoside (araC) {{has proven}} {{efficacy}} in {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML), but {{its place in the}} treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is uncertain. The therapeutic potential of araC has been assessed in patients with AML, ALL, and T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> by measuring the conversion of araC to its active metabolite, the 5 '-triphosphate of araC (araCTP), in purified blasts from patients as well as in normal polymorphs and lymphocytes. In all leukemias, araCTP was the major intracellular metabolite of araC. The highest araCTP formation was in blasts from T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> which formed threefold more nucleotide than myeloblasts, and in turn myeloblasts formed twofold more araCTP than lymphoblasts from ALL. The mean araCTP formation in myeloblasts was sixfold greater than polymorphs, but in contrast, lymphoblasts and lymphocytes formed low and similar amounts of this nucleotide. Reasons for the sixfold range in araCTP accumulation in the various leukemic blasts were studied. The mean size of myeloblasts was 35 - 70 % larger than lymphoblasts when compared on the basis of protein or intracellular water content, but T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> blasts and lymphoblasts were the same size. Activities of deoxycytidine kinase, deoxycytidylate deaminase, and pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase were not different between any of the leukemic cell types. The number of nucleoside transport sites on blasts was estimated by measuring the equilibrium binding of [3 H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), which binds with high affinity to the transporter. Scatchard analysis yielded mean values of 27, 500 sites/cell for T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> blasts, 10, 000 sites/cell for myeloblasts, and 2, 300 sites/cell for lymphoblasts. Our previous work has shown that araC influx correlates with the maximum number of 3 H-NBMPR binding sites in leukemic and normal white cells. A strong correlation was observed between the number of nucleoside transport sites per leukemic blast cell and the accumulation of intracellular araCTP from extracellular araC at 1 microM. Membrane transport of araC at the low concentrations (approximately 1 microM), which are achieved therapeutically, is a major rate-limiting step in its conversion to araCTP by leukemic blast cells. Myeloblasts form more araCTP than lymphoblasts because of both higher nucleoside transport capacity and larger cell size. The highest nucleoside transport capacity and largest conversion of araC to araCTP is in T <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> which suggests that araC may be effective in the treatment of this disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of Clusters of Differentiation for T- and B-lymphoid cells during International Workshops on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens prompted the authors {{to evaluate the}} immunophenotypes in 160 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In this group, 130 were of B-lymphocyte lineage (117 by monotypic immunoglobulin expression), and 30 of T-cell lineage. In the B-NHL series the expression of immunoglobulin isotypes, B-cell maturation/differentiation antigens of CD 9, CD 10, CD 19 - 24, CD 37, and CD 38 (OKT 10), HLA-DR and peanut agglutinin binding showed no significant relationship with histopathologic diagnosis {{as defined by the}} Kiel classification. Of the T-cell markers, CD 5, CD 6, and CD 7 showed lineage promiscuity by their presence on some B-NHL. Conversely, the authors grouped the cases according to phenotypes (either CD antigens or immunoglobulin isotypes) which occur in distinct stages of (physiologic) B-cell maturation/differentiation. Eighty-six of the 130 cases could be fitted according to CD phenotype expression. This approach did not yield a significant relationship between phenotype and individual histopathologic categories either. The staging by CD phenotype and by immunoglobulin isotype yielded different results in this respect. Most B-NHL had an intermediate stage of B-cell maturation/differentiation. In the T-NHL series most cases showed a phenotype (CD 1 -CD 8, CD 38, TdT, and peanut agglutinin binding capacity) compatible with mature T-lymphocyte characteristics. The exceptions were <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>convoluted</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> which exhibited an immature immunophenotype. It is concluded that NHL in distinct histopathologic categories are heterogeneous in immunologic phenotypes, and that the immunophenotype of lymphoma cells has no evident association with that of their presumed counterparts in physiologic cell maturation/differentiation...|$|R

METHOD: Each case was reclassified according to the Working Formulation and an attempt made to allocate an immunophenotype using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Results were correlated with clinical data on site and survival. RESULTS: Of the 43 cases, 30 were males and 13 females. There were 17 cases of <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> 15 cases of small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (SNCC), and four cases of large cell lymphoma. The SNCC group was subdivided into 10 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and five cases of non-Burkitt's lymphoma. An immunophenotype was allocated in 65. 1 % of cases (23 B, 5 T). The SNCC cases were spread throughout the 0 - 16 year age range while the <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cases tended to occur in older children. Most mediastinal tumours were <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and most abdominal tumours were SNCC.

Metabolic disturbances {{are thought to be}} the primary cause of clinical ATLS symptoms, which include renal dysfunction, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. The histopathologic lesions associated with organ dysfunction are largely unknown because of the low rate of mortality of ATLS in humans and the few cases of ATLS identified in laboratory animals. Here, we describe histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic analyses of thirty-one ATLS cases from a cohort of 499 mice that are prone to spontaneous <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> owing to genetic defects in DNA replication fidelity. Seventy-three percent of our cohort died with <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> and 8 % of affected mice died with dif-fuse microthromboemboli consistent with ATLS.
