5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual <b>checkup,</b> he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard <b>checkup.</b>|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the <b>checkup</b> routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

40|$|An {{economic}} analysis of personal health maintenance {{is complicated by}} the great variability in the health care process, the large amount of missing data and the great range in analytic results. Accordingly, this study should be considered more illustrative than conclusive. Data are available on middle-aged adults that periodic health <b>checkups</b> can be effective in significantly lowering mortality from potentially postponable disease. Using these data, a net-cost analysis has been attempted for periodic health <b>checkups.</b> The findings suggest that their costs and effects on health depend on how they are provided, how often and to whom. Yet, periodic health <b>checkups</b> can reduce lost earnings capability of examinees and can be cost-effective by using efficient health examination methods. If policy decision makers require health <b>checkups</b> for the lowest income people to be cost-effective, then these <b>checkups</b> probably will continue to be limited to case finding by physicians as an expense already included in current medical practice...|$|R
40|$|Background. Birth {{preparedness}} {{program was}} designed to enhance skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups</b> of women in a developing country to reduce the three delays that lead women and neonates to death and disability. However, the relationship between birth preparedness with skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups</b> among mothers is not well studied. Therefore this study is intended to assess the association between birth preparedness and skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups.</b> Methods. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2014. Eight out of 22 Kebeles were selected using probability proportional to size sampling method. Seven hundred and forty-five mothers were selected randomly from the sampling frame, generated from family folders obtained from health posts. Data was collected using pretested questionnaire by face-to-face interview. Data was entered into EpiData version 3. 1 database and analyzed by SPSS version 16. Result. Out of 745 sampled mothers 728 (97. 7 %) participated in the study. One hundred and twelve (15. 4 %) and 128 (17. 6 %) mothers got skilled birth attendance and received postpartum <b>checkups</b> for their last child, respectively. Birth preparedness, educational status of women and their husbands, and antenatal care visits of mothers {{were found to be}} predictor of skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups.</b> Mothers well prepared for child birth were 6. 7 times more likely to attend skilled birth attendance [AOR = 6. 7 (2. 7 – 16. 4) ] and 3 times more likely to follow postpartum <b>checkups</b> [AOR = 3. 0 (1. 5 – 5. 9) ] than poorly prepared mothers, respectively. Travel time to reach the nearest health facility was found as predictor for postpartum <b>checkups</b> of mothers; mothers who travel ≤ 2 hours were {{three times more likely to}} follow postpartum <b>checkups</b> than mothers who travel > 2 hours (AOR (95 % CI) = 3. 4 (1. 5 – 7. 9)). Conclusion and Recommendation. Skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups</b> were low. Encouraging women to attend recommended antenatal care visits and providing advice and education on birth preparedness and obstetric danger signs are important interventions to increase skilled birth attendance and postpartum <b>checkups...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify the status of occupational health and safety services for immigrant workers, the barriers to employing immigrant workers and the needs of the managers in workplaces to keep immigrant workers healthy and safe. This study was a crosssectional survey. We sent self-administered questionnaires to 126 workplaces in the western part of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan in August 2006. The questionnaire included the characteristics of the workplace, barriers to employing immigrant workers, current actions to keep immigrant workers healthy and safe, the implementation rate of health <b>checkups</b> and important issues to keep immigrant workers healthy and safe. Implementation rates of health and safety education, creating job instruction manuals written in their native languages, creating safety signs written in their native languages, and the use of translators were 62. 5 %, 50. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 37. 5 %, respectively. Implementation rates of general health <b>checkups,</b> special health <b>checkups</b> and follow up after health <b>checkups</b> were 80. 8 %, 73. 6 % and 67. 3 %, respectively. The most important issue which the managers considered kept immigrant workers healthy and safe was health <b>checkups</b> (69. 6 %). In conclusion, several occupational health and safety services were conducted for immigrant workers without a margin to compare with Japanese workers...|$|R

Seizing his last opportunity just before the communist regime took over, Manuilă appealed to the anti-communist resistance figure Silviu Craciunas, who ran a people-smuggling operation.

25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship. The worker has {{to receive an}} invitation before being granted a working permit to enter the country. The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly from the agency itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary work authorization to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on the migrant domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When the migrant domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the handing over of their passports to the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while the migrant domestic worker waits to be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings the migrant domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical <b>checkup.</b>|$|E
