5|$|To {{co-ordinate}} {{planning for}} the proposed genocide, Heydrich hosted the Wannsee Conference, which brought together administrative leaders of the Nazi regime on 20 January 1942. In preparation for the conference, Eichmann drafted for Heydrich {{a list of the}} numbers of Jews in various European countries and prepared statistics on emigration. Eichmann attended the conference, oversaw the stenographer who took the minutes, and prepared the official distributed record of the meeting. In his <b>covering</b> <b>letter,</b> Heydrich specified that Eichmann would act as his liaison with the departments involved. Under Eichmann's supervision, large-scale deportations began almost immediately to extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibor, Treblinka and elsewhere. The genocide was code-named Operation Reinhard in honour of Heydrich, who died in Prague in early June from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt. Kaltenbrunner succeeded him as head of the RSHA.|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan was a noted {{collector}} of relics, {{and while this}} was a common practice at the time, he was marked out by the scale of his collection and the refinement of its contents. The abbot of Saint Samson in Dol sent him some as a gift, and in his <b>covering</b> <b>letter</b> he wrote: [...] "we know you value relics more than earthly treasure". Æthelstan was also a generous donor of manuscripts and relics to churches and monasteries. Indeed, his reputation {{was so great that}} some monastic scribes later falsely claimed that their institutions had been beneficiaries of his largesse. He was especially devoted to the cult of St. Cuthbert in Chester-le-Street, and his gifts to the community there included Bede's Lives of Cuthbert. He commissioned it especially to present to Chester-le Street, and out of all manuscripts he gave to a religious foundation which survive, it is the only one which was wholly written in England during his reign. This has a portrait of Æthelstan presenting the book to Cuthbert, the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of an English king. In the view of Janet Nelson, his [...] "rituals of largesse and devotion at sites of supernatural power... enhanced royal authority and underpinned a newly united imperial realm".|$|E

2500|$|As Jacobovici and Wilson point out, {{there are}} two <b>covering</b> <b>letters</b> to [...] "Joseph and Aseneth". One is by an {{anonymous}} individual who had found a small, very old Greek manuscript in a library belonging to the bishops who had come from Resh’aina. Being rusty in Greek, he asked his friend, Moses of Ingila, to translate the work, suspecting that it contained a hidden meaning. The second letter is by Moses of Ingila. He translated the work into Syriac, positioning it {{as a work of}} Wisdom whose meaning has to be carefully discerned. He also indicated that it contains a hidden meaning. Along with the clues provided by the <b>covering</b> <b>letters,</b> the use of Christian terminology (“Son of God,” “Bride of God”), Eucharistic imagery and Syriac use of typology in which Old Testament figures prefigure New Testament ones, the authors argue that the work reflects a community which held that Jesus was married and had children.

2500|$|Vägmärken (Markings), {{published}} in 1963, {{is the only}} book by former UN secretary general, Dag Hammarskjöld. The journal was discovered after his death, with a <b>covering</b> <b>letter</b> to his literary executor, [...] "a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God." [...] After the original Swedish version was {{published in}} 1963, the English translation came out in 1964, [...] The translation was done by noted Swedish scholar Leif Sjöberg, [...] and was refined by the poet W. H. Auden, who also wrote a foreword. This brought the book immediate literary notice, and even a front-page rave in The New York Times Book Review. It is highly regarded as a classic of contemporary spiritual literature.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{advised by}} the District Auditor {{that the council}} {{would be unable to}} pay wages after November, the Labour group on the council decided in September 1985 to issue ninety-day notices to the 30,000 strong {{workforce}} Militant said the redundancy notices were a [...] "tactic" [...] to buy time. A <b>covering</b> <b>letter</b> to council employees dated 19 September 1985, signed by council leader John Hamilton and his deputy Derek Hatton, explained that [...] "this course of action provides the only way of providing wages and salaries until 18th December, 1985. ... the Government three months to negotiate with Labour representatives a just settlement to our financial crisis. If the Government recognises its responsibility then all notices will be withdrawn." [...] Later, the Deputy Council leader Derek Hatton and Militant's national general secretary Taaffe saw later as a great error, although the Council set a legal budget in November 1985 after borrowing £30 million.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} the work of {{co-ordinating}} requests to government was co-ordinated in part of the West Midlands by Fisher's eldest son, Samuel Fisher junior, {{and it seems that}} it was he who, a little later, also sent to London petitions relating to nonconformist communities in Darlaston, Sedgley, and Rowley Regis, as well as a further house in Birmingham. These were all channelled through Robert Blayney, clerk of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, allegedly a former confidant of Oliver Cromwell, who handled a large volume of correspondence with government officials for the nonconformists outside London. It is likely that the petition relating to Fisher's Birmingham meetings was accompanied by a <b>covering</b> <b>letter</b> from Charles Fisher, the preacher's younger son, who probably lived in London and was known personally to Blayney. This made clear that the signatories included some of the principal citizens of Birmingham. Samuel junior's letter relating to Darlaston finished with the postscript [...] "I pray remember my fathers business," [...] suggesting there had been some delay in dealing with it. Shortly after, it was returned to Blayney, with an [...] "Endorsed" [...] mark. Licences for Samuel Fisher's house in Birmingham to be a Presbyterian meeting place and for him to operate as a Presbyterian teacher in it were entered in government records on 1 May 1672, along with two of the Staffordshire licences, suggesting Blayner did actually expedite matters for Birmingham when he received the further requests from Samuel junior. Blayney picked up the Birmingham licences two days later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Loos was debated in the British press. Kitchener demanded a formal report (6 October) and Lord Haldane (a former Cabinet Minister) {{was sent to}} France to {{interview}} French and Haig. French in turn demanded a report from Haig, in particular his claim to have penetrated the German lines (16 Oct). Haig claimed in his diary that a proposal that he be sent {{to report on the}} Gallipoli bridgehead, was shelved because of the imminence of French's removal. Lord Stamfordham, the King's Secretary, telephoned Robertson to ask his opinion of French and Robertson conferred with Haig—who was pushing for Robertson to be appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff—before giving his opinion. The King also discussed the matter with Haig over dinner on a visit to the front (24 October). Haig again told him that French should have been sacked in August 1914. Four days later the King, whilst inspecting troops, was injured when thrown by one of Haig's horses and had to be evacuated to England on a stretcher, which caused Haig some embarrassment. French was reduced to having his orders releasing the reserves published in The Times (2 November), along with an article by Repington blaming Haig. Haig demanded a correction of French's [...] "inaccuracies" [...] about the availability of the reserve, whereupon French ordered Haig to cease all correspondence on this matter, although he offered to let Haig see the <b>covering</b> <b>letter</b> he was sending to London in his report but French's fate was sealed. Haig met with the Prime Minister Asquith (23 November) and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) the next day. Rumours were rife that French was to be sacked, another reason given for sacking him, was that his shortcomings would become more pronounced with the expansion of the BEF, which would number sixty divisions within two years. Matters had been delayed as Kitchener was away on an inspection tour of the Mediterranean and French was sick in bed. Kitchener returned to London (3 Dec) and at a meeting with Haig that day, told him that he was to recommend to Asquith that Haig replace French.|$|E
