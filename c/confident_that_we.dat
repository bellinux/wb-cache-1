500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could do this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.|$|E

500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are going}} to disaggregate the changes over time in {{reported}} income as well as track what happened to different cohorts of the population (Azevedo et al. 2014). To do <b>that</b> <b>we</b> use two detailed household surveys, one from 2004 and the other from 2012. The original 2004 survey was based on population weights from an early population census. These weights were updated using data from the 2007 demographic census. The Peruvian Census Bureau (INEI) then updated the 2004 survey. This is the 2004 base <b>that</b> <b>we</b> used to get comparable statistics for 2004 and 2012. Our poverty estimates are slightly different from those published by INEI because some respondents in either of the two surveys did not report either age, income or place of residence.

However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene {{with the help of her}} driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon. After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.|$|E

40|$|In [1] a novel {{metamaterial}} {{has been}} designed and studied, whose performances include an enhanced toughness in extension: {{one of the problems}} to be solved in the further development of the concept involves the study of its deformation induced by loads concentrated on fibers (fiber pull-out test). A continuum model seems particularly unfit for the description of this kind of phenomena. As a consequence, in order to design a campaign of experimental tests we resorted to numerical simulations based on a novel Lagrangian, finite dimensional model for pantographic sheets. The developed code has the robustness features necessary to supply reliable predictions also in presence of very large deformations and, indeed, produces very accurate predictions. The agreement between the presented three-elastic-parameters discrete Lagrangian model and the numerous experimental measurements performed is very accurate.

40|$|Mr Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, {{colleagues and}} friends, I {{have in the}} {{preceding}} address delineated my vision of the core role of medical genetics {{as it pertains to}} medicine in South Africa today.

These challenges offer us the opportunity of evolving solutions for our own unique South African circumstances.
