The type of analysis was explicit dynamics. In order to understand modeling of reinforced concrete structures in Abaqus, several tests were performed on a simple wall under shear load. In these tests the area of reinforcing bars, {{the distance between the}} bars and the position of the bars in the wall were varied. The influence of the velocity of the load on results was tested too. In the next step, impact simulations were done on a simple model of the container. This model was optimizer with respect to the numerical error. Finally, the knowledge obtained on simple tests was used to prepare a detailed model of a container, with the reinforced concrete walls modeled in a different way from its interior; the later is meant as a disposal volume for a radioactive material. By performing analyses on a detailed model, we obtained data of the level of damage of the reinforced concrete walls, which was the main goal of this work...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} {{conception}} of some permanent repositories for radioactive wastes, these are trapped, after proper conditioning, in cement matrices within special drums. These drums, in turn, {{are placed in}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>container</b> called a "module", in which {{the space between the}} drums is back-filled with grout. Finally, several modules are stacked within the concrete walls of the repositories. Through this multiple barrier design, typical of the nuclear industry, the disposal facility is expected to ensure adequate protection of man and environment against the radiological impacts of the wastes by meeting various functional objectives which aim at limiting the release of radionuclides. Because one of the principal mechanisms of release of radionuclides is through water infiltration into the various constituents of the repository and subsequent percolation into the groundwater system, it is of utmost importance to study the phenomena of advection and dispersion of radionuclides in the artificial porous matrices hosting the waste (near field) and, subsequently, in the natural rock matrix of the host geosphere (far field). This paper addresses the issue of radionuclide transport through the artificial porous matrices constituting the engineered barriers of the repository's near field. The complexity of the phenomena involved, augmented by the heterogeneity and stochasticity of the media in which transport occurs, renders classical analytical-numerical approaches scarcely adequate for realistic representation of the system of interest. Hence, we propound the use of a Monte Carlo simulation method based on the Kolmogorov and Dmitriev theory of branching stochastic processes...|$|E

The PSI contributes to waste related problems in two aspects, namely to the scientific basis of waste management and disposal, and to the practical treatment and storage of radioactive waste.

Therefore the Dismantling and Waste Management Section {{is a part of the}} Logistics Department at PSI. Proved and accepted methods have to be developed for the safe conditioning and storage of radioactive waste. Various waste treatment facilities exist at PSI. The conditioning facility is dedicated to sorting, compaction by a 120 t press, solidification with special cement, and embedding in concrete. Specialized facilities were constructed for waste from the decommissioning of research reactors. Activated aluminum and its alloys were melted in crucibles and embedded in concrete in a <b>concrete</b> <b>container.</b> After dismantling the structural material of the reactors, it was embedded in concrete in the same manner. For the conditioning of activated reactor graphite, a dedicated method was developed. Graphite was crushed to replace sand in the grout, for embedding radioactive waste in concrete containers. For accelerator waste, a walk-in hot cell equipped with an electrically driven manipulator is available where the highly activated large components (targets, beam dump) can be cut into pieces and embedded in concrete in containers.

40|$|In {{the process}} of the {{construction}} of low- and intermediate-nuclear waste repository, a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>container,</b> in which the waste is going to be stored, was designed. In this thesis, the impact of the container with a rigid ground was analysed. Such a drop test is required by the Law on transportation of dangerous goods, which is referring to European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR). A finite element method code Abaqus/Explicit was used for analysis, solving the structural dynamic equation with an explicit method. In the first part, the numerical model, type of analysis and used material models are presented. Material model describing the behaviour of concrete was carefully selected, as concrete {{is one of the most}} complex materials, because of its anisotropic behaviour and nonhomogeneous composition. Concrete damage plasticity model, which is used, is capable of describing the damage in the material under load as well as the different behaviour in tension and compression. Simple tests on a rod and a three and four point bending beam were conducted to see material behaviour in such circumstances. In the second part, the results of analysis for both the model of impact on the corner and the tumble over one side of the container are first presented. A parametric study was conducted in which we changed the values of chosen parameters. Energy throughout the analysis is presented and based on the results the parameters that impact the results are identified.

40|$|Object-oriented {{design is}} usually driven by three main {{reusability}} principles: step-by-step design, design for reuse and design with reuse. However, these principles {{tend to be}} just partially applied to the subsequent object-oriented implementation, often because they conflict with other quality criteria (remarkably, efficiency). So, there is a gap between design and implementation: due to these conflicts developers use to give up design level abstractions during the implementation. In this paper we present a framework for bridging this gap for a concrete domain, the design and implementation of object-oriented container-like component libraries, such as JCF, STL, Booch Components, LEDA, etc. At {{the core of the}} framework we propose a new design pattern called emphShortcut together with its corresponding implementation.

First safety analysis were performed by SCK•CEN for Nuclear Regulatory Authority in 1993. Calculations were performed with one dimensional codes MODEMO, NUCDSLB and LAKE. Following {{the request of the}} Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority and IAEA WATRP mission in 1994 the number of modifications were adopted to design and construction of the Mochovce repository. Following an upgrade of the Mochovce repository a new safety report was prepared including performance assessment. A set of new site and radiological data have been prepared and the computer codes originally created by SCK•CEN Belgium were modified and locally adapted. According to progress of experience and knowledge codes DUST-MS for source term release and MODFLOW for ground-water flow have been integrated into performance assessment. This paper is dealing with the main activities and results of performance assessment of Mochovce LLW/ILW repository. The paper presents the implementation of computer codes and results of comparative calculations performed MODEMO and DUST-MS codes for potential near field interactions...|$|R
