Op amps are universally used in monitoring photodetectors {{and there are a}} variety of amplifier connections for this purpose.

For example, the bandwidth, slew-rate, noise, input impedance and gain, among other characteristics of the op amp, are often the performance limiting factors of photometer circuits. For this reason, in this paper a comparative analysis between two photodiode amplifier circuits is carried out.

40|$|A DC-DC {{converter}} made of two identical IGBT {{full bridge}} power circuits is built. The two circuits are direct-ly {{connected in parallel}} and driven with only one control circuit originally built for one IGBT bridge. One signal drives two corresponding IGBTs in parallel bridges without any additional circuits for current sharing. The main causes of possible current unbalance were identified by simulation. The difference among transformer leakage in-ductances has, by far, the most significant influence on current sharing between two circuits. This was confirmed by measurements. It is concluded that transformer tolerances regarding leakage inductances {{that can be achieved}} in normal series production will ensure an acceptable current sharing.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} issue of high power switched-mode power supplies that are designed as modular systems. The thesis describes series, parallel and series-parallel possibility of connected converters. System can achieve extremely high output current for converters connected in parallel. For converters connected in series, the system can achieve extremely high output voltage. The main goal of this thesis is to develop so-called reconfigurable modular system. It is a system that can change <b>converters</b> <b>connection</b> of serial, parallel or series-parallel connection - during its operation. This option to change <b>converters</b> <b>connection</b> significantly extends the control range of output voltage and output current of the whole system. For all these mentioned variants of the modular system there are described and simulated suitable control schemes. The issue of interleaved PWM is described in the thesis. Output voltage ripple and current ripple equations were derived for each <b>converters</b> <b>connection.</b> These equations, which were derived either for systems with interleaved PWM or for systems without of phase shifted PWM, are also proved by simulations. Design of reconfigurable modular system with power of 9. 6 kW that contains four converters was introduced in this thesis. Converters use modern transistors and diodes of SiC material.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the control and}} protection of a microgrid that is connected to utility through back-to-back converters. The back-to-back <b>converter</b> <b>connection</b> facilitates bidirectional power flow between the utility and the microgrid. These converters can operate in two different modes-one in which a fixed amount of power is drawn from the utility {{and the other in}} which the microgrid power shortfall is supplied by the utility. In the case of a fault in the utility or microgrid side, the protection system should act not only to clear the fault but also to block the back-to-back converters such that its dc bus voltage does not fall during fault. Furthermore, a converter internal mechanism prevents it from supplying high current during a fault and this complicates the operation of a protection system. To overcome this, an admittance based relay scheme is proposed, which has an inverse time characteristic based on measured admittance of the line.

40|$|Because {{the support}} system of {{converter}} bears total {{weight of the}} converter and its accessories, and meanwhile transfers tilting torque from tilting mechanism to converter, {{it is the most}} important part of converter machinery.

The joint equipment of self-adjust bolt has the advantages of heavyload bear capacity and simple structure, so it’s {{the most important part of}} converter machinery. From the field testing, a large shock takes when the converter starting or breaking. Once the converter is broken at 63 °, the self-adjusting bolts are under a large load and dynamic impact. So it will cause great instantaneous stress and a serious shortage of stress intensity reserves, the crack sources easily come up in the region of stress concentration and dangerous section. Analysis of steel-making process on all typical operating conditions, such as temperature detecting, sampling and slag tapping, the stress at 75 ° is close to the theoretical maximum stress caused at 63 °, so the converter angle should be strictly controlled to avoid converter’s braking at 63 ° and limit the residence time.

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores a new {{configuration}} for modular dc–dc <b>converters,</b> namely, series <b>connection</b> at the input, {{and parallel}} connection at the output, {{such that the}} converters share the input voltage and load current equally. This {{is an important step}} toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of dc–dc converters.
