5|$|Political {{sociology}} {{has also}} moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed {{the role of}} non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a social construct, {{and the role of}} stateless entities in the modern world society. <b>Contemporary</b> <b>political</b> sociologists also study inter-state interactions and human rights.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E

5|$|His Teutonic Knights {{returned}} to Poland's history. Describing the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian {{victory over the}} Germans in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, the book had a substantial <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> context in the ongoing Germanization efforts (Kulturkampf) in German Poland. The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German National Democracy political movement, and {{became part of the}} Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Mahaleo is a folk-pop {{band from}} Madagascar that is {{widely viewed as}} the most popular Malagasy group of all time. The band was founded by Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) with six of his classmates after first {{performing}} together during the rotaka student protests at their high school on 13 May 1972. Mahaleo's lyrics draw upon the indirect language of traditional hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) to expose <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> and social issues and invite listeners to identify their own solutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contemporary</b> <b>political</b> {{sociology}} includes {{these areas}} of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

5|$|Making <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> {{points in}} this way through reinterpretation of distant {{historical}} episodes was now common. In 17th century France, {{the fall of the}} powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated in a political pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, L'Ambitieux ou le portraict d'Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen in these terms too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, The Emperor’s Favourite. The prudent need for anonymity, is suggested by the arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} more {{politically}} correct Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later {{put him in a}} Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, Bond is initially issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> leaders in his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find general characteristics of <b>Contemporary</b> Turkish <b>political</b> Elites since 1995 up to date. Social background characteristics were employed to realise the purposes. Documentary and historical research techniques were used during the study. As a result of examining the <b>Contemporary</b> Turkish <b>political</b> elites (since 1995 up to 2005) these major findings were discovered: the large majority of the Turkish parliamentary elites were well educated, male, middle aged, married and with a small family size. Also, more than 25 percent of Turkish Elites are trader and businessmen. Moreover the size of the groups of lawyers, civil bureaucrats and managers, educators and free professions was also meaningful. <b>Contemporary</b> Turkish <b>political</b> elites have exhibited an elitist character as compared with Turkish society, but this elitist character and male domination has begun to change in recent years.

25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President of the American Political Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, so it might better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social and political problems revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation that grew out of a deep discontent with the direction of <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct de-emphasis of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E
25|$|The 1918–1921 {{independence}} of Georgia, though short-lived, was {{of particular importance}} {{for the development of}} national feeling among Georgians, a major factor that made the country one of the most active independent forces within the Soviet Union. Leaders of the national movement of the late 1980s frequently referred to the DRG as a victory in the struggle against the Russian Empire and drew parallels with the <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> situation, portraying a somewhat idealized image of the Georgian First Republic.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party, {{commonly}} referred to as the GOP (abbreviation for Grand Old Party), is one of the two major <b>contemporary</b> <b>political</b> parties in the United States, the other being its historic rival, the Democratic Party. The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern states for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.|$|E
