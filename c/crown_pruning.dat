40|$|Growth {{responses}} of Pinus radiata D. Don to pruning, thinning, and fertiliser treatments in a factorial design were measured over a 19 -year period at two Kaingaroa Forest sites (Goudies, site index 30 m; Matea, site index 25 m). As single-factor treatments: • Pruning —(selective green-crown pruning without thinning) {{resulted in a}} considerable loss in basal area growth; • Thinning — Trees that were thinned-only responded with increased diameter growth; • Fertiliser — The application of nitrogenous fertiliser (at 200 kg N/ha) to trees that remained unthinned (at 2700 - 3000 stems/ha) gave no significant improvement in basal area growth. For combined treatments, when nitrogen fertiliser was applied to trees that were also thinned, a moderate basal area response resulted. For trees that were pruned and thinned, there was evidence that nitrogen fertiliser assisted with growth recovery from green <b>crown</b> <b>pruning.</b> The response to nitrogen fertiliser applied at first thinning (age 5 - 6 years...|$|E

Poucassão as técnicas e estudos que visam recuperar ervais degradados e resgatar {{material}} vegetativo de erveirasadultas. Diante disso, instalou-se um experimento em São Mateus do Sul, PR, em erveiras nativas debilitadas,com aproximadamente quarenta anos. Objetivou-se avaliar a eficiência do anelamento da casca e diferentesintensidades de poda da copa na indução de brotações na base de erveiras adultas. Removeu-se a 20 cm do soloum anel de casca com 1 cm de largura. A intensidade de poda da copa originou os tratamentos: T 0 - testemunha(sem poda); T 40 - remoção de 40 % e T 70 - remoção de 70 % da copa. As árvores foram agrupadas em cincoblocos, sendo seis árvores por bloco, num total de 30 erveiras. Avaliou-se mortalidade das erveiras, número ecomprimento médio das brotações basais por árvore. Após 270 dias do anelamento, não ocorreu mortalidade, ea remoção de 70 % da copa induziu maior número de brotos por planta. Erveiras, mesmo debilitadas, demonstraramalta capacidade de cicatrização do anel de casca removido, indicando a viabilidade dessa técnica.

Few are the techniques and studies, focused on the restoration of degraded mate tree plantations, in order to recover vegetative samples of mature trees. So, an experiment was installed in São Mateus Country, Paraná State-BR, in a mate weakened population whose trees aged approximately 40 years. The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of bark girdling, combined to different pruning intensities, on the sprouting at the base of the  trunk of weakened mate trees. A bark ring of 1 cm width, at 20 cm from the base, was removed. Additionally the crown was submitted to three pruning intensities: T 0, control (no pruning); T 40, 40 % <b>crown</b> <b>pruning</b> and T 70, 70 % of <b>crown</b> <b>pruning.</b> The trees were grouped into five blocks, with six trees each, considered a block totalizing 30 mate trees. Mortality, number and length of the basal sprouts per tree were evaluated. After 270 days from the girdling procedure no mortality has been detected.

Today, its importance stems from cork production, with Portugal producing half of the cork in the world. As the main economic objectives may change with changes in markets and environment conservation concerns (e. g. biodiversity, water, carbon) {{there is a need}} for improved management tools. Spatial tree growth simulators are tools that enable the generation of tree growth scenarios dependent on site and competition status, that allow to simulate large scope management actions. In the present work it is presented a cork oak tree spatial growth simulator, CORKFITS, that was constructed with data generated by the monitoring system installed in 1995. The simulator was built assuming the potential increment modifier principle: z = zpot * modifier + ε, where zpot is the potential growth as function of site; modifier is the reduction factor as function of spatial competition index and the intensity of debark; ε is a random error. CORKFITS is composed by sub growth models (cork, stem, tree height and crown), cork production models and mortality models. Single trees are in cork oak woodlands subjected to natural (genetics and competition) and artificial (debark, <b>crown</b> <b>pruning,</b> root pruning) factors that affects their growth therefore there is a large amount of unexplained variability which creates problems in the modeling phase, the solutions for these problems will be discussed in the present work...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was conducted to determine maize growth and yield at various agroforestry development levels, especially in Batur Agung area, Gunung Kidul District, Java, Indonesia. This experiment was conducted in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) single factor with three blocks as replication. Research factor was agroforestry development levels, namely, initial, intermediate, and advanced levels. Observations were done on maize growth and yield variables. Data then was analyzed by applying Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 5 % level, and continued with the Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) if significant. Maize physiological response on initial to intermediate and advanced agroforestry level demonstrated impairment tendency. This condition continued to maize production decline in line with shade level (initial AF, intermediate AF, and advanced AF). Traditional silvicultural developed with trees along border, alley cropping and mixer characteristics. Tree planting space was irregular with conventional stands management. Although the physiological response decreased in line with shade increase and so did maize production, farmers still continued to develop initial, intermediate, and advanced agroforestry models. Scheme developed to improve the productivity of agroforestry was constructing intensive agroforestry regimes (IAR). There are 3 IAR, namely, IAR- 1 to hold initial agroforestry during the acceleration and management of initial agroforestry heading to intermediate and advanced. IAR- 1 base is more intensive <b>crown</b> <b>pruning</b> and commercial thinning approach. Crop area was utilized during the management with C 4 species. IAR- 2 was designed to hold intermediate AF from traditional to intensive by applying intensive harvesting, with need based cutting and C 3 species cultivation.

40|$|Silviculture {{agroforestry}} regime (SAR), {{which is}} a compatible management with forest rehabilitation and also renewal zoning system of the national park, was started to increase the agroforestry productivity surrounding Gunung Merapi National Park (GMNP). In addition, SAR also supported the basic information succession of Mount Merapi eruption in 2006 to strengthen Merapi lava tour. This is an innovative step in developing GMNP, in which its pro-poor conservation is not only based on land productivity, but also based tourism. This study was begun {{with the development of}} a permanent plot to study succession (May 2008 -Novemper 2009), and the impact of community intervention on grass stock at GMNP, as well as to assess agroforestry typology and its implication on the areas surrounding GMNP. SAR was developed using landuse model based on limiting the factor of each agroforestry cluster. Choosing the treatment in SAR refers to the actual condition and opportunity every agroforestry cluster and sensitivity analysed until the intervention on the GMNP was minimal. The implementation of SAR was done with a software known as Stella 9. 0. There are five SAR models which are appropriate for agroforestry cluster (AF); these are labelled as AF 1 -SAR 1, AF 2 -SAR 2, AF 3 -SAR 3, AF 4 -SAR 4 and AF 5 -SAR 5. SAR is based on resources sharing whereby space is arranged through <b>crown</b> <b>pruning</b> and also rationalization number of dairy cows. In addition, SAR has a packet management for synergizing function of private lands (homegarden, dry field and land village as a unit management) and intensification by land tillage, renewal of grass and fertilization. In particular, SAR 1 - 5 has the ability to balance agroforestry management with decreasing local community intervention and increasing biodiversity level on GMNP. The ratio for grass productivity outside GMNP with grass necessity and implementation of SAR was close to an optimum point (1). Meanwhile, the ratio values of SAR 1 - 5 were 0. 982, 1. 010, 1. 44, 1. 047 and 1. 253, respectively. Nonetheless, the implementation of SAR needs more technology of silviculture agroforestry and a full support from stakeholders...|$|E

However, no efficient cloning techniques are available and, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetative rescue methods for cuttings propagation of the species. Shoots/cuttings were generated in two ways: 26 years old trees underwent coppicing and 20 years old trees had the primary branches on the upper third of <b>crown</b> <b>pruned</b> at 2, 20 and 50 cm from the main trunk. Orthotropic shoots were rooted after application of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 g. L- 1. Coppicing produced 47 cuttings per plant with 90 % orthotropic shoots, while pruning resulted in 182 cuttings per plant with 44 % orthotropic shoots. Rooting success indexes were low with no influence of IBA, although they are slightly superior to the ones available in the literature for the species, ranging from 12 to 30 % for the coppice shoots and from 0 to 28 % for the branches shoots. We conclude that both vegetative rescue techniques are viable and have potentially important applications. Coppicing is recommended for the propagation aiming the production of wood, while shoots derived from the side branches of the crown are more appropriate for seeds orchards formation...|$|R

40|$|Arborists {{assume that}} pruning {{can help reduce}} the risk of tree failure by {{reducing}} the pressure exerted on trunks by wind (drag-induced bending moment), but there are few studies that quantify this effect. We simulated wind by driving trees {{in the back of a}} pickup truck from 0 to 24. 5 m/s (0 to 55 mph) and measured drag-induced bending moment as well as tree morphometric data for Freeman maple (Acer × freemanii), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor Willd.), and shingle oak (Quercus imbricaria Michx.). Measurements were taken before and after application of one of three American National Standards Institute A 300 pruning types (raising, reduction pruning, thinning). Reduction of drag-induced bending moment differed by pruning type, largely in accordance with the mass of foliage and twigs removed. The effectiveness of pruning types was also species-dependent because crown architecture affected how much mass each pruning type removed. In general, per unit of mass removed, reduction pruning more effectively reduced the drag-induced bending moment than thinning or raising. Reduction pruning reduced the center of pressure height and, presumably, increased <b>crown</b> porosity after <b>pruning.</b> Prediction of the reduction of drag-induced bending moment was not reliable based on reduction in <b>crown</b> area after <b>pruning.</b> We discuss the practical applications of our findings...|$|R

The production of essential oil and leaf biomass of resprouts were differently related to the canopy openness, indicating that light increases the production of the essential oil and decreases the biomass of resprouting leaves. This study revealed that plant organs differ in their essential oil production and that the canopy openness must be taken into account when pruning the A. canelilla tree crown in order to achieve higher oil productivity...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{effects of}} clonal variability, crown {{position}} of cones, and top-pruning of ramets to reduce height growth, on 1) {{the proportion of}} viable self-fertilized progeny (s) and 2) the proportion of filled seeds (PF), were investigated in a 20 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. 1 Franco) seed orchard. Cones were collected from the upper one-third and lower one-third <b>crown</b> positons of <b>pruned</b> and nonpruned raiets (three each) from six clones. Estimates of s were derived from a maximum likelihood procedure using data from 10 allozyme loci (PGII, LAP 1, LAP 2, GOT 2, GOT 3, GLYDH, CAT, 6 PGD, IDH, and DIA). The six clones sampled varied significantly (P < 0. 05) both in s and PF, but estimates of PF and s were not significantly correlated among clones. On the average, seeds from the upper portion of the crown were lower in s (0. 055) and higher in PF (0. 512) than seeds from the lower crown (s = 0. 190, PF = 0. 381). Combined over <b>crown</b> positions, <b>pruning</b> appeared to have little effect on s, while pruned ramets (PF = 0. 432) had only a slightly lower filled seed proportion than nonpruned ramets (PF = 0. 461). A total crown estimate of the proportion of viable progeny due to selffertilization from the six sampled clones was about 10 percent. These results show that crown position of cones, top-pruning, and clonal variation are all factors which could influence orchard management practices and the utilization of orchard seeds. Although the average proportion of viable progeny resulting from selffertilization in the seed orchard appeared to be no greater than that found in natural populations, information on clonal variation {{may be useful in}} roguing decisions. It may be desirable to remove clones which are consistently high selfers and low seed producers; or perhaps seed from these clones should be excluded from commercial collections. In addition, orchard managers may consider not collecting lower crown cones because of the lower seed yields and greater proportions of self seed found in the lower crown. In this study, the effects of top-pruning orchard ramets on seed set or self ing appeared to be minimal, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether there is a relationship between severity of top-pruning and seed quality or quantity...|$|R

40|$|Every year, countless urban {{trees are}} {{affected}} by storms, causing property damage, electric outages, human injuries, and fatalities. Factors such as tree form, size, species, pruning, and wood material properties impact tree resistance to storm damage. There is little empirical data examining the impact of branch reduction on tree dynamic properties, and no apparent data on the strength and failure patterns of sizable dominant limbs subjected to reduction cuts, a common practice for improving form and reducing risk. This dissertation is comprised of three studies that examined how branch breaking strength is affected by orientation and <b>pruning,</b> and how <b>crown</b> form and <b>pruning</b> affect the dynamic response of young shade trees. An examination {{of the effect of}} branch reorientation on breaking strength indicated that breaking stress for horizontally reoriented branches was double that of vertically reoriented branches. Horizontal branches usually failed near the branch base, whereas vertical branches tended to fail beyond the first lateral branch. The study testing the effects of <b>crown</b> form and <b>pruning</b> on dynamic response indicated that excurrent trees had a higher natural frequency than decurrent trees, and pruning in summer increased the frequency of excurrent trees more than decurrent trees. Tree form and pruning had little effect on damping ratio. Percent branch mass in {{the top half of the}} crown was greater for decurrent trees than excurrent trees, which could result in larger wind induced stress and increase the risk of failure.   Breaking strength of branches 8 years after codominant stem removal showed an inverse relationship between breaking stress and diameter of pruning cuts. There was no relationship between decay and wound wood cross-sectional area, but there was a strong inverse relationship between decayed wood and wound wood moment of inertia (I),indicating that wound wood growing near the periphery of stem cross sections had a greater effect on breaking strength than loss of strength from decay 8 years after pruning. Breaking stress of pruned branch sections was less than control branch sections. However, percent loss in Ifor pruned branch sections was below the threshold for action recommended in the literature for strength loss in tree trunks...|$|R

40|$|Four layouts {{were tested}} in a stand {{reorganisation}} trial established in Pinus radiata D. Don at Hautu Forest in 1973 - groups of four trees at 800 stems/ha, and groups of five trees, short lines of five trees, and the more conventional rectangular spacing at 1000 stems/ha. The final-crop 200 stems/ha were pruned to 6 m in three lifts. A production thinning was carried out at age 10 years in 1983 with a yield of 100 m 3 /ha and an estimated cost of NZ$ 12. 50 /m 3. The sale price on skid was $ 16. 00 /m 3. The growth of the pruned final-crop stems was only marginally affected {{by the presence of}} the production thinning element and little mechanical damage was caused by thinning. The economics of production thinning were improved, although the load accumulation gains were not as clear as expected. Times for prebunching in the groups of four and five and in conventional rows were all less than the lines of five. In the groups of four an initial stocking of 800 stems/ha was sufficient to give an acceptable final-crop stocking of 200 stems/ha. A second stand reorganisation trial established in 1975 investigated a paired row concept, i. e., pairs of final-crop rows alternating with pairs of rows for production thinning. Identification of the final-crop rows allowed them to receive seed orchard stock, cultivation, and fertiliser treatment to compensate for the green <b>crown</b> removal at <b>pruning</b> time. These advantages were sustained until the production thinning at age 10 years. Satisfactory levels of production were achieved using current machines and systems.

5000|$|The {{two primary}} ways to control Podosphaera macularis are {{cultural}} and chemical control. The {{most effective way}} to manage hop powdery mildew is through preventative measures. Cultural control of the disease include growing powdery-mildew tolerant/resistant varieties of the host plant. Cultural practices that can help prevent the disease include carefully monitoring water and nutrient, reducing initial inoculum, and removing basal growth. Furthermore, <b>pruning,</b> <b>crowning,</b> and/or scratching will aid in further reduction of the disease. Pruning consists of removing shoots before training. Crowning refers to the process of removing the top 1-2 inches of the crown before budbreak. Scratching is done through disturbing the soil surface to remove the top 1-2 inches of buds. All of these methods disturb the overwintering stage of the life cycle of Podosphaera macularis. Likewise, chemical control primarily consists of spraying fungicides in hopes of preventing the disease through the use of early, continuous spraying during the growing season. Thus, prophylactic fungicide programs can be a very effective way in preventing the disease. Since the fungicides are a preventative measure, they are not very useful to use during a full-blown infection. Therefore, the use of fungicides disturbs release of spores and further infection within the disease cycle of Podosphaera macularis. As there are several fungicides that are effective against powdery mildew, it is important to apply the fungicides at specific times. If it is known that powdery mildew is present, spray programs should be started as soon as the shoots emerge. Due to powdery mildew's ability to quickly develop resistance to fungicides, it is important to rotate the fungicides that are used. However, few or no fungicide applications should be used during burr development as these burrs have increased vulnerability to damage. In this case, removing basal growth before flowering and applying a protectant fungicide with long-term residual action should be employed.|$|R
30|$|The {{results in}} Fig.  4 {{are thought to}} be {{important}} because they demonstrate the possibility of improvement of juvenile wood properties by silvicultural practices. It is assumed that growth traits of plantation trees are affected by the genetic factor of planted trees and the environmental factor of the plantation site. We reported the variation of wood properties among hinoki half-sib families (plus trees selected as trees with various superior traits, e.g., fast growth and trunk straightness) and the effect of diameter growth on wood properties [23]. In the previous study, we did not examine the effect of tree height on wood properties. There may be hinoki plus trees with superior tree height growth in younger age. Based on the results from Fig.  4, these plus trees may have superior juvenile wood properties. In 4 -year-old radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and 8 -year-old slash pine (Pinus elliottii), a larger H/D and greater tree height increased the stiffness of juvenile wood, respectively [33 – 35]. These results in other conifer trees are consistent with Fig.  4. In sugi trees, it was reported that site indexes and local environment of plantations also affected height growth of trees [36, 37]. We studied on a sugi cultivar stand, in which trees of each cultivar were planted in a row from the upper to {{the lower part of the}} slope [10]. Many sugi cultivars planted at the lower part of the slope had a larger tree height and DBH than trees at the upper part of the slope. Therefore, selecting hinoki families with superior height growth and/or selecting plantation sites with larger site indexes may increase tree height in younger age, and improve juvenile wood properties by decreasing MFA. We reported that a positive effect of crown length and a negative effect of the distance from crown base on IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues in sugi cultivars [31]. We reported the possible effects of IAA amounts on MFA [32]. If these results in sugi trees held true in hinoki trees, creating shorter crown length and higher position of <b>crown</b> base by <b>pruning</b> in juvenile trees might decrease IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues, and thus induce smaller MFA. In generally, pruning is believed to be a silvicultural practice for the production of lumbers with smaller number of knots. According to our previous and current studies, pruning may have additional effects on juvenile wood properties. More studies on juvenile hinoki trees should be conducted for a better understanding of juvenile wood properties.|$|R

O plantio de 3 anos possui 1. 240 árvores com espaçamento de 1, 5 m x 2, 0 m, e o plantio de 5 anos possui 335 árvores e espaçamento de 3 m x 4 m. Foi utilizado um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente ao acaso, com esquema fatorial de 2 x 2 (intensidade de poda e adubação), composto por 4 tratamentos. Foram utilizados dez repetições para cada tratamento, por plantio. As copas foram podadas e quantificadas a biomassa dos galhos e folhas, através do método direto. Para a adubação foram utilizados os adubos: calcário dolomítico, uréia (45 % N), superfosfato triplo (40 % P 2 O 5), cloreto de potássio (60 % K 2 O). A avaliação da rebrota da copa foi obtida pelo número, comprimento e diâmetro das rebrotas. Após 12 meses, as árvores foram novamente podadas e determinada a biomassa da rebrota produzida e qualificado e quantificado o óleo de galhos e folhas. Para a avaliação da produtividade do óleo essencial foram selecionadas três amostras aleatórias de cada tratamento. A extração do óleo foi feita por hidrodestilação, utilizando o aparelho de Clevenger. A qualidade do óleo foi determinada através de cromatografia gasosa acoplada à espectroscopia de massas (CG-EM), assim como a quantificação do linalol, determinado por cromatografia gasosa com detector de ionização de chamas (CG-DIC). A maior produção de biomassa total da copa de árvores de pau-rosa foi obtida no plantio de 5 anos de idade, com 24 ton/ha, enquanto que no plantio de 3 anos produziu uma quantidade inferior, com cerca de 5 ton/ha. O plantio de 3 anos produziu maior quantidade de biomassa das rebrotas (16 ton/ha), em apenas 12 meses da aplicação da poda, enquanto o plantio de 5 anos produziu quantidade inferior (13 ton/ha). Os tratamentos com poda a 100 % tiveram melhores respostas na produção de biomassa das rebrotas de galhos e folhas, em ambos os plantios. A adubação não foi um fator determinante na produção de biomassa das rebrotas da copa, no intervalo de tempo de 12 meses. O rendimento de óleo, no plantio de 3 anos, foi maior no tratamento com poda a 100 % e adubação, tanto de galhos quanto de folhas, com 2, 43 % e 4, 28 %, respectivamente, enquanto que no plantio de 5 anos, o maior rendimento de óleo dos galhos foi obtido no tratamento com poda a 50 % e adubação. O teor de linalol encontrado nos óleos de galhos foi superior ao dos óleos das folhas, com 64 % de linalol nos galhos e 50 % nas folhas do plantio de 3 anos, e 65 % de linalol nos galhos e 38 % nas folhas do plantio de 5 anos. O conteúdo de óleo essencial e de linalol nas folhas e galhos finos, mostrou que é mais rentável a extração de óleo destas partes vegetais do que os obtidos da madeira. Além de evitar a extinção da espécie, proporciona maior produção, principalmente se for adotado o sistema de podas periódicas. This study {{aimed to}} evaluate the production of biomass and productivity of oil branches and leaves of rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora) trees in commercial plantations with ages of 3 and 5 years, subject to pruning and fertilization, located in Maués, states of Amazonas, Brazil. The planting of 3 years has 1, 240 trees with spacing of 1. 5 m x 2. 0 m and the planting of 5 years has 335 trees with spacing of 3 m x 4 m. A completely randomized design {{was used for the}} experiment, with factorial of 2 x 2 (intensity of pruning and fertilization), composed of 4 treatments, with ten replicates were used for each treatment, for plantation. The <b>crowns</b> were <b>pruned</b> and quantified the biomass of branches and leaves, through the direct method. For fertilization were used dolomitic limestone, urea (45 % N), triple superphosphate (40 % P 2 O 5), potassium chloride (60 % K 2 O). The evaluation of sprout of the crown was made by resulting in the number, length and diameter of sprouts. After 12 months, the trees were pruned again; determining the amount of biomass produced the sprout and quantified and qualified the oil of branches and leaves. To the evaluation of the productivity of essential oil were selected three random samples of each treatment. The extraction of oil was made by hidrodistillation, using apparatus for Clevenger. The quality of the oil was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the quantification of linalool, determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The highest total biomass production of the crowns of trees, rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora) was obtained from the planting of 5 years old, with 24 ton/ha, whereas in the planting of 3 years produced a smaller quantity, with about 5 ton/ha. The planting of 3 years produced the largest quantity of biomass of sprout (16 ton/ha) in only 12 months of implementation of pruning, while the planting of 5 years produced smaller quantity (13 ton/ha). The treatments with pruning to 100 % of which had better answer with respect to the production of biomass of sprout of branches and leaves, in both plantations. The fertilizer was not a determining factor in the production of biomass of sprout of the crown, in plantations of 3 and 5 years, in the time interval of 12 months. The production of oil in the planting of 3 years was higher in treatment with a 100 % pruning and fertilization, as both branches of leaves, with 2. 43 % and 4. 28 % respectively, while the planting of 5 years the higher production of branches oil was obtained in treatment with a 50 % pruning and fertilization. The content of linalool found in oils of branches was higher than that of oils from the leaves, with 65 % of linalool in branches and 50 % in the leaves, in the planting of 3 years, and 65 % of linalool in branches and 38 % in the leaves of planting of 5 years. The content of essential oil and linalool in the branches and leaves showed that it is more profitable to extract oil from these parts of the plant that made of wood. In addition to prevent the extinction of species, provides increased production, especially if it is adopted the system of periodic pruning...|$|R
