40|$|An {{issue in}} the area of {{insurance}} law that has been litigated frequently in recent years is whether <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> are “occurrences” under Commercial General Liability (“CGL”) insurance policies. The courts have been divided in deciding the issue and in their approaches to analyzing the issue. This article addresses how the issue should be analyzed and concludes that <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> are “occurrences”. The relevant rules of insurance policy interpretation dictate that <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> are “occurrences”. Policy language should be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the policyholder when the policy is construed as a whole with all ambiguities in the policy to be construed in favor of coverage. “Occurrence” is defined in CGL policies as an “accident,” including continuous or repeated exposure to harmful conditions, but the term “accident” itself is undefined. The common law provides that an “accident” is an event or happening that unexpectedly and unintentionally results in property damage. Thus, in determining whether <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> are “occurrences”, the analysis should focus upon whether the faulty workmanship and resulting damage was expected or intended by the contractor/policyholder. If the faulty workmanship and resulting damage was unexpected and unintended by the contractor, which typically is the case, then the resulting <b>construction</b> <b>defects,</b> and any related property damage, were caused by an “occurrence”. Such a result is consistent with contractors’ reasonable expectations regarding the coverage they think they are purchasing under CGL policies. Contractors reasonably expect that when they purchase CGL insurance to cover their business liabilities that they will receive coverage for liability claims relating to property damage arising out of their business activities, which often include claims for alleged <b>construction</b> <b>defects.</b> Thus, if <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> were not “occurrences” under CGL policies, then CGL policies unfairly and impermissibly would provide illusory coverage to contractors. Finally, if <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> were not “occurrences” in the first instance, then the “business risk” exclusions found in CGL policies, which purport to exclude coverage for certain risks inherent in doing business, would be superfluous. Thus, construing CGL policies as a whole also leads to the conclusion that <b>construction</b> <b>defects</b> are “occurrences”...|$|R

50|$|A Contractor Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) {{is similar}} to an OCIP except that the general {{contractor}} (GC) or construction manager sponsors the insurance program. There have also been hybrid programs combining features of an OCIP and CCIP on a loss-sensitive basis; that is, the property owner and GC share in the expected savings, but they also agree to share any additional costs if losses are higher than expected. A Developer Controlled Insurance Program (DCIP) is also similar to an OCIP but might not include WC; instead, a DCIP provides CGL, umbrella and excess mainly for protection against <b>construction</b> <b>defect</b> claims.|$|E

50|$|Tunnels can be {{extremely}} dangerous — superheated steam pipes are not always completely insulated; when they are insulated, it is occasionally with carcinogenic materials like asbestos. Opening or damaging a steam valve or pipe can be potentially deadly. Steam contains significantly more thermal energy than boiling water, and transfers that energy when it condenses on solid objects such as skin. It is typically provided under high pressure, meaning that comparatively minor pipe damage can fill a tunnel with steam quickly. In 2008, a high-pressure steam pipe exploded {{in the basement of}} Building 66 at MIT, apparently due to a <b>construction</b> <b>defect.</b> The explosion and ensuing flood caused extensive damage and lethal conditions in the basement.|$|E

40|$|The phrase “all good {{architecture}} leaks ” can {{be traced}} back to Oslo School of Architecture (AHO) in the 1970 s. The history and context of this phrase now form the basis for a doctorate study on design-related <b>construction</b> <b>defects.</b> Supported by social-anthropological thought models, the frames of interpretation for the phrase were examined [1]. As part of this examination, the driving forces of architecture as a subject were studied supported by simple explanatory models [2]. Data were collected through interviews and detailed literature studies, and resulted in deep insight into the problem area. The study revealed the existence of several phrases about the same phenomenon, i. e. architecture with quality deficiencies. One of these phrases came from a foresighted senior researcher at the Norwegian Building Research Institute (NBI) knowing that being creative and original in architecture can be risky: “All prize-awarded buildings have multiple defects. ” Another was coined by the famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright: “If the roof doesn’t leak, the architect hasn’t been creative enough ” [3]. In a simplified manner, these humorous words of wisdom express a well-known and complex yet tabooed phenomenon. Through the study, two cultural representations have emerged – one belonging to the experimental avant-garde architects, and the other rooted in down-to-earth and practical architect engineers. These opposites nurture a tension that influences the phenomenon of <b>construction</b> <b>defects.</b> The revelation of this mechanism is significant in further research on the topic design-related <b>construction</b> <b>defects...</b>|$|R
