40|$|The {{isolation}} of Indonesian <b>cananga</b> oil {{was carried out}} by a new process, instantaneous controlled pressure drop (DIC). Dry <b>cananga</b> flowers (<b>Cananga</b> odorata Hook. fil. et Thomson, forma macrophylla) were exposed for a short time to saturated steam and then the pressure was abruptly decreased to a vacuum level (about 5 kPa). This abrupt pressure drop provokes auto-vaporization of the superheated volatile compounds, expansion and breaking of the cell walls and instantaneous cooling. In this study, the effects of two parameters of DIC process namely pressure-drop rate and flowers moisture content on the yield of essential oil and its grouped compounds such as oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and other light and heavy oxygenated compounds were studied. The oil composition was analyzed by GC coupled with MS. The availability of the volatile compounds in the residual flowers was analyzed using organic solvent extraction. The quantity of compounds obtained by DIC treatment increased with pressure-drop rate. At a rate of 1. 43 MPa/s the total amount of compounds in the direct and residual oils was greater than in the reference oil obtained by chloroform extraction (2 h) from untreated flowers. The hydration of dry <b>cananga</b> flowers had no effect on the essential oil yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of <b>cananga</b> oil {{by a new}} process, Instantaneous Controlled Pressure Drop (DIC), was investigated. This process consists in heating the dry <b>cananga</b> (<b>Cananga</b> odorata Hook. fil. et Thomson,forma macrophylla) flowers {{for a short time}} period by steam, followed by an abrupt pressure drop into a vacuum (about 5 kPa). This pressure drop provokes auto-vaporization of the volatile compounds, puffing of flowers, breaking of cell walls and cooling. The effect of the process parameters, namely number of DIC cycles (1 - 9), saturated steam pressure (0. 2 - 0. 6 MPa), and heating time (0. 5 - 20 min) on the oil yield and oil composition was examined. The results indicated a significant increase of oil yield with increasing processing pressure and number of DIC cycles, however the total heating time was not a significant parameter. The DIC oil was compared with the oil obtained using steam distillation (SD). DIC exhibited better results than SD concerning rapidity (4 min versus 24 h), oil yield (2. 74 % versus 2. 60 %) and also oil quality...|$|E
40|$|Dry <b>cananga</b> (<b>Cananga</b> odorata Hook. fil. et Thomson, forma macrophylla) {{flowers were}} steamed {{for a short}} time after which an abrupt {{pressure}} drop into a vacuum (about 5 kPa) was applied (DIC process). This pressure drop provoked auto-vaporization of the volatile compounds, puffing of flowers, breaking of cell walls, and cooling. The yields of major volatile compounds of the <b>cananga</b> oil obtained from the condensate were studied as functions of heating time (0. 5 to 20 min) and cycle number (1 to 8) at different steam pressures (0. 2 to 0. 6 MPa). The results of DIC isolation and steam distillation (SD) were compared. A satisfactory yield of oil without thermal degradation was obtained using several DIC cycles with a high steam pressure (0. 6 MPa) and short heating time (< 1 min). The quantity of the oil obtained by SD in 12 h was isolated by DIC in 4 min. The quality of DIC oil was better because it contained more light and heavy oxygenated compounds (LOC and HOC) than the SD oil. The DIC isolation kinetics leads to the conclusion that sesquiterpenes and LOC are located in the exogenous site and a majority of HOC in the endogenous site...|$|E
