5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the road surface or speed limits do not <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed and a hard shoulder would also need to be built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E
25|$|Under rescaling, {{when the}} system is shrunk {{by a factor of}} (1+b), the t {{coefficient}} scales up by a factor (1+b)2 by dimensional analysis. The change in t for infinitesimal b is 2bt. The other two coefficients are dimensionless and do not <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Gould, [...] "stasis {{may emerge}} as the theory's most {{important}} contribution to evolutionary science." [...] Philosopher Kim Sterelny adds, [...] "In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming {{that there is no}} <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch describes this very process." ...|$|E

The mines changed yet again as they could carry 100 KB or 106 Model 1926 mines.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{static port}} {{is a more}} serious {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. [...] A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. [...] The vertical speed indicator will become frozen at zero and will not <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> even if vertical speed increases or decreases. [...] The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. [...] When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. [...] In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{container}} with an ideal gas is expanded instantaneously, {{the temperature of}} the gas doesn't <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> because none of the molecules slow down. The molecules keep their kinetic energy, but now the gas occupies a bigger volume. If the container expands slowly, however, so that the ideal gas pressure law holds at any time, gas molecules lose energy at the rate that they do work on the expanding wall. The amount of work they do is the pressure times the area of the wall times the outward displacement, which is the pressure times the change in the volume of the gas: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{language}} was {{a descendant of}} the Proto-Slavic language and faithfully retained many of its features. A striking innovation {{in the evolution of}} this {{language was}} the development of so-called pleophony (or polnoglasie 'full vocalisation'), which came to differentiate the newly evolving East Slavic from other Slavic dialects. For instance, Common Slavic *gordъ 'settlement, town' was reflected as OESl. gorodъ, Common Slavic [...] 'milk' > OESl. moloko, and Common Slavic [...] 'cow' > OESl korova. Other Slavic dialects are differed by resolving the closed-syllable clusters *eRC and *aRC as liquid metathesis (South Slavic and West Slavic), or by no <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> (see the article on Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony for a detailed account).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} {{illustrated}} {{with the help}} of [...] Figure 1 both X1 and X2 are normal goods in which case, the demand for the good increases as money income rises. However, if the consumer has different preferences, he has the option to choose X0 or X+ on budget line B2. As the income of the consumer rises,and the consumer chooses X0 instead of X' i.e. if the consumer's indifference curve is I4 and not I2, then the demand for X1 would fall [...] In that case, X1 would be called an inferior good i.e. demand for good X1 decreases with a rise in income of the consumer. Thus, a rise in income of the consumer may lead his demand for a good to rise, fall or not <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> It is important to note here that, the knowledge of preferences of the consumer is essential to predict whether a particular good is inferior or normal.|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche's philosophy, while {{innovative}} and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, {{and the text}} of this lecture series has been characterized as a [...] "lost link" [...] {{in the development of}} his thought. [...] "In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche." [...] The pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus was known for the rejection of the concept of being as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of [...] "flux" [...] and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as [...] "child play" [...] marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche. From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of Parmenides, who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no <b>change</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
