The <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> {{was designed to be}} chemical compatible with the ceramic electrolyte (YSZ) and the interconnect (AISI 430), to have suitable thermo-mechanical properties (Tg, Thermal Expansion Coefficient, TEC), and good wettability with them. The reinforcing phase (alumina) was chosen to increase the seal viscosity at the SOFC working temperature (about 800 °C), to improve the thermal shock resistance of the seal and to match the thermal expansion coefficient of the components to be joined. The seal was morphological and thermo-mechanical characterized by scanning electron microscopy, SEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS, thermo mechanical analysis, TMA, X-ray diffraction, XRD and differential thermal analysis, DTA. 2 The joining process between YSZ and AISI 430 was optimized taking into account that the maximum process temperature should be around 1000 °C.

In this study, taking cement as a base material, a new <b>composite</b> <b>sealing</b> material mixed by expansion admixture, additive, fibrin and coupling agent was developed and the sealing performance and expansion performance of the material were also studied and analyzed.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{currently}} {{developing a new}} universal docking mechanism for future space exploration missions called the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). A candidate LIDS main interface seal design is a composite assembly of silicone elastomer seals vacuum molded into grooves in an electroless nickel plated aluminum retainer. The strength of the silicone-tometal bond is a critical consideration for the new system, especially due {{to the presence of}} small areas of disbond created during the molding process. In the work presented herein, seal-to-retainer bonds of subscale seal specimens with different sizes of intentional disbond were destructively tensile tested. Nominal specimens without intentional disbonds were also tested. Tension was applied either uniformly on the entire seal circumference or locally in one short circumferential length. Bond failure due to uniform tension produced a wide scatter of observable failure modes and measured load-displacement behaviors. Although the preferable failure mode for the seal-to-retainer bond is cohesive failure of the elastomer material, the dominant observed failure mode under the uniform loading condition was found to be the less desirable adhesive failure of the bond in question. The uniform tension case results did not show a correlation between disbond size and bond strength. Localized tension was found to produce failure either as immediate tearing of the elastomer material outside the bond region or as complete peel-out of the seal in one piece. The obtained results represent a valuable benchmark for comparison in the future between adhesion loads under various separation conditions and <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> bond strength...|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} two avenues of investigation: {{a new concept}} of Direct Carbon Fuel Cell (DCFC) {{and the production of}} carbon from biomass. The new concept of DCFC merges a solid oxide electrolyte and a molten carbonate electrolyte called the “hybrid direct carbon fuel cell” using tubular geometry. The tubular cell was chosen for several reasons, such as sealing process, reduction of stress during the sintering process and reduction of the final size of the stack. In addition, it makes the fuelling process easier than in planar geometry. The previous tests carried out on tubular hybrid direct carbon fuel cell at the University of St Andrews showed promising results. In fact, a power of 85 mW was achieved at 800 ºC. However this temperature was too high and so the focus of the new project was on decreasing the operating temperature to 650 ºC, replacing the YSZ electrolyte used in the previous configuration with an electrolyte such as GDC, which showed better performance at low temperature. YSZ was substituted for GDC in the anodes and cathode in order to prevent an increase in the interface resistance due to the possible reaction between electrolyte and electrodes at the interface. Anodes with different proportions of NiO and GDC were investigated {{in order to understand the}} electrochemical phenomena in the presence of GDC compared to YSZ. Three different electrical configurations were investigated by AC impedance studies because the electrochemistry of the cell changes as function of the position and the surface of the current collector, which is dipped into the anode chamber. Performance improved when the surface area of the current collector increased, which combined a silver wire with strip of nickel mesh. Two types of seals (552 ceramabond and ToKu adhesive) and the sealing process were also studied in order to prevent leakage, which affects the performance of the entire cell. The leakages were reduced using a <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> composed of alumina paste and a combination of flexi disks of mica and alumina fibre disk. In the preliminary test using 70 - 30...|$|E
40|$|Helium leak {{tests were}} {{completed}} {{to characterize the}} leak rate of a 54 in. diameter composite space docking seal design {{in support of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration s (NASA's) Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). The evaluated seal design was a candidate for the main interface seal on the LIDS, which would be compressed between two vehicles, while docked, to prevent the escape of breathable air from the vehicles and into the vacuum of space. Leak tests completed at nominal temperatures of - 30, 20, and 50 C on untreated and atomic oxygen (AO) exposed test samples were examined to determine the influence of both test temperature and AO exposure on the performance of the <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> assembly. Results obtained for untreated seal samples showed leak rates which increased with increased test temperature. This general trend was not observed in tests of the AO exposed specimens. Initial examination of collected test data suggested that AO exposure resulted in higher helium leak rates, however, further analysis showed that the differences observed in the 20 and 50 C tests between the untreated and AO exposed samples were within the experimental error of the test method. Lack of discernable trends in the test data prevented concrete conclusions about the effects of test temperature and AO exposure on helium leak rates of the candidate seal design from being drawn. To facilitate a comparison of the current test data with results from previous leak tests using air as the test fluid, helium leak rates were converted to air leak rates using standard conversion factors for viscous and molecular flow. Flow rates calculated using the viscous flow conversion factor were significantly higher than the experimental air leakage values, whereas values calculated using the molecular flow conversion factor were significantly lower than the experimentally obtained air leak rates. The difference in these sets of converted flow rates and their deviation from the experimentally obtained air leak rate data suggest that neither conversion factor can be used alone to accurately convert helium leak rates to equivalent air leak rates for the test seals evaluated in this study; other leak phenomena, including permeation, must also be considered...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In an {{industrial}} application, equipment uptime {{is vital for}} on-time performance and profitability.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on <b>composite</b> rubber <b>seal</b> strips that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and sealing test devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested. Finally, full-scale waterproofing tests on tunnel joints were conducted. The experimental results provide a scientific reference for the engineering application and design of <b>composite</b> <b>sealing</b> rubber strips putty for underground post-tensioned precast concrete structures.|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) hold great promise for clean power generation. However, high {{temperature}} stability {{and long term}} durability of the SOFC components have presented serious problems in SOFC technological advancement and commercialization. The seals of the fuel cells are the most challenging area to address. A high temperature gas seal is highly needed which is durable against cracking and gas leakage during thermal cycling and extended operation. This project investigates a novel <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> by integrating 3 D printed shape memory alloy (SMA) wires into a glass matrix. The SMA we use is TiNiHf and the glass matrix we use is SrO-La{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-SiO{sub 2 } (SLABS). Dilatometry shows to be an extremely useful tool in providing the CTEs. It pinpoints regions of different CTEs under simulated SOFC thermal cycles for the same glass. For the studied SLABS glass system, the region with the greatest CTE mismatch between the glass seal and the adjacent components is 40 - 500 C, the typical heating and cooling regions for SOFCs. Even for low temperature SOFC development, this region is still present {{and needs to be}} addressed. We have demonstrated that the proposed SLABS glass has great potential in mitigating the thermal expansion mismatch issues that are limiting the operation life of SOFCs. TiNiHf alloy has been successfully synthesized with the desired particle size for the 3 DP process. The TiNiHf SMA shape memory effect very desirably overlaps with the problematic low CTE region of the glass. This supports the design intent that the gradient structure transition, phase transformation toughening, and self-healing of the SMA can be utilized to mitigate/eliminate the seal problem. For the 3 DP process, a new binder has been identified to match with the specific chemistry of the SMA particles. This enables us to directly print SMA particles. Neutron diffraction shows to be an extremely useful tool in providing information regarding the austenite to martensite phase transformation, SMA alloy lattice constant change, and the corresponding thermal stress from the glass matrix. It pinpoints regions of SMA phase transformation and the thermal stress effect under simulated SOFC thermal cycles. The bilayer test shows that there is still much work to be done for the proper integration of the seal components. Large scale production should lower the cost associated with the proposed approach, especially on the raw material cost and 3 D printing...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Pittsburgh Research Laboratory {{conducted}} a full-scale {{test of a}} composite polyurethane-aggregate seal in a hydrostatic chamber at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine. This <b>composite</b> <b>seal</b> consisted of a polyurethane and limestone aggregate core that was formed between two concrete block walls. In the hydrostatic chamber test, water is used to pressurize the seal. During the test, the maximum average water pressure the seal was able to withstand was 18. 9 psi. Further, the seal began to yield at an average water pressure of only 17 psi. At {{the time of the}} test, the minimum seal design requirement was 20 psi under 30 CFR 4 75. 335 (2005). Therefore, based on this test, the seal did not meet the regulatory minimum design requirement. Uniaxial compressive tests conducted on samples from the polyurethane-aggregate core revealed that both the compressive strength and the elastic modulus of the material were much less than that for polyurethane only with a density of 10. 0 - 12. 0 lb/ft 3. The significant reduction in the strength and stiffness of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture results from the formation of a soft polyurethane foam around each piece of aggregate. The formation of the soft foam seems to be caused by residual moisture from the aggregate. The moisture also caused the density of the polyurethane in the polyurethane-aggregate mixture to be less than the design requirements. The lower density of the polyurethane in the mixture, along with the formation of zones of pure polyurethane only, resulted in the overall seal density being less than the design requirements. During seal construction, steps were taken to control the moisture, but were not successful. An analysis of the seal failure showed that the calculated shear stresses at failure and the estimated shear strength of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture are fairly close. This suggests that the strength properties of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture along with a weak zone of poorly bonded aggregate controlled the maximum pressure the seal could withstand. At the time of the seal testing, the minimum design requirement was 20 psi, as specified at 30 CFR 75. 335 (2005). New emergency temporary standards for seal designs were promulgated on May 22, 2007, with a minimum requirement of 50 psi under specified conditions. However, it will be shown that the evaluation of the polyurethane seal performance as designed to meet the older 20 -psi criterion can be relevant to the design requirements under the new standards.

40|$|Coal bed Methane (CBM), {{a primary}} {{component}} of natural gas, {{is a relatively}} clean source of energy. Nevertheless, the impact of considerable coal mine methane emission on climate change in China has gained an increasing attention as coal production has powered the country 2 ̆ 7 s economic development. It is well-known that coal bed methane is a typical greenhouse gas, the greenhouse effect index of which is 30 times larger than that of carbon dioxide. Besides, gas disasters such as gas explosive and outburst, etc. pose a great threat {{to the safety of}} miners. Therefore, measures must be taken to capture coal mine methane before mining. This helps to enhance safety during mining and extract an environmentally friendly gas as well. However, as a majority of coal seams in China have low-permeability, it is difficult to achieve efficient methane drainage. Enhancing coal permeability is a good choice for high-efficiency drainage of coal mine methane. In this paper, a modified coal-methane co-exploitation model was established and a combination of drilling–slotting-separation–sealing was proposed to enhance coal permeability and CBM recovery. Firstly, rapid drilling assisted by water-jet and significant permeability enhancement via pressure relief were investigated, guiding the fracture network formation around borehole for high efficient gas flow. Secondly, based on the principle of swirl separation, the coal–water–gas separation instrument was developed to eliminate the risk of gas accumulation during slotting and reduce the gas emission from the ventilation air.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryX. Susan SunPoly(lactic acid) (PLA), a {{synthetic}} biopolymer, is a promising substitute of some petroleum-based polymers {{due to its}} mechanical and biodegradable properties. But, {{because of the high}} cost of PLA (compared to those petroleum plastics for disposable application), starch has been incorporated into PLA to reduce cost and accelerate the biodegradability rate of the composites. But, the addition of starch as filler to PLA decreased mechanical performance of the composite. The addition of methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) into PLA/starch blends improved drastically the mechanical properties of the composite. Results from thermal-degradation analysis showed that PLA had the highest Arrhenius activation energy and strongest thermal endurance of all samples, followed by PLA/starch/MDI and PLA/starch. Aged samples exposed to fluctuating humidity storage conditions significantly decreased their performance. But, storing the samples in plastic bags could minimize degradation of properties. PLA and its composites with starch would not significantly affect application function when they are stored in controlled environment. PLA and PLA/starch based <b>composites</b> <b>sealed</b> in plastic bags can be stored in fluctuating humidity conditions (30 - 90 % RH) for up to 30 days. Tensile strength, elongation, and damping increased with average particle size of starch granules (APS). But, declination of these properties was detected with APS larger than 45 mm. Crystallinity increased as the APS decreased. Young’s modulus, storage modulus, and moisture absorption were not significantly affected by the starch APS. The use of MDI as a coupling agent altered the role of starch APS on those properties of poly(lactic acid) /starch composite. The oxidation of the primary alcohol group on C 6 of starch molecules up to 10 % degree of substitution did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of PLA/starch/MDI, but the composites showed a reduced inelastic deformation (tensile curve) and significant increase in storage modulus and damping. Results suggest that a substitution of hydroxyl group on C 6 of starch molecules for carboxyl group (up to 10 %) increased the strengthening effect of MDI enough to reduce inelastic deformation of the composites upon load, but not enough to enhance mechanical properties...|$|R

For the mesofluidic device, a homemade polyetheretherketone (PEEK) flow cell with 800 μL internal volume was screwed on a steel support with a glass slide and the photocatalytic composite. The photocatalytic activities of the devices were evaluated using two different pumping flow systems: a peristaltic pump and a syringe pump, both at 0. 05 mL/min under the action of 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. The characterization of TiO 2 –PDMS composite was performed by confocal Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The photocatalytic microreactor was the most efficient, showing high organic dye photodegradation (88. 4 % at 12. 5 mW/cm 2) ...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{operating}} state of aeroengines {{has an impact}} on the performance of finger seals. However, little work has been focused on the issue and the dynamic performance of finger seals is also rarely studied. Therefore, a distributed mass equivalent model considering working conditions is proposed in this paper for solving the existing problems. The effects of the fiber bundle density and the preparation direction of the fiber bundle of a C/C composite on the dynamic performance of a finger seal are investigated in rotor tilt based on the proposed model. The difference between the C/C <b>composite</b> finger <b>seal</b> performances under the rotor precession and nutation tilt cases is also investigated. The results show that the fiber bundle density and the preparation direction of the fiber bundle have an influence on the dynamic performance of the finger seal as rotor tilt is considered, and the dynamic performance of the finger seal is different in the two kinds of tilting modes. In addition, a novel method for design of finger seals is presented based on the contact pressure between finger boots and the rotor. Finger seals with good leakage rates and low wear can be acquired in this method...|$|R
40|$|SiC-fiber {{reinforced}} SiC matrix composites with a BN interphase were oxidized in reduced oxygen partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{to simulate the}} environment for hypersonic vehicle leading edge applications. The constituent fibers as well as composite coupons were oxidized in oxygen partial pressures ranging from 1000 ppm O 2 to 5 % O 2 balance argon. Exposure temperatures ranged from 816 C to 1353 C (1500 F to 2450 F). The oxidation kinetics of the coated fibers were monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An initial rapid transient weight gain was observed followed by parabolic kinetics. Possible mechanisms for the transient oxidation are discussed. One edge of the <b>composite</b> coupon <b>seal</b> coat was ground off to simulate damage to the composite which allowed oxygen ingress to {{the interior of the}} composite. Oxidation kinetics of the coupons were characterized by scanning electron microscopy since the weight changes were minimal. It was found that sealing of the coupon edge by silica formation occurred. Differences in the amount and morphology of the sealing silica as a function of time, temperature and oxygen partial pressure are discussed. Implications for use of these materials for hypersonic vehicle leading edge materials are summarized...|$|R
40|$|The {{preventive}} {{effect of}} sealing materials depends on ability to penetrate into the fissures, and microleakage absence, resulting with better clinical success. The aim of {{present study was}} to investigate the influence of ozone on microleakage and penetration of nanoparticle fissure sealing resin and flowable composite, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of microleakage. Forty extracted non carious third molars were randomly divided in 4 groups. Group A: KaVo Healozone and Grandio Seal; Group B: Kavo Healozone and X-Flow; Group C: Grandio Seal; Group D: X-Flow. The teeth were thermocycled, immersed in 5 % methylene dye for 24 hours, and sectioned with precision saw. The total of 149 slices were analysed with stereomicroscope for microleakage and sealant penetration. According to qualitative scores, there is a significant difference between groups C and D, group C showing better results. According to quantitative scores, there are no statistical differences between the groups. The treatment of the enamel with KaVo HealOzone after etching does not affect either microleakage or penetration proportion of flowable <b>composite</b> or <b>sealing</b> resin. There is no statistically significant difference in a degree of penetration between different groups of sealing materials. Groups of materials with flowable composite in combination with an adhesive system show a good degree of penetration into the fissure and low microleakage meaning that they {{can be used as a}} fissure sealing materials...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{discoloration}} {{varies in}} etiology, appearance, localization, severity, and adhesion to tooth structure. It {{can be defined}} as being extrinsic or intrinsic on the basis of localization and etiology. In this review of the literature, various causes of tooth discoloration, different bleaching materials, and their applications to endodontically treated teeth have been described. In the walking bleach technique the root filling should be completed first, and a cervical seal must be established. The bleaching agent should be changed every 3 - 7 days. The thermocatalytic technique involves placement of a bleaching agent in the pulp chamber followed by heat application. At the end of each visit the bleaching agent is left in the tooth so that it can function as a walking bleach until the next visit. External bleaching of endodontically treated teeth with an in-office technique requires a high concentration gel. it might be a supplement to the walking bleach technique, if the results are not satisfactory after 3 - 4 visits. These treatments require a bonded temporary filling or a bonded resin <b>composite</b> to <b>seal</b> the access cavity. There is a deficiency of evidence-based science in the literature that addresses the prognosis of bleached nonvital teeth. Therefore, it is important to always be aware of the possible complications and risks that are associated with the different bleaching techniques...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{cervical}} resorption {{is entirely}} uncommon entities and the etiology is poorly understood. A 19 year old patient presented with fractured upper left central incisor and sinus tract opening on the distobuccal aspect in cervical region. Radiographic examination shows irregular radiolucency over the coronal one-third and it extended externally towards the external invasive resorption. After sectional obturation, the defect was accessed surgically. The resorption area was chemomechanically debrided using irrigant solution. Fibre post placement using flowable composite resin and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) {{was used to}} fill the resorptive defect, and the coronal access was temporarily <b>sealed.</b> <b>Composite</b> restoration was subsequently replaced with ceramic crown after 4 years. Radiographs at 1 and 4 years showed adequate repair of the resorption and endodontic success. Clinically and radiographically the tooth was asymptomatic, and no periodontal pocket was found after a 4 -year followup...|$|R
40|$|Flat or curved micro {{heat pipe}} panels are {{fabricated}} by arranging essentially parallel filaments {{in the shape}} of the desired panel. The configuration of the filaments corresponds to the desired configuration of the tubes that will constitute the heat pipes. A thermally conductive material is then deposited on and around the filaments to fill in the desired shape of the panel. The filaments are then removed, leaving tubular passageways of the desired configuration and surface texture in the material. The tubes are then filled with a working fluid and <b>sealed.</b> <b>Composite</b> micro heat pipe laminates are formed by layering individual micro heat pipe panels and bonding them to each other to form a single structure. The layering sequence of the micro heat pipe panels can be tailored to transport heat preferentially in specific directions as desired for a particular application...|$|R
