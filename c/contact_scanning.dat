50|$|The {{process of}} {{comparing}} 3D data against a CAD model {{is referred to}} as CAD-Compare, and can be a useful technique for applications such as determining wear patterns on moulds and tooling, determining accuracy of final build, analysing gap and flush, or analysing highly complex sculpted surfaces. At present, laser triangulation scanners, structured light and <b>contact</b> <b>scanning</b> are the predominant technologies employed for industrial purposes, with <b>contact</b> <b>scanning</b> remaining the slowest, but overall most accurate option. Nevertheless, 3D scanning technology offers distinct advantages compared to traditional touch probe measurements. White-light or laser scanners accurately digitize objects all around, capturing fine details and freeform surfaces without reference points or spray. The entire surface is covered at record speed without the risk of damaging the part. Graphic comparison charts illustrate geometric deviations of full object level, providing deeper insights into potential causes.|$|E

Optical comparators are used when physically touching the part is undesirable. Instruments can now build 3D models of a part and its internal passages using x-ray technology or 3D laser scanners.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of new electrochemical scanning probe techniques and the application of these to biological problems. These techniques allow high resolution quantitative investigations of surface processes through measurements at a precisely placed electrode probe. A new technique, called intermittent <b>contact</b> <b>scanning</b> electrochemical microscopy, which allowed the probe-surface distance to be decisively determined through the physical interaction of the probe with the surface was developed. Separately, a new type of dual electrode probe was developed and characterised, and a new instrument (including both hardware and software) capable {{of a wide range of}} electrochemical imaging modes was developed with wide applications. The quantitative analysis of the electrochemical signal, typically measured at the probe, requires understanding the mass transport between the probe and the surface. Finite element modelling was used extensively throughout to solve the mass transport problem and therefore quantitatively analyse experimental results. Intermittent <b>contact</b> <b>scanning</b> electrochemical microscopy was used to quantify the mass transport through a porous biological membrane, dentin, that separates the pulp and enamel in teeth. Oxygen generation and consumption rates during photosynthesis were determined by measuring the local oxygen flux at an electrode placed a precise distance above a monolayer of isolated chloroplasts or thylakoid membranes. Finally, the new dual electrode probe was used to measure the reduction of an artificial electron acceptor by isolated thylakoid membranes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation into different metallisation structures {{aimed at reducing}} the contact resistance and morphology of p-type contacts to 4 H-SiC. The structures {{are based on a}} combination of Al/Ni and Al/Ti layers. The lowest specific contact resistivity obtained was based on a triple layer Al/Ti/Al contact, measured at 5. 0 x 10 (- 6) Omega cm(2). Analogously, for the triple layer contacts comprised of Al/Ni/Al, the lowest specific contact resistivity was measured at 4. 9 x 10 (- 4) Omega cm(2). In all cases {{it was found that the}} multiple layer structures remained rectifying even after annealing. A range of physical characterisation techniques were used to investigate these different structures. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans point to enhanced formation of silicides for triple layer contacts based on Al/Ti (Ti 3 SiC 2) and Al/Ni (NiSi,) when compared to multiple layer <b>contacts.</b> <b>Scanning</b> electron microscope (SEM) and wavelength dispersive analysis (WDA) measurements indicate that a multiple layer metallisation improves the morphology of the contact with respect to the Al spreading, which is known to be problematic during a high temperature anneal.

40|$|Azobenzene-{{functional}}ized polymer {{films are}} functional materials, where the (planar vs. homeotropic) orientation of azo-dyes {{can be used}} for storing data. In order to characterize the nanoscale 3 D orientation of the pigments in sub- 10 nm thick polymer films we use two complementary techniques: polarization-controlled tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) microscopy and <b>contact</b> <b>scanning</b> capacity microscopy. We demonstrate that the homeotropic and planar orientations of the azo-dyes are produced by applying a local dc electrical field and a resonant longitudinal optical near-field, respectively. For a non-destructive probe of the azo-dye orientation we apply a non-resonant optical near-field and compare the intensities of the Raman-active vibrational modes. We show that near-field Raman dichroism, a characteristic similar to the absorption dichroism used in far-field optics, can be a quantitative indicator of the 3 D molecular orientation of the azo-dye at the nanoscale. This study directly benefits the further development of photochromic near-field optical memory that can lead to ultrahigh density information storage...|$|E

Thin film metal bolometers are molded into tips {{at the end of each}} cantilever in the array, and are sandwiched between two layers of polyimide that serves as the structural material. The probes overhang a Si substrate on which they are fabricated. Since integrated actuators and accompanying circuitry are no longer required, the prospect of scaling from the present eight-probe version to large numbers of probes for high speed, high resolution thermal mapping of large areas with simple detection circuitry is enhanced. The scalability and performance of the eight-probe prototype are evaluated, addressing issues of speed versus resolution, and thermal and mechanical decoupling.
