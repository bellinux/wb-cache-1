2500|$|A coroner's {{report and}} {{subsequent}} ballistic investigation revealed that six bullets {{removed from the}} murdered men's bodies were of [...]32 automatic (ACP) caliber. Five of these [...]32-caliber bullets were all fired from a single automatic pistol, a [...]32-caliber Savage Model 1907, which used a particularly narrow-grooved barrel rifling with a right-hand twist. Two of the bullets were recovered from Berardelli's body. Four [...]32 automatic brass shell casings were found at the murder scene, manufactured by one of three firms: Peters, Winchester, or Remington. The Winchester cartridge case was of a relatively obsolete <b>cartridge</b> <b>loading,</b> which had been discontinued from production some years earlier.

Prosecutor Frederick Katzmann decided to participate in a forensic bullet examination using bullets test-fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt Automatic after the defense arranged for such tests. Sacco, saying he had nothing to hide, had allowed his gun to be test-fired, with experts for both sides present, during the trial's second week. The prosecution matched bullets fired through the gun to those taken from one of the slain men.|$|E

50|$|A {{collision}} of loaded railway cars being shunted at the powder works on 15 July 1890 triggered an explosion killing twelve people and starting fires destroying the railroad station, the freight house, two Peters Cartridge Company office buildings, the shell factory, the <b>cartridge</b> <b>loading</b> plant, a large warehouse and six employee residences. Wood-frame structures were rebuilt {{on the opposite}} side of the river from the old powder works included a large shot tower completed in 1895. The last wood-frame structures were machine shop building R-3 and shotgun shell loading building R-21 built in 1907. With the approach of World War I the company received large ammunition orders from the Russian Empire and from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Bullet manufacturing building R-6 was built of brick; and money from wartime contracts was used to replace most of the old wooden framed buildings with brick and reinforced concrete structures including the main R-1 building in 1916, the R-17 power house in 1917, metallic <b>cartridge</b> <b>loading</b> building R-2 in 1918, primer assembly building R-9, and the R-23 indoor shooting range and ballistics laboratory in 1919.

50|$|The {{standard}} 8 mm format {{was quickly}} displaced, {{for the most}} part, by the Super 8 mm film format - which offers <b>cartridge</b> <b>loading,</b> a 50% larger frame size and electric-powered cameras - from the mid-1960s onwards. Super 8 was criticized that the film gates in some cheaper Super 8 cameras were plastic, as was the pressure plate built into the cartridge; while the standard 8 cameras had a permanent metal film gate that was regarded as more reliable in keeping the film flat and the image in focus. In reality, {{this was not the}} case, since the plastic pressure plate could be moulded to far smaller tolerances than their metal counterparts could be machined. Another criticism of Super 8 was that more sophisticated standard 8 mm cameras permit backwind of the film - difficult but not impossible with a Super 8 cartridge - enabling simple double-exposure and dissolve effects to be made in-camera. Finally, Super 8's smaller sprocket holes, while allowing a larger frame size, were also inherently more liable to tear.|$|E

On April 15, 1920, {{two men were}} robbed and killed while {{transporting}} the company's payroll in two large steel boxes to the main factory. One of them, Alessandro Berardelli - a security guard - was shot four times {{as he reached for}} his hip-holstered [...]38-caliber, Harrington & Richardson revolver; his gun was not recovered from the scene. The other man, Frederick Parmenter - a paymaster who was unarmed - was shot twice: once in the chest and a second time, fatally, in the back as he attempted to flee. The robbers seized the payroll boxes and escaped in a stolen dark blue Buick that sped up and was carrying several other men.

40|$|Air {{cleaning}} efficiency {{tests on}} placing material load into the lavsan biofilter were carried out. Testing included butanol vapour-contaminated air stream pulled during the boot. The studies {{were conducted by}} the Department of Environmental Protection at VGTU that developed a biofilter – an experimental biological air cleaning device. Measurements were done using 60 l/min and 90 l/min air volume aspirators under the initial pollutant concentration making 180, 305, 350, 440 and 545 mg/m 3. Before measuring the concentrations of butanol lavsan <b>cartridge,</b> <b>loading</b> was periodically irrigated with nutrient-rich solution. In order to evaluate the influence of microorganisms on genus Pseudomonas, cleaning efficiency tests were repeated – Boot was moistened with water only, which allowed measuring butanol vapour concentrations after the cartridge. At the concentration of 180 ± 9 mg/m 3, efficiency reached 41 % at a speed of 0, 07 m/s and 46 % at a speed of 0, 10 m/s. Measuring {{the performance of the}} initial concentration of 545 ± 67 mg/m 3, efficiency was 54 % at 0, 07 m/s and 53 % at 0, 10 m/s respectively. Article in Lithuanian</p...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} the {{chemical}} or set of chemicals that act as a germination stimulant in Lactuca sativa v. Grand rapids (a variety of lettuce seed) was the underlying basis of this project. Through {{the development of a}} solid phase extraction (SPE) system different fractions of smoky water were tested for their effects on germination enhancement. The project targeted streamlining the amount of solvents as well as time used in past research on smoky water. Previously, several steps involving high perfo 1 mance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) were employed. This project used SPE cartridges to separate fractions and isolate components. Cartridges of the non-polar varieties were C­ 18, C 8, Phenyl and Cyanopropyl. After <b>cartridge</b> <b>loading</b> with smoky water and flushing, three fractions of increasing concentration of methanol from a buffered ethanoic acid/methanol system were created. These fractions were extracted into hexane before application to bioassays. Polar cartridges were also loaded with smoky water and fractionated with mixtures of hexane, and increasing concentrations of dichloromethane and methanol. These four fractions were not extracted but applied directly to bioassays. Fraction activity was prevalent in early eluting fractions from non-polar cartridges but the pattern was more varied from the polar cartridges. Solutions not retained by cartridges enhanced germination except for solutions from 20 H and Amino cartridges. GC fractions from the three C 18 fractions highlighted differences in peak number and comparative peak ratios within chromatograms. This emphasised that component separation was resulting from the SPE system. An adsorption test on seed coats of L. sativa was unable to reject the hypothesis that germination enhancing components do adsorb irreversibly to the seed coat. An application of l, 8 -cineole {{as a result of a}} poor Mass Spectrometry (MS) library match proved to be a source of germination enhancement at low concentrations...|$|E
