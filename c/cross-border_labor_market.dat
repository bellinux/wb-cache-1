This paper reviews the relevant issues focusing in particular on assignment of decision power {{at different levels of}} governance, and on theoretically clear and empirically apparent sources of incoherent and ineffective policy structures. It discusses proposals of citizenship-based or “delayed integration ” welfare systems as a way to enhance <b>cross-border</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> flexibility. It concludes that reform efforts should be better focused on reappraisal and modernization of social responsibilities at all levels of governance in the European Union’s economic system. 1 The policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of labor and stock both from employment to employment, and from place to place, occasions in some cases a very inconvenient inequality in the whole of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} their different employments.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the joint influence of migration inflows and outward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) on wage bargaining. Labor migration and offshoring supported by FDI affect wage deals by changing the outside options of workers and firms. Unemployed workers may find alternative jobs either in the legal or in the illegal <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> Wages in this latter case are highly affected by migrants crowding this segment more than any other market. Firms may have the option of moving production partly or entirely to foreign low-cost countries. A wage curve is designed theoretically, reflecting <b>cross-border</b> <b>labor</b> and capital mobility, and estimated on panel data for 13 European countries over the period 1995 – 2013.

In this paper I examine two case studies of cross -border labor organizing.

The PVH case illustrates the potential for <b>cross-border</b> <b>labor</b> organizing in the highly mobile garment industry. The PVH workers' union and their cross-border allies adopted a "strategic cross-border organizing model" that included consumer and trade pressure, an active international trade secretariat, and several other strategies, to achieve an amazing victory. However, the Ford Cuautitlan case demonstrates that corporatist state-labor relations and internal union conflicts have limited cross-border organizing in the automobile industry.

Our empirical results, based on an OECD country panel from 1990 - 2004, suggest that lower levels of product and <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> regulation foster employment growth, including through sizable interaction effects.

Optimal deregulation takes various forms depending on the deregulation costs, the strength of reform interactions, and the perspective of the policymaker.

This paper investigates the impact of such interventions on the <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> conditions faced by low-skill workers in Mauritius. It finds that even relatively minor intervention can dramatically increase the fragility of jobs, the length of unemployment spells, as well as the extent of unemployment and <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> churning. With institutions of the type studied here common across many different types of countries, these results have relatively general implications.

40|$|This paper evaluates European {{structural}} reforms {{over the last}} 20 years, in light of economic theory predictions about interactions between <b>labor</b> and product <b>market</b> reforms. Reforms in <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> occur at higher frequencies than in product market, which are, however, more coherent. These asymmetries {{can be explained by}} the nature of political obstacles to reforms in the two domains. <b>Labor</b> <b>market</b> reforms can exploit institutional trade-offs; notably, reforms can trade <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> flexibility with state-provided unemployment insurance and can be applied only to new entrants in the market without affecting the set of regulations applied to existing workers. These two-tier strategies are infeasible in product markets, since incumbent firms can easily drive away new entrants. In product markets, however, it is possible to shift responsibilities to supranational authorities, resisting pressures of national lobbies.

5000|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>market</b> institutionsLabor {{markets can}} be egalitarian, efficient, or {{somewhere in the}} middle. According to Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010), [...] "efficient <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> {{typically}} feature flexibility, low unemployment, and higher economic growth, and facilitate the rapid hiring and firing of workers. Egalitarian <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> are bolstered by strong <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> institutions, higher wages, and greater security" [...] (p562). The United States has an efficient <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> whereas most European countries have egalitarian <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> Each system has its drawbacks, but the egalitarian <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> model is typically associated with lower rates of working poverty. One tradeoff to {{this is that the}} [...] "lowest skilled and least employable" [...] people are sometimes excluded from an egalitarian <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> and must instead rely on government aid in order to survive (p. 563). [...] If the United States switched from an efficient to an egalitarian <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> it might have to increase its welfare state generosity in order to cope with a higher unemployment rate.|$|R

40|$|Using panel {{data for}} 15 {{industrial}} countries, active <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> policies (ALMPs) are {{shown to have}} raised employment rates in the business sector in the 1990 s, after controlling for many institutions, country-specific effects, and economic variables. Among such policies, direct subsidies to job creation were the most effective. ALMPs also affected employment rates by reducing real wages below levels allowed by technological growth, changes in the unemployment rate, and institutional and other economic factors. However, part of this wage moderation {{may be linked to}} a composition effect because policies were targeted to low-paid individuals. Whether ALMPs are cost-effective from a budgetary perspective remains to be determined, but they are certainly not substitutes for comprehensive institutional reforms.
