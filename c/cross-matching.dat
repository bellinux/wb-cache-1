How to effectively integrate data from different ground- and space-based observation equipments, different observers, different bands, different observation time, requires the data fusion technology. In this paper we introduce the <b>cross-match</b> tool that is developed by the Python language {{and based on the}} PostgreSQL database and uses Q 3 C as the core index, facilitating the <b>cross-match</b> work of massive astronomical data. It provides four different <b>cross-match</b> functions, namely: I) <b>cross-match</b> of custom error range; II) <b>cross-match</b> of catalog error; III) <b>cross-match</b> based on the elliptic error range; IV) <b>cross-match</b> of the nearest algorithm. The <b>cross-match</b> result set provides good foundation for subsequent data mining and statistics based on multiwavelength data. The most advantage of this tool is a user-oriented tool applied locally by users. By means of this tool, users may easily create their own databases, manage their own data and <b>cross-match</b> databases according to their requirements. In addition, this tool is also able to transfer data from one database into another database. More importantly, the tool is easy to get started and used by astronomers without writing any code.

40|$|Introduction］ In liver transplant, {{antibody}} mediated rejection {{is believed}} to occur less frequently and to lead less graft losses than in kidney transplant. So, liver transplant has been performed irrespective of positive lymphocyte crossmatch test. Nowadays, even in kidney transplant, both ABO incompatibility and <b>cross-match</b> positivity are being overcome with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement of immunosuppressive agents such as rituximab and IL- 2 receptor antagonists. Retrospective analysis on living donor liver transplant recipient was performed focusing on <b>cross-match</b> positivity and posttransplant complications. ［Patients and methods］ Since 1994, 41 living-donor liver transplants were performed. Retrospective analysis was done in 33 patients, who were done pretransplant <b>cross-match</b> test. Immunosuppression was basically initiated with steroid and tacrolimus. ［Results］ Twelve patients （ 36. 3 %） were positive for lymphocyte <b>cross-match.</b> Acute rejection occurred in 13 cases（ 33. 3 ％） within 180 post transplant days. One-year rejection-free survival were 42. 3 % in positive cases and 72. 2 % in negative cases （p< 0. 05 ）, {{but there was no}} significance in patient survival. Posttransplant complications including biliary stenosis, hepatic vein stenosis, and portal vein stenosis occurred more frequently in positive lymphocyte crossmatch transplant patietns（p< 0. 05 ）. ［Conclusion］ With improvement of immunosuppressive agents, liver transplant can be successfully performed with more favorable survival even in <b>cross-match</b> positive pair. Complications, however, happen more frequently in those recipients compared to <b>cross-match</b> negative ones. Posttransplant course should be carefully followed focusing on biliary and vascular complications.

40|$|Background: Antibodies against {{only about}} 25 - 28 blood group antigens {{are known to}} cause {{hemolytic}} reactions (HTRs), and red cell antibody screening should detect such clinically significant antibodies. An extension of the antibody screening test is the &#x 2032;type and screen&#x 2032; done to detect clinically significant antibodies, omiting the anti-human globulin (AHG) <b>cross-match.</b> Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to find out if the type and screen procedure is a safe method for pre-transfusion testing when compared to the AHG <b>cross-match</b> currently in use in India. Materials and Methods: We evaluated data from 45373 patients for whom a total of 61668 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) were <b>cross-matched</b> in the AHG phase using DiaMed &# 894; ID cards. An antibody screen was carried out in all the patients using the DiaMed &# 894; ID-DiaCell I&#x 002 B;II&#x 002 B;III. The AHG <b>cross-match</b> was also carried out for all recipients, irrespective of the result of the antibody screen. The results were compared to see if there were any cases where the antibody screening was negative but the AHG <b>cross-match</b> showed incompatibility. Results: Not a single case was found where the antibody screen was negative and AHG <b>cross-match</b> showed incompatibility. In 68 cases the antibody screening was positive. Out of the 68 cases, AHG <b>cross-match</b> was incompatible with at least one unit of PRBC in 41 cases. Conclusion: The screening cell panel adequately detected the clinically significant antibodies in the Indian population in our study.

40|$|The <b>cross-match</b> test is an exact, distribution-free test of no {{treatment}} {{effect on a}} high-dimensional outcome in a randomized experiment.

If the test is applied in an observational study in which treatments are not randomly assigned, then it may be comparing treated and control subjects who are not comparable, and thus may falsely reject a true null hypothesis of {{no treatment}} effect.

2500|$|Patients should ideally {{receive their}} own blood or type-specific blood {{products}} {{to minimize the}} chance of a transfusion reaction.

40|$|Introduction: Provision of {{adequate}} safe blood is challenging {{in developing countries}} due to paucity of voluntary blood donors, poor facilities for storage and blood component preparation as well as inappropriate blood ordering and utilization. Appraisal of pattern of blood transfusion requests and utilization helps highlight shortcomings that could be addressed toward judicious use of blood. Aims: To determine the pattern of blood transfusion requests and utilization at a Nigerian Teaching Hospital. Materials and Methods: Blood request forms and <b>cross-match</b> worksheets at the blood bank of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH) Sokoto were analyzed over a 3 -month period. Number of blood units requested, <b>cross-matched,</b> or transfused and the <b>cross-match</b> to transfusion ratio (CTR) for clinical units were computed. Results: Of the 1703 units of blood requested for 986 patients, 94. 42 % (1608) were <b>cross-matched</b> but only 34. 51 % (555) were transfused giving a CTR of 2. 90 for the hospital.

40|$|Background: Blood {{transfusion}} plays vital {{roles in}} the medical and surgical practice. To achieve optimum use of blood, transfusion has to be appropriate and judicious consuming minimal resources and manpower. Objective: To evaluate the pattern of blood transfusion requests and utilization {{with the aim of}} determining transfusion practice. Materials and Methods: Blood request forms and <b>cross-match</b> worksheets at the blood bank were analyzed over a 6 -month period. Numbers of requisitions, blood units <b>cross-matched,</b> issued out, transfused, and nontransfused were calculated. Nonusage probability (NUP) and the <b>cross-match</b> to transfusion ratio (CTR) for each clinical unit were computed. Results: Two thousand two hundred and sixty-eight units of blood were <b>cross-matched</b> for 1487 patient's transfusion requests, out of which only 1455 (64. 2 %) were transfused giving a total CTR of 1. 6 for the hospital. The CTR for the various clinical units were: Obstetrics and gynecology (O and G) 2. 7, surgery 2. 1, orthopedics 1. 9, medicine 1. 1, pediatrics 1, and oncology 1. Conclusions: The overall CTR (1. 6) of the hospital was within the optimal range except for the O and G and surgery department which were having very high NUP and CTR indicating their suboptimal transfusion practices.

40|$|In {{order to}} select MLC {{incompatible}} one-haplotype related donor-recipient pairs that would achieve better graft survival {{and in an}} effort to alter the recipient immune response, 45 patients received three fresh blood transfuions from their prospective kidney donors.

Ninety-seven per cent of the kidneys are functioning from one to 25 months with a single graft failure due to a patient discontinuing immunosuppressive medication. In addition to the excellent graft survival there was an unusually low incidence of rejection episodes in the recipients of kidneys from their blood donor so that the posttransplant course paralleled that of HLA-identical siblings.
