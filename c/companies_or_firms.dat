50|$|<b>Companies</b> <b>or</b> <b>firms</b> {{that tend}} to get {{involved}} with the strategy of predatory pricing often have the goal to place restrictions or a barrier for other new businesses from entering the applicable market. It is an unethical act which contradicts anti-trust law, attempting to establish within the market a monopoly by the imposing Company. Predatory pricing mainly occurs during price competitions in the market as it is an easy way to obfuscate the unethical and illegal act. Using this strategy, in the short term consumers will benefit and be satisfied with lower cost products. In the long run, firms often will not benefit as this strategy will continue to be used by other businesses to undercut competitors margins, causing an increase in competition within the field and facilitating major losses. This strategy is dangerous as it could be destructive to a firm in terms of losses and even lead to complete business failure.|$|E

In the past years there have been great developments to equalize and diversify workplaces with qualified employees. The case study organization Equalisters is a purely Web-based non- profit organization working to break norms associated with gender and ethnicity within the Swedish media and various business sectors. However, there is still {{work to be done}} to regain Sweden’s place as the number 1 equal country in Europe. Therefore, it is crucial to get a thorough understanding and deeper knowledge regarding a non-profit organizations possibilities to grow. Hence, the purpose of this research is to answer the following research question: How can a purely Web-based Non-profit organization in the start-up phase continue its growth? The authors of this thesis have conducted a qualitative research in collaboration with the chosen case study organization, Equalisters, and their clientele.  As a conclusion the authors argue that a purely Web based non-profit organization can grow both financially and operationally through differentiating procedures. The organizational growth will continue with the aid of immediate connections {{to the fact that the}} employees, accommodators, clients and volunteers do make a difference in society, which results in intrinsic rewards. In addition a financial profit is accomplishable without harming the core of the business by developing side services or side products such as quality checks for the lists, consultancy work with the aim of observing inequalities within the <b>companies</b> <b>or</b> <b>firms,</b> financially supporting the organization by “adopting lists” and create an identification of the organization as an investment to corporate social responsibility work for companies and firms. Moreover, utilizing social venture capitalist is another approach to increasing finances. However, the authors have observed a risk with involving more people to the organization since the core mission might have to change as a result of the financial support.

40|$|More {{than one}} third of {{companies}} listed in the FTSE EUROFIRST 300 index are governed accordingly to principles differing from the One share – One vote standards. These exceptions could be illustrated by several practices such as Scandinavian multiple voting shares, non voting shares as seen in some State members as authorised by European Directives, French double voting shares, “golden shares” concerning recently privatized firms, or even preference shares as observed in Holland. Such variety {{can be explained by}} the fact that “control rights” and “cash-flow rights”, understood as essential to the company's activities, are distinctly considered in the shareholder practices. The question at stake is to know if the application of the One share – One vote as a European standard would be justified with regard to European Law, including its underlying principles, and to economic efficiency in general. Indeed, One share – One vote enthusiast affirm that this rule participates to corporate democracy and contributes to increases firms' performance. The aim of our study is to determine whether these principles are reached or not. As a preliminary remark, we can notice that the European Commission intervention is questionable. First, its competence, and therefore the legality of a potential action, is not obvious. Indeed, owing to the subsidiarity principle and the article 48. 2 : (“co-ordinating to the necessary extent the safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of <b>companies</b> <b>or</b> <b>firms,</b> with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community”.) and the European Parliament position concerning the Takeover Directive, the legitimacy of the European Commission in this case is undoubtedly compromised. Then, the application of One share - One vote, by the cancellation of certain rights attached to a share, would violate a democratic principle, founder of the European Union, and dedicated by Member States Constitutions, known as private property. It would have, as a result, an unjustified, not compensable and therefore, illegal expropriation. We also have to question ourselves concerning the concept of corporate democracy and its consequences on Europeans companies. Unquestionable at first glance, is the notion of democracy transposable it in corporate Law? Is it only referring to a strict equality between shareholders or rather intents to limit unequal situations and therefore, prevent dominant shareholders from unilaterally capturing the company's performance? The respect of principles such as equity, shareholders general interest and company's interest, combined with transparency rules and protection of minority shareholders leads us to favour the second supposition. Finally, we underline that the ultimate argument relating to efficiency as a result from the strict application of the One share – One vote rule, is tempered by economical studies and by the practice observed in several State members. The One share - One vote rule could definitely be necessary for market readability purposes. But, some exception to this rule might be justified with regard to the company's interest. Therefore, some flexibility principles should remain. A dogmatic approach focused on shareholders, or certain type of shareholders, would disadvantage the development of the internal market and could not be justifiable on a legal ground. We believe that promoting corporate democracy requests an enhancement of transparency with a better bordering of existing practices and a strengthening of minority shareholders (by improving an “upper standard” harmonization). Corporate Governance; One share-One vote; Shareholder Democracy...|$|E
