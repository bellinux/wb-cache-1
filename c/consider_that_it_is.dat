25|$|Recent archaeological {{excavations}} {{have found}} fortifications in Mount Homon and La Carisa (near the Huerna and Pajares valleys) dated {{between the end}} of the seventh and beginning of the eighth centuries. The Berber fortifications included watchtowers and moats of almost two meters, in whose construction and defense many hundreds may have participated. That would have required a high degree of organization and firm leadership, probably by Pelayo himself. Therefore, experts <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> probable that the construction of the defensive line was intended to prevent the reentry of Moors into Asturias through the mountain passes of Mesa and Pajares.|$|E

The play only ran for six weeks but Burton once again won praises from critics.

2500|$|Although the Kebra Nagast {{and some}} {{traditional}} Ethiopian histories {{have stated that}} Gudit (or [...] "Yudit", Judith; another name given her was [...] "Esato", Esther), a 10th-century usurping queen, was Jewish, some scholars <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely {{that this was the}} case. It is more likely, they say, that she was a pagan southerner or a usurping Christian Aksumite Queen. [...] However, she clearly supported Jews, since she founded the Zagwe dynasty, who governed from around 937 to 1270 CE. According to the Kebra Nagast, Jewish, Christian and pagan kings ruled in harmony at that time. Furthermore, the Zagwe dynasty claimed legitimacy (according to the Kebra Nagast) by saying it was descended from Moses and his Ethiopian wife.|$|E

2500|$|Nouri al-Maliki was at loggerheads {{with the}} leader of ethnic Kurds, who brandished the threat of secession in a growing row over the {{symbolic}} issue of flying the Iraqi national flag at government buildings in the autonomous Kurdish north. Maliki's Arab Shi'ite-led government was locked in a dispute with the autonomous Kurdish regional government, which has banned {{the use of the}} Iraqi state flag on public buildings. The prime minister issued a blunt statement on Sunday saying: [...] "The Iraqi flag is the only flag that should be raised over any square inch of Iraq." [...] But Mesud Barzani, president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, told the Kurdish parliament the national leadership were [...] "failures" [...] and that the Iraqi flag was a symbol of his people's past oppression by Baghdad: [...] "If at any moment we, the Kurdish people and parliament, <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in our interests to declare independence, we will do so and we will fear no one." [...] The dispute exposes a widening rift between Arabs and Kurds, the second great threat to Iraq's survival as a state after the growing sectarian conflict between Arab Sunnis and Shi'ites.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
