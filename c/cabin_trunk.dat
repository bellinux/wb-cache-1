5000|$|Several {{thousand}} {{copies of}} the original cover were destroyed and replaced by the [...] "cabin trunk" [...] sleeve, but Capitol eventually decided {{that it would be}} more economical to simply paste the new cover photo over the old one. After the album was released, news of the paste-over operation leaked out, and Beatle fans across America began steaming the <b>cabin</b> <b>trunk</b> photos off of their copies of Yesterday And Today in the hope of finding the [...] "butcher" [...] cover underneath.|$|E
5000|$|The firemen {{do not get}} far {{because they}} run into a roadblock, where the police reclaim the money and arrest Matthews. In fact, they are not police but {{disguised}} mafiosi, whose plan is to smuggle {{the money out of}} France in a replica of the Statue of Liberty. Hijacking a DS19, Arthur and Anatole give chase. Also in the chase at the wheel of a BMW 2000 coupé is Sofia, who has freed Matthews and locked her brother in a <b>cabin</b> <b>trunk.</b> All three groups of villains are pursued by the police, ending up on the dockside at Le Havre.|$|E
5000|$|Steamer trunks (named {{after their}} {{location}} of storage {{in the cabin}} of a steam ship, or [...] "steamer") which are {{sometimes referred to as}} flat-tops, first appeared in the late 1870s, although the greater bulk of them date from the 1880-1920 period. They are distinguished by either their flat or slightly curved tops and were usually covered in canvas, leather or patterned paper and about 14 inches (36 cm) tall to accommodate steamship luggage regulations. There has been much debate and discourse on what these types of trunks are actually called. In some old catalogs, these trunks were called [...] "packers", and the [...] "steamer" [...] trunk actually referred to a trunk that is often called a <b>cabin</b> <b>trunk.</b> An orthodox name for this type of trunk would be a [...] "packer" [...] trunk, but since it has been widely called a steamer for so long, it is now a hallmark of this style.|$|E
5000|$|He {{documented}} {{these years}} in his journals, including accounts of his congregation {{and his personal}} experiences. As a collector, he assembled Australian pipes, boomerangs, snake skins, butterflies, glass cages with hummingbirds, <b>cabin</b> <b>trunks</b> full of furs and pelts, poison tipped arrows and stone weapons, tortoise shells, precious gems, and gold dust. He brought these collections to Silesia when he returned.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cabin</b> <b>trunks,</b> {{which are}} {{sometimes}} called [...] "true" [...] steamer trunks, were today's equivalent of carry-on luggage. They were low-profiled and {{small enough to}} fit under the berths of trains or in the cabin of a steamer, hence their name. Most were built with flat-tops and had inner tray compartments to store the owner's valuables deemed too precious to keep stowed away in the main luggage train or berth.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a devastating}} fire in 1925, Papworth Industries {{opened a new}} well-equipped trunk-making factory in 1926 that was able to produce {{a wide range of}} goods from utility fibre {{suitcases}} to handcrafted attaché cases, from canvas kit bags to vulcanized fibre <b>cabin</b> <b>trunks.</b> A reputation far and wide was soon established and the buyer from Saks Fifth Avenue is recorded as coming in person to select items for the prestigious New York store.|$|R
50|$|Her {{original}} {{name was}} Tuolumne, {{named after a}} river in Yosemite National Park. She was designed by Don McQuiston with engineering by Don Patterson, NA. She {{was built on the}} Steven's Ranch, a cattle operation east of Del Mar, California by Don McQuiston and his son Donnie. After an enclosed structure was built, construction of the hull was begun. Next came the laying of the deck, installation of skylights, hatches, and interior bulkheads. The last major task was the <b>cabin</b> <b>trunk</b> located aft. From aft forward is the master stateroom, engine room, salon, mid stateroom, and fore stateroom, all finished in varnished mahogany. Power is a Ford marine diesel with a feathering 3-bladed prop. The building took several years as at the same time Don operated the family design and publishing business McQuiston & Daughter, Inc. (mcquistonbooks) producing coffee table books for various publishers on the outdoors, Native American Art, and America's National Parks. Upon completion she was hauled to The Knight & Carver Boatyard on San Diego's Mission Bay and launched on October 25, 1989.|$|E
50|$|He {{amassed a}} fortune of 15,000 to 20,000 of {{head of cattle}} during this period, and was {{considered}} one of the wealthiest Floridians before he reached age 40. In this pre-banking era, Jacob kept his gold and silver at his <b>cabin</b> in <b>trunks,</b> meal sacks, tin meat cans, woolen socks, cigar boxes, behind door frames, in the rafters, or tossed in a corner. He used his wealth to purchase large tracts of land sprawling from Fort Meade to Fort Myers. He bought a wharf at Punta Rassa and a thousand acres (4 km²) nearby for cow pens, some of which he rented to other cattlemen.|$|R
2500|$|After the rear-engine Chevrolet Corvair was outsold by the {{conventional}} Ford Falcon in 1960, Chevrolet {{began work on}} a more conventional compact car that would eventually become the Chevy II. The car was of semi-unibody construction having a bolt on front section joined to its unitized <b>cabin</b> and <b>trunk</b> rear section, available in two-door coupe and four-door sedan configurations as well as convertible and station wagon versions. The 1962 Chevy II came in three series and five body styles—the 100 Series, 300 Series and Nova 400 Series. A 200 series was also introduced, but was discontinued almost immediately. [...] The sportiest-looking of the lot was the $2,475 Nova 400 convertible—23,741 were produced that year.|$|R
50|$|The ist, {{the sixth}} brand {{to use the}} Vitz as the base model, was {{conceived}} as a high-end multi-use compact car with SUV-like styling and wagon-like roominess. The car was fitted with either a 1.3-liter (FWD) or a 1.5-liter engine (FWD or 4WD), with a Super ECT transmission. A wide front grille consisting of two thick horizontal bars, large 15-inch tires, and extended wheel arches gave the vehicle its unique and dynamic exterior styling. The body dimensions were a notch above those of the Vitz, giving more space to the <b>cabin</b> and the <b>trunk.</b> The 6:4 split rear seats could be fully folded to widen the deck as necessary. The sturdy body structure was realized through the advanced GOA (Global Outstanding Assessment) process, which enhanced safety in collisions with heavier vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Rebecca T. Ruark is {{a typical}} sloop-rigged skipjack, built for the shallow draft, low {{freeboard}} and high stability needed to work the Chesapeake Bay oyster beds. She has a rounded chine with a sharp, convex clipper bow on a sloop hull. The Ruark is fore-and-aft planked. Her wood plug rudder is carried well forward beneath the transom, astern of the centerboard. As part of her 2000 U.S. Coast Guard certification to carry passengers for hire she received a watertight bulkhead ahead of the mast. An aluminum hatch provides access into the new space, which is used for sail and line storage. The deck is 2 in fir forward of the main hatch and pressure-treated pine aft. Deck beams are oak, with two 11.5 in king planks running from the bow to the main hatch. A central hatch measures 55 in long by 64.75 in wide. Behind the hatch is a small <b>trunk</b> <b>cabin</b> with a three-sided doghouse aft, with double doors leading from the doghouse to the hold. A fuel tank for the push boat is on the starboard side of the cabin. Pipe rails have been added for passenger carriage.|$|R
60|$|Such a <b>cabin!</b> A good-sized <b>trunk,</b> with a {{small table}} in it, and the lid shut down, had about as much right to the name. It was awfully small-- even I could not stand upright in it, though at the time I had {{scarcely}} attained to the altitude of five feet; yet here were we destined to pass the night--and a wretched night we did pass. We got over the first part tolerably, but as it grew late our eyes grew heavy. We yawned, fidgeted and made superhuman efforts to keep awake and seem happy; {{but it would not}} do. There were only two berths in the cabin; and, as so many gentlemen were present, Mrs Gowley would not get into either of them, but declared she would sit up all night. The gentlemen, on the other hand, could not be so ungallant as to go to sleep while the only lady present sat up. The case was desperate, and so I went off to the hold, intending to lie down on a bale, if I could find one. In my search I tumbled over something soft, which gave vent to a frightful howl, and proved to be no less a personage than Mr Wiseacre, who had anticipated me, and found a convenient place whereon to lie. My search, however, was less successful. Not a corner big enough for a cat to sleep in was to be found, all the goods having been flung hastily into the hold, so that it was a chaos of box corners, stove legs, edges of kegs and casks, which presented a surface that put to flight all hope of horizontal repose; so I was obliged to return to the cabin, where I found the unhappy inmates winking and blinking at each other like owls in the sunshine.|$|R
