A crankshaft tone wheel was present between number 1 and number 2 <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pins,</b> and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the crankshaft's position as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The tone wheel was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved {{to the rear of the}} crankshaft.

50|$|The {{result of}} the trio's {{creativity}} was the world's only 65° V6 engine. The extra 5° between cylinder banks gave Ferrari the straight intakes he wanted. As this engine was not a true V6 but had a separate crank <b>pin</b> for every <b>connecting</b> <b>rod,</b> the crank <b>pins</b> were offset by 55 degrees within every pair of cylinders. This ensured an even firing order for the complete engine {{as well as an}} even distance between firing pulses per cylinder bank. Thus the engine was as smoothly running as a conventional 60 degree V6, but had greatly enhanced potential for the design of harmonically balanced exhaust manifolds, giving much better performance. Although the Dino V6 was discontinued with the introduction of the V8, the 65° design continues to this day: It reappeared on Ferrari's 1992 456 V12.|$|R

The improvements were directed solely at improving the durability of the car. To this end, engine capacity was increased and a stiffer crankshaft fitted. To increase reliability, the crankshaft incorporated larger diameter <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> bearings which called for modifications to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> and gudgeon <b>pins.</b> Modified oil and water pumps completed the engine changes. As a result, power output increased from [...] to [...] at 5,100 rpm and torque increased from 84 lbft Nm at 3500 rpm to [...] at 3,900 rpm. In addition, the Series IIIA included many detail changes such as an increased diameter front anti-roll bar which greatly improved roadholding, a redesigned clutch bell housing, a revised clutch assembly with nine pressure springs instead of six and a redesigned air cleaner assembly. Inside the car a fresh-air heater, hitherto available only at extra cost, became a standard fitting.

40|$|Abstract- Every {{vehicle that}} uses an {{internal}} combustion engine requires at least one <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. <b>Connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is a structural member in the engine, which transfers reciprocating motion in to rotary motion of crank shaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> while transferring the power from piston to crank shaft takes load from piston due to combustion process in the combustion chamber and inertia forces of the reciprocating parts (piston & <b>connecting</b> <b>rod)</b> due to this the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> may fail.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper was to evolve a methodology for minimising vibration transmission through a reciprocating mechanism, which is the dominant path of vibration transmission in a diesel engine. Vibration transmission in this path in a diesel engine is {{in the range of}} 800 to 3000 Hz. Since statistical energy analysis is applicable in this frequency range, it was used for the transfer path analysis, from the viewpoint of minimising vibration transmission. The transfer path, consisting of piston,piston <b>pin,</b> <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> and crank <b>pin</b> was constructed using simple elements like beam, plate and shell, which enabled the use of analytical results for modal density. Damping loss factors and coupling loss factors were measured experimentally. Modal density of all the subsystems was computed analytically and then compared with the experimental measurements. Coupling loss factor was analytically determined for a beam-beam connection, which enabled fine tuning of the experimental method of determining coupling loss factor between the subsystems of the transfer path model. After evaluating all the SEA parameters, the energy ratio between the piston and crank pin was computed. A total of eight different transfer path models were constructed with some variation in their dimensions and materials used for construction. Based on these results, certain recommendations were made for designing such paths for minimum vibration transmission...|$|R
