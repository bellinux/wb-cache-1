Generally, four strokes motor cycle piston ring consist of three components, those are <b>compression</b> <b>rings,</b> {{including}} top ring and second <b>ring.</b> The <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> work to enlarge machine compression at compression step, as well as to prevent cylinder contact with piston to make tolerance.

40|$|PLIF {{has been}} used to observe the {{in-cylinder}} transport of unburned fuel that, while trapped in the ring-land and ring-groove crevices, survives combustion in the propagating flame. Away from the top-ring gap, we detect a wall-jet comprised of unburned charge exiting the top ring-land crevice opening. At the location of the top-ring gap, we observed unburned fuel lying in the cool boundary layer along the cylinder wall during the later stages of the expansion stroke. This layer is scraped into the roll-up vortex during the exhaust stroke. These data lead us to conclude that away from the end gap, unburned, high pressure charge, trapped between the two <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> escapes as a wall jet after ring-reversal near the bottom center. Conversely, at the ring gap, when the cylinder pressure drops below the pressure between the <b>compression</b> <b>rings,</b> the trapped charge escapes through the gap and forms a thin layer on the cylinder wall...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Krasnodar Stadium, hosting FC Krasnodar of Russian Premier League, has a {{capacity}} of 36. 260 seats.

50|$|The cable net roof is the {{transformation}} of the primarily single-plane loading of the spoked wheel to vertical load transfer. It combines the characteristics of cable and membrane structures: in between closed, self-anchored tension and <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> exists a wide-meshed primary load-bearing structure of cables with a secondary membrane structure tensioned in between. One of the first modern cable net roofs is the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Stuttgart. Further examples of this principle are some of the many soccer stadiums worldwide (such as in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Warschau, Kapstadt, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Johannesburg).|$|R

For strongly non-conformal contacts pocketing is detrimental, but for quasi-conformal contacts friction reductions of up to 73 % are predicted.

40|$|Thermo-mixed-hydrodynamics of <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> and big-end {{bearings}} are presented. Frictional losses {{under normal}} engine op erating {{conditions for a}} gasoline engine and those with cylinder deactivation (CDA) are predicted. With CDA, the combustion chamber pressure increases in the active cylinders, whilst some residual pressure remains in the deactivated ones. For the former, the increased in-cylinder temperatures reduce viscous friction, whilst reducing the load carrying capacity, promoting increased boundary interactions. In deactivated cylinders, lower contact temperatures yield increased viscous friction. Overall, a 5 % improvement in expended fuel is expected with the application of CDA. However, 10 % of these gains are expended due to increased friction. The study demonstrates the need to consider total system effects when introducing new technologies such as CDA...|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} and {{cylinder block}} are fabricated from steel by welding {{a mixture of}} steel castings and platework. This gives a more rigid structure than the YH's cast light alloy block. The aluminium frame of the YH and ZH engines had previously given trouble with cracking {{and had to be}} replaced in the Class 17 with a cast iron frame, at Paxman's expense. Both engines have individual aluminium cylinder heads for each cylinder. Centrifugally cast iron wet cylinder liners are used with aluminium pistons in both. These pistons have three <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> and two oil-control rings. The top ring is carried in a cast iron insert. The combustion chamber of this direct injection engine is a toroidal recess in the piston crown.|$|R

50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> and oil control ring to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> system, also with an oil control ring. It used low friction rings and a molybdenum disulphide coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|E
5000|$|During use, the {{cylinder}} {{is subject to}} wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a rebore to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons. The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> of the piston, which {{can result in a}} detectable ridge. If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring. For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally [...] "exercised" [...] through their full speed range to develop a tapered wear profile rather than a sharp ridge.|$|E
5000|$|In small sizes, the {{compression}} fitting {{is composed of}} an outer compression nut and an inner <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> or ferrule (sometimes referred to as an [...] "olive") that is typically made of brass or copper. Ferrules vary in shape and material but are most commonly {{in the shape of}} a ring with beveled edges. To work properly, the ferrule must be oriented correctly—usually the ferrule is fitted such that the longest sloping face of the ferrule faces away from the nut.|$|E
50|$|The pistons {{are made}} of light metal alloy and have three <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> {{as well as one}} oil ring. They are {{connected}} to the crankshaft with I-shape connecting rods made of heat treatable steel. The bearings of the connecting rods {{are made of}} a lead bronze alloy and are fixed with a pin. Each connecting rod has a small oil pipe for the lubrication of it′s bearings. For weight reduction, the connecting rod pins are hollow-drilled. The crankshaft with hardened pins is supported in five bearings and is equipped with couter-weights to reduce crankshaft bearing wear. The covers of the crankshaft bearings are mounted with two pin screws each. The flywheel is flanged onto the crankshaft. On the opposite site of the crankshaft, it holds a friction- and vibration damper.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular <b>compression</b> <b>rings,</b> or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R

A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45º tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting. The flare nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{lightweight}} cable roof is {{designed as a}} classic looped cable roof containing one compression and one tension ring. While {{the majority of the}} roof is covered with a membrane, the inner edge has a glass roof. The roof of Vodafone Park is composed of 260 tons of 246 rope assemblies. The inner tension ring, which is made of 8 Ø110 mm full locked coil ropes with a single length of nearly 200 meters, is connected to the outer <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> by radial cables that consist of full locked coil ropes with Ø110, Ø85, Ø65 and Ø45 mm.|$|E
5000|$|Compression {{fittings}} use a {{soft metal}} or thermoplastic ring (the <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> or [...] "ferrule") which is squeezed onto the pipe {{and into the}} fitting by a compression nut. The soft metal conforms {{to the surface of}} the tubing and the fitting, and creates a seal. Compression connections do not typically have the long life that sweat connections offer, but are advantageous in many cases because they are easy to make using basic tools. A disadvantage in compression connections is that they take longer to make than sweat, and sometimes require retightening over time to stop leaks.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> test using physical modelling experiments and finite element (FE) simulation. Using commercially available modelling clay, material stress–strain relationships were obtained from compression tests of solid cylindrical specimens. A series of <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> tests were carried out to obtain friction coefficients for a number of lubricants including vaseline, zinc stearate and talcum powder. FE simulations were used to derive the friction calibration curves and to evaluate material deformation, geometric changes and load–displacement results. Friction coefficient values of the tested lubricants are in agreement with the results obtained by other researchers. Further investigation is necessary {{to determine the effects of}} material properties, test conditions and use of calibration curves on the <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> test.
