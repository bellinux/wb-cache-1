50|$|This will be {{the final}} {{year in which the}} Chicago Cubs will air on WGN. WGN has had some form of {{broadcast}} relationship with the Cubs since 1925 and has been the exclusive broadcaster of the team since 1958; for many years, the Cubs and WGN were both owned by Tribune Company. The spin-off of the Cubs to new ownership, combined with continued financial losses, the Cubs' persistent on-field futility and the pending end of the rival <b>Chicago</b> <b>White</b> <b>Sox's</b> contract with WSCR after the 2015 season, prompted Tribune to end its relationship with the Cubs. Cubs broadcasts will move to CBS Radio's WBBM for 2015 and, if the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> do not renew with WSCR, to WSCR for 2016 and beyond.|$|R

The team's game telecasts moved to then-upstart independent station WFLD (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) - which, like WGN-TV, carried <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> games on more than occasion - in 1968. WGN-TV regained broadcast rights for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> in 1973, and entered into a contractual agreement with then-competing independent WSNS-TV (channel 44, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station) to have that station carry select games, an arrangement that lasted through the 1980 season. WGN-TV became the exclusive television broadcaster of <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> games in 1981, before WFLD re-obtained broadcast rights the following year. After an eight-year run on WFLD, the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> returned to WGN-TV in 1990 after co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf agreed to long-term deals with the station for both the Sox and his NBA franchise, the Chicago Bulls.|$|R
