25|$|A <b>classified</b> <b>document</b> by EU delegates, {{obtained}} by Ynet, suggested funding Palestinian construction projects in Area C of the West Bank without Israel's cooperation, undermining Israeli control. Under the Oslo Accords, Area C is under full Israeli civil and security control. It contains all of Israel's West Bank settlements {{and a small}} Palestinian population. The document expressed concern that Israel's policies would undermine {{the prospect of a}} Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, and called on Israel to support Palestinian construction across Area C and in East Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|In July 2005, Pollard again filed {{a motion}} for a new trial, this time {{on the grounds of}} {{ineffective}} assistance of counsel. He also sought access to <b>classified</b> <b>documents</b> pertinent to his new lawyers' efforts in preparing a clemency petition. The Court of Appeals rejected both arguments. In February 2006, his attorneys filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding access to the <b>classified</b> <b>documents.</b> They argued that the separation of powers doctrine is a flexible doctrine that does not dictate the complete separation of the three branches of Government from one another. The brief claimed that the Court of Appeals violated this principle in asserting sua sponte that the judiciary has no jurisdiction over the <b>classified</b> <b>documents</b> {{due to the fact that}} access was for the ultimate purpose of clemency, an executive function. The Supreme Court denied the cert petition in March 2006, ruling that the president's clemency power would be wholly unaffected by successor counsel's access to the <b>classified</b> <b>documents,</b> and that the <b>classified</b> <b>documents</b> were sealed under protective order, a judicial tool.|$|R

25|$|As with Fred Holroyd and John Weir, {{there were}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts to undermine Colin Wallace. Barron notes that Wallace was {{targeted by the}} same security services he had served. He {{was forced to resign}} in 1975, ostensibly for trying to pass a <b>classified</b> <b>document</b> to journalist Robert Fisk. Wallace claims the real reasons for his dismissal were his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project, and his discovery that the security forces were involved in a child sex abuse ring. After his dismissal, Wallace attempted to expose these scandals, as well as state collusion with loyalists. In 1980, shortly after making some of his allegations, he was arrested and convicted of manslaughter. He was released on parole in 1985 and proclaimed his innocence. Various people have alleged that Wallace was framed. He later had his conviction overturned and was paid £30,000 compensation for unjust dismissal from government service. His role within the British Army intelligence service had been officially, albeit belatedly, acknowledged in 1990.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a June 2015, memorandum to the Justice Department from the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the State Department regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State. A transmittal memorandum, written by State Dept. official Patrick F. Kennedy, said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a <b>classified</b> <b>document,</b> or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.|$|E
25|$|For signal processing, the Wiener filter is {{a filter}} {{proposed}} by Wiener during the 1940s {{and published in}} 1942 as a <b>classified</b> <b>document.</b> Its purpose {{is to reduce the}} amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the future, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target has moved, and maybe has changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel, on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality---a theory for predicting the future as best as one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that didn't strictly speaking predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.|$|E

The Home Ministry referred the matter to Delhi Police and National Archives for the response pertaining to any post-mortem conducted on the body of Shastri in India. Sunil Shastri, son of the former Prime Minister, called the transferring of application as [...] "absurd" [...] and [...] "silly joke". [...] "He (Lal Bahadur Shastri) died as sitting Prime Minister.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a research support system, called Papits, that shares research information, such as PDF files of research papers, in computers on the network and classifies the information into types of research fields. Users of Papits can share various research information and survey the corpora of their particular fields of research. In order to realize Papits, we need to design a mechanism for identifying what words are best suited to <b>classify</b> <b>documents</b> in predefined classes. Further {{we have to consider}} classification in cases where we must <b>classify</b> <b>documents</b> into multivalued fields and where there is insufficient data for classification. In this paper, we present an implementation method of automatic classification based on a text classification technique for Papits. We also propose a new method for using feature selection to <b>classify</b> <b>documents</b> that are represented by a bag-of-words into a multivalued category. Our method transforms the multivalued category into a binary category to easily identify the characteristic words to classify category in a few training data.
