The track infuses Bloc Party's blueprint with keyboards, looped strings, and ethereal vocals. Power concluded, [...] "By taking the percolating synth {{from the end of}} the original version and wrapping the sweet ee cummings-borrowed lyric—"I <b>carry</b> <b>your</b> heart here with me"—in a dense cloud of treated, looped guitar, he produces a remix that ... offers an interesting, possibly even superior, reading of its source material." [...] Album closer [...] "Your Visits Are Getting Shorter (Optothetic Remix)" [...] was named as a [...] "generic commercial dance music" [...] song by Lee White of This Is Fake DIY.|$|E

"Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I <b>Carry</b> <b>Your</b> Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.|$|E

The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." ...|$|E
500|$|Science Wonders {{first issue}} {{included}} {{the first part}} of a serial, The Reign of the Ray, by Fletcher Pratt and Irwin Lester, and short stories by Stanton Coblentz and David H. Keller. Air Wonder began with a reprinted serial, Victor MacClure's Ark of the Covenant. Writers who first appeared in the pages of these magazines include Neil R. Jones, Ed Earl Repp, Raymond Z. Gallun and Lloyd Eshbach. The quality of published science fiction at the time was generally low, and Lasser was keen to improve it. On 11 May 1931 he wrote to his regular contributors to tell them that their science fiction stories [...] "should deal realistically with the effect upon people, individually and in groups, of a scientific invention or discovery.... In other words, allow yourself one fundamental assumption—that a certain machine or discovery is possible—and then show what would be its logical and dramatic consequences upon the world; also what would be the effect upon the group of characters that you pick to <b>carry</b> <b>your</b> theme." ...|$|E

[...] and [...] "You have no immortality! None of your descendents <b>carry</b> <b>your</b> blood!" [...] Duncan then allows himself to be struck down by an enraged Stilgar, who realizes afterward that Alia would be forced by political necessity to execute him and his only hope of survival is to join the Fremen rebels — which is what Duncan had planned from the beginning. Duncan's last gasping words were, [...] "Two deaths for the Atreides. The second for no better reason than the first." ...|$|E
