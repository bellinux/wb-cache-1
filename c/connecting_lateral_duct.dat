5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The <b>lateral</b> <b>ducts</b> are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the <b>lateral</b> <b>duct,</b> while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|R

40|$|Indwelling {{catheters}} {{were used}} to collect fluid directly from the medial and lateral segments of duck nasal salt glands showing, for the first time, that the secretions are fully hypertonic before reaching the medial and <b>lateral</b> drainage <b>ducts.</b> Using this method {{it was possible to}} show that (a) there is a functional symmetry between the left and right salt glands, (b) the medial segment always secretes fluid at approximately twice the rate of the lateral segment and (c) fluid secreted by the medial segment has the same ionic composition but variable ion concentrations when compared with fluid from the lateral segment. A 12 % increase in post-segmental fluid osmolality was probably due to the evaporation of water from epithelial surfaces in the nasal cavities during breathing.

40|$|Differential autoregulation of {{androgen}} receptors (AR) {{has been}} previously described for the separate lobes of the rat prostate gland. While AR are up-regulated by testosterone in the ventral, dorsal, and LP 1 lateral lobes, the epithelial cells of the LP 2 <b>lateral</b> <b>ducts</b> show continued expression of the AR protein following androgen withdrawal. To determine the mechanism of this differential autologous regulation, the present study examined the autoregulation of AR mRNA in the separate regions of the rat prostate gland. Northern blot analysis revealed that AR mRNA levels are down-regulated by androgens in all prostate lobes, since their levels increase following cas-tration and decrease upon testosterone replacement. In situ hybridization confirmed {{that the increase in}} AR mRNA levels immediately following androgen withdrawal is due to increased transcripts per cell. When normalized to DNA content, the AR mRNA elevation upon androgen withdrawal was transient, and the value returned to control levels in the ventral and dorsal lobes within three days, while the elevation of AR message in the lateral lobe was prolonged. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that elevated AR mRNA levels in the prolonged absence of androgens were confined to the LP 2 <b>ducts</b> of the <b>lateral</b> lobe. Nuclear run-on experiments showed no alteration in AR gene transcription two days after castration in the ventral, dorsal, or LP 1 lateral lobes when compared to the values in intact rats, indicating that posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in AR mRNA autoregulation. In contrast, the AR gene transcription rate doubled in the <b>lateral</b> LP 2 <b>ducts.</b> The elevated AR mRNA levels in the LP 2 ducts due to increased AR gene transcription following castration may, in part, explain the continued expression of AR protein in that region in the absence of testosterone...|$|R

40|$|The cocoon, {{produced}} by most holometabolous insects, is built with silk {{that is usually}} {{produced by}} the larval salivary gland. Although this silk has been widely studied in the Lepidoptera, its composition and macromolecular arrangement remains unknown in the Hymenoptera. The macromolecular array patterns of the silk in the larval salivary gland of some meliponids, wasps, and ants were analyzed with polarized-light microscopy, and they were {{compared with those of}} Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera). There is a birefringent secretion in the glandular lumen of all larvae, due to filamentous structural proteins that display anisotropy. The silk in the distal, middle and proximal regions of the secretory portion of Formicidae and Vespidae glands presented a lattice optical pattern. We found a different pattern in the middle secretory portion of the Meliponini, with a zigzag rather than a lattice pattern. This indicates that the biopolymer fibers begin their macromolecular reorganization at this glandular region, different from the Formicidae and the Vespidae, in which the zigzag optical pattern was only found at the <b>lateral</b> <b>duct.</b> Probably, the mechanism of silk production in the Hymenoptera is a characteristic inherited from a common ancestor of Vespoidea and Sphecoidea; the alterations in the pattern observed in the Meliponini could be a derived characteristic in the Hymenoptera.

40|$|Bank filtration, either {{natural or}} induced through the river bed by pumping from {{a system of}} <b>connected</b> <b>lateral</b> or {{vertical}} wells, provides a means of obtaining public water supplies.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{presence}} of left-sided gallbladder is {{closely associated with}} multiple combined anomalies of the portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. This requires special attention for preoperative evaluation {{for the purpose of}} preventing postoperative complications. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 70 -year-old woman with metastatic liver cancer and intrahepatic portal vein, biliary system and hepatic artery anomalies with left-sided gallbladder is reported. On computed tomography (CT), a solitary low density mass occupied from the right anterior to the posterior segment of the liver. The gallbladder bed was on the left of the hepatic fissure. On drip-infusion-cholangiography (DIC) CT three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction, the left medial bile duct arose from the right umbilical portion after arising from the left <b>lateral</b> bile <b>duct.</b> Following a right hepatectomy and lymph node dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament, hepaticojejunostomy was conducted separately to the left medial and left <b>lateral</b> bile <b>duct.</b> DISCUSSIONThe left-sided gallbladder accompanies with several anomalies of hepatic vascular and bile duct anomalies in a frequent manner. A safe hepatectomy needs accurate operative plans to ascertain the range of hepatectomy, because it often has the diversity of a combined anomaly. CONCLUSIONPreoperative DIC-CT 3 D reconstruction was extremely useful because it provided an important information that could not be obtained with 2 D-DIC-CT. 3 D imaging has the ability to demonstrate complex anatomical relationships, this devise is a effective new tool for making appropriate preoperative strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the liquid metal with the plasma confinement magnetic field constitutes a challenge {{for the design of}} fusion reactor blankets, due to the arise of MHD effects: increased pressure drops, heat transfer suppression, etc. To overcome these issues, a dielectric fluid can be employed as coolant for the breeding zone. A typical configuration involves pipes transverse to the liquid metal flow direction. This numerical study is conducted to assess the influence of pipe conductivity on the MHD flow and heat transfer. The CFD code ANSYS CFX was employed for this purpose. The fluid is assumed to be bounded by rectangular walls with non-uniform thickness and subject to a skewed magnetic field with the main component aligned with the cylinder axis. The simulations were restricted to Re = (20, 40) and M = (10, 50). Three different scenarios for the obstacle were considered: perfectly insulating, finite conductivity and perfectly conducting. The electrical conductivity was found to affect the channel pressure penalty due to the obstacle insertion only for M = 10 and just for the two limiting cases. A general increment of the heat transfer with M was found due to the tendency of the magnetic field to equalize the flow rate between the sub-channels individuated by the pipe. The best results were obtained with the insulating pipe, due to the reduced electromagnetic drag. The generation of counter-rotating vortices close to the <b>lateral</b> <b>duct</b> walls was observed for M= 50 and perfectly conducting pipe {{as a result of the}} modified currents distribution...|$|R
