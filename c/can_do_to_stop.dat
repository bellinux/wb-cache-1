If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> things.|$|E
