60|$|The chemist bowed; and, {{turning to}} his shelves, filled an {{ordinary}} half-ounce bottle with laudanum immediately. In ascertaining his <b>customer's</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> beforehand, {{the owner of}} the shop had taken a precaution which was natural to a careful man, but which was by no means universal, under similar circumstances, {{in the state of the}} law at that time.|$|R
50|$|EuroOptic was infamous for {{maintaining}} {{a list of}} customers who attempted or successfully defrauded or broke {{the trust of the}} company during its early days. This list often contained the <b>customer's</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally information about which products they had fraudulently obtained. This practice proved to be interesting to the readership of this site, and prompted a few bounty hunters to begin working through the list proferred on the Wall of Shame in hopes that they might split some of the profits of collecting the charges for the illegitimately-obtained products.|$|R
50|$|A {{function}} {{looking up}} a <b>customer's</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> in a database is typically idempotent, since {{this will not}} cause the database to change. Similarly, changing a customer's address is typically idempotent, because the final address {{will be the same}} {{no matter how many times}} it is submitted. However, placing an order for a car for the customer is typically not idempotent, since running the call several times will lead to several orders being placed. Canceling an order is idempotent, because the order remains canceled no matter how many requests are made.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, NetMarket, {{now owned}} by Cendant, had its {{ordering}} system breached due to a bug in its software. <b>Customer</b> <b>names,</b> <b>addresses,</b> <b>and</b> phone numbers could have been shown publicly along with order details {{for as many as}} 983,000 orders stretching back to June 1998.|$|R
50|$|<b>Customers</b> {{registered}} their <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> {{with the}} club and were sent a newsletter every three months which advised them of the latest books which had been or were to be issued; {{they did not have}} to promise to buy a certain number of volumes each year.|$|R
50|$|Los Angeles, in its city code, {{required}} hotels to keep certain specified {{information about}} their <b>customers,</b> including the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address,</b> vehicle information, dates of the stay, room number, and how the customer paid the bill, among other information. The hotel had to keep the information for 90-days, and if a police officer requested the information, the hotel {{had to make it}} available or face criminal penalties. In 2003, Naranjibhai and Ramilaben Patel and other hotel operators sued the city in the federal district court, alleging that the ordinance violated the Fourth Amendment.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, a {{security}} breach in the Columbia House website exposed thousands of <b>customer</b> <b>names,</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>and</b> portions {{of credit card}} numbers, leaving private information about customers vulnerable to exploitation. The issue involved a particular section of the website, which could easily be accessed by deleting {{a portion of the}} website address in the address bar, discovered by customer Mark Alway. Upon the discovery of the breach, he emailed the Columbia House staff who were quick to respond to the problem. This event gave rise to concerns over the website's capability of keeping private information secure from hackers or devastating scams. Although no information was reportedly obtained from the temporary breach according to Columbia House, industry professionals were {{quick to point out that}} the simple error was the consequence of negligent handling of customer information.|$|R
40|$|While {{online service}} {{providers}} are sometimes accused of forwarding identifying <b>customer</b> information as <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> to untrusted third parties, comparatively little {{attention is paid}} to the input data that customers provide explicitly to the service. If the input data is sensitive but the service provider is not completely trustworthy, this constitutes a serious privacy problem. From a privacy-defending point of view, the most desirable situation would be for the service not to require any kind of sensitive information at any time, while still yielding useful results for the customer. This paper presents a service architecture that allows for the use of a restricted number of services without requiring the transmission of unencrypted customer data to the service provider. The supported services include the execution of basic database and arithmetic operations that can be combined in numerou...|$|R
