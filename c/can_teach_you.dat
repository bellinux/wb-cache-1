During filming he arrived on set {{at four in the}} morning and spent five hours being covered in Read's {{trademark}} tattoos. In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that [...] "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> how to hit, but not a lot of people <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E

At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> how to draw, I cannot {{teach you how to}} think or see. If you can think and you can see, you can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw something in me I didn't know was there." [...] By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits.
