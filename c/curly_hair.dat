5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a much more complex villain than the fairy tale witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn {{to serve as a}} foil to Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E
5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple {{may have been}} consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of Uma Mahesvara (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and <b>curly</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E

5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of <b>curly</b> <b>hair,</b> wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with <b>curly</b> <b>hair.</b> The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E

50|$|The species {{comprises}} three subspecies: {{the typical}} subsp. subaphyllus; subsp. psammophilus, a shrub up to 2,5 m with shorter and thinner flower-bearing branches and longer upper leaves; and subsp. charifii, with conspicuous tufts of long <b>curly</b> <b>hairs</b> in the axils of the leaves.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are thick, leathery, usually wavy, oblong to ovate, up to 25 mm (1 inch) long. The {{upper side}} of the leaf is green with {{scattered}} clumps of small curly hairs; the underside appears white or brown because of a thick coat of <b>curly</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the stylistic}} {{elements}} in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: himation, the contrapposto stance of the upright figures (see: 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and ushnisha apparently derived from {{the style of the}} Apollo Belvedere (330 BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism. A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the modern site of Hadda, Afghanistan. The <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> of Buddha is described in the famous list of the physical characteristics of the Buddha in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the Pāli canon; we find the same description in the Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā.|$|E
25|$|In Pre-Raphaelite art, Helen {{is often}} shown with shining <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and ringlets. Other {{painters}} {{of the same}} period depict Helen on the ramparts of Troy, and focus on her expression: her face is expressionless, blank, inscrutable. In Gustave Moreau's painting, Helen will finally become faceless; a blank eidolon {{in the middle of}} Troy's ruins.|$|E

Russell's long and <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> {{was one of her}} character's defining characteristics. A drastic hairstyle change {{at the beginning of the}} show's second season was thought to cause a significant drop in the show's television ratings.|$|E

25|$|Afro-textured hair is {{the natural}} hair texture of certain populations in Africa, the African diaspora, Australia and Asia, {{which has not been}} altered by hot combs, flat irons or {{chemicals}} (through perming, relaxation or other straightening methods). Each strand of this hair type grows in a tiny, spring-like helix shape. The overall effect is such that, compared to straight, wavy or <b>curly</b> <b>hair,</b> afro-textured hair appears denser.|$|E
25|$|The couple also {{stayed in}} Quebec {{for five weeks}} during the late spring of 1942, where they met a {{precocious}} eight-year-old boy with blond <b>curly</b> <b>hair,</b> Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided. During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.|$|E

25|$|The Mamanwa is a Negrito tribe often grouped {{together}} with the Lumad. They come from Leyte, Agusan del Norte, and Surigao provinces in Mindanao; primarily in Kitcharao and Santiago, Agusan del Norte, though they are lesser in number and more scattered and nomadic than the Manobos and Mandaya tribes who also inhabit the region. Like all Negritos, the Mamanwas are phenotypically distinct from the lowlanders and the upland living Manobos, exhibiting <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and much darker skin tones.|$|E
25|$|Apeliotes (or Apheliotes) (the {{name means}} 'from the (rising) sun') was the Greek deity {{of the east}} wind. As this wind was thought to cause a {{refreshing}} rain particularly beneficial to farmers, he is often depicted wearing high boots and carrying fruit, draped in a light cloth concealing some flowers or grain. He is clean shaven, with <b>curly</b> <b>hair</b> and a friendly expression. Because Apeliotes was a minor god, he was often syncretized with Eurus, the southeast wind. The Roman counterpart of Apeliotes was Subsolanus.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{critics have}} pointed out that Colbert had a mixture of unique {{physical}} assets (her round apple-face, big eyes, <b>curly</b> <b>hair,</b> slender body), an elegant voice, aristocratic manner, relaxed acting, a tongue-in-cheek vivacity, intelligent style, comedic timing and ladylike alluring charm, that distinguishes her from other screwball comediennes of the 1930s. In her comedy films, she invariably played shrewd and self-reliant women, but unlike many of her contemporaries, Colbert rarely engaged in physical comedy. Her characters {{were more likely to be}} observers and commentators.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of biblical {{references}} or historical records, for two millennia {{a wide range of}} depictions of Jesus have appeared, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Christian art, the earliest depictions date to the late second or early 3rd century, and are primarily found in Rome. In these early depictions, Jesus is usually shown as a youthful figure without a beard and with <b>curly</b> <b>hair,</b> sometimes with different features from the other men in the scenes, e.g. his disciples or the Romans. However bearded depictions also appear from very early on, perhaps drawing on an existing stereotype from the Greek world of the appearance of the many itinerant charismatic philosophers.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Exupéry {{may have}} drawn {{inspiration}} for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (the Sun King) because of his golden <b>curly</b> <b>hair.</b> The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. Another possible {{inspiration for the}} little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh Jr. and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.|$|E
