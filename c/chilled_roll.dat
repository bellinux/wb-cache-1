This model includes crystallization kinetics and accounts carefully for the heat transfer coefficient with the successive rolls and surrounding air. Its predictions have been successfully compared to experimental temperature measurements along the coating line for various processing conditions (velocity, roll temperature, etc). Moreover, thermal history has a real impact on structure and morphology in the film. All these aspects are revealed by microscopic observations of thin microtomed sections of the film and X-ray diffraction experiments. Finally, adhesion properties of the laminate have been tested for the same process conditions.

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{begins with a}} film of molten polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being extruded onto a <b>chill</b> <b>roll,</b> which quenches it into the amorphous state. It is then biaxially oriented by drawing. The most common way of doing this is the sequential process, in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction, i.e. orthogonally to the direction of travel, in a heated oven. It is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously, although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate. Draw ratios are typically around 3 to 4 in each direction.|$|R

Diffusion path length was shown to be the main mechanism behind the release kinetics. Terahertz pulsed imaging visualized that adhesion between the core and coat of the calendered tablet was not complete and a gradient in coat thickness (varying from 200 to 600 Î¼m) was observed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interplay between}} inertia and gravity is {{examined}} for Newtonian film casting in this study. Both linear and nonlinear stability analyses are carried out. Linear stability analysis indicates that while both inertia and gravity enhance the stability in film casting, inertia plays a more dominant role regarding the critical draw ratio. In contrast, the disturbance frequency is {{more sensitive to}} the effect of gravity. The nonlinear results show that at the critical draw ratio, the system oscillates harmonically, indicating the onset of a Hopf bifurcation. For a draw ratio above criticality, finite-amplitude disturbances are amplified, and sustained oscillation is achieved. It is found that the growth rate increases with draw ratio, but decreases with inertia and gravity, which suggests that initial transients tend to take longer to die out for a fluid with inertia and gravity. Transient post-critical calculations show that the nonlinearity can be effectively halted by inertia and gravity. The oscillation frequency (film-thickness amplitude) decreases (increases) with draw ratio. However, the film oscillates more frequently but less fiercely with stronger inertia and gravity effects. The rupture of the film is also examined, and is found to be delayed by inertia and gravity. Interestingly, although the oscillation amplitude is found to be weakest at the <b>chill</b> <b>roll,</b> it is at this location that the film tends to rupture first...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that in {{extrusion}} coating, the coating adhesion to the substrate decreases with decreasing thickness. The study on this phenomenon is divided into three parts. Part I explores the reduction in adhesion of LDPE to paper and other porous substrates. Several hypotheses are proposed for the origin of this decrease, including a reduction in oxidation time, faster cooling in the air gap, and more rapid quenching in the nip. A model of the molten polymer penetration into the substrate shows that the greatest effect is cooling in the nip; thinner coatings have less time to flow into the substrate interstices once the <b>chill</b> <b>roll</b> contact is made. The model results agree well with experimental adhesion data from the literature. In Part II, adhesion to aluminum foil and other nonporous substrates is studied. Several hypotheses are proposed for why peel strength decreases in these structures, including a reduction in the air gap time, faster air gap cooling, more rapid nip quenching, and stress imposed during drawing. Modeling and experimental results show that cooling in the nip and imposed stress have the greatest impact. In Part III, the peel test is analyzed to understand why the peel strength of better adhering adhesives are more sensitive to changes in coating thickness. The analysis shows that changes in the critical dimension of the deformation region at the peel front may be responsible...|$|R

A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, crosshead guide bars, links, piston rods, <b>chilled</b> <b>rolls,</b> granite rolls, brass rolls, rubber rolls, paper rolls, crankshafts, camshafts, piston rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes.

[...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|R
40|$|Printing shrink labels with waterbased flexographic inks {{require a}} great deal of {{attention}} from the press operator. Lack of heat from the dryers can cause drying related problems, while an increase in the dryer temperature can shrink the material. Some press manufacturers recommend presses that are equipped with powerful dryers and expensive <b>chill</b> <b>roll</b> systems. Manufacturers also suggest the use of a corona treatment unit to improve ink adhesion. Newcomers, that do not wish to invest in new presses and equipment of this kind, struggle with finding a proper combination of press speed and dryer settings that may offer acceptable print results. The main objective of this research project was to establish an optimal press speed for a conventional flexographic printing technique that could output acceptable printing products for heat sensitive materials. To accomplish the research objective, a series of shrink film samples were evaluated from two main flexographic print runs. One run was performed using a corona treatment unit and another one without corona treatment. These print runs were executed using waterbased inks on a shrinkable film. Each run was divided into six press speed segments. For each segment, the press was set at a different speed. Following the print operation, a series of tests were conducted to determine the press speed boundaries that were best suited for printing without affecting the performance of the shrink film or inks. Samples were evaluated by employing an adhesion test, re-wetting test, shrinkage test, a blocking test and an offsetting test. Tests performed during the course of this research project established that shrink labels could be printed on a conventional waterbased flexographic press as long as the press uses corona treatment and that the maximum press speed does not exceed 150 feet per minute. Printing shrink films without corona treatment should not be performed since ink adhesion fails at all press speeds and blocking and offsetting issues are visible when press speed reaches 150 feet per minute...|$|R
