25|$|Following {{the success}} of Operation Opera— in which an Israeli Air Force strike took place to destroy the Iraqi nuclear {{programme}} in 1981— suspicion grew in Pakistan that the Indian Air Force had similar plans for Pakistan. In a private meeting with General Anwar Shamim, then-Chief of Air Staff, Zia had notified General Shamim that the Indian Air Force had plans to infiltrate Pakistan's nuclear energy project, citing solid evidence. Shamim felt that the Air Force was unable to divert such attacks, therefore, he advised Zia to use diplomacy through Munir Ahmad Khan to divert the attacks. At Vienna, Munir Ahmad Khan met with Indian physicist Raja Ramanna and notified him that such an attack would provoke a nuclear war between the two countries. In the meantime, Shamim decided to start the programme to acquire the F-16 Falcons and A-5 Fanton jets for the Pakistan Air Force. Shamim launched Operation Sentinel- a <b>counter</b> <b>operation</b> that thwarted the Israeli Air Force attempt to sabotage Pakistan's nuclear energy project— forced Indian Premier Indira Gandhi to held talks with Pakistan on nuclear issues and directed a high delegation to Pakistan where both countries pledged not to assist or attack each other's facilities.

In late August early September the unit moved to southern France at Salon-en-Provence. On 26 November 1943 the unit flew its last mission off North Africa. Until July 1944 I./KG 26 continued to fly anit-shipping missions off Anzio and western Italy.In July it relocated to Denmark to rearm with Junkers Ju 88A-4 aircraft. It formed a Einsatzstaffel which {{was ordered to}} pick up torpedoes from Flensburg for operations in the Crimea. However while en route, the unit ran into United States Army Air Force P-51 Mustangs and lost nine aircraft.

50|$|The President of the United States of America, {{under the}} {{provisions}} of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major General Samuel T. Williams, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General of the 25th Infantry Division. Major General Williams distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chu-Dong, Korea, on the morning of 15 July 1953. On that date, General Williams was advised of a large-scale enemy attack consisting of six hostile divisions and extending the width of the corps front. He immediately contacted all available sources of information in an effort to coordinate the defense. The reports he received were confused because of the scope of the battle, and General Williams realized that only through personal observation would he be able to secure the data he needed. Consequently, he flew in a helicopter {{to the scene of the}} battle. Dipping repeatedly to within a few feet of the hostile positions, General Williams noted the disposition of the foe without regard for the heavy fire directed against his craft. At one point, a bullet ripped through the plastic canopy of the helicopter, narrowly missing him. However, even this did not cause him to turn back. Instead, he passed again and again over the battle area until satisfied that he had gathered sufficient information upon which to base an effective defense. Only then did he return to his command post to plan and coordinate a <b>counter</b> <b>operation</b> which substantially reduced the fighting potential of the hostile force through the tremendous casualties they suffered.|$|E
50|$|Shamim {{then placed}} Pakistan Air Force on high-alert with alert level 7. Pakistan Air Force jets {{began to take}} sorties, {{equipped}} with missiles, on regular basis. The intelligence was confirmed by Air Intelligence who recommended the acquisition of Mirage-2000 or F-16 Falcon Fighters at an emergency level. Shamim advocated for the F-16s and acknowledged General Zia about the plans. In 1981, Air Intelligence command became alerted of suspected F-16s jets who had landed near the Indian borders. Shamim alerted the Pakistan Air Force, and a <b>counter</b> <b>operation</b> was launched, Operation Sentinel. Pakistan Air Force jets intercepted the suspected F-16s and confirmed their Israeli identity. Pakistan Air Force jets took aggressive measures and their tactics surprised the Israeli Air Force F-16s. Panicked and surprised, the mission was cancelled and Israeli Air Force F-16s were called off immediately. Pakistan then used Munir Ahmad Khan who was attending IAEA General Conference along with his Indian counterpart Dr. Raja Ramana. The Foreign Office directed a secret-coded message, through Ambassador of Pakistan to Austria Abdul Sattar, to Munir Khan who soon met Dr. Raja Ramana at the Imperial Hotel at Vienna, Austria. There, his Indian counterpart confirmed the possible surgical attack on Pakistani nuclear facilities. During their conversation, Munir Khan told the Chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission that an Indian attack on Pakistani nuclear facilities would trigger a possible Pakistan retaliatory strike on Indian nuclear facilities at Trombay, which {{will result in the}} release of radioactivity causing a major disaster. Dr. Raja Ramana held a meeting with Indira Gandhi and conveyed Pakistan's possible response. Indira Gandhi immediately postponed the surprise attack, and subsequently the matter was shelved. Following these events, Indian and Pakistani officials met for negotiations and agreed that both countries would not attack each other's nuclear facilities.|$|E

At 05:00 hours, after the 6 hours after the assault had begun, the <b>counter</b> <b>operation</b> was started. By the time SSG(N) arrived, the attackers had taken position on the roof of an adjacent two-storey building used by Pakistan Navy for pre-and post-flight briefings and debriefings. Prime minister Gillani personally monitored this operation, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Air Staff, and Chief of Naval Staff stayed in direct contact with Prime minister Gillani. The core objectives of the mission were issued to SSG(N) teams. The main priority of mission was to recover and evacuate the foreign military advisers from the scene of shooting. The second objective was to either kill or apprehend the militants. The third and final objective was issued by the Naval Intelligence, in which the SSG(N) were instructed to recover the bodies of militants to prevent further mutilation, in order to carry out the investigations. The complex, which the foreign advisers were held in, has a crew room, a lounge, a briefing room and a leisure room and small offices. The gang-leader, however, stayed in front of the building, taking a position on the ground. As the teams engaged, the leader went inside the building. A sniper on the rooftop began firing rounds at the SSG(N) teams, taking out men with the help of night vision equipment. The militant sniper also killed three naval firefighters and two Rangers, who were providing cover for naval firefighters, who were trying to get control of a fire on a P3C-Orion aircraft. The SSG(N) teams quickly targeted the sniper. The sniper {{was shot in the head}} and fell on the ground from the top of the complex. According to Naval Intelligence, the militants were only targeting the aircraft and its crew who were unarmed, mostly pilots and officers. The SSG(N) teams provided the cover to the crew in a heavy exchange of fire while the crew took the aircraft to a safe place. The SSG(N) teams had pushed and forced the militants into retaliation, after SSG(N) took aggressive counter measure. The militants ran and hid in a complex near the airport.|$|E

From 1979 to 1983, the country was made a subject of attack by international organisation for not signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); Zia deftly neutralised international pressure by tagging Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme to the nuclear designs of the neighbouring Indian nuclear programme.

The FPGA timer module consists of timer controller, timer dynamic parameters and soft contact state register, the timer controller carries out <b>counter</b> <b>operation</b> for timing unit every 1 ms, then results from timing operation would be saved in timer parameter list of a dual port RAM, when controller commands need to be executed via PLC, the timer will be used as a regular memory unit for W/R operation, thus no executing time of PLC program would be spared basically, which can well meet the system requirements where large number of controllers are needed. Simultaneously, principles of system composition, timing operation control and timing operation flow are all introduced followed by which a field test is also carried out for testament of the designed timer system...|$|E
