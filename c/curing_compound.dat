The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) developed and maintains a quality monitoring (QM) program for curing compounds to ensure that curing compounds used in TxDOT projects meet the minimum requirements.

The new protocol consists of using measured relative humidity and temperature to calculate an effectiveness index (EI) which serves as an indicator of the effectiveness of curing.

A finite element program, temperature and moisture analysis for curing concrete (TMAC 2), is updated to solve the coupled and nonlinear heat transfer and moisture transport problems in early-age concrete. Moisture capacity is induced into the TMAC 2, which makes it unique to characterize the self-desiccation.

In this study, the material properties, i. e. thermal conductivity and moisture diffusivity, were backcalculated from field data. Thereafter, backcalculated material properties were used to forward-calculate the temperature and moisture histories of all other sections.

Application of a liquid membrane-forming <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> is among the most widely used curing methods for concrete pavements and bridge decks.

This report presents a literature review of curing technology, with an emphasis on curing compounds, and the experimental results from the first part of this research—lab investigation. In the lab investigation, three curing compounds were selected and applied to mortar specimens at three different times after casting. Two application methods, single- and double-layer applications, were employed. Moisture content, conductivity, sorptivity, and degree of hydration were measured at different depths of the specimens. Flexural and compressive strength of the specimens were also tested. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between these material properties. The research results indicate that application of a <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> significantly increased moisture content and degree of cement hydration and reduced sorptivity of the near-surface-area concrete. For given concrete materials and mix proportions, optimal application time of curing compounds depended primarily upon the weather condition.

Among all test methods applied, the sorptivity test is the most sensitive one to provide good indication for the subtle changes in microstructure of the near-surface-area concrete caused by different curing materials and application methods.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringKyle RidingConcrete is {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} material. Concrete strength and durability develop from a series of exothermic reactions involving water called hydration. Long-term durability and performance of concrete is very much dependent on the early hydration behavior of cementitious materials. This study examined the effects of curing temperature and access to moisture on the early age reaction rate of cementitious materials, and methods for quantifying these effects. Apparent activation energy (Ea) relates the effects of temperature on the cement hydration reaction. There are various methods and calculation techniques for estimating Ea that result in greatly varying values. Cement paste and mortar are often used to calculate Ea and used later for concrete. Ea values were calculated using cement mortar and paste by isothermal calorimetry and showed excellent correlation. This validates the use of Ea based on cement paste in modeling concrete behavior. Ea values were also calculated by chemical shrinkage and it showed potential for use in calculating Ea. Cementitious materials need free water to be available for hydration to continue. Curing with either waxy <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> or ponded water are common practices. The thickness of distilled water, lime-saturated water, and cement pore water used as a curing method affects the rate of hydration. Water-cementitious material ratio (w/cm) and sample depth affect the performance of water curing, with low w/cm being the most significant.

The maintenance of reinforced concrete structures is an extremely expensive exercise and is a continuing necessity. Concrete curing is a practice that is understood to be a necessity within industry, but is often overlooked {{as a result of}} time and/or economic constraints. The objective of the study is to ascertain whether or not the implementation of better quality and alternative curing techniques will improve the durability properties of the concrete. Curing is defined as the maintenance of appropriate moisture and temperature conditions to permit the continuation of the hydration or pozzolanic reaction. The objective of curing is to ensure the progress of hydration reactions causing the filling and discontinuity of capillary voids by hydrated compounds in newly placed concrete. Modern curing methods are generally classified as wet or sealing. Wet methods include fogging, sprinkling, ponding, immersion and wet coverings. Sealing methods include plastic coverings and membrane forming <b>curing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Crystallising permeability reducing admixtures may be included in the concrete mix design in order to decrease the penetrability of concrete by decreasing the interconnectivity of the pore structure. Curing methods need to be employed in order to assure specified durability limits are acquired, as durability constraints are implemented in industry. Various methods of curing were tested in order to establish the effect of the techniques on the durability properties of concrete. Samples were placed in water and in winter (Western Cape, South Africa) and simulated summer environments. Various curing techniques were then employed within each of the exposure environments. The curing methods were damp hessian, cling wrap, two <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> and two crystallising permeability reducers (PRA's). Samples were also left untreated in each environment as reference samples. Compressive strength, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity, chloride conductivity, bulk diffusion and accelerated carbonation tests were conducted. The results obtained in the study concur with those presented in literature. Prolonged periods of moist curing are significantly beneficial to the compressive strength and durability properties of concrete, however, full water immersion is not a feasible alternative for large or insitu-cast concrete elements. Results of the study show that d amp hessian was the best method to ensure superior durability properties. The sealing of samples with <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> in a cool and wet environment (winter) is not recommended, whereas it is marginally beneficial, as was clingwrap, in a hot and dry environment (summer).

Conventionally, curing has been conducted by means of water sparkling, wet burlap or a <b>curing</b> <b>compound.</b> For performance and environmental reasons, internal curing has been gaining increased attention. However, more data is needed for the effectiveness of this curing technique when used in various concrete mixtures. This investigation addresses potential utilization of internal curing in high performance concrete (HPC). Internal curing was introduced by means of three aggregates: perlite, pumice and recycled aggregates; all of which were incorporated into HPC mixtures. Conventional mixtures were prepared and were thoroughly cured either by water or by a <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> or left non-cured. Fresh concrete and Hardened concrete properties were assessed including slump, unit weight, compressive and flexural strength, and durability tests such as shrinkage assessment, rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) and abrasion resistance. Experimental work is backed up with a simplified feasibility analysis with case study, incorporating initial and future costs to better judge potential of this technique. The outcome of this study uncovers that the addition of pre-wetted lightweight aggregates can prompt an enhancement in concrete workability and durability accompanied by a reduced shrinkage. Compressive and flexural strengths decreased with the increased replacement dosages, however several dosages were tested to reach a figure of optimum replacement. Results of this study reveal the potential of this technology in saving fresh water as well as the costs saved in maintenance and rehabilitation works...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the synthesis and characterization of epoxy resins based on (hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphenol (EFN) and p,p&# 8217;-isopropylidenebisphenol (EBN), respectively and 4, 4 &# 8217;- (hexafluoroisopropylidene) dipthalic-imideamine (IMAM), a curing agent. The synthesized epoxy resins and IMAM curing agent {{were characterized by}} Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 13 C NMR technique was also used to characterize IMAM. Study of curing behavior of EFN and EBN with stoichiometric amount of aromatic 4, 4 &# 8217;-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), 4, 4 &# 8217;-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) and IMAM by using Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) indicated that IMAM was least reactive curing agent towards both epoxy resins as compared to DDS and DDM. The investigation of thermal decomposition of the <b>cured</b> <b>compounds</b> by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) indicated the higher thermal stability of EFN and EBN resins initially with DDS and at elevated temperatures with IMAM. It was also observed that EFN resins were thermally more stable than EBN resins cured with corresponding curing agents...|$|R
40|$|Blends {{of natural}} rubber (NR) and styrene {{butadiene}} rubber (SBR) were prepared with sulfur and n-t-butyl- 2 -benzothiazole sulfonamide (TBBS) as accelerator, varying the amount of each polymer in the blend. Samples were analysed by rheometer curing at 433 K until their maximum torque was reached. The miscibility among the constituent polymers of the <b>cured</b> <b>compounds</b> was studied in {{a broad range of}} temperatures by means of differential scanning calorimetry, analyzing the glass transition temperatures of the samples. The specific heat capacity of the compounds was also determined. Thermal diffusivity of the samples was measured in the temperature range from 130 to 400 K with a new device that performs measurements in vacuum. The thermal results are explained {{on the basis of the}} structure formed during the vulcanization of the samples considering the variation of the crosslink density of each phase. Finally, a serial thermal conduction model that takes into account the contribution of each phase to the thermal diffusivity was used to fit the experimental results...|$|R
