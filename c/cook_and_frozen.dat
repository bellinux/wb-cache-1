40|$|Background: Anisakis simplex is {{responsible}} for allergic symptoms after repeated ingestion or contact with parasitized fi sh. Objective: To further analyze type I and IV immunologic mechanisms {{in a group of}} patients with allergic reactions to A simplex, we performed prick-by-prick testing with A simplex larvae and patch tests with live, cooked, or frozen larvae of the A simplex parasite. Methods: Thirty-eight patients underwent skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test with inhalant allergens, foods, and A simplex. Prick-by-prick tests with A simplex and patch tests with live, <b>cooked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> larvae were carried out in 10 patients with evidence of allergy to A simplex. Results: Prick-by-prick testing yielded a positive result in 100 % of cases with live larvae and in 70 % with <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> larvae. Patch tests with A simplex were positive in 8 patients for live larvae, in 3 patients for <b>frozen</b> larvae, <b>and</b> in 1 patient for cooked larvae. Conclusion: Our data emphasize that A simplex {{is responsible}} for both immediate allergic reactions and cell-mediated (delayed) reactions, in particular in subjects with occupational exposure. In addition, our data demonstrate that not only live but also <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> larvae can induce sensitization. This observation may be explained by differences in the allergenic proteins involved, and further studies will be required to address this possibility. Key words: Allergic contact dermatitis.

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture <b>and</b> mouthfeel. Canned, <b>cooked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of different ageing times before deboning (deboning time) and ageing times after deboning (holding time) on the quality (sensory attributes and texture) and cooking loss of chicken breast marinated, <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> using a continuous process. The following 3 ² experimental design was used (3 deboning times: zero, 6 and 12 hours; and 3 holding times: zero, 12 and 24 hours). Brine absorption, chicken breast pH and cooking loss were evaluated, a sensory analysis was carried out and the shear force was determined. The deboning and holding times did not significantly influence brine absorption and pH, but did significantly influence cooking loss, where the lowest value obtained was a mean of 19. 72 % for deboning times of 6 or 12 hours and a holding time of 24 hours. A deboning time of 6 hours was sufficient to improve tenderness as measured by a sensory analysis and shear force determination...|$|R
40|$|Abstractβ-N-Methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) is a {{potential}} neurotoxin associated with the aquatic environment. Validated analytical methods for the quantification of both free and total concentrations of BMAA were used in an investigation of seafood purchased from different grocery stores in Uppsala, Sweden. The analysis was performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI–MS/MS) and detection of BMAA as a dansyl derivate. The determined concentrations of free BMAA (after a simple trichloroacetic acid extraction) in mussels and scallops were up to 0. 46 μgg− 1 wet homogenate. The total BMAA (after hydrochloric acid hydrolysis) levels were between 0. 29 and 7. 08 μgg− 1 wet mussel homogenate. The highest concentration of total BMAA was found in imported <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> canned mussels which contained about ten times the quantity of BMAA measured in domestic <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> mussels. In this study it was also concluded that BMAA could be detected in seafood origin from four different continents. The risks associated with human exposure to BMAA through food are unknown today. However, {{the results of this}} study show that imported seafood in Sweden contain BMAA, indicating that this area needs more investigation, including a risk assessment regarding the consumption of e. g., mussels, scallops and crab...|$|R

40|$|Low-temperature {{blanching}} (LTB) {{of potatoes}} (cv. Kennebec), both {{without further processing}} and prior to cooking or freezing + cooking, significantly increased firmness retention as measured from compression parameters. The increase in firmness with respect to that of unblanched potatoes diminished in the order: blanched at 60 °C for 60 min <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> > blanched at 60 °C for 60 min <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> > blanched at 60 °C for 60 min. Potato tubers were kept in refrigerated storage, and firmness, PME activity and dry matter (DM) content were periodically sampled {{over a period of}} 80 days. In the early stages of storage, PME activity lost 40 % of its original value after 60 min at 60 °C, indicating that the contribution of starch breakdown products to the firmness of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>cooked</b> potatoes predominated over the effect of enzyme activity. With increasing time in storage, PME activity measured in the fresh tissue increased by 95 % of its original value after 35 days; this resulted in changes in the pectic polymers which made for a firmer texture and different PME behaviour versus LTB temperature and time. A central composite rotatable design was used to study the effects of variation in levels of temperature (52. 93 - 67. 07 °C) and time (31. 72 - 88. 28 min) on compression parameters and PME activity. Stationary points showing maximum mechanical resistance had critical temperatures and times in the ranges of temperature (58 - 60 °C) and time (66 - 75 min) used for each independent variable. Results show a high correlation between PME activity and tissue firmness, suggesting that the contribution of the changes in the composition of the cell wall to the firmness of frozen cooked potatoes increased with increasing time in storage and reached a maximum in the intermediate stages of storage (35 days). Engineering stress (σu) proved to be the most appropriate compression parameter for detecting the firming effect that the PME activity produced on the frozen-cooked potato tissues as a consequence of LTB under these conditions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

40|$|Because meat is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} food item, extra care and attention are needed {{to ensure that a}} high quality, wholesome product is served. Unwholesomeness and spoilage of meat are caused by bacteria and other microorganisms. This contamination generally occurs during cutting and processing. These bacteria require three conditions for growth: low acidity (near neutral pH) level within the meat; an available supply of water or other moisture, such as meat juices; a warm temperature [...] generally between 45 ° and 127 °F. Therefore, to prevent spoilage and the possibility of food borne illness, precautions must be taken to control these three factors. The safety measures taken vary depending on the form or type of meat product. Five basic types of meat exist, each of which require special storage techniques. They are fresh, <b>cooked,</b> cured, canned <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> meat...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{antioxidants}} (AO) {{are believed}} {{to contribute to the}} overall health benefits seen from fruit and vegetables. Despite increased public awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetables through campaigns such as 5 A DAY, consumption remains low. Freezing is usually regarded as destructive to AO and ascorbic acid (AA) and this has fostered a belief that fresh vegetables are nutritionally superior to frozen. In this study, AO and AA activity in commercially bought fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables were investigated and compared after a typical home cooking practice (boiling). Five different vegetables were examined: carrots, broccoli, green beans, peas and spinach. Each vegetable was bought four times from a selection of local supermarkets and green grocers in the Wirral, United Kingdom to account for variation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assay were utilised to measure total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and AA content respectively. The results showed both fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables to contain AO and AA after cooking. <b>Cooked</b> fresh spinach <b>and</b> peas contained significantly (p<. 05) higher levels of total AO than <b>cooked</b> <b>frozen</b> spinach <b>and</b> peas. However the remaining fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables (broccoli, carrots and green beans) did not appear to differ in AO content after cooking. Furthermore {{there was no difference between}} AA content in fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>cooked</b> vegetables. The current study provides evidence against the misconception that fresh is always nutritionally superior to frozen at the point of consumption. Frozen vegetable promotion may be the way forward to increase fruit and vegetable consumption as they are generally nutritionally comparable to fresh but, cheaper, result in less waste, are more convenient and, if packaged correctly, taste the same as fresh. Further work, on a larger scale, is needed, to measure AO and AA content of fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables bought <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> by the consumer...|$|R
