40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of dairy system and {{individual}} cow-related factors on the volatile fingerprint {{of a large number}} <b>of</b> individual <b>model</b> cheeses analyzed by proton transfer reaction time-offlight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). A total <b>of</b> 1, 075 <b>model</b> cheeses were produced using milk samples collected from individual Brown Swiss cows reared in 72 herds located in mountainous areas of Trento province (Italy). The herds belonged to 5 main dairy systems ranging from traditional to modern and the cows presented different daily milk yields (24. 6 ± 7. 9 kg × d− 1), stages of lactation (199 ± 138 d in milk), and parities (2. 7 ± 1. 8). The PTR-ToF-MS revealed 619 peaks, of which the 240 most intense were analyzed, and 61 of these were tentatively attributed to relevant volatile organic compounds {{on the basis of their}} fragmentation patterns and data from the literature. Principal component analysis was used to convert the multiple responses characterizing the PTR-ToF-MS spectra into 5 synthetic variables representing 62 % of the total information. These principal components were related to groups <b>of</b> volatile <b>compounds</b> tentatively attributed to different peaks and used to investigate the relationship <b>of</b> the volatile <b>compound</b> profile obtained by PTR-ToF-MS to animal and farm characteristics. Lactation stage is related to 4 principal components which brought together 52. 9 % of the total variance and 57. 9 % of the area of analyzed peaks. In particular, 2 principal components were positively related to peaks tentatively attributed to aldehydes and ketones and negatively related to alcohols, esters, and acids, which displayed a linear increase during lactation. The third principal component was affected by dairy system; it was lower in the modern system in which cows received total mixed rations. The third principal component was positively related to daily milk production. In summary, we report the first application of this innovative, high-throughput technique to study the effects of dairy system and individual animal factors on volatile organic <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> cheeses.

40|$|We propose an {{extension}} to other high T_{c } <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> a <b>model</b> introduced earlier for YBCO. In the ''self-doped'' compounds {{we assume that}} the doping part (namely the BiO, HgO, TlO planes in BSCCO, HBCCO, TBCCO respectively) is metallic, which leads to a multiband model. This assumption is supported by band structure calculations. Taking a repulsive pairing interaction between these doping bands and the CuO_{ 2 } bands leads to opposite signs for the order parameter on these bands and to nodes whenever the Fermi surfaces of these bands cross. We show that in BSCCO the low temperature dependence of the penetration depth is reasonably accounted for. In this case the nodes are not located near the 45 ^{o} direction, which makes the experimental determination of the node locations an important test for our model. The situation in HBCCO and TBCCO is rather analogous to BSCCO. We consider the indications given by NMR and find that they rather favor a metallic character for the doping bands. Finally we discuss the cases of NCCO and LSCO which are not ''self-doped'' and where our model does not give nodes. Comment: 11 pages, revtex, 1 figure...|$|R
