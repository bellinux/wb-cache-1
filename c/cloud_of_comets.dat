40|$|The {{proposal}} by Frank et al. (1986) that <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> small <b>comets</b> periodically inject {{large amounts of}} H 2 O into the upper atmospheres of the earth, Venus, and Mars is examined critically, {{with a focus on}} transport and disposal mechanisms invoked to account for the large H 2 O masses involved. It is argued that observed parameter values (such as mixing ratios, vertical wind velocities, and H escape flows) prohibit transport by eddy, molecular diffusion, vertical avection, or coherent movement. In a reply by Frank et al., these objections are discussed in terms of an overall description of the decelerataion and penetration of a cometary water cloud, and H 2 O concentrations and mixing mechanisms consistent with observed values for the earth are proposed. It is suggested that an increase in cometary H 2 O influx could lead to concentrations attaining the frost point and to formation of a global mesospheric cloud with significant climate effects. A lower H 2 O influx rate for Venus (consistent with observed H loss and atmospheric H 2 O concentration) and relatively rapid loading of the Mars surface and atmosphere with H 2 O ice and vapor (followed by brief warming periods with increased exospheric H 2 O outflow and surface flow of liquid H 2 O) are considered...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} several {{properties}} of the Oort <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> Sun, Galaxy (and Jupiter) gravitationally act on the comets. New physical model of galactic tide is considered. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1. Mass of the Oort <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> is less than 1 mass of the Earth (M_E), probably not greater than 1 / 2 M_E. 2. Theoretical number of long-period comets with perihelion distance q < 5 AU is about 50 -times greater than the conventional approach yields. Gravity of Jupiter was {{taken into account in}} finding this result. 3. Semi-major axis a and period of oscillations P of eccentricity (and other orbital elements) are related as a^ 3 P = 1 in natural units for a moving Solar System in the Galaxy. The natural unit for time is the orbital period of the Solar System revolution around the galactic center and the natural unit for measuring the semi-major axis is its maximum value for the half-radius of the Solar System corresponding to the half-radius of the Oort cloud. The relation holds for the cases when comets approach the inner part of the Solar System, e. g., perihelion distances are less than ≈ 100 AU. 4. The minimum value of semi-major axis for the Oort cloud is a_min ≪ 1 × 10 ^ 4 AU. This condition was obtained both from the numerical results on cometary evolution under the action of the galactic tides and from the observational distribution of long-period comets. If the density function of semi-major axis is approximated by proportionality a^α, then α is - 1 / 2, approximately. 5. The magnitude of the change in perihelion distance per orbit, Δ q, of a comet due to galactic tides is a strong function of semi-major axis a, proportional to a^ 8. 25.

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} {{hypothesis}} of a vast cometary reservoir surrounding the Solar System - the Oort <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> - {{within the framework of}} Milgromian Dynamics (MD or MOND). For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud assuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity versions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external gravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external field is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect (EFE). Adopting the popular pair ν(x) =[1 -(-x^ 1 / 2) ]^- 1 for the MD interpolating function and a_ 0 = 1. 2 × 10 ^- 10 m s^- 2 for the MD acceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The comets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide can torque their orbits significantly. However, this {{does not need to be}} an obstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE can induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a comet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function families and a revised value of a_ 0 (provided recently by the Cassini spacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in conclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its overall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the Jupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a significant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like orbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible in MD. In MD, they both belong to the same population, just in different modes of their evolution. Comment: 19 pages, 1 table, 21 figures; v 3 - minor corrections, typo...|$|E

The dusty debris from these comets will manifest itself as a debris disk temporarily visible around newborn white dwarfs; examples of such disks may already have {{been seen in the}} Helix Nebula, and around several other young WDs. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives such as a dynamically excited Kuiper Belt analogue. If interpreted as indeed being cometary in origin, the observation that & 15 % of young WDs possess such disks provides indirect evidence that low mass gas giants (thought necessary to produce an Oort cloud) are common in the outer regions of extrasolar planetary systems. Hydrogen abundances in the atmospheres of older white dwarfs can, if sufficiently low, also be used to place constraints on the joint parameter space of natal kicks and exo-Oort cloud models. Key words: White dwarfs−−Accretion, accretion disks−−cometary bodies...|$|R
