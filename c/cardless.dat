25|$|In April 1994, Valley View Center added a frequent-shopper rewards {{program called}} the Smart Shoppers Club. Mall {{management}} said {{they planned to}} spend roughly $500,000 over {{the first two years}} of the program in a bid to increase mall traffic while collecting invaluable demographic data about mall shoppers. Within five months, 9,000 shoppers had joined the club and the mall announced a goal of 20,000 members by the end of 1994. Shoppers logged their visits by swiping their membership card and entering a personal identification number at one of the mall's three touch-screen kiosks. Member benefits included special discount coupons, free gifts, and the chance to win prizes. Club members also received a periodic Shopping Smart newsletter, a Valley View Center shopping bag, plus a birthday card and gift. The Smart Shoppers Club was terminated in late 2000 when it was replaced by a <b>cardless</b> web-based system called Centerlinq. Customers were then able to redeem their old Smart Shoppers Club cards at the mall's customer service desk for a Valley View Center T-shirt.|$|E

5000|$|Kounta is an Australian {{software}} company founded in 2012. The company {{is best known}} for its flagship product, Kounta, which comprises a cloud based point of sale mobile app. Released in 2012, Kounta became the first hospitality-focused point of sale (POS) mobile app for iPad, Android, Mac, and Windows. In 2012 Epson announced a partnership with Kounta, which led to the integration of Kounta's cloud-based POS platforms in Epson printers. In 2013 Kounta launched a partnership with PayPal to integrate cashless and <b>cardless</b> transactions via PayPal's mobile app. In June 2014, Kounta announced a minority stake investment from MYOB (company), which resulted in a partnership towards the development of a co-branded product integrating Kounta's POS with MYOB's software. MYOB Kounta launched in October of the same year. In 2016, Kounta partnered with The Commonwealth Bank of Australia to include the Kounta app onto [...] "Albert", the bank's EFTPOS tablet. This allowed The Commonwealth Bank of Australia to become the first bank to manage customers operations from a single mobile application.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the whole}} world going mobile and with the threats {{represented}} by third party mobile payments, the banks need to react and offer their clients innovative integrated solutions for payments and money transfer. Mobile banking applications {{are more and more}} used, and the possibilities to expand are still open. A <b>cardless</b> withdrawal solution integrated in an already developed smartphone mobile banking application might just give an edge in the fight with other competitors. By using SMS technologies for sending money to other people the appeal of such an application will rise considerably and will attract more and more clients. It is very important to keep the mobile payment endorsers as clients of the bank and not some other provider. Key-Words: Mobile banking, Mobile payments, <b>Cardless</b> withdrawa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCARMA 1 (originally called CARD 11) is a membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase {{family member}} {{that is required}} for T cell receptor (TCR) -induced NF-κB activation in T cell leukemia lines [1 – 5]. It uses its N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) {{to interact with the}} CARD in the downstream adaptor Bcl- 10. We show that primary B and T lymphocytes from knock-in mice expressing only a <b>CARDless</b> form of CARMA 1 (ΔCARD) are defective at mitogen-induced NF-κB activation and fail to proliferate. CARMA 1 mutant mice exhibited normal T but impaired B cell development; CD 5 + peritoneal B cells were absent, and serum immunoglobulin levels were markedly reduced. A lacZ reporter gene knocked into the CARMA 1 locus confirmed lymphocyte-specific expression of CARMA 1. Thus, CARMA 1 has an essential role in mediating B and T lymphocyte proliferation and requires its CARD to engage downstream signaling components...|$|E
40|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) is moving from research laboratories towards applications. As computing becomes more mobile, cashless {{as well as}} <b>cardless</b> payment solutions are introduced, and a need arises for incorporating QKD in a mobile device. Handheld devices present a particular challenge as the orientation and the phase of a qubit will depend on device motion. This problem is addressed by the reference frame independent (RFI) QKD scheme. The scheme tolerates an unknown phase between logical states that varies slowly compared to the rate of particle repetition. Here we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of RFI QKD over a free-space link in a prepare and measure scheme using polarisation encoding. We extend the security analysis of the RFI QKD scheme {{to be able to}} deal with uncalibrated devices and a finite number of measurements. Together these advances are an important step towards mass production of handheld QKD devices...|$|E
40|$|The caspase {{recruitment}} domain (CARD) -containing proteins CARMA 1 - 3 share {{high degree}} of sequence, structure and functional homology. Whereas CARMA 1 and CARMA 3 {{have been identified as}} crucial components of signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of NF-κB transcription factor, {{little is known about the}} function of CARMA 2. Here we report the identification of two splice variants of CARMA 2. One transcript, named CARMA 2 short (CARMA 2 sh), is predicted to encode for a CARMA 2 polypeptide containing the CARD, coiled coil, and a PDZ domains, but lacking the SH 3 and the GuK domains. The second variant, CARMA 2 <b>cardless</b> (CARMA 2 cl), encodes for a polypeptide lacking the CARD domain and containing only a portion of the coiled coil domain and a linker region. Expression analysis confirmed the presence of the CARMA 2 alternatively spliced transcripts in both human cell lines and tissues. Fluorescence microscopy data show that both splice variants localize in the cytosol. Biochemical experiments indicate that CARMA 2 sh interacts with TRAF 2 and activates NF-κB in a TRAF 2 -dependent manner. Finally, CARMA 2 sh variant protects cells from apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multiple transcripts encoding several CARMA 2 isoforms exist in vivo and regulate NF-κB activation and apoptosis. J. Cell.

40|$|Kanazawa Institute of Technology Library Center (KIT-LC) was {{established}} in June 1982 with the aim to collect one million books and ten million informations such as theses, essays etc. For the construction and realization of the LC keen attentions were paid and numerous {{attempts were made to}} establish an ideal technological special library in Japan. In other words the KIT-LC is in fact an experimentation in Japan as exemplified in the following seven points: (1) KIT-LC basically has four functions, namely the educational center and the research center, which are self-evident at any university libraries, the center for the graduate students and the center for local technological informations. (2) Implementation of the subject librarians system utilizing the present KIT professors. (3) Subject librarians, who are teaching staff as well as librarians, are assigned with responsibilities of library user education. (4) By utilizing the progressive computer system in KIT, online library system was introduced and thereby realized the form of <b>cardless</b> library. (5) Through this online system all users can search the address of any documents in the library. (6) In addition to the IR function this online system can be utilized as an integrated online library information system that handles almost all types of library operations, including acquisition, cataloging, circulation etc. (7) In Japan the bibliographic informations are expressed mainly by two types of letter, Japanese and alphabetical letters. Based on this concept, development of the multilingal system is assumed to be possible. This means that the system can handle not only Kanji, two kinds of Kana and Roman script etc. but can also handle such script as the Arabic letter. This is currently under research by the staffs in KIT. A more detail description of the above seven functions are presented in this paper...|$|E
