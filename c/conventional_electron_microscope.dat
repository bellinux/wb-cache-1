40|$|Lithium sulfur (Li-S) {{batteries}} {{have the}} potential to provide higher energy storage density at lower cost than conventional lithium ion batteries. A key challenge for Li-S batteries is the loss of sulfur to the electrolyte during cycling. This loss can be mitigated by sequestering the sulfur in nanostructured carbon-sulfur composites. The nanoscale characterization of the sulfur distribution within these complex nanostructured electrodes is normally performed by electron microscopy, but sulfur sublimates and redistributes in the high vacuum conditions of <b>conventional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The resulting sublimation artifacts render characterization of sulfur in <b>conventional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> problematic and unreliable. Here, we demonstrate two techniques, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and scanning electron microscopy in air (airSEM), that enable the reliable characterization of sulfur across multiple length scales by suppressing sulfur sublimation. We use cryo-TEM and airSEM to examine carbon-sulfur composites synthesized for use as Li-S battery cathodes, noting several cases where the commonly-employed sulfur melt infusion method is highly inefficient at infiltrating sulfur into porous carbon hosts...|$|R

This relatively large thickness is due to dynamical amplification of bonding contrast arising from partial de-channeling of 1 s states.

25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases.

The {{results showed that the}} birds fed 150 g kg(- 1) of FFSK showed a shortening and thickening of the villi, hyperplasia and vacuolar degeneration of enterocytes, and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of goblet cells. Likewise, an increment of intraepithelial lymphoid cells and hypercellularity of the lamina propria was observed. In addition, electron microscopy showed large vacuoles in the enterocytes, which could be dilations of agranular and granular endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi. There were many dark granules within the vacuoles that could be triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (portomicrons). These lesions could have been due to the presence of chlorogenic acid or to the greater concentration of oil in the FFSK diet.

40|$|International audiencePhotoactivated {{localization}} microscopy (PALM) {{and related}} fluorescent biological imaging methods {{are capable of}} providing very high spatial resolutions (up to 20 nm). Two major demands limit its widespread use on biological samples: requirements for photoactivatable/photoconvertible fluorescent molecules, which are sometimes difficult to incorporate, and high background signals from autofluorescence or fluorophores in adjacent focal planes in three-dimensional imaging which reduces PALM resolution significantly. We present here a high-resolution PALM method utilizing conventional EGFP as the photoconvertible fluorophore, improved algorithms to deal {{with high levels of}} biological background noise, and apply this to imaging higher order chromatin structure. We found that the emission wavelength of EGFP is efficiently converted from green to red when exposed to blue light in the presence of reduced riboflavin. The photon yield of redconverted EGFP using riboflavin is comparable to other bright photoconvertible fluorescent proteins that allow < 20 nm resolution. We further found that image pre-processing using a combination of denoising and deconvolution of the raw PALM images substantially improved the spatial resolution of the reconstruction from noisy images. Performing PALM on Drosophila mitotic chromosomes labeled with H 2 AvD-EGFP, a histone H 2 A variant, revealed filamentous components of ~ 70 nm. This is the first observation of fine chromatin filaments specific for one histone variant at a resolution approximating that of <b>conventional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> images (10 – 30 nm).

Abstract- The {{properties of}} creep subboundaries {{are described as}} derived from observations and experiments in the electron microscope for aluminium and an aluminium-zinc alloy.

Through a companion proposal, another group was to measure the size distribution of aerosols in the 0. 008 to 2 micrometer diameter range and to collect for us impactor samples of particles larger than about 0. 02 gm. In the first year, we conducted laboratory studies related to particulate deposition patterns on our collection substrates, and have performed the analysis of many ASHOE/MAESA aerosol samples from 1994 using analytical electron microscopy (AEM). We have been building an "aerosol climatology" with these data that documents the types and relative abundances of particles observed at different latitudes and altitudes. The second year (and non-funded extension periods) saw continued analyses of impactor aerosol samples, including more ASHOE/MAESA samples, some northern hemisphere samples from the NASA Stratospheric Photochemistry Aerosols and Dynamics Expedition (SPADE) program for comparison, and a few aerosol samples from the NASA Stratospheric TRacers of Atmospheric Transport (STRAT) program. A high-resolution field emission microscope {{was used for the}} analysis and re-analysis of a number of samples to determine if this instrument was superior in performance to our <b>conventional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> In addition, some basic laboratory studies were conducted to determine the minimum detectable and analyzable particle size for different types of aerosols. In all, 61 aerosol samples were analyzed, with a total of over 30, 000 individual particle analyses. In all analyzed samples, sulfate particles comprised the major aerosol number fraction. It must be stressed that particles composed of more than one species, for example sulfate and organic carbon, were classified according to the major fraction. Thus, many of the particles classified as sulfate may have contained significant mass fractions of carbonaceous or other material. These particles for the most part did not show two physical phases, however. Nonsulfate particles were classified according to the physical and chemical characteristics of each particle, and were grouped into the major nonsulfate particle classes, including C-rich, crustal, metallic, and salts. Our UT and LS sample analyses indicate a maximum for crustal and C-rich particle abundance in the Northern Hemisphere upper troposphere, and a salt particle maximum in the Southern Hemisphere upper troposphere. Metallic particles are clearly more prevalent in the troposphere than in the stratosphere, but interhemispheric differences appear small...|$|E

Here, we describe a modular, self-aligned, amplitude-division electron interferometer in a <b>conventional</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The interferometer consists of two 45 -nm-thick silicon layers separated by 20 μm. This interferometer is fabricated from a single-crystal silicon cantilever on a transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> grid by gallium focused-ion-beam milling. Using this interferometer, we obtain interference fringes in a Mach-Zehnder geometry in an unmodified 200 kV transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The fringes have a period of 0. 32 nm, which corresponds to the [111] lattice planes of silicon, and a maximum contrast of 15 %. We use convergent-beam electron diffraction to quantify grating alignment and coherence. This design can potentially be scaled to millimeter-scale, and used in electron holography. It could also be applied to perform fundamental physics experiments, such as interaction-free measurement with electrons...|$|R
