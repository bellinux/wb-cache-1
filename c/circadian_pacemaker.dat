40|$|WOS:A 1983 QG 64000002 International audienceThe {{possible}} role {{of different}} kind of photoreceptors in synchronization of circadian locomotor activity in cockroaches is presently still contradictory. We try to clarify the part played by the compound eyes and the ocelli with lesion and black‐varnishing experiments. The locomotor activity of isolated animals is automatically recorded in ring‐shaped cages equiped with infra‐red beams. Circadian rhythms are detected by using the Whittaker and Robinson periodogram. We obtained the following results:- Animals submitted to a shifting of their LD cycle keep the ability to synchronize with the new photocycle when their ocelli are destroyed or black‐varnished. When the eyes are destroyed or varnished, animals start free‐running or become arrhythmic. - Animals kept in IX from the eggs and submitted to a photocycle after the operation become rhythmic with ocelli destroyed or black‐varnished. With destroyed eyes, they stay arrhythmic. Only a few become rhythmic with black‐varnished eyes. - These results support Roberts, Nishiitsutsuji‐Uwo and Pittendrigh, Sokolove and Page results. The two kinds of photoreceptors are not equally powerful in synchronizing the locomotor activity rhythm with the external LD cycle.

It was convincingly shown in lesion experiments that cockroaches without optic lobes remained arrhythmic throughout their lifetime. But, because arrhythmic locomotion does not indicate the absence of an intact circadian clock, the most compelling evidence for the location of the circadian clock in the optic lobes of the cockroach was provided by transplantation experiments (Page, 1982).

40|$|Traditionally, {{circadian}} clocks {{have been}} {{thought of as}} a neurobiological phenomenon. This view changed somewhat over recent years with the discovery of peripheral tissue circadian oscillators. In mammals, however, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus still retains the critical role of a central synchronizer of biological timing. Zebrafish, in contrast, have always reflected a more highly decentralized level of clock organization, as individual cells and tissues contain directly light responsive <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> As a consequence, clock function in the zebrafish brain has remained largely unexplored, and the precise organization of rhythmic and light-sensitive neurons within the brain is unknown. To address this issue, we used the period 3 (per 3) -luciferase transgenic zebrafish to confirm that multiple brain regions contain endogenous circadian oscillators that are directly light responsive. In addition, in situ hybridization revealed localised neural expression of several rhythmic and light responsive clock genes, including per 3, cryptochrome 1 a (cry 1 a) and per 2. Adult brain nuclei showing significant clock gene expression include the teleost equivalent of the SCN, as well as numerous hypothalamic nuclei, the periventricular grey zone (PGZ) of the optic tectum, and granular cells of the rhombencephalon. To further investigate the light sensitive properties of neurons, expression of c-fos, a marker for neuronal activity, was examined. c-fos mRNA was upregulated in response to changing light conditions in different nuclei within the zebrafish brain. Furthermore, under constant dark (DD) conditions, c-fos shows a significant circadian oscillation. Taken together, these results show that there are numerous areas of the zebrafish central nervous system, which contain deep brain photoreceptors and directly light-entrainable <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> However, there are also multiple brain nuclei, which possess neither, demonstrating a degree of pacemaker complexity that was not previously appreciated...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) is a {{principle}} transmitter regulating circadian locomotor rhythms in Drosophila. We {{have identified a}} Class II (secretin-related) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is specifically responsive to PDF and also to calcitonin-like peptides and to PACAP. In response to PDF, the PDF receptor (PDFR) elevates cAMP levels when expressed in HEK 293 cells. As predicted by in vivo studies, cotransfection of Neurofibromatosis Factor 1 significantly improves coupling of PDFR to adenylate cyclase. pdfr mutant flies display increased circadian arrhythmicity, and also display altered geotaxis that is epistatic to that of pdf mutants. PDFR immunosignals are expressed by diverse neurons, but only by a small subset of <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> These data establish the first synapse within the Drosophila circadian neural circuit and underscore the importance of Class II peptide GPCR signaling in circadian neural systems...|$|R
40|$|The fan {{activity}} rhythm of Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin, 1791) and its entrainment capability to light were studied. Animals were tested under constant darkness (DD) {{followed by two}} consecutive 24 h light-darkness regimes: a first 11 h light period (LD) and a second 9 h light period, with its phase inverted (DL). An infrared analogical video-camera took shots each 30 s. A number of pictures with open fan were counted every 15 min. In DD a weak free-running periodicity in the circadian range was found, thus reinforcing the matching of the 24 h period under study in both photoperiod regimes. A nocturnal activity was characterised with a consistent anticipation to lightOFF (i. e. entrainment). Moreover, this phase of entrainment differed between DL and LD.

However, this notion was inconsistent with observations of the timing of sleep in human subjects living in isolation from time cues. Serge Daan, together with Borbély and Beersma, developed a model which convincingly explained the observations. It was called the two-process model of sleep regulation and explained human sleep regulation in terms of two key processes: a <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemaker,</b> and a homeostatic drive to sleep that increases during wake and decreases during sleep. Today, the two process model is used as the basis for most predictive models of sleep and performance.|$|E

40|$|Regulation of {{physiological}} functions with approximate daily periodicity, or circadian rhythms, is a characteristic feature of eukaryotes. Until recently, cyanobacteria {{were the only}} prokaryotes reported to possess circadian rhythmicity. It is controlled by a cluster of three genes: kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC.

40|$|Adult {{crayfish}} {{exhibit a}} variety of overt circadian rhythms. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the overt rhythms are controversial.

40|$|Background: Circadian clocks {{regulate}} the gene expression, metabolism and behaviour of most eukaryotes, controlling an orderly succession of physiological {{processes that are}} synchronised with the environmental day/night cycle. Central <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemakers</b> that control animal behaviour {{are located in the}} brains of insects and rodents, but the location of such a pacemaker has not been determined in plants. Peripheral plant and animal tissues also maintain circadian rhythms when isolated in culture, indicating that these tissues contain circadian clocks. The degree of autonomy that the multiple, peripheral circadian clocks have in the intact organism is unclear. Results: We used the bioluminescent luciferase reporter gene to monitor rhythmic expression from three promoters in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. The rhythmic expression of a single gene could be set at up to three phases in different anatomical locations of a single plant, by applying light/dark treatments to restricted tissue areas. The initial phases were stably maintained after the entraining treatments ended, indicating that the circadian oscillators in intact plants are autonomous. This result held for all the vegetative plant organs and for promoters expressed in all major cell types. The rhythms of one organ were unaffected by entrainment {{of the rest of the}} plant, indicating that phase-resetting signals are also autonomous. Conclusions: Higher plants contain a spatial array of autonomous circadian clocks that regulate gene expression without a localised <b>pacemaker.</b> <b>Circadian</b> timing in plants might be less accurate but more flexible than the vertebrate circadian system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Numerous {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{indicate that the}} initial photoresponse of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster is the light-induced degradation of TIMELESS (TIM). This posttranslational mechanism is {{in sharp contrast to}} the well-characterized pacemakers in mammals and Neurospora, where light evokes rapid changes in the transcriptional profiles of 1 or more clock genes. The authors show that light has novel effects on D. melanogaster <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemakers,</b> acutely stimulating the expression of tim at cold but not warm temperatures. This pho-toinduction occurs in flies defective for the classic visual phototransduction pathway or the circadian-relevant photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY). Cold-specific stimulation of tim RNA abundance is regulated at the transcriptional level, and although numerous lines of evidence indicate that period (per) and tim expres-sion are activated by the same mechanism, light has no measurable acute effect on per mRNA abundance. Moreover, light-induced increases in the levels of tim RNA are abolished or greatly reduced in the absence of functional CLOCK (CLK) or CYCLE (CYC) but not PER or TIM.

40|$|Abstract. Most species {{living outside}} the {{tropical}} zone undergo physiological adaptations to seasonal environmental changes and changing day length (photoperiod); {{this phenomenon is}} called photoperiodism. It {{is well known that}} the circadian clock is involved in the regulation of photoperiodism such as seasonal reproduction, but the mechanism underlying circadian clock regulation of photoperiodism remains unclear. Recent molecular analysis have revealed that, in mammals and birds, the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary gland acts as the relay point from light receptors, which receive information about the photoperiod, to the endocrine responses. Long-day (LD) -induced thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the PT acts as a master regulator of seasonal reproduction in the ependymal cells (ECs) within the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and activates thyroid hormone (TH) by inducing the expression of type 2 deiodinase in both LD and short-day (SD) breeding animals. Furthermore, the circadian clock {{has been found to be}} localized in the PT and ECs as well as in the <b>circadian</b> <b>pacemaker(s).</b> This review purposes to summarize the current knowledge concerning the involvement of the neuroendocrine system and circadian clock in seasonal reproduction...|$|R
