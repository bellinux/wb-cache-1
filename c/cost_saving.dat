Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology.

Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal being led by Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. Part of the political support was because there was agreement on a national railway plan, and removing parts of it would disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> for a road was estimated at 30 percent. The issue of a road was taken up in a new vote in Parliament in 1927, but was again rejected.|$|E

The Chow test, which examines whether the estimated coefficients on the explanatory variables are the same, reveals that different cost functions have to be estimated for the sub-samples.

40|$|The {{potential}} <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> {{due to the}} use of caustic recycle used {{in conjunction}} with remediation of radioactive underground storage tank waste, is shown in a figure for the Hanford and Savannah River sites. Two <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> estimates for each case have been made for Hanford, and one <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> estimate for each case have been made for Hanford, and one <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> estimate for each case has been made for the Savannah River site. This is due to the Hanford site remediation effort being less mature than that of Savannah River; and consequently, a range of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> being more appropriate for Hanford. This range of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> (rather than a ingle value) for each case at Hanford is due to cost uncertainties related to the LAW immobilization operation. Caustic recycle Case- 1 has been defined as the sodium required to meet al identified caustic needs for the entire Site. Case- 2 has been defined as the maximum sodium which can be separated from the low activity waste without precipitation of Al(OH) {sub 3 }.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis project identifies current sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance generated through Army foreign military sales (FMS). Using a comparative high-low case-study approach, a high-demand volume case and a low-demand volume case were selected in major weapons categories. The cases were analyzed on an internal basis to determine <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value. Once the cases were analyzed and compared against each other, advantages or trends in <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value became apparent. Upon completion of our analysis, we determined that <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were usually gained from reduced system unit costs due to higher economic order quantities, reduced overhead costs per unit, and reduced unit costs resulting from manufacturing learning curves. Additional costs were avoided by reducing gaps in production lines. Furthermore, we {{determined that the}} Army’s FMS strategy needs improvement {{in order to take}} full advantage of these sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} realization rate of energy and <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> from the Department of Energy's Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) program based on information reported by the energy services companies (ESCOs) that are carrying out ESPC projects at federal sites. Information was extracted from 134 Measurement and Verification (M&V) reports to determine reported, estimated, and guaranteed <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and reported and estimated energy savings for the previous contract year. Because the quality of the reports varied, {{it was not possible to}} determine all of these parameters for each project. For 133 of the 134 projects, there was sufficient information to compare estimated, reported, and guaranteed <b>cost</b> <b>savings.</b> For this group, the total estimated <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> for the reporting periods addressed were $ 95. 7 million, total reported <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were $ 96. 8 million, and total guaranteed <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were $ 92. 1 million.

On the basis of site energy, estimated savings for those projects for the previous year totaled 5. 371 million MMBtu, and reported savings were 5. 374 million MMBtu, just over 100 % of the estimated energy savings.
