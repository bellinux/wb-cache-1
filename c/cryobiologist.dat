Some <b>cryobiologists</b> are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full vitrification (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, tissues, and organs.

25|$|For {{red blood}} cells, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100°C per second), whereas for stem cells the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1°C per minute). Cryoprotectants, such as {{dimethyl}} sulfoxide and glycerol, {{are used to}} protect cells from freezing. A variety of cell types are protected by 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. <b>Cryobiologists</b> attempt to optimize cryoprotectant concentration (minimizing both ice formation and toxicity) and cooling rate.

50|$|Conventional cryoprotectants are glycols (alcohols {{containing}} {{at least}} two hydroxyl groups), such as ethylene glycol , propylene glycol and glycerol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as automobile antifreeze; while propylene glycol {{has been used to}} reduce ice formation in ice cream. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is also regarded as a conventional cryoprotectant. Glycerol and DMSO have been used for decades by <b>cryobiologists</b> to reduce ice formation in sperm, oocytes, and embryos that are cold-preserved in liquid nitrogen. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a practice that involves conventional cryoprotectants to store genetic material with the intention of future revival. Trehalose is non-reducing sugar produced by yeasts and insects in copious amounts. Its use as a cryoprotectant in commercial systems has been patented widely.|$|R
50|$|When used at high concentrations, cryoprotectants {{can stop}} ice {{formation}} completely. Cooling and solidification without crystal formation is called vitrification. The first cryoprotectant solutions able to vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with whole organ survival {{were developed in}} the late 1990s by <b>cryobiologists</b> Gregory Fahy and Brian Wowk {{for the purpose of}} banking transplantable organs. This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and electron microscopy. No ice crystal damage was found; remaining cellular damage was due to dehydration and toxicity of the cryoprotectant solutions. Large vitrified organs tend to develop fractures during cooling, a problem worsened by the large tissue masses and very low temperatures of cryonics.|$|R

40|$|As {{suspensions}} {{of cells}} freeze, the electrolytes and other solutes {{in the external}} solution concentrate progressively, and the cells undergo osmotic dehydration if cooling is slow. The progressive concentration of solute comes about as increasing amounts of pure ice precipitate out of solution and cause the liquid-filled channels in which the cells are sequestered to dwindle in size. The consensus has been that slow freezing injury {{is related to the}} composition of the solution in these channels and not to the amount of residual liquid. The purpose of the research reported here was to test this assumption on human erythrocytes. Ordinarily, solute concentration and the amount of liquid in the unfrozen channels are inversely coupled. To vary them independently, one must vary the initial solute concentration. Two solutes were used here: NaCl and the permeating protective additive glycerol. To vary the total initial solute concentration while holding the mass ratio of glycerol to NaCl constant, we had to allow the NaCl tonicity to depart from isotonic. Specifically, human red cells were suspended in solutions with weight ratios of glycerol to NaCl of either 5. 42 or 11. 26, where the concentrations of NaCl were 0. 6, 0. 75, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, or 4. 0 times isotonic. Samples were then frozen to various subzero temperatures, which were chosen to produce various molalities of NaCl (0. 24 - 3. 30) while holding the fraction of unfrozen water constant, or conversely to produce various unfrozen fractions (0. 03 - 0. 5) while holding the molality of salt constant. (Not all combinations of these values were possible). The following general findings emerged: (a) few cells survived the freezing of greater than 90 % of the extracellular water regardless of the salt concentration in the residual unfrozen portion. (b) When the fraction of frozen water was less than 75 % the majority of the cells survived even when the salt concentration in the unfrozen portion exceeded 2 molal. (c) Salt concentration affected survival significantly only when the frozen fraction lay between 75 and 90 %. To find a major effect on survival of the fraction of water that remains unfrozen was unexpected.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Biopreservation, {{especially}} cryopreservation, of bio-samples, includeing DNA/RNA, proteins, bio-fluids, cells, {{tissues and}} organs, has attracted {{more and more}} attentions, because of its great support in clinical research and trials. The successful biopreservation of bio-samples enables the cellular therapy, drug development and diagnosis of disease. To achieve the best biopresration result, various of factors and steps need to be optimized, including selection of the optimal cryoprotective agent (CPA), successful addition of CPA, optimization of the cooling protocol, thawing of the frozen samples, removal of CPA after thawing, and others. <b>Cryobiologists</b> rely on the theoretical interpretation of bio-heat and mass transfer and novel measurement techniques to design optimal cryopreservation protocol. In this dissertation, cell confinement and manipulation devices were developed to determine the fundamental cryobiological properties of cells, and a novel across cell membrane temperature dependent mass transfer model were investigated with measurement methods proposed. Determianation of the intrinsic cryobiological characteristics of the cells is the very first steps of cryopreservation protocol optimization, which includes the cell membrane permeabilities to water and the CPA at different temperatures, the osmotically inactive cell volume, the activation energy of water/CPA transport across cell membranes, osmotic tolerance limit, sensitivity to the CPA toxicity and others. To determine these cyobiological properties, two kinds of microfluidic device are proposed and applied: a microfluidic perfusion channel and non-contact cell confinement and manipulation platform. Studying the phase contrast microscopy of cell volume excursion history when perfused with solutions is the common method to evaluate the cell membrane properties, which requires the measurement devices equiped with features as followed: (1) steadily trap cells for long time; (2) change the extracellular media cell exposed to; (3) control and monitor the extracellular media temperature and the whole cell volume excursion history can be recorded and easily analyzed. The microfluidic perfusion channel is {{used to determine the}} cell membrane transport properties of human vaginal mucosal immune cells (T cells and macrophages), because of their importance in HIV vaccine research. The cell membrane permeabilities to four different CPAs (Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol) at room temperature are measured, indicating that DMSO and propyleneglycol could be a potencial CPA options, while glycerol is not a good choice for these cells as to the slow across membrane transport of which. Though a low cost and easy to operate tool the microfuidic perfusion channel is, the challenges, like the intense images processing effort, due to the shadow from the blocker, lack of on-chip temeprature control, remain to be solved for better measurement precision and efficiency. To overcome the challenges unsolved in microfludic perfusion channel, a cell confinement and manipulation platform with instananous flow and local temperature control was developed. Numerical simulation of in-channel laminar flow coupled heat transfer was coducted to exam various heater desgins, to achieve the best temperature uniformity and heating efficiency. The fabrication protocol was developed and tested to provide the optimal device performance of the integrated microfludics. With the developed cell confinement and manipulation platform, two practices of cell membrane properties measurement were executed, with both the traditional mass transfer model under static temperatures and the originally proposed temperature dependent mass transfer model. With the assist of the numerical simulation of temperature dependent mass transfe model, the temperature profile during the measurmenet was identified and used for the estimation of activation energy. The further development vista beyond the projects covered in this dissertation was also discussed, including the integration of on-chip active cooling design, options to scale up current system, and some other applications, for instance exploring new potencial CPAs...|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSC) {{isolated}} from the peripheral blood (PBSC) are frozen and stored using the same techniques previously developed for bone marrow hematopoietic cells. 1 The general parameters include cryopreservation in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) {{and a source of}} plasma protein with or without hydroxyethylstarch (HES), 2, 3 cooling at 1 to 3 o C/minute, and storage at- 80 o C or colder. The major difference for the <b>cryobiologist</b> is the large number of cells collected during apheresis, averaging 4. 3 x 1010 in a series of patients at this center, that complicates cryopreservation of PBSC. Cryopreservation of cells at the concentrations frequently used for bone marrow could result in volumes in excess of 400 ml for each collection. Infusion-related toxicities appear {{to be related to the}} amount of DMSO infused. 4 The maximal tolerated dose of dimethylsulfoxide is not known for humans.
