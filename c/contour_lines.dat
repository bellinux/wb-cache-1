5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> indicating a peak versus <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
40|$|The <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of 2 D scalar field in scientific visualization. A new method for <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> extraction is presented in this paper. Unlike the existing methods, the <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> is extracted in image space. In order to accelerate root-finding procedure, Bezier clipping and subdivision algorithm are used in the proposed method. Cross scan-line algorithm is adopted to overcome sample insufficiency problem. The implementation results show that the proposed method can extract <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> in the pixel level accurately and fast.

Introduction The <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> extraction {{is one of the}} main techniques to describe the feature of 2 D scalar field. The field is generally defined either as analytical function or on some given grid points. The former form can be converted as the later form through sampling on grid points.

The <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> points that cross a wall are not considered in the computation of the weighting function, since directions to points behind a wall should not be favored.|$|R
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (<b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of <b>contour</b> <b>lines.</b> Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the influence of the <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> position on the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) parameters and on the diagnostic capacity of the system. METHODS: Thirty subjects with clinical diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma and 30 healthy subjects were recruited. For each patient only one eye was randomly chosen. All optic nerve heads (ONH) were analysed with HRT. An operator drew the right <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> in all the considered images, while a second user increased and decreased radius size of 0. 05 and 0. 1 mm, recalculating each time all the HRT parameters. Five different disc area subgroups were obtained and for each subgroup discriminant formulas were applied. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision were considered for each subgroup. RESULTS: Among the HRT parameters, rim area was the most sensitive to the <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> position changes when the radius variation was greater than ± 0. 1 mm. For most of the HRT parameters, the differences between subjects with glaucoma and control group did not significantly change when the disc area increased or decreased. Highest diagnostic capacity was observed for Mikelberg and Mardin formulas when the <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> was narrowed, while the cup shape measure value had the best diagnostic capacity when the <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> was larger. CONCLUSIONS: When the disc area was modified, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic capacity of discriminant formulas changed according to the ONH size; however, in the glaucoma clinic, small errors (within ± 0. 05 mm) in <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> position did not significantly influence the final HRT diagnostic capacity. © Wichtig Editore, 2009...|$|R

25|$|Writing {{systems are}} {{distinguished}} from other possible symbolic communication systems in that a writing system is always associated {{with at least}} one spoken language. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols for male and female, are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as numerals and the ampersand, are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.|$|E
