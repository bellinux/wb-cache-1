In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC.

Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Seasons {{video game}} series was {{originally}} produced by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Interactive in 2002), with Natsume handling the English translation and distribution in North America. The series debuted in Japan on August 9, 1996 with , which later {{was released in}} the North American and PAL regions as Harvest Moon. Story of Seasons {{is a series of}} farm simulation/role-playing video games where the main objective is to maintain a farm over a period of time, tending the crops and livestock throughout the seasons, while befriending the nearby townsfolk and getting married in some games. Story of Seasons titles have been released on numerous different video game consoles and handheld game consoles. Several titles have been re-released on multiple platforms as special editions which include an updated gameplay. Fourteen spin-off titles have been released, featuring related elements. One of these titles, , was released to mark the 10th anniversary of the Story of Seasons series. One reason the Story of Seasons series has remained popular is because of the unchanged <b>core</b> <b>system</b> of the games. According to Yasuhiro Wada, Story of Seasons lead designer, it has been the development team's response to the audience's requests which have allowed the series to maintain its popularity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the 2001, China {{carried out}} the {{drilling}} techniques research and developed conventional and wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> for oceanic gas hydrate exploration. The <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> was used for pilot testing in the hole. The test successfully demonstrated {{the operation of the}} wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system.</b> Since 2001, Institute of Exploration Techniques made significant progress on gas hydrate drilling and coring. In 2005, China started research on the drilling <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> and drilling techniques for its application to the permafrost gas hydrate. In the 2008, first testing of drilling and coring with the new wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> for the permafrost gas hydrate in Qing-Tibet Plateau, Qilian Mountain, above sea level of 4200 m was conducted to collect gas hydrate samples from 130 m to 400 m depth [...] In order to confirm the presence of gas hydrate, drilling and coring continued in 2009 and 2010, and additional gas hydrate samples were acquired and tested in the laboratory. In order to use the gas hydrate resource, additional testing of the gas hydrate in the permafrost was conducted with depressurization and reservoir heating in September, 2011. During this testing, electro-magnetic, solar energy and vapor heating methods were used, and the reservoir pressure was decreased by the submarine pump by bringing the subsurface water to the surface. The testing was considered successful. The pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system,</b> the drilling and the production processes and the results are described in the paper...|$|R

25|$|In systems {{prior to}} PowerPC G3-based systems, {{significant}} {{parts of the}} system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial purpose {{of this is to}} avoid using up the limited storage of floppy disks on system support, given that the early Macs have no hard disk (only one model of Mac was ever actually bootable using the ROM alone, the 1991 Mac Classic model). This architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or command-line mode: boot time errors, such as finding no functioning disk drives, are communicated to the user graphically, usually with an icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of Death or a series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of the time, which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black background, and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse, for input. To provide such niceties at a low level, early Mac OS depends on <b>core</b> <b>system</b> software in ROM on the motherboard, which also ensure that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected ROMs from Apple) can run Mac OS.|$|E
