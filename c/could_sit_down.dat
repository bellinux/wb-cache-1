25|$|The {{technological}} innovations of the 19th century {{had opened the}} possibility of rapid circumnavigation and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869â€“70 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: {{the completion of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad in America (1869), the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the Suez Canal (1869). It was another notable mark in the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think I <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am--I {{certainly}} am," [...] {{answered the}} little man sorrowfully; [...] "but {{it was the only}} thing I <b>could</b> do. <b>Sit</b> <b>down,</b> please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{artist was}} indeed free {{to indulge in}} a little meditation; but he had {{stumbled}} in the dark on landing, and bruised his shins, so he <b>could</b> only <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on a rock and rub them and feel miserable.|$|R
60|$|They {{followed}} the Yellow Hen into the house, which Aunt Em declared was neat as a pin. They <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> because all Billina's chairs were roosting-poles made of silver; {{so they had}} to stand while the hen fussily showed them her treasures.|$|R
500|$|By 7:30 a.m., head chef Fessaguet {{had decided}} on the day's lunch menu, {{estimated}} the number of diners La Caravelle would have and ordered the provisions for it. [...] An hour later, the fresh vegetables were being peeled and sliced and the various sauces were on the stoves. The restaurant's pastry chef began {{his work on the}} various pastries and desserts for the day's lunch; the lunch preparations were completed and the kitchen staff <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for lunch. By noon, the waiters had donned their uniforms and the prepared food was on silver trays on a kitchen table. [...] At 12:45, the orders for the day's luncheon guests began coming into the kitchen; by 2 p.m., 92 patrons had been served.|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Atlanta, King {{attended}} Booker T. Washington High School. He {{became known}} for his public speaking ability and {{was part of the}} school's debate team. King became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal in 1942 when he was 13. During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia. Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> King initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he was [...] "the angriest I have ever been in my life." [...] A precocious student, he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.|$|E
2500|$|Cameron {{enrolled}} at Fullerton College, a two-year community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched to English, then dropped {{out before the}} start of the fall 1974 semester. Next, he worked several jobs, including as a truck driver, writing when he had time. During this period he taught himself about special effects: [...] "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology. That way I <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and read it, and if they'd let me photocopy it, I would. If not, I'd make notes." ...|$|E
60|$|Bold, however, {{felt that}} he <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> at ease with Mr Harding and his {{daughter}} after what had passed, and therefore excused himself with much awkward apology; and merely raising his hat and bowing as he passed Eleanor and the pony chair, left her in disappointed amazement at his departure.|$|R
60|$|The bald {{announcement}} at once plunged {{us into a}} {{fever of}} excitement, and next morning we set sail for England. Soon we came {{within sight of the}} white cliffs of Albion. Mary <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for a moment, so hot was she to see her child. She paced the deck in uncontrollable agitation.|$|R
5000|$|Wilmer {{also notes}} [...] What really amazed me was his energy. His work program was exhausting; yet he <b>could</b> just <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{in a chair}} and close his eyes for a short time, then walk {{straight}} onto the set and act a long scene perfectly despite the enormous burden he carried of being producer, director, and leading man.|$|R
2500|$|The Tsarevich {{was less}} than a month shy of his fourteenth {{birthday}} when he was murdered on 17 July 1918 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The assassination was carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the murder, the family was told to get up and get dressed {{in the middle of the}} night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, [...] "terrified," [...] before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. [...] "Nothing seemed to work," [...] wrote Yurovsky later. [...] "Though injured, he continued to live." [...] Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich's torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head, and he fell silent. Rumors of Alexei's survival began to circulate when the bodies of his family and the royal servants were located. Alexei's was missing, along with that of one of his sisters (generally thought to be Maria or Anastasia). As a result of this, there have been people who have pretended to be the Tsarevich; these people are Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia. The missing bodies were said to have been cremated, though scientists believe it would have been impossible to completely cremate the bodies given the short amount of time and the materials the killing squad had to work with. Numerous searches of the forest surrounding Yekaterinburg up until 2007 failed to turn up the cremation site or the remains of Alexei and his sister.|$|E
60|$|HILLMAN (with {{an attempt}} at conciliation). I know if we <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and talk this thing out with you, Mr. Pindar, you'd see it reasonable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she. [...] "You {{might make}} him one. Think how pleased {{he would be}} with it. Then he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with you, and you could both be {{splitting}} together." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{about the}} room were grouped other mother-of-pearl couches, not raised {{like that of the}} queen, and upon each of these {{reclined}} a pretty mermaid. They <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> as we do, Trot readily understood, because of their tails; but they rested very gracefully upon the couches with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy folds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel I {{ought to}} go up," [...] he said, {{regarding}} the ground. He looked up and met the Lady Mary's eyes. [...] "I want to go up," [...] he said, and smiled whitely at her. He turned towards Banghurst. [...] "If I <b>could</b> just <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> somewhere for a moment {{out of the crowd}} and sun--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The idea of {{dressing}} one's self, or doing {{anything in the}} way of action, in that state of love, was a little too ridiculous. I <b>could</b> only <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> before my fire, biting the key of my carpet-bag, and think of the captivating, girlish, bright-eyed lovely Dora. What a form she had, what a face she had, what a graceful, variable, enchanting manner! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{not even}} a gulch we <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in," [...] he said. [...] "We'll have to go on; and I'm not sorry, for one reason. There's not much time to spare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{always in}} vain to talk {{philosophy}} to you, Barney, so good night t'ye. Oh, dear me, I wish I <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down!</b> but there's no alternative,--either bolt upright or quite flat." ...|$|E
60|$|The early Monday morning train {{which brought}} Verrian up to town was so very early that he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to breakfast {{with his mother}} only a little later than their usual hour.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the moon}} rose; but this only made matters worse. The shadows had been still before; now they moved and danced, {{as the night}} wind tossed the boughs. The old house, with its dreadful secret, was white and clear against the dark {{background}} of spruces. We were woefully tired, but we <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> because the grass was reeking with dew.|$|R
60|$|Then {{witnesses}} were called. The {{first of these}} was the fourth man whom Irene had set upon me, who alone escaped with a wound behind. This fellow, having been carried into court, for he could not walk, leaned over a bar, for he <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> and told his story. When he had finished I was allowed to examine him.|$|R
6000|$|The boat {{returned}} to the lugger, the sails were filled again and, at four next afternoon, the Henriette passed Handfast Point, {{and headed for the}} entrance to Poole harbour. As the distance from home lessened, Patsey's excitement increased hourly. She <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for a minute, quietly, but walked restlessly up and down the deck. She had scarcely spoken when Leigh said, after a long look through the telescope: ...|$|R
60|$|Joe gave little heed to his friend's cupboard. He {{was looking}} around for some spot where the princess <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> without danger of soiling her garments, but failed to find that for which he sought.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt that}} he, not these matter-of-fact crowds, was alien. He was hungry and tired. There was nothing heroic to do--just go hungry. There {{was no place}} where he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> The benches of the tiny hard-trodden parks were full.... If he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> if he could rest one little hour, {{he would be able}} to go and find freight-yards, where there would be the clean clang of bells and rattle of trucks instead of gabbled Yiddish. Then he would ride out into the country, away from the {{brooding}} shadows of this town, where there were no separable faces, but only a fog of ceaselessly moving crowds....|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{why should}} I stay here? Do {{you think that}} I <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to table with you all after that? I will ask your brother to explain my going; I shall find him in his room. Good-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{considered}} the terms on which I could afford just now to sell Mr. Braham the acting copyright in London of an entirely new piece for the St. James's Theatre; and I <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to write one in a single act of about one hour long, under a hundred pounds. For a new piece in two acts, {{a hundred and fifty}} pounds would be the sum I should require.|$|R
60|$|When Estelle reappeared, dressed {{once more}} like a little French lady (at least {{in the eyes of}} those who were not {{particular}} about fit), she found a little feast being prepared for her out of the provisions sent by the consuls; but she <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to it till Arthur, escorted by several of the Marabout's suite, had carried a share both of the food and the garments to Lanty and Victorine.|$|R
60|$|Two cases, {{facing each}} other at an {{interval}} sufficiently wide for a small person to enter, formed an apartment four or five feet square; and, although {{it was impossible for}} Carrots even to stand erect, he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> or lie <b>down</b> in a most comfortable fashion.|$|R
60|$|Jerry's head ached so much {{he could}} think only with difficulty, {{and he decided to}} return to Nellie Ardell's apartments. It was a hard walk, and he was glad when the place was reached and he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; I haven't been {{conscious}} of myself all winter." [...] He {{looked at his}} brown English gaiters and smiled. [...] "It's all behind me now. I believe I <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and think of all that--those months before we sailed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are not {{as clear}} as one would wish, so father told me," [...] {{answered}} Dick. He gave a long sigh. [...] "Too bad! And just when we thought the Stanhopes and the Lanings <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and enjoy all that fortune." ...|$|E
60|$|All of {{the company}} save Dickey and Johnny seated {{themselves}} at the table, and began to make a hearty but hurried meal. Johnny stood up in a careful manner, and got along very well, but poor Dickey <b>could</b> neither <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> nor help himself. He made one or two vain efforts {{to pick up a}} biscuit from the table, but his armor would not permit, and he was about to lean back against the wall in helpless indignation, when Mrs. Green noticed him.|$|R
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} there were seven days of {{darkness}}. During the first three days, one who wished to arise from sitting could do so, {{and the one who}} wished to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>could</b> do so. Concerning these days [...] says: [...] "And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; and they did not see one another." [...] During the last three days, one who sat could not stand up, one who stood <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> and one who was lying down could not rise upright. Concerning these days [...] says: [...] "neither rose any from his place for three days." ...|$|R
