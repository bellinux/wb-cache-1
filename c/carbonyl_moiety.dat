Acidity of the hydroxyl proton at the terminus of the vinyl group in ascorbic acid is more comparable to a typical carboxylic acid than an alcohol because two major resonance structures stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base of ascorbic acid (center and right structures in last image), analogous to the two resonance structures that stabilize the negative charge on the anion that results from removal of a proton from a simple carboxylic acid (cf. first image).|$|E
5000|$|Though the Cram and Felkin-Anh models {{differ in}} the conformers {{considered}} and other assumptions, they both attempt to explain the same basic phenomenon: the preferential addition of a nucleophile to the most sterically favored face of a <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moiety.</b> However, many examples exist of reactions that display stereoselectivity opposite of what is predicted by the basic tenets of the Cram and Felkin-Anh models. Although both of the models include attempts to explain these reversals, the products obtained are still referred to as [...] "anti-Felkin" [...] products. One {{of the most common}} examples of altered asymmetric induction selectivity requires an α-carbon substituted with a component with Lewis base character (i.e. O, N, S, P substituents). In this situation, if a Lewis acid such as Al-iPr2 or Zn2+ is introduced, a bidentate chelation effect can be observed. This locks the carbonyl and the Lewis base substituent in an eclipsed conformation, and the nucleophile will then attack from the side with the smallest free α-carbon substituent. [...] If the chelating R group is identified as the largest, this will result in an [...] "anti-Felkin" [...] product.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hydrogen}} bond {{is a specific}} dipole where a hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge (δ+) to due a neighboring electronegative atom or functional group. Hydrogen bonds are amongst the strong intermolecular interactions know other than ion-dipole interactions. For intermolecular {{hydrogen bond}}s the δ+ hydrogen interacts with a δ- on an adjacent molecule. Examples of molecular solids that hydrogen bond are water, amino acids, and acetic acid. For acetic acid, the hydrogen (δ+) on the alcohol moiety of the carboxylic acid hydrogen bonds with other the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moiety</b> (δ-) of the carboxylic on the adjacent molecule. This hydrogen bond leads a string of acetic acid molecules hydrogen bonding to minimize free energy. These strings of acetic acid molecules then stack together to build solids.A halogen bond is when an electronegative halide participates in a noncovalent interaction with a less electronegative atom on an adjacent molecule. [...] Examples of molecular solids that halogen bond are hexachlorobenzene and a cocrystal of bromine 1,4-dioxane. For the second example, the δ- bromine atom in the diatomic bromine molecule is aligning with the less electronegative oxygen in the 1,4-dioxane. The oxygen {{in this case is}} viewed as δ+ compared to the bromine atom. This coordination results in a chain-like organization that stack into 2D and then 3D.|$|E

We obtained {{information on the}} CCL phase transition following the thermal evolution (310 - 70 K) of the IR spectrum of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moieties</b> of phospholipids in the frequency range 4225 - 4550 cm(- 1). Furthermore, we simultaneously followed the thermal evolution of the water association band, which gave information {{on the behavior of}} the surrounding water-saccharide matrix. The analysis revealed a small sub-band of the water association band present in CCL but not in cholate-free liposomes, the thermal evolution of which is tightly coupled to that of the spectrum of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moieties</b> of phospholipids. We suggest that this band arises from water molecules, which are inserted within the lipidic structure, in the region located at the border between the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic moieties of phospholipids in the presence of cholic acid. Such water molecules could be responsible for the peculiar flexibility and hydrophilicity of CCL. Following Giuffrida et al. (J. Phys. Chem.

In this work {{the effect of the}} silanol-to-amine ratio on the aldol condensation of 4 -nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone is investigated in a range from 0 to 2. 4. Irrespective of the amine density, identical, moderate turnover frequencies are obtained if the silica exclusively has amines on its surface. The turnover frequency increases with increasing silanol-to-amine ratio until an upper limit is reached at a silanol-to-amine ratio of 1. 7. At this upper limit the turnover frequency is a factor 5 higher than the turnover frequencies obtained with the monofunctional amine-based catalysts. This increase is ascribed to hydrogen-bridge interactions between the silanols and the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moiety</b> of the reactants that provoke a more easy interaction between the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>moiety</b> and the amine as required for the aldol condensation. The observation that higher values than one for the silanol-to-amine ratio are required is rationalized by computer simulations.
