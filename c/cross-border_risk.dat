40|$|Countries' {{concerns}} {{about the value of}} their currency have been studied and documented extensively in the literature. Capital controls can be - and often are - used as a tool to manage exchange rate fluctuations. This paper investigates whether countries can benefit from using such a tool. We develop a welfare-based analysis of whether (or, in fact, how) countries should tax international borrowing. Our results suggest that restricting international capital flows through the use of these taxes can be beneficial for individual countries, although it would limit cross-border pooling of risk. The reason is because, while consumption risk-pooling is important, individual countries also care about domestic output fluctuations. Moreover, the results show that countries decide to restrict the international flow of capital exactly when this flow is crucial to ensure <b>cross-border</b> <b>risk</b> sharing. Our findings point to the possibility of costly capital control wars and thus to significant gains from international policy coordination...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of the financial crisis}} back in 2007 exposed a series of deficiencies in the way the European mechanisms functioned, highlighting the incomplete policy design of the EMU (Economic and Monetary Union). Thus, it became evident that financial integration, financial stability and national responsibility for crisis prevention and management could not be all simultaneously fulfilled. Several factors have been responsible for the deepening of the financial crisis effects in the EU (European Union) /EZ (Euro Zone), namely the one-size fits all monetary policy and the absence of a fiscal institution counterpart to the ECB (European Central Bank), the EZ governance focused on rules-based prevention with limited scope for crisis management, lax banking supervisory standards, the absence of <b>cross-border</b> <b>risk</b> sharing mechanisms and bank nationalism, and the lack of political leadership. Given these flaws, the aims of the EBU (European Banking Union) would largely be twofold: * To strengthen the single market for financial services by ensuring a level playing field for banks. This would require a competitively neutral financial supervision across the EZ (and ideally across the EU). * To break the vicious circle between sovereigns and banks, thus reversing the process of financial fragmentation.

40|$|Nowadays, {{agri-food}} {{chains are}} more global {{than ever and}} are characterized by increased imports and exports and global sourcing of products, resulting in increased <b>cross-border</b> transaction <b>risks.</b> The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the typical risks regarding agri-food supply chains involved in cross-border transactions and to assess their importance as perceived by agri-food managers. The analysis takes into consideration four different agrifood value chains (meat, grain, olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits). Following an explorative approach and a qualitative technique, a series of face to face in-depth interviews was conducted. Results indicate that risk perception may be quite different across countries, value chains, tiers of the supply chain, as well as across respondents. The prevalence of Market dynamics risks was pointed out in most of the interviews, yielding the impression that many operators identify the market as the most difficult environment. Differences in risk perception between fresh produce (fruit/vegetables and meat) and processed food chains (grain and olive oil) are probably interrelated to the different degree of integration within these supply chains, the different level of standardization achieved and the different causes of risks that are inherent to the nature of the product.

40|$|Governmental {{authorities}} {{are known for}} zealously protecting their ‘turf’, which is usually seen to inhibit them from coordinating their work with rival authorities. In the EU, however, national regulators often engage proactively in coordination with sister authorities in the forum of EU regulatory bodies. This is puzzling if one considers that this means that national authorities actively support EU bodies –potential rivals- in their work. The thesis hence examines what determines the coordinative behaviour of national regulators at a transnational level in the European Union. It analyses the engagement of UK and German authorities in transnational coordination in the regulatory regimes of drug safety, maritime safety, food safety, and banking supervision. The study demonstrates that coordinative behaviour is driven by strategic considerations of national regulators that want their coordination activities to add value to their own work, rather than being determined by their professional norms, functional pressures or the ‘shadow of hierarchy’, as stipulated in the EU governance literature. Their strategic assessments of whether they are getting something out of transnational activities are informed by the interpretative filters of the social relations they are embedded in at the domestic level. They are also fundamentally shaped by the institutional frameworks provided by the tasks of the EU regulatory bodies in which national regulators come together. This explains variation of coordination patterns across policy areas and national regulators, which the EU governance literature has not accounted for. The argument of the thesis implies that the engagement with coordination {{can be linked to}} an enhancement –rather than a loss– of bureaucratic autonomy. By identifying the determinants of coordinative behaviour at a transnational level, this thesis hence also seeks to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} conditions in which transnational administration functions.

We find that a shock that affects the liabilities of one country may undermine the stability of the entire financial system. Particularly, a shock wiping out 25 % (35 %) of US (UK) cross-border liabilities against non-US (non-UK) banks could lead to bank contagion eroding at least 94 % (45 %) of the recipient countries' banking assets. We also find that since 2006 a shock to Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia affects most countries. Our simulations also reveal that the 'speed of propagation of contagion' has increased in recent years resulting in a higher number of directly exposed banking systems. Finally, we find that contagion is more widespread in geographical proximities. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) International Review of Finance Ltd. 2010. ...|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{decision}} facing retirement savers is how {{to allocate}} their savings across broad investment classes, including the choice of how to divide investments between domestic and foreign holdings. This study investigates whether cross-border investing would have been advantageous to U. S. retirement savers in the past. The analysis is based on empirical evidence on asset returns in eight industrialized countries that have reliable historical time series data on stock and government bond returns. The goal is to determine whether U. S. workers would have obtained higher expected retirement incomes, with smaller risk of catastrophic investment shortfalls, if they invested part of their retirement savings in foreign stocks and bonds without hedging the currency risks of their overseas investments. The results show that workers could indeed have increased their expected pensions if they included unhedged foreign assets in their portfolio and if the portfolio were selected from one on the efficient frontier. Under many naïve investing strategies, however, increasing workers’ allocation to overseas assets will not {{reduce the risk of}} catastrophically poor investment performance.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} optimal design of banking {{supervision}} {{in the presence}} of cross-border lending. Cross-border lending could imply that an individual bank failure in one country could trigger negative spillover effects in another country. Such cross-border contagion effects {{could turn out to be}} important in the EU because national banking problems could easily spread via the highly integrated interbank market. I show that if benevolent supervisors are accountable only to their own jurisdiction, they will not take cross-border contagion effects into account. Supervisors with such a national mandate fail to implement the optimum from a supranational perspective. In consequence, the probability of a bank failure will be inefficiently high. Against the background of this result, I argue in favor of institutionalizing an EU ”Supervisory Coordination Authority” to which national supervisors are accountable. banking supervision, systemic <b>risk,</b> <b>cross-border</b> contagion...|$|R

However, the recent turmoils in the major financial centers in USA, China, etc. raise the question about the possible transmission of the global shocks to the CEECs stock markets despite the low degree of financial integration. The main research questions are: can the spillover effect transmit from the major stock markets on the CEECs stock markets and what type of shocks cause the <b>cross-border</b> contagion <b>risk</b> transmission to the CEECs stock markets? The objective of this study – to identify the transmission of global shocks through stock markets channel in the CEECs.

The empirical {{results of this study suggest}} that the highest degree of global and regional integration of the stock markets was observed in Poland's, Czech Republic's, and Hungary's stock markets that can be explained by higher development level of these stock markets comparing to other CEECs.

40|$|The {{global economy}} faces {{a number of}} {{critical}} challenges ranging from climate change to <b>cross-border</b> health <b>risks</b> to natural-resource scarcities. Many of these so-called global commons problems carry grave risks to {{economic growth in the}} developing world and to the livelihoods and welfare of their people. Climate change is the classic example. Despite the risks involved, donor governments have funded programs addressing global challenges such as climate change at far lower levels than traditional programs of country-based development assistance. The prospects for dealing with such global challenges will depend at least in part on new collective financing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine four categories of existing resource-mobilization options, including (1) transportation levies; (2) currency and financial transaction taxes; (3) capitalization of IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs); and (4) the sale, mobilization, or capitalization of IMF gold. In the end, we recommend that willing governments utilize a modest portion of their existing SDR allocations to capitalize a third-party financing entity. This entity would offer bonds on international capital markets backed by its SDR reserves. The proceeds would back private investment in climate-mitigation projects in developing countries that might otherwise lack adequate financing. This approach could mobilize up to $ 75 billion at little or not budgetary cost for contributing governments. Any limited budgetary costs could be offset by using excess proceeds from recent IMF gold sales. In our view, capitalizing a small portion of existing global assets - SDRs with a small back-up reserve of the income from gold already sold - to finance programs that deal with global public goods and bads makes eminent sense. global public goods, fiancing, climate change, IMF...|$|R

The paper begins by outlining the regulatory challenges resulting from the globalization of securities markets and describing the evolution of the international regulatory regime.

It analyzes the rulemaking process in the United States and elsewhere, considering the various actors and organizations involved in that process — from national regulatory agencies to international standard-setting bodies to multinational regulatory networks.

30|$|The {{population}} of the African continent was estimated at 1.033 billion in 2013 and as growing {{at a rate of}} 2 – 4 % per annum (WPR 2015). The growth rate in SADC averaged 2.6 % per annum from 2001 to 2011 with a total population in 2011 of 281 million (SADC 2011). The southern African states do not have a long or rich history of collaboration in terms of disaster risk management (DRM), regardless of common <b>cross-border</b> characteristics of <b>risks</b> and disasters. The absence of a standard collaborative framework that can be employed in the management of risks, as well as for response and recovery from hazards and disasters (for example, fires, epidemics, floods, earthquakes, chemical explosions), provided the impetus for this research. The objective is to present and argue for an institutional model for collaborative DRM in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Within this context, the article outlines a possible institutional model and working arrangements that can be developed to ensure collaborative DRM in the SADC. The study is motivated by the recognition of the fact that regional systems of DRM are an essential element of global DRM governance, complementing governance efforts at the national and global levels (Van Niekerk 2015). The article is a contribution to enhancing DRM and reduction in the SADC and elsewhere by outlining an institutional model for collaborative DRM within the established international relations theoretical context. This is motivated by the consideration of hazards and disasters, as with development and climate change response, as phenomena that cannot be confined to national boundaries, necessitating the promotion of multinational arrangements for DRM and reduction. It is against this backdrop that the theory of international relations, through neoliberal institutionalism, was chosen to provide a theoretical frame of reference.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{statelessness}} in Kuwait between 1959 and 2009. The population of Kuwait includes over 100, 000 biduns, or stateless/paperless people, representing 10 % of the nationals. With their origins in the tribes of Northern Arabia, they are undistinguishable from Kuwaitis but have failed to obtain nationality. Despite {{their role in the}} construction of the modern state, the biduns were classified as 'illegal migrants' in 1986. By highlighting the transnational foundations of the Kuwaiti society, this research argues that the persistence of statelessness is part of the dynamics of transnational or non-state actors in the region. Statelessness resulted from a conflict over naturalisation: Kuwaiti Arab nationalists sought support among Arab migrants, whereas the ruling family used the tribes and their transnational solidarity networks to enlarge its legitimacy basis. Biduns could mobilise <b>cross-border</b> resources that <b>risked</b> upsetting the balance of Kuwaiti society. The thesis broadens the International Relations definition of transnational actors to include solidarity networks as 'non-institutionalised' non-state actors. It challenges the liberal view that considers transnationalism, in its 'institutionalised' form, as the inevitable result of increasing global integration, arguing that states engage in a two-way process with non-state actors. This research is based on fieldwork conducted between 2005 and 2008 in Kuwait. Press archives, starting in 1972, were used in order to capture the terms of the internal debate. Further material was drawn from repeated semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including individual stories of biduns. These primary sources were complemented by the findings of international human rights organisations. While contributing to the understanding of hidden transnational actors, this thesis adds a critical perspective in emerging Gulf studies. By labelling biduns as 'illegal migrants', Gulf monarchies have sought to portray themselves as facing the common challenge of migration while preserving their international reputation on which their security depends...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{linkages}} between volatility of interest rate swaps (hereafter, IRS) and macroeconomic <b>risk,</b> <b>cross-border</b> linkages of swap markets from two-factor volatility models, {{and the influence of}} three additional risk factors on swap spreads. In order to investigate these, the thesis presents three empirical research essays that all revolve around a common theme: volatility and risk modelling in interest rate swaps. First research essay, presented in Chapter 3, explores whether and how the volatility of swap yield curves is related to macroeconomic risk. The methodology in this essay is based on a recent Spline-GARCH model, multivariate regression, principal component analysis and Granger causality. The empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of daily data for the period between 1987 and 2010 from three major swap markets namely, Japan, the UK and the US. The empirical analysis reveals two important findings. First, using “low-frequency” volatility extracted from aggregate volatility shocks of the three swap markets the analysis suggests that this low-frequency IRS volatility has strong and (mostly) positive association with most of the macroeconomic risk proxies. This relationship between the macroeconomic risks and IRS volatility varies slightly across the different swap maturities but is robust to alternative volatility specifications, namely C-GARCH model and model-free realized volatility. This finding is fairly consistent with the argument that the greater the macroeconomic risk the greater is the use of derivative instruments to hedge or speculate. Second, to explore the dynamic interaction including lead-lag relationship, the study finds that it is the low-frequency (IRS) volatility that Granger causes most of the macroeconomic risk proxies. This finding is, nonetheless, consistent with the argument that, as forward looking instrument, IRS has predictive power to forecast the changes in macroeconomic risk. Motivated by these findings, an empirical analysis is done on reverse regression in which macroeconomic risk proxies and their principal components are regressed on low-frequency volatility of swaps. The findings are encouraging for those who would like to use swaps in predicting macroeconomic risk. Second research essay, presented in Chapter 4, explores whether the observed relationship between macroeconomic risk proxies and volatility of swap market can be extended to investigate the cross-border linkages of swap markets. The mixed and inconclusive evidence on volatility transmission and swap market integration motivated this essay to investigate this issue from different approach. In particular, using the decomposed volatilities (long-term and short-term), this essay examines the financial integration and volatility linkages of three major swap markets, namely Japan, the UK and the US. To facilitate empirical investigation, a step-by-step approach is proposed in measuring volatility transmission and financial linkages including dynamic correlations, contagion and causality of volatility components. These findings have important implications for portfolio risk diversifications in swaps. Third research essay, presented in Chapter 5, exploits the puzzle with regard to determinants and components of swap spreads. This essay argues that in addition to default risk and liquidity risk, three risk factors namely, business cycle risk, market skewness risk and correlation risk contain significant information in determining the swap spreads. Using the GMM approach, this essay provides empirical support of risk premia related to these three risk factors in addition to default and liquidity risk premia. The results are robust to sub-sample analysis...|$|R
