40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of systemic risk in Credit Structured Finance (CSF). Risk measurement issues loomed large during the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, as the massive, unprecedented number of downgrades of AAA senior bond tranches inflicted severe losses on banks, calling into question the credibility of Rating Agencies. I discuss {{the limits of the}} standard risk frameworks in CSF (Gaussian, Single Risk Factor Model; GSRFM), popular among market participants. If implemented in a ‘static’ fashion, GSRFM can substantially underprice risk at times of stress. I introduce a simple ‘dynamic’ version of GSRFM that captures the impact of large systemic shocks (e. g. financial meltdown) for the value of CSF bonds (ABS, <b>CDO,</b> <b>CLO,</b> etc.). I argue that a proper 'dynamic' modeling of systemic risk is crucial for gauging the exposure to default contagion (‘correlation risk’). Two policy implications are drawn from a 'dynamic' GSRFM: (i) when rating CSF deals, Agencies should disclose additional risk information (e. g. the expected losses under stressed scenarios; asset correlation estimates); and (ii) a ‘point-in-time’ approach to rating CSF bonds is more appropriate than a ‘through-the-cycle’ approach. structured finance, systemic risk, credit risk measures, bond pricing...|$|E

We find that investment banks {{are more likely to}} lead syndicated loans to riskier borrowers than commercial banks. Investment banks also tend to participate more often in the riskier tranches of multi-facility loans. Though non-bank entities like finance companies, insurance companies, investment companies, <b>CLOs,</b> <b>CDOs,</b> mutual funds, and prime funds rarely play lead roles in syndications, they also participate more frequently in riskier, multi-facility syndicated credits. Maskara (2010) argues that multi-facility syndicated loans derive economic value from the participation of lender groups with varying levels of risk aversion. We provide empirical support for his theoretical arguments...|$|R
