5|$|The 2007 bearer <b>cheque</b> {{series was}} first issued on 2 March 2007 with the {{introduction}} of $5000 and $50000 cheques to act as intermediary denominations between the $1000, $10000 and $100000 cheques respectively. As inflation intensified, the $200000 bearer <b>cheque</b> was also introduced on 1 August 2007, followed by the joint introduction of the $250000, $500000, and $750000 denominations on 20 December 2007.

5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded.

Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 <b>cheque</b> was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer <b>Cheque</b> would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro <b>Cheque</b> being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E
