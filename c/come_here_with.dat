25|$|The {{history of}} the temple is not known clearly. Different {{communities}} put {{their own version of}} it. There are many beliefs regarding the antiquity and history of this splendid, miraculous and extraordinary idol. This idol was in Lanka. It was very much worshipped in the times Bhagawan Munisuvrat Swami. Ramchandraji took it to Ayodhya. Then it was in Ujjain. In course of time, it appeared under a banyan tree outside Vatpradnagar. It was worshipped for some years. Again it appeared under a tree at distance of one kilometer from the village. This is the Chief Tirth of Jains in the Mevad State. A fair is held here every year on the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Fagan. With all the five fingers, people worship God here with Saffron. They give a gift of saffron to God. Bhils, know God by the name of ‘Kalababa’. Non - Jain devotees <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> faith. Since centuries, there is a custom of giving saffron to God as a gift. Sometimes so much saffron is plastered on God, that God looks saffron - colored. People, therefore, call God Kesariyanath.|$|E

2500|$|Goodloe came to Meadville {{even though}} he knew it was {{unlikely}} he would be ordained by a Unitarian church, because none would accept a black minister.

It's not an Israeli combat force or an anti-terror force, as they {{would like it to}} be. As long as we don't serve their direct interests, they are going to denigrate it as much as they can."

2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay Pentru legionari ("For the Legionaries" [...] or [...] "For My Legionaries").|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 restoration, the Tower Bar was reconfigured {{to have a more}} turn of {{the century}} ambience. [...] After the Tower Bar opened in 2006, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that it had become one of the trendiest in Los Angeles: [...] "On a recent night at the intimate Tower Bar, Jennifer Aniston dines 10 feet away from Joaquin Phoenix and white-coated waiters weave between tables like players in a Broadway musical. A $155 bottle of Pinot Noir is uncorked here, chilled oysters delivered there and a bow given every now and then." [...] The New York Times also reported on the transformation of the hotel: [...] "The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer and Barbara Walters), complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a Friday night in mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside." [...] Other celebrities visiting the Tower Bar include Sean Penn, Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Jennifer Lopez. [...] Dmitri Dmitrov, a 60-year-old Macedonian immigrant with Rudolph Valentino hair, is the Tower Bar's maître d’hôtel. [...] Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing. [...] In the six years since Klein, following a suggestion from the designer Tom Ford, rescued Dmitrov from a fading career at drearily elegant places like a local Russian restaurant that featured a harpist, ice swans and a caviar menu, he has become a Hollywood institution. [...] In February 2007, the New York Post reported that the hotel's front desk manager was nearly fired when Lindsay Lohan tried to book three rooms. [...] Owner Jeff Klein was reportedly overheard yelling at the manager, [...] "If that piece of trailer trash so much as enters my driveway, you are fired. She can't <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> all my chic guests, she'll ruin the place." [...] Also in 2007, Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs showed up with an entourage to attend a Golden Globes party, and was told his name was not on the list. When Combs was reported to have become [...] "verbally abusive," [...] owner Jeff Klein personally asked Combs to leave. [...] When Klein said he would call the police if Combs did not leave, the New York Post reported that Combs was heard shouting, [...] "Just try it - I'll {{spend the rest of my}} life hunting you down!" [...] In February 2009, Vanity Fair hosted its Oscar party at the Sunset Tower.|$|E
