5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read <b>cursive</b> <b>writing,</b> he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and <b>cursive</b> <b>writing,</b> used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E

25|$|The Met's {{collection}} of Islamic {{art is not}} confined strictly to religious art, though {{a significant number of}} the objects in the Islamic collection were originally created for religious use or as decorative elements in mosques. Much of the 12,000 strong collection consists of secular items, including ceramics and textiles, from Islamic cultures ranging from Spain to North Africa to Central Asia. The Islamic Art department's {{collection of}} miniature paintings from Iran and Mughal India are a highlight of the collection. Calligraphy both religious and secular is well represented in the Islamic Art department, from the official decrees of Suleiman the Magnificent to a number of Qur'an manuscripts reflecting different periods and styles of calligraphy. Modern calligraphic artists also used a word or phrase to convey a direct message, or they created compositions from the shapes of Arabic words. Others incorporated indecipherable <b>cursive</b> <b>writing</b> within the body of the work to evoke the illusion of writing.|$|E
500|$|The pyramidion has two inscriptions, {{neither of}} which is {{regarded}} as a memorial stone.

500|$|The four {{faces of}} the {{external}} aluminum apex all bear inscriptions in <b>cursive</b> <b>writing</b> (Snell Round hand), which are incised into the aluminum. The apex was inscribed on site after it was delivered. Most inscriptions are the original 1884 inscriptions, except for the top three lines on the east face which were added in 1934. A wide gold-plated copper band that held eight lightning rods covered most of the inscriptions from 1885 until it was removed and discarded in 2013. The inscriptions that it covered were damaged and are now illegible. Only the top four and bottom two lines of the north face, {{the first and last}} lines of the west face, the top four lines of the south face, and the top three lines of the east face are still legible. Even though the inscriptions are no longer covered, no attempt was made to repair them when the apex was accessible in 2013. The following table shows legible inscriptions in [...] and illegible inscriptions in [...] No colors appear on the actual apex. The inscriptions occupy the lower portions of triangles, thus the inscribed upper lines are necessarily shorter than some lower lines.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most often}} {{associated}} with the People's Republic of China, character simplification predates the 1949 communist victory. Caoshu, <b>cursive</b> <b>written</b> text, almost always includes character simplification, and simplified forms have always existed in print, albeit not for the most formal works. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, {{and a large number}} of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the Communist Party of China) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the Latin script, and spawned such inventions as the Gwoyeu Romatzyh.|$|R

2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see {{the style of}} No Natural Religion as more confident than that of All Religions. They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in All Religions contrasted with the italic, <b>cursive</b> <b>writing</b> on several plates of No Natural Religion; [...] "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch." [...] Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of No Natural Religion, a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other {{evidence for}} an earlier dating of All Religions {{is that many of}} the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in No Natural Religion. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in All Religions but not No Natural Religion suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extensive {{investigation of the}} use of trigraphs for on-line cursive handwriting recognition based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Trigraphs are context dependent HMMs representing a single written character in its left and right context, similar to triphones in speech recognition. Looking at the great success of triphones in continuous speech recognition ([1]-[3]), it was always a challenging and open question, if the introduction of trigraphs could lead to substantially improved handwriting recognition systems. The results of this investigation are indeed extremely encouraging: The introduction of suitable trigraphs led to a 50 % relative error reduction for a writer dependent 1000 word handwriting recognition system, and to a 35 % relative error reduction for the same system with an extended 30000 word vocabulary for cursive handwriting recognition. 1.
