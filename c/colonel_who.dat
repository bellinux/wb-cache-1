5|$|Grey's troops marched {{around the}} head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks. The {{following}} day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly <b>colonel</b> <b>who</b> was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a withering volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.|$|E

5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls.

5|$|In 1982, the {{original}} autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 {{of the set}} were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne, Australia, for the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth. After a concert at the festival, a woman presented the manuscripts in a plastic shopping bag to the conductor Christopher Hogwood. The Haydn scholar Georg Feder, who was visiting Australia at the time, then verified the scores to be the authentic original manuscripts of the four quartets. It emerged that the woman who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them, through successive generations, from an English <b>colonel</b> <b>who</b> had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand. The colonel's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn's pen. Until the 1982 discovery, publishers had been working from incomplete or non-original editions.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in the Virungas {{were very}} harsh for the RPF. At an {{altitude}} of , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude cold climate. Kagame {{spent the next two}} months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu <b>colonel</b> <b>who</b> had previously worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation; the appointment of Kanyarengwe was motivated by a desire to appear inclusive, but most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Rank and file numbers grew steadily, with volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldiers' conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population. Certain offences, such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.|$|E

5000|$|The term senior colonel is {{also used}} informally and unofficially in the U.S. {{military}} for <b>colonels</b> <b>who</b> have either been selected for promotion to brigadier general but not actually promoted yet, or for veteran <b>colonels</b> <b>who</b> are particularly experienced and influential. The Argentine Army makes a similar use of the term, though {{in this case it}} is an official distinction (Coronel Mayor) with its own rank insignia (a single red-trimmed golden sun instead of the three golden suns of a regular colonel). In the Portuguese Army, a colonel selected but still waiting for promotion to a general officer rank is officially designated coronel tirocinado (literally meaning [...] "practiced colonel" [...] in Portuguese), having a proper rank insignia (the rank stripes of colonel added with a general rank silver star).|$|R
