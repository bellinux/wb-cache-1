50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>{{stonechat}}</b> (Saxicola dacotiae), {{also known}} as the Fuerteventura stonechat or Fuerteventura chat, and formerly known as the Canary Islands chat due to its once widespread distribution on the Canary Islands. It is a sedentary resident found only on the island of Fuerteventura where it is known as the Caldereta.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Siberian {{stonechat}} and <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> it constitutes {{eastern and western}} representatives of an Eurasian lineage; the Asian and European populations separated during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5-2.5 mya, and Fuerteventura was colonised by western European or northwest African birds somewhat later in the Early Pleistocene, about 1-2 mya.|$|E
40|$|Background: Latitudinal {{variation}} in avian life histories falls along a slow-fast pace of life continuum: tropical species produce small clutches, {{but have a}} high survival probability, while in temperate species the opposite pattern is found. This study investigated whether differential investment into reproduction and survival of tropical and temperate species is paralleled by differences in the secretion of the vertebrate hormone corticosterone (CORT). Depending on circulating concentrations, CORT can both act as a metabolic (low to medium levels) and a stress hormone (high levels) and, thereby, influence reproductive decisions. Baseline and stress-induced CORT was measured across sequential stages of the breeding season in males and females of closely related taxa of stonechats (Saxicola spp) from a wide distribution area. We compared stonechats from 13 sites, representing <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> European temperate and East African tropical areas. Stonechats are highly seasonal breeders at all these sites, but vary between tropical and temperate regions with regard to reproductive investment and presumably also survival. Results: In accordance with life-history theory, during parental stages, post-capture (baseline) CORT was overall lower in tropical than in temperate stonechats. However, during mating stages, tropical males had elevated post-capture (baseline) CORT concentrations, which {{did not differ from}} those of temperate males. Female and male mates of a pair showed correlated levels of post-capture CORT when sampled after simulated territorial intrusions. In contrast to the hypothesis that species with low reproduction and high annual survival should be more risk-sensitive, tropical stonechats had lower stress-induced CORT concentrations than temperate stonechats. We also found relatively high post-capture (baseline) and stress-induced CORT concentrations, in slow-paced <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechats.</b> Conclusions: Our data support and refine the view that baseline CORT facilitates energetically demanding activities in males and females and reflects investment into reproduction. Low parental workload was associated with lower post-capture (baseline) CORT as expected for a slow pace of life in tropical species. On a finer resolution, however, this tropical-temperate contrast did not generally hold. Post-capture (baseline) CORT was higher during mating stages in particular in tropical males, possibly to support the energetic needs of mate-guarding. Counter to predictions based on life history theory, our data do not confirm the hypothesis that long-lived tropical populations have higher stress-induced CORT concentrations than short-lived temperate populations. Instead, in the predator-rich tropical environments of African stonechats, a dampened stress response during parental stages may increase survival probabilities of young. Overall our data further support an association between life history and baseline CORT, but challenge the role of stress-induced CORT as a mediator of tropical-temperate {{variation in}} life history...|$|R

5000|$|This <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> is now {{considered}} Endangered, as construction, mainly tourism-related, encroaches upon the best habitat (Illera et al., 2006). The population is hard to estimate, but most probably between 1300 and 1700 mature birds (BirdLife International 2004), and recognisably in decline. In particular, heavy land clearance on the Jandía peninsula is isolating the local subpopulation and making it vulnerable to adverse effects of small population size.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was classed {{as a member of}} the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher in the Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called chats. It was included in the [...] "common stonechat" [...] (Saxicola torquata), but it is quite distinct; it is likely to be an insular derivative of ancestral European stonechats that colonised the islands some 1-2 mya, during the Early Pleistocene (Wink et al. 2002).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> is {{intermediate}} {{in appearance}} between the European stonechat and the whinchat; its body {{size and shape}} reminiscent of a lithe European robin. Its upperparts are generally coloured as the whinchat, but more contrasting, dark brown with a blackish head and back streaks. It has a purer white supercilium reaching behind the eye and white neck sides, and a light orangey-chestnut breast becoming duller and paler on the underside towards the whitish belly. The rump and tail are dark, the latter with a white pattern visible in flight. There is also a white wing band. The female {{is similar to a}} washed-out version of the male, with a brown, black-streaked head and no white neck patches.|$|E

50|$|This <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> {{is highly}} {{faithful}} to good habitat. Its main occurrence and only breeding habitat is in barrancos, ravines and rocky slopes with fairly sparse (30-50% open ground), shrubby vegetation (Illera et al., 2006). Although they sometimes also venture into {{more open and}} arid areas such as malpaís (old lava flows with resurgent vegetation), the species prefers copses of palm trees and shrubs (Álamo Tavío 1975) such as the aulaga Launaea arborescens, the saltwort Salsola vermiculata and the boxthorn Lycium intricatum (BirdLife International 2004). Males sing from exposed perches, from where the birds also like to hunt insects on the wing; occasionally, they venture into fields or gardens for feeding. Completely open habitat appears only to be utilised when gathering food for their young (BirdLife International 2004).|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. —New {{data on the}} population, {{distribution}} and habitat preferences of the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> Saxicola dacotiae. This paper updates estimates of population size, {{distribution and}} habitat preferences of the endemic <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> Saxicola dacotiae {{on the basis of}} data gathered across their whole distribution range, the island of Fuerteventura. We surveyed 1, 462 0. 5 -km line transects during the reproductive seasons in 2005 and 2006, distributed across the whole island. Results were used to estimate population size using two methods: stratified estimates of mean densities and sum of estimated abundances across strata, and sum of estimations of abundance in 1 km x 1 km UTM squares based on statistical models built by boosted regression trees (BRT). In both methods we accounted for the effects of bird detectability in transects. Overall, 490 mature individuals were recorded. The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> preferred high, steep terrain (particularly above 20 % slope and 200 m a. s. l.) and selected negatively the lower and flatter areas comprising most of the island. These habitats were occupied, however, albeit at low density. The highest average densities sampled per habitat (up to 43 birds/km 2) were registered on steep area...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{selection}} by the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>stonechat</b> (Saxicola dacotiae), an endemic bird of Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain), was {{studied in}} a two-tier habitat approach of microhabitat and landscape. Birds spent all their foraging time on stony fields and barrancos, avoiding lava and sandy fields. Slopes with high shrub coverage {{were the best}} predictors of occurrence of Canary Islands stonechats at a landscape scale. At a microhabitat scale, slopes with large boulders were selected, whilst those covered with small stones were clearly avoided. Birds used those places that supported the largest invertebrate densities. Two main threats to the species are: (1) grazing pressure (which could increase the process of desertification and decrease the availability of food), and (2) the destruction or alteration of optimal habitats, mainly owing {{to an increase in}} tourism development. Future management eorts should include the protection of large patches of stony field and barranco habitats, with slopes having at least 50 % of shrub cover and large boulders. In addition, rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the maximum level of goat grazing for maintaining thes...|$|E
