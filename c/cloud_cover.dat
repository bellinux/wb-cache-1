5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is {{such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clouds</b> <b>cover</b> {{observations}} are performed by visual inspection which determines {{the fraction of}} the sky that is overcast. However, visual observation of <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> is a very subjective method, and can vary significantly among observers. This study examined the variability in <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> over the city of São Paulo between 1961 and 2013, using <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> fraction data observed at the weather station operated by IAG / USP. The study also used two techniques based on visible radiance data observed by the GOES- 10 satellite in order to indirectly estimate <b>clouds</b> <b>cover.</b> In order to ensure consistency, the estimated and observed cloudiness was compared with the clearness index, which is the ratio between the total solar radiation observed at the weather station and the incoming solar irradiation {{at the top of}} atmosphere. The study found consistency between the various databases that showed similar behavior in all of the seasons of the year. The largest cloudiness values occurred in the summer and lowest in the winter...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|Despite the low precipitation, Patagonia is cloudy, {{with the}} mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> ranging from 50% in eastern parts of Neuquén Province and {{northeast}} Río Negro Province to 70% in Tierra del Fuego Province; {{the region has}} one of the highest percentages of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> in Argentina. In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than inland areas. Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine). The southernmost islands receive some of the lowest average annual sunshine hours in the world.|$|E

5|$|Scientifically, the light-observation {{experiments}} were unsuccessful, as both target locations {{were covered by}} thick <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted the lights of a city {{a few hundred miles}} from Durban. The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems. Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of orthostatic hypotension caused by sitting inside the cramped capsule for hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} {{solar energy}} {{that could be}} used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} {{interpretations of the}} phenomenon of broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs are presented and a resolution is suggested. One interpretation is that the BAL <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> most of the sky as viewed from the quasar; this implies that BALQSOs are an usual subset of the general class of QSOs. The other interpretation suggests that the BAL <b>clouds</b> <b>cover</b> about 10 percent of the sky as viewed from the quasar; thus, most, if not all, quasars have BAL clouds. It is argued that neither extreme is correct, and that quasars {{have a range of}} BAL covering factors. An analysis is presented of emission-line strengths in BALQSOs relative to those of non-BALQSOs...|$|R
