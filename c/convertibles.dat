Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble <b>convertibles</b> of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} <b>convertibles</b> from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E

The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume {{and the end of}} the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion <b>Convertibles</b> quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size <b>convertibles</b> from 1971 to 1976.|$|E

Please note the Packaged <b>Convertibles</b> (e.g. Siemens 17 DE000A1G0WA1) are {{not considered to be}} synthetics since the issuer would not be an Investment Bank: they would only act as underwriter.

25|$|Takeover paper. <b>Convertibles</b> have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic <b>convertibles</b> accounted for about 80pct of the European <b>convertibles</b> market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers.

The tax advantage is greatest with mandatory <b>convertibles.</b> Effectively a high tax-paying shareholder can benefit from the company securitising gross future income on the convertible, income which it can offset against taxable profits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first empirical analysis of firms' rationale for issuing putable <b>convertible</b> bonds in the literature. We distinguish between three possible rationales for {{the issuance of}} putable convertibles: 1) the risk-shifting hypothesis, 2) the asymmetric information hypothesis, and 3) the tax savings hypothesis. The results of our empirical analysis can be summarized as follows. First, putable <b>convertible</b> issuers are larger, less risky firms, having larger cash flows, smaller growth opportunities, and lower bankruptcy probabilities as compared to ordinary <b>convertible</b> issuers. Second, putable <b>convertible</b> issuers have lower preissue market valuations, more favorable announcement effects, and better postissue operating performance when compared to ordinary <b>convertible</b> issuers. Third, putable <b>convertible</b> issuers have better postissue long-run stock return performance as compared to ordinary <b>convertible</b> issuers. Finally, putable <b>convertible</b> issuers typically have greater tax obligations and better credit ratings than ordinary <b>convertible</b> issuers. Overall, {{the results of our}} univariate as well as multivariate analyses provide support for the asymmetric information and tax savings hypotheses, but little support for the risk-shifting hypothesis.
