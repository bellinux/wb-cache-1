5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various <b>control</b> <b>points</b> to earn points. Standard maps contain three <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> Control of these points is {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but {{control of a}} point continues until a player from another team occupies the space. The first team to reach the point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.|$|E

A player {{can do this}} in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all <b>control</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at <b>control</b> <b>points</b> referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E
5|$|Vainglory is a {{video game}} {{developed}} and published by Super Evil Megacorp for iOS and Android devices. The game is a simplified version of the PC-based MOBA genre wherein two opposing teams of three players fight to destroy the enemy base by controlling the path between the bases, which is lined by turrets and guarded by AI controlled enemy creatures. Off the path, players battle for <b>control</b> <b>points</b> that provide resources. The game was released for IOS in November 2014, after being soft-launched for over half a year, with the Android version being released in July 2015.|$|E

5000|$|In NACMO (North American) style mounted orienteering and fox Oring {{only the}} general {{vicinity}} of the <b>control</b> <b>point</b> is marked on the map.

The description sheet gives bearings from each clue to the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> In fox Oring, once in the vicinity the competitor searches for a low power beacon at the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined <b>control</b> <b>points</b> for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E
25|$|A Bézier {{curve is}} defined {{by a set of}} <b>control</b> <b>points</b> P0 through Pn, where n is called its order (n = 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc.). The first and last <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are always the end points of the curve; however, the {{intermediate}} <b>control</b> <b>points</b> (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as affine combinations, the coefficients sum to 1.|$|E
25|$|In Battlefield 2, {{players are}} divided into two {{opposing}} teams (which factions they represent is dependent upon the map). The key objective in Battlefield 2 {{is to reduce the}} opposing teams tickets. Tickets represent an army's ability to reinforce their position on the battlefield; each team has only a limited supply of tickets, and each casualty on the battlefield reduces the number of available tickets. <b>Control</b> <b>points</b> represent key points on the map, and are represented by flags. <b>Control</b> <b>points</b> are Battlefield 2s spawn points, and one team possessing a significant majority of the <b>control</b> <b>points</b> causes the other teams tickets to gradually decrease, regardless of casualties. A round ends when one team's tickets gone, the round's timer ends, or if at any point a team holds no <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> and has no soldiers alive on the battlefield (meaning they are not present in any way on the battlefield).|$|E

50|$|The Times {{reported}} the 1904 Gordon Bennett motor race {{took place in}} Germany on June 17, over 342 mi, consisting of four laps of a course in the Taunus Forest, {{in the vicinity of}} Bad Homburg. (The venue was suggested by Kaiser Wilhelm II.) From Saalburg the course ran north to Usingen, where there was a <b>control</b> <b>point</b> (for observation by course marshals), then through Grävenwiesbach to Weilburg, where there was a second <b>control</b> <b>point,</b> then past Allendorf and Obertiefenbach to Limburg. The Obertiefenbach-Limburg stage was the fastest of the event, enabling speeds of up to 150 km/h. At Limburg there was another <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> From there, the route was by way of Kirberg and Neuhof, where there was a very bad turn, then Idstein where there was another <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> It then ran through Glashütten to Königstein (a <b>control</b> <b>point),</b> then through Friedrichshof and the Oberursel <b>control</b> <b>point</b> to the Homburg <b>control</b> <b>point</b> and back to Saalburg.|$|R

25|$|The {{knot vector}} is a {{sequence}} of parameter values that determines where and how the <b>control</b> <b>points</b> affect the NURBS curve.

Each time the parameter value enters a new knot span, a new control point becomes active, while an old control point is discarded.|$|E
25|$|Bézier curves {{are widely}} used in {{computer}} graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the convex hull of its <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively.

50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>point</b> (CP, also <b>control</b> and checkpoint) is {{a marked}} {{waypoint}} used in orienteering and related {{sports such as}} rogaining and adventure racing. It {{is located in the}} competition area; marked both on an orienteering map and in the terrain; and described on a control description sheet. The <b>control</b> <b>point</b> must be identifiable on the map and on the ground. A <b>control</b> <b>point</b> has three components: a high visibility item, known as a flag or kite; an identifier, known as a control code; and a recording mechanism for contestants to record proof that they visited the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>point</b> is usually temporary, except on a permanent orienteering course.|$|R
