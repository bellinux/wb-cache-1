40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the application of numerical image measurement techniques and fundamental continuum mechanics to measurement of the large strain kinematic behaviour of prepared sugar <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse.</b> A generic, standœalone software tool was created for measuring the twoœdimensional finite strains of solidœphase historic continua, via time series of digital images from filmed experiments. This software, referred to for simplicity as Image Tensor Analysis (ITA), combines numerical image displacement measurement using the FFT direct crossœcorrelation, with the classical theory of continuum mechanics, to produce transient kinematic and material output that is concurrent with Lagrangian finite element models. The ITA software presents a new platform for data acquisition from prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse</b> experiments, as well as providing a means for proofing finite element simulations of bagasse milling. Furthermore, the accurate measurement of fibre kinematics, coupled with mechanical data, provides sufficient information for estimating parameter values within the solidœphase material model, with a reverse finite element procedure. A small series of confined flatœplaten uniaxial compression experiments were conducted and the ITA software was calibrated for the complex fibroœporous process materials, prepared sugar <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse.</b> Problems with experimental procedures were identified and a subsequent series of experiments conducted. Refined experimental practice resulted in improved initial sample homogeneity and repeatable sample deformation measurements. The ITA software was also employed in an investigation into bagasse behaviour during compression between grooved surfaces, providing insight into juice flow through the bagasse fibre blanket. A series of twoœroll milling experiments were conducted, with the aim of quantifying the deformation behaviour of prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse</b> during rolling. The experiments were inhibited by apparatus limitations, resulting in poor repetition of the deformation measurements. However, the ITA software was shown to be capable of measuring the large biaxial material strains, and solid conclusions were made in regard to the kinematic behaviour of the solidœphase fibre. It was identified that improved apparatus is required to obtain suitable ITA deformation results for direct comparison with finite element simulations of the twoœroll milling regime...|$|R

40|$|In the Australian sugar industry, {{sugar cane}} is smashed into a straw like {{material}} by hammers before being squeezed between large rollers {{to extract the}} sugar juice. The straw like material is initially called prepared <b>cane</b> and then <b>bagasse</b> as it passes through successive roller milling units. The sugar cane materials are highly compressible, have high moisture content, are fibrous, and they resemble some peat soils in both appearance and mechanical behaviour. A promising avenue to improve the performance of milling units for increased throughput and juice extraction, and to reduce costs is by modelling of the crushing process. To achieve this, it is believed necessary that milling models {{should be able to}} reproduce measured bagasse behaviour. This investigation sought to measure the mechanical (compression, shear, and volume) behaviour of prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse,</b> to identify limitations in currently used material models, and to progress towards a material model that can predict bagasse behaviour adequately. Tests were carried out using a modified direct shear test equipment and procedure at most of the large range of pressures occurring in the crushing process. The investigation included an assessment of the performance of the direct shear test for measuring bagasse behaviour. The assessment was carried out using finite element modelling. It was shown that prepared <b>cane</b> and <b>bagasse</b> exhibited critical state behavior similar to that of soils and the magnitudes of material parameters were determined. The measurements were used to identify desirable features for a bagasse material model. It was shown that currently used material models had major limitations for reproducing bagasse behaviour. A model from the soil mechanics literature was modified and shown to achieve improved reproduction while using magnitudes of material parameters that better reflected the measured values. Finally, a typical three roller mill pressure feeder configuration was modelled. The predictions and limitations were assessed by comparison to measured data from a sugar factory...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The sugar <b>cane</b> residue <b>bagasse</b> is an underutilized {{renewable}} agricultural material. Bagasse {{is generally}} grey-yellow to pale green in color.

However, wherever there is large scale production of sugarcane, there will be excess bagasse which must be disposed of by other methods such as burning, dumping, land burial, etc. Thus, an economic use of the excess bagasse could both increase the profits of the sugar mill and solve an environmental problem. In this work an attempt {{has been made to}} upgrade the value of this agricultural residue by bonding with resin to produce composites for suitable applications.
