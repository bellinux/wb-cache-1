Observation-Based Slicing (ORBS) is a language-independent slicing technique capable of slicing multi-language systems, including systems which contain (third party) binary components. A potential slice obtained through repeated statement deletion is validated by observing the behaviour of the program: if the slice and original program behave the same under the slicing criterion, the deletion is accepted. The resulting slice {{is similar to}} a dynamic slice. We evaluate five variants of ORBS on ten programs of different sizes and languages showing that it is less expensive than similar existing techniques. We also evaluate it on bash and four other systems to demonstrate feasible large-scale operation in which a parallelised ORBS needs up to 82 % less time when using four threads. The results show that an ORBS slicer is simple to construct, effective at slicing, and able to handle systems written in multiple languages without specialist analysis tools...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method for displaying {{data obtained by}} three-dimensional medical imaging, by which the position and orientation of a freely movable screen are optically tracked and used in real time to select the <b>current</b> <b>slice</b> from the data set for presentation. With this method, which we call a “freely moving in-situ medical image”, the screen and imaged data are registered to a common coordinate system in space external to the user, at adjustable scale, and are available for free exploration. The three-dimensional image data occupy empty space, as if an invisible patient is being sliced by the moving screen. A behavioral study using real computed tomography lung vessel data established {{the superiority of the}} in situ display over a control condition with the same free exploration, but displaying data on a fixed screen (ex situ), with respect to accuracy in the task of tracing along a vessel and reporting spatial relations between vessel structures.

40|$|Abstract. Contour {{extraction}} of image stacks {{is a basic}} task in medical modeling. The existing level-set methods usually suffer from some problems (e. g. serious errors around sharp features, incorrect split of topology and contour occlusions). This paper proposes a novel method of multi-constraint level-set evolution to avoid above-mentioned problems. Interpolation constraint and deviation constraint are added to evolution processin addition to existing constraints (such as edge points and areas). In order to prevent occlusions, it proposes a method of three-phase level-set evolution. The first phase obtains a rough contour according to selected edge points. The second phase applies an expanding LSE (level-set evolution). Missing edge {{points in the first}} phase are added when occlusions probably appear. In the third phase, occlusions are deleted and a refining evolution is implemented. As proved by final experiments, our method can steadily extract contours slice by slice when the shapes of previous contours (contours in the previous slice) are similar to current contours (contours in the <b>current</b> <b>slice).</b> Furthermore, there is no error propagation during the process of contour extraction...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} framework for analyzing and visualizing digital medical images. Two new segmentation methods have been developed: a probability based segmentation algorithm, and a segmentation algorithm that uses a fuzzy rule based system to generate 2 ̆ 2 similarity 2 ̆ 2 values for segmentation. A visualization software application has also been developed to effectively view and manipulate digital medical images on a desktop computer {{as well as in}} an immersive environment.;For the probabilistic segmentation algorithm, image data are first enhanced by manually setting the appropriate window center and width, and if needed a sharpening or noise removal filter is applied. To initialize the segmentation process, a user places a seed point within the object of interest and defines a search region for segmentation. Based on the pixels 2 ̆ 7 spatial and intensity properties, a probabilistic selection criterion is used to extract pixels with a high probability of belonging to the object. To facilitate the segmentation of multiple slices, an automatic seed selection algorithm was developed to keep the seeds in the object as its shape and/or location changes between consecutive slices.;The second segmentation method, a new segmentation method using a fuzzy rule based system to segment tumors in a three-dimensional CT data was also developed. To initialize the segmentation process, the user selects a region of interest (ROI) within the tumor in the first image of the CT study set. Using the ROI 2 ̆ 7 s spatial and intensity properties, fuzzy inputs are generated for use in the fuzzy rules inference system. Using a set of predefined fuzzy rules, the system generates a defuzzified output for every pixel in terms of similarity to the object. Pixels with the highest similarity values are selected as tumor. This process is automatically repeated for every subsequent slice in the CT set without further user input, as the segmented region from the previous slice is used as the ROI for the <b>current</b> <b>slice.</b> This creates a propagation of information from the previous slices, used to segment the <b>current</b> <b>slice.</b> The membership functions used during the fuzzification and defuzzification processes are adaptive to the changes in the size and pixel intensities of the current ROI. The proposed method is highly customizable to suit different needs of a user, requiring information from only a single two-dimensional image.;Segmentation results from both algorithms showed success in segmenting the tumor from seven of the ten CT datasets with less than 10...|$|R

30|$|In our approach, the {{generated}} {{curve in}} the first slice is copied to the two adjacent slices (below and upper in the cranio-caudal direction). These two slices are then copied to the next adjacent slice and so on. Thus, {{the choice of the}} first slice for manual segmentation is really important. Based on our experience, if we choose an axial slice below the liver where the peritoneum is quite smooth, then the user may put 15 control points only, which seems sufficient for the <b>current</b> <b>slice.</b> But when we slide to an axial slice close to the lungs, the curve may not perfectly fit the border of the peritoneum even if we modify the position of the 15 control points, since borders with high curvature occur close to the ribs. It thus requires the curve to have stronger local fitting capability, namely {{to increase the number of}} control point, which contradicts our design principle. On the other hand, if we put too many control points, for instance 50, the distance between control point of B-spline is very small (< 20  pixels) and it is difficult to generate a smooth curve which fit the border very well. Thus, we need to compromise the number of control point and the smoothness of the segmentation result.|$|R

The new method was used to calculate the soil slope safety factors for different values of intermediate principal stress parameter b, double shear stress parameters uτ′, and static lateral pressure coefficient K 0. The results showed that the safety factor Fs increased when b was increased; Fs first increased and then decreased when uτ′ was increased; and Fs increased when K 0 was increased. These results show that the intermediate principal stress as well as the stress state and its changes cannot be ignored during soil slope stability analysis. The slope soil characteristics and stress state should be considered to determine the unified strength theoretical parameters and static lateral pressure coefficient, maximize the potential of slope soil strength, and effectively reduce the costs of soil slope engineering...|$|R

The H. 264 compressed video is convolutionally encoded and transmitted over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Two iterative joint source-channel decoding schemes are proposed, in which slice candidates that failed semantic verification are exploited. The first proposed scheme uses soft values of bits {{produced by a}} soft-input soft-output channel decoder to generate a list of slice candidates for each slice in the compressed video sequence. These slice candidates are semantically verified to choose the best one. A new semantic checking method is proposed, which uses information from slice candidates that failed semantic verification to virtually check the <b>current</b> <b>slice</b> candidate. The second proposed scheme is built on the first one.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} semi-automatic liver segmentation method from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. We exploit level-set speed images to define an approximate initial liver shape. The first step divides a CT image into {{a set of}} discrete objects based on the gradient information, which is normalized on the speed image. The second step detects the objects belonging to the liver based on 2. 5 D shape propagation, which models the segmented liver region of the slice immediately above or below the <b>current</b> <b>slice</b> by points being narrow-band of distance from the boundary, and skeletons. In this step, manual inputs of seed points for the topmost slice, the bottommost slice of the liver, and regions that do not connect to the liver from the previous slice are required {{because there is no}} prior information for the 2. 5 D shape propagation. With this optimal estimation of the initial liver shape, our method decreases the computation time by minimizing levelset propagation, which converges at the optimal position within a fixed iteration number. Our method was validated on ten data sets and the results were compared with the manually segmented result. The average score using the comparison metrics for the accuracy evaluation was 75. The average processing time for segmenting one data set was 382 s. ...|$|R

30|$|Medical image {{perception}} tasks {{include both}} static two-dimensional (2 D) image viewing and dynamic stack viewing. Stack viewing involves a clinician quickly scrolling through {{a stack of}} 2 D images to get a three-dimensional (3 D) impression of the anatomical structure of an organ (Nakashima, Komori, Maeda, Yoshikawa, & Yokosawa, 2016). The shift from static to dynamic viewing has changed the task of medical image interpretation with a tiled set of 2 D images containing less information than a volumetric image (Krupinski et al., 2012). Medical students tend to perform worse on volumetric images than on 2 D images (Ravesloot, van der Gijp et al., 2015; Ravesloot, Van Der Schaaf et al., 2015). van der Gijp et al. (2015) showed that radiology clerks take more time, and engage in more and different cognitive processes, when interpreting volumetric images than 2 D images with Stuijfzand et al. (2016) reporting an effect of image information (i.e. 2 D or 3 D) on self-reported mental effort used to index cognitive load. 3 D volumetric image interpretation better reflects the clinical setting for inspecting brain MRI images in which the brain is separated into cross-sections or ‘slices’. Therefore, in this experiment, {{it is important to}} investigate eye-gaze behaviour in dynamic viewing and the visual search of clinicians viewing sequentially presented, dependent, medical images (Drew, Võ, Olwal et al., 2013; Nakashima et al., 2016).

Historically, studies on sexual images of women in advertising have focused on content analyses of these images and how they affect women. This study asks how sexualized imagery of women functions rhetorically {{as part of a}} branding message designed to sell products. The exemplar advertisements were chosen specifically for their sexual imagery from an earlier study by the researcher on sexual images of women in fashion advertisements found in men 2 ̆ 7 s magazines. The messages interpreted within the visuals of this study reveal a <b>current</b> <b>slice</b> of history in terms of gender and sexuality. In the case of this study the constructed 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 heteronormative view of gender, masculinity, femininity, and sexuality are what are for sale; they are the merchandise to be purchased. Women are present in the exemplar ads as an accessory to prove and support heterosexual masculinity through sex, as if to ward off any ideas that metro-sexual men may be anything but heterosexual. Though we cannot generalize beyond these five magazine ads, we can think of the exemplar ads as a small sample of contemporary culture. The narratives of these ads suggest that man continues to be the prevailing figure in terms of importance and power relative to woman, who is subordinate to man. This thesis supports prior research on women in advertising where men are more important than women, and the ads in this thesis continue to define masculinity and femininity in classic patriarchal and heterosexual terms.

40|$|The role of cystine-glutamate {{exchange}} in controlling the extracellular glutamate {{concentration in the}} central nervous system was examined by whole-cell clamping neurons in rat brain slices, and using their glutamate receptors as sensors of extracellular glutamate concentration. Applying cystine to cerebellar slices generated a membrane current in Purkinje cells which was abolished by glutamate receptor blockers. Similar cystine-evoked currents were seen in pyramidal cells of frontal cortex slices. Control experiments on non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors in enzymatically isolated Purkinje cells showed that cystine did not produce a <b>current</b> in <b>slice</b> Purkinje cells by directly activating glutamate receptors, nor by potentiating the action of background levels of glutamate on receptors. Experiments on isolated salamander Müller cells showed that cystine did not block Na+-dependent GLAST glutamate transporters (homologous to the transporters in the Bergmann glia ensheathing the Purkinje cells), nor did it block the current produced by EAAT 4 and EAAC 1 glutamate transporters in Purkinje cells. Thus the cystine-evoked current in Purkinje cells is not due to a rise in extracellular glutamate concentration caused by block of Na+-dependent uptake. The dependence of cystine-evoked current on cystine concentration in slice Purkinje cells could be fitted by a Michaelis-Menten relation with a Km of 250 μM. The Km predicted from this for cystine activating glutamate efflux is less than 140 μM, because of the non-linear dependence on glutamate concentration of the Purkinje cell current. The current evoked by 1 mM cystine was little affected by removal of extracellular chloride or addition of 1 mM furosemide (frusemide), but was potentiated by 1 mM 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (DIDS).

In the diacetylene dimer, it is shown, via laboratory studies combined with electronic structure calculations that the photodissociation of the dimer readily initiates atomic hydrogen (H) loss and atomic H transfer reactions forming two prototypes of resonantly stabilized free radicals, C 8 H 3 and C 4 H 3, respectively. In ethylamine cation, high-level ab initio calculations identify the complex dissociation pathways for the ground state CH 3 CH 2 NH 2 + radical cation at 233. 3 nm using Direct <b>current</b> (DC) <b>slice</b> imaging technique, revealing important features of the potential surface that are important in Titan 2 ̆ 7 s ion-molecule reactions. Finally, a new technique is implemented to measure the branching ratios for the reactions of state-prepared N 2 + ions with methane (CH 4), acetylene (C 2 H 2) ethylene (C 2 H 4), Hydrogen (H 2) and acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) under a rotational temperature 40 ± 5 K...|$|R
40|$|Direct <b>current</b> <b>slice</b> {{velocity}} map ion {{images of}} the HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘) products from the photoinitiated reactions of ground state Cl atoms with ethane, oxirane (c-C 2 H 4 O), and oxetane (c-C 3 H 6 O), at respective mean collision energies of 5. 5, 6. 5, and 7. 3 kcal mol- 1, were analyzed using a Legendre moment fitting procedure. The experimental method and the fitting technique were tested by comparing the derived center-of-mass (CM) frame angular scattering distribution for the HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘ = 1) products from the reaction of Cl + C 2 H 6 with those determined by Suits and co-workers from a crossed molecular beam experiment. For the Cl + c-C 2 H 4 O reaction, a broad, forward, and backward peaking CM frame angular distribution of HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘ = 2) products was determined, with an average fraction of the available energy released as product translational energy of ft, equal to 0. 52 ± 0. 18. The HCl consumes only 1 % of the available energy, and conservation arguments dictate that the radical coproduct is significantly internally excited, corresponding to an average fraction of the available energy of fint(c-C 2 H 3 O), equal to 0. 47 ± 0. 18. For the reaction of oxetane with Cl atoms, abstraction of H atoms is possible from carbon atoms from positions either α or β to the O atom. The contributions to the reaction from these two H-atom abstraction channels were estimated to be 63 and 37 %, consistent with an unbiased propensity for removal of α- and β-H atoms that are present in 2 : 1 abundance. The angular scatter of products in the CM frame is also broad and forward−backward peaking and {{is reminiscent of the}} products of the Cl + CH 3 OH and CH 3 OCH 3 reactions. The derived mean fraction of the available energy channelled into product translation is ft = 0. 54 ± 0. 12 for each of the two abstraction pathways. With only a small amount of energy in the rotation of the HCl(v‘ = 0), the remainder is accounted for by excitation of the radical coproduct internal modes, with fint(c-C 3 H 5 O) = 0. 42 ± 0. 12 for both α- and β-H abstraction. The broad product scattering in the CM frame observed for both reactions of Cl atoms with the cyclic ethers is consistent with reactive collisions over a wide range of impact parameters, as might be expected for barrierless reactions with loose transition states...|$|R
