50|$|At {{this point}} the new viral genome can either be {{packaged}} into capsids and released from the cell or they can be transported by movement proteins into an adjacent, uninfected cell. The Cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV 35S) is used in most transgenic crops to activate foreign genes which have been artificially inserted into the host plant. It is inserted into transgenic plants in a form which {{is different from that}} found when it is present in its natural Brassica plant hosts. This enables it to operate {{in a wide range of}} host-organism environments which would otherwise not be possible. CaMV contains about 8 kb double-strand DNA genome and produces spherical particles. CaMV infections are systemic, and even its DNA is infectious when inoculated on abraded plant surfaces. The CaMV genome has 8 tightly packed genes, of which only two small genes, genes II and VII, are nonessential; as a result, only these two genes can be replaced/deleted without a loss of infectivity. In addition, modified CaMV genomes exceeding the natural genome size (8024 bp) by even a few hundred bp are not packaged into virions. These two factors seriously limit the size of DNA insert <b>clonable</b> in CaMV. The bacterial dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene has been successfully cloned into the CaMV genome, in place of gene II, and has been successfully expressed in plants.|$|E

The <b>clonable</b> pre-B cell assay provides an environment adequate for the expansion and differentiation of these cells into mature, Ig-secreting, cells. Using the same methodology, we have also identified progenitors that are uncommitted to the production of a particular L chain isotype.

Those <b>clonable</b> 6 -TGr T cells were deficient in hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity and sensitive to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium, {{as in the case of}} HGPRT-deficient L 5178 Y mouse lymphoma cells. When splenic T cells of individual aging mice were assessed simultaneously for the frequency of <b>clonable</b> 6 -TGr T cells and for their ability to produce interleukin 2 or to proliferate in response to mitogenic stimulation, an inverse correlation was observed. These results indicate that the frequency of 6 -TGr T cells is more closely related to physiologic age than chronologic age.

During this process cells undergo chromosomal rearrangements as the genetic elements that make up the Ig H and L chain genes are assembled. In this study we investigate whether the progressive commitment of cells to the expression of a particular H chain and a particular L chain is associated with differential growth properties.

30|$|Determining the {{cellular}} localization of proteins of interest at nanometer resolution {{is necessary for}} elucidating their functions. Besides super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, conventional electron microscopy (EM) combined with immunolabeling or <b>clonable</b> EM tags provides a unique approach to correlate protein localization information and cellular ultrastructural information. However, there are still rare cases of such correlation in three-dimensional (3 D) spaces. Here, we developed an approach by combining the focus ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and a promising <b>clonable</b> EM tag APEX 2 (an enhanced ascorbate peroxidase 2) to determine the target protein localization within 3 D cellular ultrastructural context. We further utilized this approach to study the 3 D localization of mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins (MiD 49 / 51, Mff, Fis 1, and Mfn 2) in the cells where the target proteins were overexpressed. We found that all the target proteins were located at {{the surface of the}} mitochondrial outer membrane accompanying with mitochondrial clusters.

3000|$|<b>Clonable</b> tags {{localization}} {{has been}} achieved via metallothionein, a small cysteine-rich protein that can bind a variety of heavy metal ions with its cysteine residues (Hamer 1986; Kagi and Schaffer 1988; Mercogliano and DeRosier 2007). To avoid the possible heavy metal toxicity or its influence {{on the behavior of}} target proteins, the cells were treated with the heavy metal during EM sample preparation (Morphew et al. 2015). However, the preservation of the cellular ultrastructure and the low tolerance of metallothionein to strong chemical fixation are still mutually exclusive. Another kind of <b>clonable</b> tag is based on the oxidization of 3, 3 ′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The contrast comes from the enriched osmium tetroxide that is recruited by the osmiophilic DAB polymer. According to the type of oxidation, these tags can be further classified into photo-oxidation tags, which include fluorescent protein (FP) (Grabenbauer et al. 2005; Meißlitzer-Ruppitsch et al. 2008), resorufin arsenical hairpin (ReAsH) (Gaietta et al. 2002), and mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) (Shu et al. 2011), or they can be classified as enzyme-based oxidation tags, which include horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Connolly et al. 1994; Li et al. 2010) and enhanced ascorbate peroxidase (APEX/APEX 2) (Martell et al. 2012; Lam et al. 2015 [...]). Considering the low-yield efficiency of singlet oxygen by FPs as well as the relative low EM contrast, the usage of FPs is limited (Su et al. 2010). ReAsH works based on the reaction between tetracysteine tag and biarsenical compounds (Adams et al. 2002), which yields a problem of nonspecific labeling. Moreover, one general concern for the photo-oxidation-based tags is the inaccessibility of light in a deep tissue. Although the enzyme-based tags take advantage in dealing with thick tissue, the targeting capabilities of HRP in cytosol limit their usage (Hopkins et al. 2000). However, APEX/APEX 2 has become a promising <b>clonable</b> EM tag because it can not only preserve cellular ultrastructure well but also give excellent EM contrast, regardless of the thickness of the specimen and the localization of target proteins (Martell et al. 2012). It {{is important to note that}} APEX 2 is an A 134 P mutant of APEX with improved kinetics, thermal stability, heme binding, and resistance to high H 2 O 2 concentrations (Lam et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|Protein {{localization}} {{correlates with}} its particular function in cells or tissues. Mapping protein localization information onto their cellular ultrastructural context {{is of great}} importance for cell biology study and can be achieved via electron microscopy (EM). Generally, {{there are two ways}} to localize a target protein in EM: immune-localization and <b>clonable</b> tags localization. The EM contrast of immune-localization comes from the antibody-conjugated gold particles (De Mey et al. 1981) or quantum dots (Giepmans et al. 2005). This approach is significantly limited due to the limited efficiency of immunolabeling, the spatial hindrance of large antibodies, and the fact that the well-preserved ultrastructure and the antigen immuno-activity are always mutually exclusive.|$|E

40|$|The {{differentiating}} {{potency of}} pineal cells from 8 -day quail embryos was studied with cell culture. It {{was found that}} the differentiation of striated muscle fibres occurred abundantly in the pineal cells cultured in hypertonic culture conditions. Muscle nature of these fibres was confirmed by utilizing the antiserum against the striated muscle type creatine kinase (MM-CK). When CO 2, NAHCO 3, NaCl, KC 1 and MgCl 2 were added in hypertonic concentrations, extensive myo-genesis occurred in cultured pineal cells. Myogenesis in pineal cultures began as early as 2 days and, after 3 days in the medium with 75 mM additional NaCl, reached 100 -fold when compared with that in the isotonic medium. Muscle fibres from pineal cells in culture were similar in morphology to the skeletal muscle fibres of mesodermal origin in situ. Myogenesis of pineal cells under hypertonic conditions was ac-companied by the synthesis of a unique 56 xlO 3 Mr protein, which was not found in the intrinsic muscle cells. Clonal cell culture revealed that about 80 % of <b>clonable</b> pineal cells were myogenic precursors. Pineal cells of 8 -day quail embryos were not only myogenic but oculopotent (melanogenic and lentoidogenic) in cultures.
