5|$|The {{internal}} <b>carotid</b> arteries are {{branches of}} the common <b>carotid</b> arteries. They enter the cranium through the <b>carotid</b> canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal <b>carotid</b> arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the <b>carotid</b> sinus comes from <b>carotid</b> bodies located near the <b>carotid</b> artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, <b>carotid</b> artery dissection, involves the <b>carotid</b> arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E

5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two <b>carotid</b> arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} <b>carotid</b> arteries supply oxygenated {{blood to}} the front of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply {{blood to the}} back of the brain. These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal <b>carotid</b> artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of thyroid ima artery is also observed in other higher primates. The artery {{has been reported}} in gorillas, gibbons, macaques and gray langurs. Variations in the origin were also seen; it was found to originate from the aorta in the thorax, or the <b>carotid</b> in the neck.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the <b>carotid</b> sheath alongside the <b>carotid</b> arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The artery has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common <b>carotid,</b> the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} <b>carotid</b> artery is {{a terminal}} {{branch of the}} common <b>carotid</b> artery; it arises around {{the level of the}} fourth cervical vertebra when the common <b>carotid</b> bifurcates into this artery and its more superficial counterpart, the external <b>carotid</b> artery.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} <b>carotid</b> artery {{is a major}} paired artery, one on {{each side}} of the head and neck, in human anatomy. They arise from the common <b>carotid</b> arteries where these bifurcate into the internal and external <b>carotid</b> arteries at cervical vertebral level 3 or 4; the internal <b>carotid</b> artery supplies the brain, while the external <b>carotid</b> nourishes other portions of the head, such as face, scalp, skull, and meninges.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{external}} <b>carotid</b> artery, the internal <b>carotid</b> normally has no branches in the neck.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} <b>carotid</b> runs vertically {{upward in}} the <b>carotid</b> sheath, {{and enters the}} skull through the <b>carotid</b> canal. During this part of its course, it lies {{in front of the}} transverse processes of the upper three cervical vertebrae.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGiant-cell {{arteritis}} (GCA) is a large-vessel vasculitis usually affecting individuals over 50 years old; half {{of cases}} {{are associated with}} polymyalgia rheumatica [1]. The aorta and its large arterial branches are typically involved, particularly {{the branches of the}} external <b>carotids,</b> leading to headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness and temporal artery thickening [2]. GCA affects the aorta and its large branches in up to 83 % of cases, leading to aneurysms or arterial stenosis [3]. Internal <b>carotids</b> and vertebral arteries are less commonly involved and may be responsible for ischemic cerebrovascular events in cases of stenosis or occlusion. Strokes in GCA patients occur frequently in the first year after diagnosis and may sometimes be the initial symptom of GCA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} soft tissue image quality of a mobile cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanner with an integrated flat-panel detector. STUDY DESIGN: Eight fresh human cadavers were used in this study. For evaluation of soft tissue visualization, CBCT data sets and corresponding computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were acquired. Evaluation was performed with the help of 10 defined cervical anatomical structures. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of the scoring results of 3 examiners revealed the CBCT images to be of inferior quality regarding the visualization of most of the predefined structures. Visualization without a significant difference was found regarding the demarcation of the vertebral bodies and the pyramidal cartilages, the arteriosclerosis of the <b>carotids</b> (compared with CT), and the laryngeal skeleton (compared with MRI). Regarding arteriosclerosis of the <b>carotids</b> compared with MRI, CBCT proved to be superior.

40|$|Atherosclerosis and its {{complications}} still {{represent the}} leading cause of death in the developed countries. While autologous blood vessels may be regarded as the best solution for peripheral and coronary bypass, they are unavailable in most patients. Even though tissue engineering techniques are often applied to the development of small-diameter vascular grafts, limiting factors of this approach are represented by the lack of essential extracellular matrix proteins and/or poor biomechanical properties of the scaffolds used. Along these lines, the aim of this study was to develop a decellularization protocol for ovine <b>carotids</b> to be used as suitable small-diameter vascular grafts. Samples were treated either with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) or with Trypsin and Triton X- 100; a final nuclease digestion was performed for both protocols. Morphological analyses demonstrate complete removal of nuclei and cellular components in treated vessels, also confirmed by significant reduction in wall thickness and DNA content. Essential extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, elastin, and fibronectin are well preserved after decellularization. From a mechanical point of view, Trypsin and Triton X- 100 treated arteries show elastic modules and compliance comparable to native <b>carotids,</b> whereas the use of SDS makes samples stiffer, with a significant decrease in the compliance mean value and an increase in longitudinal and circumferential Young's modules. It is demonstrated that the treatment where Trypsin and Triton X- 100 are combined guarantees complete decellularization of <b>carotids,</b> with no significant alteration of biomechanical and structural properties, thus preserving a suitable environment for adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells...|$|R
