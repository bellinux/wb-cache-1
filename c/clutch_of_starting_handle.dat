40|$|The {{sport of}} luge {{belongs to the}} group of sports known as “sliding sports”. These sports employ special iced sliding tracks for their activities. Start plays an {{important}} role in performance in all sliding sports, the sport of luge not being an exception. What sets aside the sport of luge from other sliding sports is a way the start is performed – athletes use their arms’ and upper body strength for initial acceleration rather than legs. Since start is considered an important technical element in sliding sports, athletes spend a lot of time practicing it. Not only sliding tracks serve for this purpose, but also specially built start ramps and other constructions. Start in the sport of luge actually initiates before time counting is open – it begins at <b>start</b> <b>handles</b> already, where lugers make a start jerk; but according to International Luge Federation (FIL) rules start light barrier at luge tracks is located 5 – 10 m further ahead <b>of</b> <b>start</b> <b>handles,</b> though this distance is considerably shorter at training start ramps. After leaving the <b>start</b> <b>handles</b> athletes continue their efforts to gain higher speed by pushing off the ice surface with fingers or palms. Little had been published so far about characteristics <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in the sport of luge. The aim of this study is to investigate variability of time parameters that lugers show during this important part of a run. This would enhance understanding <b>of</b> biomechanics <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in luge that is essential for further development of sliding sports, and provide basis for following research. Data for this study were collected during two training camps with ten days interval between them, and one competitive event that took place immediately after the second training camp. Five athletes with different competitive experience participated in the study. All starts were performed on a special iced start ramp that is constructed for trainings in sliding sports. Average values of interval times typical to female lugers during starts were previously reported (Федотова и др., 2010). In this study we concentrated rather on repeatability of measured times than their average values. Measured times include total start time and interval times: times of push-offs from the ice and times of activities that contribute to initial jerk. Total start times were collected using photocells (Brower Timing Systems). Other times were calculated using motion analysis software SIMI Motion (SIMI Reality Motion Systems GmbH) from high-speed video records performed with two Basler A 602 fc cameras (Basler AG) at frequency 100 frames per second (fps), and one Casio EX-FH 20 digital camera (Casio Computer Co., Ltd.) at 210 fps. The study had shown that athletes with less competitive experience tend to show larger span of push-off times values than more experienced athletes. However, the most experienced athlete had the largest span <b>of</b> the total <b>start</b> time values among all participants...|$|R
50|$|Bachman's sparrows' {{breeding}} season typically begins in April and continues through August. The earliest date for Bachman's sparrow eggs in Florida is 14 April {{and the latest}} date is 4 August. The earliest Bachman's sparrow nest found during a study in longleaf pine habitat of South Carolina was 10 April, while the latest nest found was early in the incubation stage on 5 August. In a study of Bachman's sparrow reproduction in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, egg laying started as early as 17 April and continued until 26 August. However, 85% <b>of</b> <b>clutches</b> were <b>started</b> in May, June, or July.|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) was studied on Gull Island, Presqu'ile Provincial Park, Ontario, in 1976 and 1977. Early started clutches (comprising the majority <b>of</b> <b>clutches</b> on Gull Island) in 1977 produced more chicks per nest (2. 20 ± 0. 09) than late started clutches (0. 86 ± 0. 13) {{as a result}} of reductions in mean clutch size, hatching success and fledging success with date <b>of</b> <b>clutch</b> initiation. Seasonal changes in mean clutch size, hatching success and fledging success also resulted in early clutches, initiated at the peak <b>of</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>starts,</b> producing more chicks per nest (2. 34 ± 0. 11) than either pre-peak (2. 13 ± 0. 20) or post-peak (1. 82 ± 0. 29) clutches. Possible reasons for these trends, including the observed predominance of immature plumaged, breeding gulls in late started areas, are discussed. Clutches were deserted at night for varying lengths of time from at least 15 April until 10 May, 1977. It is suggested that this nocturnal desertion behaviour resulted in the enhancement of inter- and intra-clutch hatching synchrony in early started areas and further, that this may in part explain the existence of the behaviour in terms of its adaptive significance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup clutches for a hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate the shifting time <b>of</b> <b>clutches</b> under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the shifting time of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> shifting mechanism firstly and then disengaging a group <b>of</b> <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group <b>of</b> the <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> planetary gear mechanism lastly.
