The minimum negative chronotropic response occurred at 10 M acetylchohine whereas 10 M produced a maximum decrease in rate. The maximum heart rate effect of norepinephrine occurred with 10 -i M. The effects of fixed concen-trations of norepinephrine on the chronotropic effect of acetyhcholine and vice i’ersa were determined. Acetylcholine (10 -v, 10 and 10 M) shifted the norepinephrine curve to the right. Atropine (10 M) abolished the influence of acetylcholine.

However, it {{is unclear}} how septal activation regulates the spatial properties of hippocampal neurons. We investigated here what is the functional effect of selective-cholinergic and non-selective septal stimulation on septo-hippocampal system. We show for the first time selective activation of cholinergic cells and their differential network effect in medial septum of freely-behaving transgenic rats. Our data show that depolarization of cholinergic septal neurons evokes frequency-dependent response from the non-cholinergic septal neurons and hippocampal interneurons. Our findings provide vital evidence that <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effect</b> on septo-hippocampal axis is behavior-dependent. During the active behavioral state the activation of septal cholinergic projections is insufficient to evoke significant change in the spiking of the hippocampal neurons. The efficiency of septo-hippocampal processing during active exploration relates to the firing patterns of the non-cholinergic theta-bursting cells. Non-selective septal theta-burst stimulation resets the spiking of hippocampal theta cells, increases theta synchronization, entrains the spiking of hippocampal place cells, and tunes the spatial properties in a timing-dependent manner. The spatial properties are augmented only when the stimulation is applied in the periphery of the place field or 400 - 650 ms before the animals approached the center of the field. In summary, our data show that selective cholinergic activation triggers a robust network effect in the septo-hippocampal system during inactive behavioral state, whereas the non-cholinergic septal activation regulates hippocampal functional properties during explorative behavior. Together, our findings uncover fast septal modulation on hippocampal network and reveal how septal inputs up-regulate and down-regulate the encoding of spatial representation...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} β-adrenergic and muscarinic {{cholinergic}} {{stimulation of the}} bullfrog atrial myocyte has been developed that mimics the dose-dependent effects of isoprenaline (ISO) on the action potential duration (APD); i. e., low doses of ISO lengthen the APD, while high doses shorten the ADP. This reduction in APD is modeled {{as the result of}} (1) calcium-dependent inactivation of ICa resulting from the enhancement of ICa by ISO and (2) an enhancement of IK due to both an ISO-induced increase in the rate of activation of IK and an increase in peak action potential height. The effect of acetylcholine (ACh) is to reduce the ISO-induced increase in ICa and IK through a reduction in relative (cAMP) as well as to stimulate the ACh-sensitive K+ current IK,ACh. At low (ISO) levels or high (ACh) levels, the muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effect</b> dominates over the β-adrenergic effect. However, for a large (ISO) and a small (ACh), this pattern of changes in transmembrane currents is different; in this case the model predicts that ACh can actually increase APD. A distributed parameter model of an idealized bullfrog atrial trabeculum is developed. Individual cardiac cells are resistively coupled end to end via intercalated discs to form an idealized cylindrical cardiac strand encased in a resistive-capacitative trabecular sheath which, in turn, is located in a finite cylindrical volume conductor. A second-order implicit finite numerical integration method is used to calculate the time-varying potentials within the intracellular (Vi), interstitial (Ve), and the outer volume conductor (Vo) media of the concentric cylindrical structure. 'Reduced' cell membrane models which lack the complete complement of transmembrane currents are compared with regard to their accuracy in representing the foot, upstroke, and plateau regions of the propagated action potential in the complete model. A reduced cell membrane model should contain the sodium current INa, the calcium current ICa and the background rectifying K+ current IK 1. A cell membrane model which contains a linear background K+ current IL instead of IK 1 produces a poor approximation to the upstroke, plateau and conduction velocity of an action potential. The trabecular sheath reduces the extracellular resistance seen by the cell by shunting current away from highly resistive interstitial medium into the volume conductor medium which is of low resistance, and thereby increases conduction velocity. Finally, the effects of the cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), on both the passive and active properties of the trabeculum are investigated. The addition of ACh to the extracellular medium reduces the space constant and input resistance of the trabeculum, as well as the conduction velocity of electrical activity propagating through it...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to clarify the}} physiological character of the intestinal inner plexus, especially of the post-ganglionic inhibitory nerve fibres which were found in relation to action of nicotine on intestinal motility, and to detect the association of the plexus with intestinal movement, above all, with peristaltic movement which plays the part of carrying contents of the intestine. (1) In action of nicotine (10 ^ ～ 10 ^ g/ml) on motility of small intestine isolated from animals (dog, cat, rabbit, guinea-pig, rat and mouse) appeared a transient inhibitory response ("pre-inhibitory response") which {{was followed by a}} excitatory one, always in the rat and sometimes in the dog and rabbit but did not in the other animals. This "pre-inhibitory response" was abolished by ganglionic blocking agents (pentamethonium, C- 5; hexamethonium, C- 6; respectively 10 ^ ～ 10 ^ g/ml) and in addition, by adrenergic blocking agents (choline 2, 6 xylylether bromide, TM 10; dichloroisoproterenol, DCI; respectively 10 ^ ～ 10 ^ g/ml). This suggests that this "response" is stimulative effect of nicotine on ganglia in the inner plexus to cause excitation of post-ganglionic adrenergic nerve fibres. It may follow from this that in the rat there are two different kinds of post-ganglionic nerve fibres in the intestinal inner plexus, one being cholinergic (excitatory) nerve fibres which have been understood fully, and the other adrener-gic ("inhibitory") ones. (2) The physiological role of this "inhibitory nerve fibres" on intestinal movement was investigated electromyographically by taking, as an index, the number of "spike" discharge which has been described to correspond to the degree of intestinal activity. When a balloon in the intestinal lumen was swollen to give its wall a local distention which {{is said to be a}} factor of developing the peristaltic movement, the number of "spike" increased at the oral side and decreased or abolished at the anal side, of the most distended part of the wall. It is considered that the increase at the oral side shows an excitation of intestinal motility by <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effect</b> and the decrease at the anal side shows an inhibition by adrenergic effect, the latter effect being blocked by TM 10. Therefore, the presence of excitatory and inhibitory nerve fibres in the plexus may be associated with local reflex in the intestinal wall or with the orientation of peristaltic movement which will carry the contents. (3) Also in the caecum of the chick, both post-ganglionic excitatory and inhibitory nerve fibres were found by pursuing histologically, physiologically and pharma-cologically the same response as found in the rat, under application of nicotine. Accordingly also in the chick, the presence of both fibres may be associated with the orientation of peristaltic movement which will carry the contents. (4) Furthermore, it was found that in the chick's caecum the excitatory nerve fibres were originated exclusively from Auerbach's ganglia and the inhibitory nerve fibres from Meissner's. This is an interesting fact that has never been discovered in mammalian intestines, a fact which was demonstrated by making mechanically Auerbach's and Meissner's ganglion-free preparations of the caecum and applying nicotine to both of these preparations...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract {{constitutes the}} largest mucosal surface that is continually {{exposed to a}} wide range of antigens and potential immune stimuli including various dietary antigens and commensal bacteria. For this reason, the intestinal mucosal tissue contains the largest number of immune cells participating to an elaborate network of cells and effector molecules to defend the host from the external milieu. In order to maintain homeostasis, the immune system has developed diverse regulatory strategies including additional non-immunological actors able to control the immune response. Defects in these immunological responses can lead to intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Of note, organisms have evolved endogenous strategies in order to control immune response. The concept of an inflammatory reflex, in which the central nervous system responds to inflammatory stimuli and acts to limit inflammation, was clearly formulated by Tracey (174). This novel concept concerning the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP) proposes that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune response. This implies that a specific organ or region of the organism has its dedicated vagal innervation detecting activation of the innate immune system and providing integrated efferent vagal input to dampening the inflammatory response (174). Truthfully, vagotomy (VXG) significantly aggravated the development of septic shock and enhanced inflammation whereas electrical stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve prevented systemic inflammation (175). Moreover, our research group has provided evidence that the CAIP also modulates the intestinal immune system in a model of post-operative ileus (POI) in which the inflammation is located at the muscularis layer. In this thesis, we have investigated the participation of the neuro-endocrine factors, such as the vagus nerve and the gastrointestinal hormone, ghrelin, in the regulation of the intestinal immune system. First, we aim to better define the CAIP mechanism in the intestine. We demonstrated that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is able to dampen intestinal muscular inflammation and prevent ileus via activation of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR). We provide evidence that the vagus nerve reduces local intestinal inflammation through a circuit that differs from that previously reported in models of systemic inflammation, i. e. independent of the spleen and T cells. Indeed, cholinergic nerve fibers arising from enteric neurons innervated by the vagus nerve modulate intestinal resident muscularis macrophages expressing α 7 nAChR. We therefore conclude that resident macrophages located within the intestinal muscularis are the ultimate target cell mediating the anti-inflammatory effect of VNS in POI (Chapter 3). Taking into consideration that immune tolerance to food antigens and to intestinal microflora is essential to preserve intestinal homeostasis and prevent chronic inflammation, we hypothesized that the vagal innervation of the gut can modulate intestinal immune mucosal homeostasis and not only dampening on-going local inflammation. Our findings clearly showed that the vagus nerve is essential for the development of mucosal immune homeostasis and induction of appropriate immune response during colitis even if this mechanism is independent of α 7 nAChR. VGX impairs the ability to develop oral tolerance and results in increased severity of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis however these effects are not observed in α 7 nAChR-deficient mice. Additionally, no role for α 7 nAChR could be proven (either on transferred T cells or in the recipient mice) in T cell transfer colitis. Therefore our data indicate that α 7 AChR does not play a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effect</b> to the lamina propria but most likely other nicotinic receptors are participating to this pathway (Chapter 4). Together with the neuronal messengers able to affect the immune system, hormonal messengers have been recently discovered as potent immune-modulatory factors. Recent work suggests that the orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, has potent anti-inflammatory properties in a preclinical model of intestinal inflammation. Ghrelin is secreted predominantly from enteroendocrine cells of the stomach and acts as an appetite-regulating hormone increasing food intake and long-term regulation of body weight. Interestingly, the expression of this ghrelin receptor (GRLN-R) has been shown on innate and adaptive immune cells. However, the mechanism, by which ghrelin suppresses intestinal inflammation, is still unclear. Hence, we decided to investigate the effect of ghrelin on T cell function during colitis. In Chapter 5, we observed that the lack of ghrelin signalling in Th cells resulted in a significantly worsened colitis with increased colonic inflammation dependent on a pathological accumulation of CD 4 effector T cells in the lamina propria. In line, ghrelin directly affected proliferation of Th cells and induced apoptosis while it did not influence Th cell polarization in vitro. Our observations strongly suggest that ghrelin may significantly ameliorate experimental chronic colitis by modulating T helper effector cell function in the gut. Indeed, clinical evidence showed that ghrelin is involved in chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases in patients. Higher serum ghrelin level is associated with disease activity in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease patients. Currently, important amount of data regarding ghrelin and its contribution in modulating immune response are suggesting possible therapeutic properties of the ghrelin pathway. However more studies are required before translating this novel approach to the clinical setting in order to clarify the contribution of this hormone in regulating the colonic immune response. In conclusion, the results described in this thesis provide further insights into implications of nervous system, via vagus nerve, and hormonal molecules such as ghrelin in the modulation of intestinal immune system. Hopefully, these findings and further investigations on these counter regulatory mechanisms will provide new insights in the cross-talk between the neuro-endocrine and immune system leading to the identification of new therapeutic targets to treat intestinal immune diseases. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe main {{olfactory}} bulb {{is a critical}} relay step between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory cortex. A marked feature of the bulb is its massive innervation by cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain. In this study, we addressed the functional interaction between cholinergic inputs and intrinsic bulbar circuitry. Determining the roles of acetylcholine (ACh) requires the characterization of <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effects</b> on both neural excitability and synaptic transmission. For this purpose, we used electrophysiological techniques to localize and characterize the diverse roles of ACh in mouse {{olfactory bulb}} slices. We found that cholinergic inputs have {{a surprising number of}} target receptor populations that are expressed on three different neuronal types in the bulb. Specifically, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors excite both the output neurons of the bulb, i. e., the mitral cells, as well as interneurons located in the periglomerular regions. These nicotine-induced responses in interneurons are short lasting, whereas responses in mitral cells are long lasting. In contrast, muscarinic receptors have an inhibitory effect on the firing rate of interneurons from a deeper layer, granule cells, {{while at the same time}} they increase the degree of activity-independent transmitter release from these cells onto mitral cells. Cholinergic signaling thus was found to have multiple and opposing roles in the olfactory bulb.

In the hippocampus, where cholinergic involvement in learning and memory is particularly well documented, � 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (� 7 nAChRs) are highly expressed, but their precise ultrastructural localization has not been determined. Here, we describe the results of immunogold labeling of serial ultrathin sections through stratum radiatum of area CA 1 in the rat. Using both anti-� 7 nAChR immunolabeling and �-bungarotoxin binding, we find that � 7 nAChRs are present at nearly all synapses in CA 1 stratum radiatum, with immunolabeling present at both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements.

Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, <b>cholinergic</b> crisis-like <b>effects</b> (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|R
25|$|Abrupt {{withdrawal}} {{may lead}} to <b>cholinergic</b> rebound <b>effects,</b> severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers {{are aware of the}} symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.|$|R
40|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} is {{an ideal}} model for studying <b>cholinergic</b> <b>effects</b> on the processes of learning and memory for several rea-sons. First, deficits produced by selective lesions of the anatomi-cal structures shown to be critical for Pavlovian fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance (such as the amygdala and hippocam-pus) resemble those deficits seen in human pathological condi-tions resulting in damage to these same structures. This supports the suggestion that experimental findings on learning and memory in animal models are informative about similar pro-cesses in humans. Second, because aversive conditioning is learned rapidly, even with a single conditioning trial, the tem-poral dynamics of the underlying processes can be examined with a very fine degree of resolution. Third, the fear memories generated by aversive conditioning procedures {{tend to be very}} stable over long time periods. For example, we have observe...|$|R
