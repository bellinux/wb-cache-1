5|$|A {{white dwarf}} with only He I lines in its {{spectrum}} and an effective temperature of 15,000K <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> {{the classification of}} DB3, or, if warranted by the precision of the temperature measurement, DB3.5.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 1880, Norton {{collapsed}} at {{the corner}} of California and Dupont (now Grant) streets and died before he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> medical treatment. Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|In Iceland, {{assessment}} and evaluation of pupils is conducted internally, and is not standardised between different institutions. Pupils are given regular reports to grade their progress; however {{the way in which}} this is done varies between schools. For example, a numerical grade <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given,</b> or an oral and written assessment may be given.|$|E
5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July. Because {{of the lack of}} an {{infrastructure}} of post boxes, particularly in rural areas, letters <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> directly to the postman in person rather than delivered to post offices to be sent.|$|E
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E
5000|$|... 135 gallons (511 liters) of petrol <b>could</b> <b>be</b> carried, <b>giving</b> it a road {{range of}} {{approximately}} 120 miles (150 km).|$|R
50|$|Other {{symptomatic}} callers {{were able}} {{to speak to a}} nurse practitioner, who asked about their condition in order to recommend the best course of action. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> advice about treating the problem at home, suggesting a visit to a pharmacist, or advising an appointment with their GP, which, if in the out of hours period (when the GP surgeries <b>are</b> closed), <b>could</b> possibly <b>be</b> arranged over the phone.|$|R

5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli {{emphasized that the}} external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone could save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> separately; Spirit baptism could occur first or last in the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E
50|$|Disks <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> {{named for}} the first time. Under Apple DOS, disks <b>could</b> only <b>be</b> <b>given</b> a volume number, but Apple Pascal disk volume names <b>could</b> <b>be</b> up to seven {{characters}} in length.|$|R
50|$|In electing members, {{the voter}} <b>was</b> <b>given</b> three votes, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> all <b>given</b> to one candidate, or {{distributed}} to three candidates. This {{was intended to}} secure the representation of minorities.|$|R
50|$|As orders <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>given</b> {{verbally}} to men in extended order, the forester's bugle horn {{was adopted}} to control movements.|$|R
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|Two Supreme Court justices had {{previously}} disagreed {{on this question}} while riding circuit. In United States v. Ravara (C.C.D. Pa. 1793), an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters to a foreign minister {{with a view to}} extort money, Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit court <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> concurrent jurisdiction; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not; Judge Richard Peters, of the District of Pennsylvania, sided with Wilson, and the case continued.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

The drink is used to get her daughter ready for pageants. Shannon has responded to this criticism, saying. [...] "There are far worse things...I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> her alcohol." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|In late February–early March 1878, Louis {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Sultan as it lay in the Bosphorus during the Russo-Turkish War. He was criticised for visiting his brother, Prince Alexander, who was serving with the Russian forces, but an {{investigation}} cleared both Louis and Alexander, as well as Prince Alfred, of any wrongdoing. For {{the next two years}} Louis served on HMS Agincourt and on the Royal Yacht, HMY Osborne, but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> an active duty. On 17 February 1880 he, his father, and Tsar Alexander II witnessed an explosion at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.|$|E
5|$|Religious beliefs were {{central to}} the Kingdom of Nri. Nri oral {{tradition}} states that a bounty of yams and cocoyams <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to the eze Nri, while blessings were given in return. It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served {{as a place where}} sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E

One speculation <b>is</b> that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> the female(s) a chance to escape, but whether he is defending the female has not been documented. Another speculation {{is that he is}} highly motivated to engage whenever he sees movement on his territory, which he may be interpreting as a possible intruding male, or another female.|$|R

5|$|The Court {{regarded}} as conduct à titre de souverain Singapore's investigation of six shipwrecks {{in the vicinity}} of Pedra Branca between 1920 and 1993, its exclusive control over visits to the island, the installation of the military rebroadcast station on the island in 1977, and the proposed reclamation of land around it. Malaysia was correct in asserting that the flying of an ensign was not normally a manifestation of sovereignty, and that the difference in size between Pulau Pisang and Pedra Branca had to be recognised. Nonetheless, some weight <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to the fact that Malaysia had not requested for the Singapore ensign flying at Horsburgh Lighthouse to be taken down. The fact that Malaysia had referred to the lighthouse as a Singapore station in the 1959 and 1966 meteorological reports and had omitted it from the 1967 Malaysian report favoured Singapore's case.|$|E
5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old girl at {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick Cowper, the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. Cowper continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing as the person who had called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from Cowper, accused four local women of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E
5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E
