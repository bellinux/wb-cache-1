40|$|Interaction {{between the}} {{listener}} and their environment in a spatial auditory display {{plays an important}} role in creating better situational awareness, resolving front/back <b>and</b> up/down <b>confusions,</b> <b>and</b> improving localization. Prior studies with 6 DOF interaction suggest that using either a head tracker or a mouse-driven interface yields similar performance during a navigation and search task in a virtual auditory environment. In this paper, we present a study that compares listener performance in a virtual auditory environment under a static mode condition, and two dynamic conditions (head tracker and mouse) using orientation-only interaction. Results reveal tradeoffs among the conditions and interfaces. While the fastest response time was observed in the static mode, both dynamic conditions resulted in significantly reduced front/back <b>confusions</b> <b>and</b> improved localization accuracy. Training effects and search strategies are discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low {{cortisol}} levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised.

Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> {{ambiguity}} in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself.

When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
