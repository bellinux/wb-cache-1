Nakdong river surface water (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) = 2. 5 - 6. 3 mg l(- 1)) was utilized as the water source. The membrane system was also evaluated with respect to membrane permeability (along with flux decline) and flux recovery by chemical cleaning along with, the demonstration of pre-treatment alternative (combinations of conventional processes and microfiltration (MF) membrane) effects on NF membrane performance. Two different NF membranes, from the same manufacturer, were tested in this study: one with high permeability and low salt removal capability (ESNA I), and the other with low permeability and high salt removal capability (ESNA II). The former membrane exhibited consistent NOM removal behaviour (greater than 75 % based on DOC and stable permeabilities, when operated with pre-treatment of the MF membrane), while the latter membrane exhibited less stable performance in terms of NOM removal and permeability, even with chemical cleaning.

40|$|First-best optimal {{forest sector}} carbon policy is examined. Using a {{comprehensive}} forest sector {{model with a}} detailed carbon cycle section we show that the renewability and carbon neutrality arguments do not warrant emission free treatment of forest bioenergy. However, under the biomass stock change carbon accounting convention followed by UNFCCC and IPCC, the forest owners pay for the roundwood emissions and, to avoid double counting, the use of roundwood is treated as emission free. The bioenergy from harvest residues cannot be treated as emission free either. Their emission factors are determined through the decay time-scales specific to residue fractions and discount rate used in welfare assessment. In addition, we show that an optimal policy subsidizes the production of wood products sequestering carbon. The relative magnitude of the subsidy {{is based on the}} fraction of the carbon stored, the lifetime of the products and the discount rate. Correspondingly, the <b>carbon</b> <b>removals</b> by biomass growth are subsidized and the harvest residue generation taxed. Further, we show that the supply side policies are independent of final use of harvested timber. Numerical solution of the model shows that, although the use of wood is not emission free, it is optimal to increase the use of wood, possibly also in the energy sector. Before the wood use can be increased, the forest biomass has to be increased. This initial carbon sink speeds up the convergence to the lower steady-state atmospheric carbon stock...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Biological {{sequestration}} {{can increase}} the carbon stocks of non-atmospheric reservoirs (e. g. land and landbased products). Since this contained carbon is sequestered from, and retained outside, the atmosphere {{for a period of}} time, the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere is temporarily reduced and some radiative forcing is avoided. Carbon removal from the atmosphere and storage in the biosphere or anthroposphere, therefore, has the potential to mitigate climate change, even if the carbon storage and associated benefits might be temporary. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting (CF) are increasingly popular tools for the environmental assessment of products, that take into account their entire life cycle. There have been significant efforts to develop robust methods to account for the benefits, if any, of sequestration and temporary storage and release of biogenic carbon. However, there is still no overall consensus on the most appropriate ways of considering and quantifying it. Method This paper reviews and discusses six available methods for accounting for the potential climate impacts of carbon sequestration and temporary storage or release of biogenic carbon in LCA and CF. Several viewpoints and approaches are presented in a structured manner to help decision-makers in their selection of an option from competing approaches for dealing with timing issues, including delayed emissions of fossil carbon. Results Key issues identified are that the benefits of temporary <b>carbon</b> <b>removals</b> depend on the time horizon adopted when assessing climate change impacts and are therefore not purely science-based but include value judgments. We therefore did not recommend a preferred option out of the six alternatives presented here. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of brilliant red 3 B-A dye adsorption on dye degradation using two amorphous ribbons is investigated. The quantity of dye adsorption on Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 and Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 ribbons is 7. 60 mg/g and 0. 35 mg/g, respectively, leading to faster dye degradation by using Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 compared to Fe 73. 5 Si 13. 5 B 9 Cu 1 Nb 3 ribbons.

40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} certain moulds, being ochratoxin A (OTA) {{one of the}} most relevant. Its chemical structure is a dihydro-isocoumarin connected at the 7 -carboxy group to a molecule of L [...] phenylalanine via an amide bond. OTA contamination of wines might be a risk to consumer health, thus requiring treatments to achieve acceptable standards for human consumption [1]. According to the Regulation No. 1881 / 2006 of the European Commission, the maximum limit for OTA in wine is 2 µg/kg [2]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to know the effect of different fining agents on OTA removal, as well as their impact on white and red wine physicochemical characteristics. To evaluate their efficiency, 11 commercial fining agents (mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins) were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from white and red wines. Trials were performed in wines artificially supplemented (at a final concentration of 10 µg/L) with OTA. The most effective fining agent in removing OTA (80 %) from white wine was a commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated <b>carbon.</b> <b>Removals</b> between 10 - 30 % were obtained with potassium caseinate, yeast cell walls and pea protein. With bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan no considerable OTA removal was verified. In red wine, removals between 6 - 19 % were obtained with egg albumin, yeast cell walls, pea protein, isinglass, gelatine, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan. The most effective fining agents in removing OTA from red wine were an activated carbon (66 %) followed again by the commercial formulation (55 %), being activated carbon a well-known adsorbent of mycotoxins. These results may provide useful information for winemakers, namely for the selection of the most appropriate oenological product for OTA removal, reducing wine toxicity and simultaneously enhancing food safety and wine quality.

40|$|Forests {{contribute}} {{to climate change}} mitigation by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in biomass and other carbon pools. Additionally, since appropriate forest management can reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, {{it is important to}} estimate the magnitude of these services to include them into climate policy. We used a forest inventory stratified by canopy cover in the oak-pine forest of La Primavera Biosphere Reserve in México (30, 500 ha), to assess the potential provision of forest carbon services. Inventory results were used in combination with a Landsat image to estimate carbon stocks in arboreal biomass. Potential <b>carbon</b> <b>removals</b> were calculated from published allometric equations and models estimating tree growth rates, for enhancements in forested areas and for reforestation/afforestation. Carbon stocks estimated in arboreal biomass {{at the time of the}} inventory were 4. 16 MtCO 2 eq (3. 42 – 4. 89). The potential for further carbon sequestration and enhancement could take the level of stocks up to 9. 77 MtCO 2 eq (7. 66 – 11. 89, 95 % confidence interval); previous fires have degraded carbon stocks below their natural potential. The results present a gradient of carbon stocks for different degradation levels and are consistent with national and international estimates and previous local research. The baseline for the estimation of reduced emissions is critical for assessing the overall contribution of forests to mitigate climate change. The local baseline of emissions might be around 1 % according to historical data; however, when enhancements and reduced emissions are valuated together, a baseline of 3. 7 % is required to prevent the creation of perverse incentives favouring previously degraded areas; considering these figures for reduced emissions, the yearly carbon services provided by La Primavera, including enhancements, sequestration and reduced emissions, could be between 169. 4 ktCO 2 eq/year (134. 8 – 204. 5) and 282. 1 ktCO 2 eq/year (228. 2 – 337. 1), respectively. Over a period of 60 years, this would be equivalent to 2. 4 and 4. 1 times the magnitude of mean standing stocks at the time of the inventory. If incentive-based mechanisms are used to maintain and enhance forest carbon services and perverse incentives are to be avoided, a balanced mix of incentives and controls is needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of mycotoxins in foodstuff {{is a matter}} of concern for food safety. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain molds, being ochratoxin A (OTA) one of the most relevant. Wines can also be contaminated with these toxicants. Several authors have demonstrated the {{presence of}} mycotoxins in wine, especially ochratoxin A (OTA) [1]. Its chemical structure is a dihydro-isocoumarin connected at the 7 -carboxy group to a molecule of L [...] phenylalanine via an amide bond. As these toxicants can never be completely removed from the food chain, many countries have defined levels in food in order to attend health concerns. OTA contamination of wines might be a risk to consumer health, thus requiring treatments to achieve acceptable standards for human consumption [2]. The maximum acceptable level of OTA in wines is 2. 0 g/kg according to the Commission regulation No. 1881 / 2006 [3]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to reduce OTA to safer levels using different fining agents, as well as their impact on white wine physicochemical characteristics. To evaluate their efficiency, 11 commercial fining agents (mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins) were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from white wine. Trials (including a control without addition of a fining agent) were performed in white wine artificially supplemented with OTA (10 µg/L). OTA analysis were performed after wine fining. Wine was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and 1 mL of the supernatant was collected and added of an equal volume of acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid (78 : 20 : 2 v/v/v). Also, the solid fractions obtained after fining, were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 min), the resulting supernatant discarded, and the pellet extracted with 1 mL of the above solution and 1 mL of H 2 O. OTA analysis was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection according to Abrunhosa and Venâncio [4]. The most effective fining agent in removing OTA (80 %) from white wine was a commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated <b>carbon.</b> <b>Removals</b> between 10 - 30 % were obtained with potassium caseinate, yeast cell walls and pea protein. With bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan no considerable OTA removal was verified. Following, the effectiveness of seven commercial activated carbons was also evaluated and compared with the commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. The different activated carbons were applied at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer in order to evaluate their efficiency in reducing OTA levels. Trial and OTA analysis were performed as explained previously. The results showed that in white wine all activated carbons except one reduced 100 % of OTA. The commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon (C 8) reduced only 73 % of OTA concentration. These results may provide useful information for winemakers, namely for the selection of the most appropriate oenological product for OTA removal, reducing wine toxicity and simultaneously enhancing food safety and wine quality.

Removals and {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) were calculated along the whole forest sector, including the forest ecosystem, the industrial processing of wood and the stages of use and final disposal of forest products. The greenhouse gas balance was calculated by subtracting to the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal,</b> the fossil <b>carbon</b> emissions and the additional emissions of carbon as CH 4. Two different approaches were applied for estimating the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> in the sector: the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approach. The global greenhouse gas balance was a net <b>removal</b> of <b>carbon</b> that varied between 401 and 1033 Gg Ceq yr- 1, respectively with the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approaches. The difference between the two estimates is equivalent to the carbon exported in wood and forest products. Both forest and forest products were carbon sinks, as their stocks have been increasing. About 94 % of the total change in carbon stocks in the sector was due to forest, whereas paper was the forest product with the major contribution to the increase of carbon stocks. Fossil carbon emissions accounted for 13 % of the total carbon emissions in the sector and decreased the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> by 18 and 34 %, respectively with the atmospheric-flow and the stock-change approaches.

Analysis of response surface showed that total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> and Isophorone conversion were significantly affected (P <= 0. 01) by reaction time, temperature and their interactions, and affected (P <= 0. 05) by the square of reaction time.

In the aerobic reactor, organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> and nitrification of ammonia to mainly nitrite occurred. Three recycle-to-influent ratios from 1 to 3 were tested. The higher the recycle-to-influent ratio, the lower the concentrations of nitrogen oxides in the final effluent. <b>Carbon</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency was quite stable, whatever the ratio. However, the effect of this ratio was attenuated because of denitrification in the aerobic reactor, which increased the performances of the process. The use of sequencing batch reactors was essential to apply the configuration proposed, in order to combine denitrification and methanogenesis that require antagonistic conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{photochemical}} oxidation of 2 -chlorophenol aqueous solutions in a batch recycle photochemical reactor using ultraviolet irradiation and hydrogen peroxide was studied. Specifically, {{the effect of}} hydrogen peroxide initial concentration (0 - 10316 mg L- 1) and 2 -chlorophenol initial concentration (150 - 3000 mg L- 1) was examined. The process was attended via total organic carbon (TOC), 2 -chlorophenol, chloride ion, acetic acid, formic acid and pH measurements. The conversion of 2 -chlorophenol observed was always {{much higher than the}} corresponding total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal,</b> whereas the increase in hydrogen peroxide amount in the solution led to higher values of 2 -chlorophenol conversion and total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal.</b> Finally, the photo-Fenton reaction was applied to the oxidation of 2 -chlorophenol, leading to a higher degree of mineralization of the parent compound.
