40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{survival and}} growth of Cambodian field crickets (Teleogryllus testaceus) during captivity when fed a set of local weed species, agricultural and food industry by-products. Wild individuals were caught at two locations in Cambodia, kept in pens and fed commercial <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> until the second generation off-spring hatched. First larval stage nymphs from this generation were collected and used in a 70 -day feeding trial with one control treatment (<b>chicken</b> <b>feed)</b> and 12 experimental treatments (rice bran, cassava plant tops, water spinach, spent grain, residue from mungbean sprout production, and Alternanthera sessilis, Amaranthus spinosus, Commelina benghalensis, Cleome rutidosperma, Cleome viscosa, Boerhavia diffusa and Synedrela nodiflora). The crickets were kept in plastic cages and feed intake, weight and survival of crickets were recorded weekly. Overall survival did not differ between <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> and the experimental treatments {{with the exception of}} crickets fed B. diffusa, which had lower survival. From day 35 to day 49, survival on A. sessilis was also lower (P< 0. 05) than on <b>chicken</b> <b>feed.</b> There was no difference in weight between crickets fed <b>chicken</b> <b>feed,</b> cassava tops and C. rutidosperma. However, crickets fed A. sessilis, A. spinosus and B. diffusa weighed less than those fed <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> already at day 21. The feed conversion rate ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 9 and was ≤ 1. 9 in crickets fed <b>chicken</b> <b>feed,</b> cassava plant tops and C. rutidosperma. Thus this study shows that it is possible, using simple means, to rear Cambodian field crickets. Cassava plant tops and C. rutidosperma both have great potential as cricket feed and the other weeds, with the exception of A. sessilis, A. spinosus and B. diffusa, agricultural and food industry by-products tested, also showed potential...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Gentian violet, a {{compound}} that gained wide acceptance in the poultry {{industry as a}} mold inhibitor in feed, was tested for its activity against eight aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. In a simple nutrient medium, it completely inhibited growth of all strains at 8 Mg/ml. When <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> {{was added to the}} medium, the inhibition by the same concentration ranged from 12 to 44 % depending on the strain. Observations suggested that both the feed and the fungi were involved in the resistance conferred by <b>chicken</b> <b>feed.</b> Growth and aflatoxin production on moist rice was inhibited in one strain but not in a second strain. Inoculating autoclaved <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> of varying moisture contents with pure cultures revealed that the activity of gentian violet was better at high moisture contents than at low moisture contents approximating those found in poultry feed. It was not possible to assess the activity of gentian violet in unaltered <b>chicken</b> <b>feed.</b> Attempts failed because the formation of reproducible levels of aflatoxin could not be attained.

40|$|Abstract Since {{the amounts}} of arachidonic acid (AA) and EPA in food may have {{implications}} for human health, we investigated whether a small change in <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> influenced the blood lipid concentration in humans ingesting the chicken. Forty-six young healthy volunteers (age 20 – 29) were randomly allocated into two groups in a double-blind dietary intervention trial, involving ingestion of about 160 g chicken meat per day for 4 weeks. The ingested meat was either from <b>chickens</b> given a <b>feed</b> concentrate resembling the commercial <b>chicken</b> <b>feed,</b> containing 4 % soybean oil (SO), or the meat was from <b>chickens</b> given a <b>feed</b> where the soybean oil {{had been replaced by}} 2 % rapeseed oil plus 2 % linseed oil (RLO). Serum total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols, serum phospholipid fatty acid concentration, blood pressure, body weight and C-reactive protein were determined at baseline and post-intervention. In subjects consuming chicken meat from the RLO group there was a significantly (p < 0. 001) increased concentration of EPA in serum phospholipids, and a reduced ratio between AA and EPA. The participants that had a low% of EPA + DHA in serum phospholipids (less than 4. 6 %), all increased their% of EPA + DHA after the four week intervention period when consuming the RLO chicken. No significant response differences in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, C-reactive protein, body weight or blood pressure were observed between the groups. This trial demonstrates that a simple change in <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> can have beneficial effects on amount of EPA and the AA/EPA ratio in human serum phospholipids. </p...|$|R
40|$|A new highly {{specific}} and sensitive monoclonal antibody (MAb) to T- 2 toxin (T- 2) was produced, providing an IC 50 value of 1. 02 ng/mL and negligible cross-reactivity (CR) to other related mycotoxins. Based {{on the new}} MAb, a lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) using colloidal gold (CG) and fluorescent microspheres (FMs) as labels was proposed for T- 2. Under the optimized conditions, in rapid qualitative assay, the cut-off values of the CG-LFIA were 400 μg/kg in rice and 50 μg/L in fresh milk, and the cut-off values of the FMs-LFIA were 100 μg/kg in both rice and <b>chicken</b> <b>feed.</b> For the quantitative assay with the FMs-LFIA, the limit of detection (LOD) were 0. 23 μg/kg and 0. 41 μg/kg in rice and <b>chicken</b> <b>feed,</b> respectively, and the average recoveries ranged from 80. 2 % to 100. 8 % with the coefficient of variation (CV) below 10. 8 %. In addition, {{we found that the}} CG-LFIA could tolerate the matrix effect of fresh milk better than the FMs-LFIA, while the FMs-LFIA could tolerate the matrix effect of <b>chicken</b> <b>feed</b> better than CG-LFIA under the same experimental conditions. These results provide a certain reference for the selection of appropriate labels to establish a rapid LFIA in various biological samples...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} made {{to solve the problem}} in terms of {{irregular}} <b>chicken</b> <b>feeding</b> due to the distance of the farm owner's house and the location of the farm far away. In a day the owner of the farm can go to the location of his farm up to 4 - 5 times just to check and feed the cattle. This project has a solution to the existing problems, namely by making the mechanism of an automatic <b>chicken</b> <b>feeding</b> tool using NodeMcu Microcontroller. This microcontroller will be in contact with ultrasonic sensors that read the height of eating chicken in a <b>chicken</b> <b>feeding</b> place. Results The reading of the distance between the feed to the ultrasonic sensor will be the control for the servo to perform the opening or closing movement. The servo setting for open or closed is derived from NodeMcu which has been configured using arduino IDE. Data from the distance reading results of this ultrasonic sensor will be sent to the IOT broker, so that breeders can monitor the tool is working properly. This project proves that by utilizing Microcontroller then the existing problems can be solved well. Breeders no longer need to check and <b>feed</b> the <b>chicken</b> up to 4 - 5 times a day.
