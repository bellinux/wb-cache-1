40|$|AbstractThe role of {{anthraquinone}} (AQ) greatly {{depends on}} the nature of the cellulosic pulp during alkali refining. AQ acts in two ways; firstly penetration within the molecular chains separating them further apart leading to their decrystallisation; secondly stabilization of the polysaccharide chains. <b>Cotton</b> <b>linter</b> is known by its long macromolecular crystalline chains. The cold refining helps the swelling <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> and the penetration of AQ leads to decrystallisation of linter even at low AQ concentration (namely 0. 025 %). In comparison with paper Kraft pulp AQ does not reflect a considerable change on its characteristics, except on hot refining using higher AQ concentration (namely 0. 2 %). This is due to the nature opening structure of the paper Kraft pulp in addition to the hemicellulose content which preferentially stabilized by AQ giving a reasonable increase in the pentosan content. This is associated by improving in the reactivity towards xanthation...|$|R

50|$|Cotton paper, {{also known}} as rag paper, is made using <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> or cotton from used cloth (rags) as the primary material.

50|$|Cotton {{was first}} used {{with a mixture of}} silk to make paper called Carta Bombycina.

However, the tensile index of the cotton and keratin fiber blends was lower than the eucalyptus sheets. There was no remarkable difference in water absorbency up to 20 % keratin fiber. Above 20 % of keratin fibers the water absorbency started to decrease, which is likely attributable to the hydrophobic nature of the protein-based keratin fiber...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) made by mild acid hydrolysis from <b>cotton</b> <b>linter,</b> flax fibres and sulphite or kraft cooked wood pulp was studied and {{compared with the}} {{structure of}} the starting materials. Crystallinities and the length and the width of the cellulose crystallites were determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering and the packing and the cross-sectional shape of the microfibrils were determined by small-angle X-ray scattering. The morphological differences were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A model for the changes in microfibrillar structure between native materials, pulp and MCC samples was proposed. The results indicated that from softwood or hardwood pulp, flax cellulose and <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> MCC with very similar nanostructures were obtained with small changes in reaction conditions. The crystallinity of MCC samples was 54 - 65 %. The width and the length of the cellulose crystallites increased when MCC was made.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of regenerated cellulose}} (RC) films and capsules was investigated for their applications in oral controlled drug delivery. Regenerated cellulose films were prepared by non-solvent-mediated, phase inversion of native and depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions (methylolcellulose; cellulose dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/ paraformaldehyde solvent system) in water {{as well as by}} phase inversion of native <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions in organic non-solvents followed by thermal annealing. These films were monolithic in dry state and formed porous structures when hydrated. Irrespective of the degree of polymerization of the starting cellulose source or the use of organic non-solvents, the cellulose chain length was not significantly altered and cellulose was in an amorphous state. Flux analysis in diffusion cells, using ethanol-water mixtures as the solvent medium, indicated that the films take up solvent to form porous routes for transport of solute. The amount of solvent uptake required to form these routes was greater for films prepared from depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter.</b> Ionic and hydrophobic solutes traverse the films using the porous pathways following hydration of the film. Blended RC films were prepared by combining native and depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions in varying ratios and phase-inverting in water, followed by thermal annealing. Porosity, pore size and water uptake of the hydrated films decreased, while the length of the transport pathway (tortuosity) increased, as the fraction of depolymerized cellulose increased in the blended films. Differences in methylene blue dye adsorption on phase-inverted vs. phase-inverted and thermally annealed RC films indicated that the type of non-solvent utilized for phase-inversion does not affect the internal RC film structure during the phase-inversion process. However, as the boiling point of the non-solvent increased, the amount of irreversible polymer consolidation and formation non-swelling domains (hornification) increased during the thermal annealing process. This, in turn, led to reduced porosity and solute flux through these RC films. Two-piece cellulose capsules were fabricated by phase-inversion of methylolcellulose solutions in water using a dip-coating approach. Zero-order release rates for a number of drugs increased as their water solubility increased. The release of water soluble drugs occurred by osmotically-driven convection and diffusion through the pores in the capsule wall, while the release of moderate to poorly soluble drugs predominantly occurred by diffusion. Moreover, as the drug solubility increased, the apparent permeability of the drugs through the capsule wall decreased, which indicated that the inward osmotic flux of water reduced the diffusivity of the drug through the pores. The hydraulic permeability of the cellulose capsules was determined to be higher than for conventional ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate coated osmotic drug delivery systems, indicating that the cellulose-based capsules may be better suited for osmotic drug delivery...|$|R

50|$|Dissolving pulp, {{also called}} {{dissolving}} cellulose, is bleached wood pulp or <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> {{that has a}} high cellulose content (> 90%). It has special properties including {{a high level of}} brightness and uniform molecular-weight distribution. This pulp is manufactured for uses that require a high chemical purity, and particularly low hemicellulose content, since the chemically similar hemicellulose can interfere with subsequent processes. Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{coverings}} of the cottonseed, {{known as}} cottonseed hulls, {{are removed from}} the cotton kernels before the oil is extracted.

They require no grinding and easily mix with other feed sources. As they are easy to handle, their transportation cost is fairly low, as well. Whole cottonseed is another feed product of cottonseed used to feed livestock. It is the seed left after the separation of long fibres from cotton, and serves as a good source of cellulose for ruminants. Whole cottonseed leads to high production of milk and fat, if it is being fed to a high-producing dairy cow. It can be cost effective and provides nutrients such as high protein value of about 23%, crude fibre value of 25%, and high energy value of 20%. Whole cottonseed serves as a highly digestible feed which also improves the reproductive performance in livestock. Pima cottonseed, which is free of linters by default, and delinted cottonseed are other types of cottonseed feed products.|$|E

The technique is based on high-resolution time-resolved, capacitance measurements performed during exposure of an organic coating to humidified nitrogen.

A frequency sweep with a dielectric analyzer showed that in all cases the water has no interaction with the polymer films, except PA 6. 6.
