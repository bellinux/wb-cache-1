5000|$|Complementary bidding, {{also known}} as <b>cover</b> <b>bidding</b> or {{courtesy}} bidding, occurs {{where some of the}} bidders agree to submit bids that are intended not to be successful, so that another conspirator can win the contract. For example, the cover bids might contain prices that are uncompetitive in relation to the prices submitted by the conspirator who is designated to win the contract, or alternatively, the cover bids might contain conditions that the conspirators know will be unacceptable to the agency calling for the bids.|$|E

5000|$|The Competition Commission {{found that}} Murray & Roberts, {{along with another}} 14 South African {{construction}} companies, had “an agreement in terms of which firms which {{were not interested in}} the projects or winning the tenders, or were not allocated to a project, would submit <b>cover</b> <b>bids</b> to ensure that those interested in particular bids, won them.” [...] By this process the colluding companies were able to rig bids so that they could charge higher prices and ensure that participating colluding companies got bids that were preselected by those companies beforehand and without the government or any other third party knowing.|$|R
40|$|This paper tests {{how well}} the method {{proposed}} by Bajari and Ye (2003) performs to detect bidrigging cartels. In the case investigated in this paper, the bid-rigging cartel rigged all contracts during the collusive period, and all firms participated to the bid-rigging cartel. The two econometric tests constructed by Bajari and Ye (2003) produce {{a high number of}} false negative results: the tests do not reject the null hypothesis of competition, although they should have rejected it. A robustness analysis replicates the econometric tests on two different sub-samples, composed solely by <b>cover</b> <b>bids.</b> On the first sub-sample, both tests produce again a high number of false negative results. However, on the second sub-sample, one test performs better to detect the bidrigging cartel. The paper interprets these results, discusses alternative methods, and concludes with recommendations for competition agencies...|$|R
40|$|Non-competitive bids have {{recently}} {{become a major}} concern in both Public and Private sector construction contract auctions. Consequently, several models {{have been developed to}} help identify bidders potentially involved in collusive practices. However, most of these models require complex calculations and extensive information that is difficult to obtain. The aim {{of this paper is to}} utilize recent developments for detecting abnormal bids in capped auctions (auctions with an upper bid limit set by the auctioner) and extend them to the more conventional uncapped auctions (where no such limits are set). To accomplish this, a new method is developed for estimating the values of bid distribution supports by using the solution to what has become known as the German tank problem. The model is then demonstrated and tested on a sample of real construction bid data and shown to detect <b>cover</b> <b>bids</b> with high accuracy. This work contributes to an improved understanding of abnormal bid behavior as an aid to detecting and monitoring potential collusive bid practices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to detect bid-rigging by {{applying}} mutually reinforcing screens to a road construction procurement data set from Switzerland in which no prior information about collusion was available. The screening method is particularly suited {{to deal with the}} problem of partial collusion, i. e. collusion which does not involve all firms and/or all contracts in a specific data set, implying that many of the classical markers discussed in the corresponding literature will fail to identify bid-rigging. In addition to presenting a new screen for collusion, it is shown how benchmarks and the combination of different screens may be used to identify subsets of suspicious contracts and firms in a data set. The discussed screening method succeeds in isolating a group of “suspicious” firms exhibiting the characteristics of a local bid-rigging cartel operating with <b>cover</b> <b>bids</b> and a – more or less pronounced – bid rotation scheme. Based on these findings the Swiss Competition Commission (ComCo) decided to open an investigation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{uses the}} example of cover pricing to show a {{possible}} overreach of liability under Article 101 TFEU, in relation to arrangements deemed to have the ‘object’ of restricting competition. Cover pricing is where a bidder seeks a non-winning bid from a competitor {{so that he can}} participate in a tender process without securing the contract. The wide meaning of ‘concerted practice’ means that a potential breach of Article 101 may arise even where the party receiving the request refuses to provide a <b>cover</b> <b>bid.</b> It is important that a restriction by object (which leads to the finding of an infringement regardless of whether the practice was implemented or had any harmful effect) applies only to the most serious arrangements between undertakings. It is shown that cover pricing very rarely has any anti-competitive effect and indeed the alternative (lawful) behaviour, of openly announcing a non-intention to win the contract, is more likely to reduce competition. It is nevertheless treated as an object restriction, mainly because it involves direct communication between competitors of pricing intentions. Article 101 may therefore be unable to distinguish some arrangements with ambivalent effects from the most serious cartel practices. It is argued that a greater effects analysis is needed (either in applying the law or calculating penalties), to ensure fairness and proportionality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{most common}} {{unethical}} conduct {{evidenced by the}} contractors are <b>cover</b> pricing, <b>bid</b> cutting, poor documentation, late and short payments, subcontractors’ lack of safety ethics, unfair treatment of contractors in tender/final account negotiations, competitors’ overstatement of capacity and qualifications to secure work, competitors’ falsification of experience and qualifications and bureaucratic, government policy. To minimise the lapse of ethical issues in the industry, the suggested solutions are divided into short, medium and long term categories based on the project time frame. The findings provide useful information to stakeholders {{on how to deal}} with the pressing ethical issues confronting the Malaysian construction industry...|$|R

5000|$|The famous Presidential Issue, {{known as}} [...] "Prexies" [...] for short, {{came out in}} 1938. The series {{featured}} all 29 U.S. presidents through Calvin Coolidge, each of whom appeared in profile as a small sculptural bust. Values of 50¢ and lower were mono-colored; on the $1, $2, and $5 stamps the presidents' images were printed in black on white, surrounded by colored lettering and ornamentation. Up through the 22¢ Cleveland stamp, the denomination assigned to each president corresponds to his position in the presidential roster: thus the first president, Washington, is on the 1¢ value, the seventeenth, Andrew Johnson, is on the 17¢ value, etc. Additional stamps depict Franklin (½¢), Martha Washington (1½¢), and the White House (4½¢). Many of the values were included merely to place the presidents in proper numerical order and did not necessarily correspond to a postal rate; {{and one of the}} (difficult) games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with, for instance, a single 16¢ stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees valid during the Prexies' period of usage. Many such covers remain to be discovered; some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover an ordinary-seeming <b>cover</b> <b>bid</b> up to several hundred dollars because {{it was one of the}} sought-after solo usages. The Presidential issue remained in distribution for many years. Not until 1954 did the Post Office begin replacing its values with the stamps of a new definitive issue, the Liberty series.|$|R

40|$|An {{opinion survey}} of South African architects, {{quantity}} surveyors, engineers and contractors regarding ethical behaviour within {{the construction industry}} reveals that South African contractors seem to possess a reputation for unethical conduct.

Most construction professionals believe that the industry suffers from unfair tendering practices, as well as over-claiming and/or withholding payment for service delivery. Negligence arises mainly from poor documentation and poor workmanship. Incidents of collusive tendering encompass <b>cover</b> pricing and <b>bid</b> cutting by contractors, while the primary form of fraudulent behaviour is deceit and misinformation.

Bidding is a commodity transaction behavior, which includes two aspects, namely the invitation of bid and the submission of bid, the range of <b>bidding</b> <b>covers</b> all aspects of society, which has {{become an integral part}} of social fair trade. Since the 1980 s in which bidding entered China's construction market, it has gone through a certain course, playing an adequate role in the standardization of China's construction market, in the meanwhile, the construction bidding procedure itself is also being standardized and developing, however, there still exist many issues in China's construction bidding under BOQ bidding model in recent years, which need further study. 1.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The hosting of mega events encapsulates {{different}} {{opportunities and}} benefits for host countries or regions. Event management constitutes {{one of the}} most exciting and fastest growing forms of leisure, business and tourism-related phenomena. Their special appeal stems from the limited duration and innate uniqueness of each event, which distinguishes them from permanent institutions and built attractions. Events and festivals have the ability to attract a large number of visitors for a specific time period to a specific destination. The frequency of events is evident for the success of a tourism destination. The hosting of mega events requires a detailed process of bidding for international events. This study focused on the bidding process for hosting such events, with specific reference to the role of government in the bidding process. The value of this study lies in the key success factors that were identified by a comparative analysis that was done between the FlFA 2006 Soccer Bid between Germany and South Africa. Although South Africa's bid was unsuccessful, the country still delivered an outstanding technical bid and is regarded as a serious competitor for future events. South Africa already proved itself, through hosting the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Two major recommendations were made, including a FlFA World Cup Information Centre and a checklist for successful bidding. The FlFA World Cup Information Centre's aim must be to provide and disseminate information to communities. This will not only encourage community involvement. but also create support for the event. The marketing programme, staff information, maintenance plans, ecological balance, budget concerns, event evaluation process, the role of the organising committee and security matters are the key factors in developing such a centre. The checklist for creating a successful <b>bid</b> <b>cover</b> a number of issues regarding operational planning and management. Master...|$|R
