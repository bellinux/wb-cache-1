50|$|Perhaps {{its most}} memorable use was in American {{broadcast}} television graphics.

5000|$|<b>Character</b> <b>generators</b> are {{primarily}} {{used in the}} broadcast areas of live television sports or television news presentations, given that the modern <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> can rapidly (i.e., [...] "on the fly") generate high-resolution, animated graphics for use when an unforeseen situation in a broadcast dictates an opportunity for breaking news coverage—for example, when, in a football game, a previously unknown player begins to have what looks to become an outstanding day, the <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> operator can rapidly build a new graphic using the template [...] "shell" [...] of a similarly-designed graphic. The <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> {{is one of many}} technologies used {{to meet the demands of}} live television, where events on the field or in the newsroom dictate the direction of the coverage. As <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> development has progressed, the distinction between hardware and software generators has become less distinct as new platforms and operating systems evolve to meet the live television consumer's expectations.|$|R

40|$|We study {{character}} generating functions (<b>character</b> <b>generators)</b> {{of simple}} Lie algebras. The expression due to Patera and Sharp, {{derived from the}} Weyl character formula, is first reviewed. A new general formula is then found. It makes clear the distinct roles of ``outside'' and ``inside'' elements of the integrity basis, and helps determine their quadratic incompatibilities. We review, analyze and extend the results obtained by Gaskell using the Demazure character formulas. We find that the fundamental generalized-poset graphs underlying the <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> can be deduced from such calculations. These graphs, introduced by Baclawski and Towber, can be simplified {{for the purposes of}} constructing the <b>character</b> <b>generator.</b> The generating functions can be written easily using the simplified versions, and associated Demazure expressions. The rank-two algebras are treated in detail, but we believe our results are indicative of those for general simple Lie algebras. Comment: 50 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
