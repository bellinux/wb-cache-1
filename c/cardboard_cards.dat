PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|R

50|$|During the U.S. Civil War the Sanitary Commission {{collected}} {{enormous amounts}} of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns. The pioneer was John Shaw Billings (1838-1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built the Library of the Surgeon General's Office (now the National Library of Medicine), the centerpiece of modern medical information systems. Billings {{figured out how to}} mechanically analyze medical and demographic data by turning facts into numbers and punching the numbers onto <b>cardboard</b> <b>cards</b> that could be sorted and counted by machine. The applications were developed by his assistant Herman Hollerith; Hollerith invented the punch card and counter-sorter system that dominated statistical data manipulation until the 1970s. Hollerith's company became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} such {{performances}} in Thailand {{can be traced}} back to Assumption College, a member of the Jaturamitr, where in 1942, by the instruction of Cherd Sudara, a teacher at the school, differently-uniformed students in the audience arranged to form the school's initials. This developed into dynamic messages by physical movement of the crowd and later the covering and exposure of specific-colored clothing. The Chula-Thammasat Traditional Football Match adopted the card stunt in 1957; in the following years, <b>cardboard</b> <b>cards</b> became the predominant medium for the stunts. As a part of larger events, performances by Chulalongkorn University students were featured in the opening ceremony of the 1974 Asian Games at Tehran, and eight thousand students from the Jaturamitr schools performed during the 1999 FESPIC Games in Bangkok.|$|E
50|$|The bites tend to {{be grouped}} {{together}} due to the piecemeal feeding behavior of these mites. They can occur anywhere on the body though commonly on the neck, head, extremities, abdomen and chest. The papules are generally 1 to 4 mm in diameter and sometimes vesicles appear. The symptoms of this disease are common or at least mistakable for many things that should be checked for as well in differential diagnosis such as prurigo simplex, allergies, mosquito or other insect bites, bacterial folliculitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, scabies, and pediculosis. Identification of the mite itself is required for definitive diagnosis. This can be collected by laying cellophane tape or “Sticky cards” (<b>cardboard</b> <b>cards</b> with a glue surface) in the area believed to be infested with the mite. A biopsy of the lesions only shows superficial and mid-dermal perivascular infiltrates and occasionally eosinophils. This method is so nonspecific as to be inconclusive in diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{printing}} machines, numbers on bingo cards were either painted by hand or stamped using rubber stamps onto thick <b>cardboard.</b> [...] <b>Cards</b> were reusable, meaning players used tokens to mark called numbers. The number of unique cards was limited as randomization had to occur by hand. Before {{the advent of}} online Bingo, cards were printed on card stock and, increasingly, disposable paper. [...] While <b>cardboard</b> and paper <b>cards</b> are still in use, Bingo halls are turning more to [...] "flimsies" [...] (also called [...] "throwaways") [...] - [...] a card inexpensively printed on very thin paper to overcome increasing cost [...] - [...] and electronic Bingo cards to overcome the difficulty with randomization.|$|R

50|$|PVC {{packaging}} A {{more recent}} {{type of packaging}} that is common as of the 2000s decade is PVC packaging. With this type of packaging, the <b>cardboard</b> <b>card</b> {{is replaced by a}} clear PVC plastic backing. The front of the package is a different piece of PVC plastic that is molded to include a bubble that will house the action figure and all of its accessories. Any colorful artwork designed to help draw attention to the package will be printed on a thin piece of paper that is placed between these two pieces of PVC, or will be affixed in sticker form to the front piece of PVC. This type of packaging is popular today and can be seen being used by McFarlane Toys for their Movie Maniacs line of action figures beginning with Series V. Other companies that utilize this type of packaging are NECA/Reel Toys (National Entertainment Collectibles Association) with their Cult Classics and Pirates of the Caribbean line of figures, and Toy Biz with its Marvel Legends action figures, which included a comic book placed between the two PVC segments.|$|R

This was the origin of the computer punch card system that dominated statistical data manipulation until the 1970s. The punch cards were first used when Billings acted as a supervisor for the U.S. Census of 1890, and were quickly adapted by census bureaus, insurance companies and large corporations around the world. He {{came up with the idea}} for the library when working on his doctoral thesis when he discovered that there was not one library that had the resources needed for his research. To fix this, John Shaw Billings built a collection and also created Index-catalogues. By the time Billings retired from the army, he had already collected 116,847 books and 191,598 pamphlets. This collection made up the National Library of Medicine and it has grown ever since.|$|E
5000|$|States {{could use}} their own tax money to support their troops as Ohio did. Following the {{unexpected}} carnage {{at the battle of}} Shiloh in April 1862, the Ohio state government sent 3 steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals with doctors, nurses and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to eleven hospital ships. The state also set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth. [...] The U.S. Army learned many lessons and in 1886, it established the Hospital Corps.

40|$|Simple, rapid, and {{reliable}} fecal indicator tests {{are needed to}} better monitor and manage ambient waters and treated waters and wastes. Antibody-coated polymeric bead agglutination assays can fulfill these needs and are inexpensive and portable for nonlaboratory settings, and their reagents can be stored at ambient temperatures for months. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop, optimize, and validate a rapid microbial water quality monitoring assay using F+ coliphage culture, latex agglutination, and typing (CLAT) to detect F+ coliphage groups with antibody-coated particles. Rapid (180 min) F+ coliphage culture gave comparable results to those with the 16 - to 24 -h culture time used in EPA method 1601 and was amenable to CLAT assay detection. CLAT was performed on a <b>cardboard</b> <b>card</b> by mixing a drop of coliphage enrichment culture with a drop of antibody-coated polymeric beads as the detection reagent. Visual agglutination or clumping of positive samples occurred in < 60 seconds. The CLAT assay had sensitivities of 96. 4 % (185 / 192 samples) and 98. 2 % (161 / 164 samples) and specificities of 100 % (34 / 34 samples) and 97. 7 % (129 / 132 samples) for F+ RNA and DNA coliphages, respectively. CLAT successfully classified F+ RNA coliphages into serogroups typically obtained from human (groups II and III) and animal (groups I and IV) fecal sources, in similar proportions to those obtained with a nucleic acid hybridization assay. This novel group-specific antibody-based particle agglutination technique for rapid and simple detection and grouping of F+ coliphages provides a new and improved tool for monitoring the microbiological quality of drinking, recreational, shellfishing, and other waters...|$|R

5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on <b>cardboard</b> pull <b>cards</b> which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|R
50|$|The game {{takes place}} on a board {{representing}} a two-story mall. The game is designed for two to four players. Each player receives $150 from one player who is designated to be the banker. The banker dispenses cash in the following manner; one $50 bill, three $20 bills, three $10 bills, and two $5 bills. This later changed to $200, with an additional $50 bill to start the game. The first player presses the computer's gameplay button, which directs the player to move a random number of spaces. When arriving at a store, each player can make purchases with a <b>cardboard</b> credit <b>card,</b> and the computer tracks the game play. After the player purchases items with the credit card he/she will pay the banker with the appropriate amount of cash. At {{the start of each}} turn, an electronic voice announces a clearance at one store and sales at two others, players can use these sales to their advantage, since it takes up a turn to get to the ATM.|$|R
