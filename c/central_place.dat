40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>central</b> <b>places</b> is theoretically investigated by using Rushton's map transformation algorithm, MAPTRANS, {{for the case}} of the Kanto region in preindustrial Japan. The recovered hierarchical spacing reveals that <b>central</b> <b>places</b> were located according to the marketing principle to some extent, as well as being influenced by population density. Their locations were also locally distorted by traffic, administrative, and topographical conditions. These results suggest that Christaller's three principles did generally determine the {{distribution of}} <b>central</b> <b>places.</b> Application of the general hierarchical model to the actual frequency distribution of centers further confirms that the hierarchical structure is well approximated by a variable k -system rather than by the Christallerian k -system, which implies that a structural change in the hierarchy had taken place in the course of modernization. ...|$|R

50|$|According to K = 4 {{transport}} principle, {{the market}} {{area of a}} higher-order place includes a half of the market area {{of each of the}} six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of <b>central</b> <b>places</b> which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum <b>central</b> <b>places</b> possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center.The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting <b>central</b> <b>places</b> at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order,as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Economists {{have long}} been {{interested}} in understanding the relationship between economic inequality and urban form. Suburban white-flight, flight from blight, and spatial mismatch between jobs and low-income neighborhoods are believed to contribute to poverty and reduced economic opportunity. Using Census data for all U. S. <b>central</b> <b>places</b> and urbanized areas, along {{with an array of}} sprawl measures, this thesis tests for a relationship between sprawl and the change in poverty rates in <b>central</b> <b>places</b> between 2000 and 2010. The results show urban area density consistently has a negative affect on the change in poverty rates within <b>central</b> <b>places.</b> Results show that for a density increase of 1000 people within an urban area, we expect to see the change in poverty rate in <b>central</b> <b>places</b> decline by 4 to 8 percent, holding other factors constant. The study finds however that other sprawl measures used, such as centrality, or mix of land uses, do not appear to have a statistically significant effect on poverty rates. This study also finds evidence that state and local growth controls may also have a statistically significant relationship to changing poverty rates. Certain types of growth control may exacerbate poverty rates in local jurisdictions. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R
