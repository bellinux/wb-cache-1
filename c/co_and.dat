5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (<b>CO)</b> <b>and</b> molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with <b>CO</b> <b>and</b> N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear-localized mtDNA pseudogenes {{might explain}} {{a recent report}} {{describing}} a heteroplasmic mtDNA molecule containing five linked missense mutations dispersed over the contiguous mtDNA <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 genes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. To test this hypothesis, we have used the PCR primers utilized in the original report to amplify <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sequences from two independent ρ° (mtDNA-less) cell lines. <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sequences amplified from both of the ρ° cells, demonstrating that these sequences are also present in the human nuclear DNA. The nuclear pseudogene <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sequences were then tested {{for each of the}} five “AD” missense mutations by restriction endonuclease site variant assays. All five mutations were found in the nuclear <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 PCR products from ρ° cells, but none were found in the PCR products obtained from cells with normal mtDNA. Moreover, when the overlapping nuclear <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 PCR products were cloned and sequenced, all five missense mutations were found, as well as a linked synonymous mutation. Unlike the findings in the original report, an additional 32 base substitutions were found, including two in adjacent tRNAs and a two base pair deletion in the CO 2 gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear <b>CO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sequences revealed that they diverged from modern human mtDNAs early in hominid evolution about 770, 000 years before present. These data would be consistent with the interpretation that the missense mutations proposed to cause AD may be the product of ancient mtDNA variants preserved as nuclear pseudogenes...|$|R

5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as <b>CO</b> <b>and</b> O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
