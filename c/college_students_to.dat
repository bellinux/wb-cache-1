A 1998 study addressed this question by analyzing data from a cross-sectional study of girls in elementary school, middle school, high school, girls pursuing an undergraduate education in college, and girls pursuing a master's degree. Despite possible reasons to believe that education might increase the capacity to and likelihood of sharing behaviors, no differences were found.|$|E

500|$|For many years, Aigler was {{an outspoken}} {{opponent}} of athletic scholarships. In 1939, the Michigan Student Senate adopted a resolution favoring tuition scholarships for varsity athletes {{with at least}} a [...] "B" [...] average. The resolution was intended to rid college sports of unseemly under-the-table subsidies and to provide a [...] "fair return for services" [...] to the athletes who made possible the [...] "big business" [...] of college sports. Aigler opposed the move, saying: [...] "You can't give athletic scholarships without aspiring to the sigma of professionalism[...] [...] [...] Other schools have tried it, and if the practice enjoys widespread continuance, it will prove the doom of collegiate sport." [...] Aigler argued that scholarships were a form of payment that undermined the concept of the unpaid student athlete. He said: [...] "Those college teams made up of scholarship holders and the like should be grouped with the Giants, Redskins, Bears, etc., instead of with those teams made up of bona fide <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> whom athletic participation must be secondary." [...] On another occasion, he urged schools granting athletic scholarships, though [...] "ostensibly amateur", to [...] "turn square and associate themselves with the Washington Redskins and Green Bay Packers." ...|$|E

500|$|The Meelia Center {{is one of}} {{the many}} outlets {{available}} for students to volunteer in the Greater Manchester community. Since 1989, the Meelia Center has allowed Saint Anselm <b>College</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> mobilize their talents and energies to assist 14 community partnerships and more than 30 other community service agencies throughout New Hampshire. Annually, some 850 students, faculty, and staff volunteer more than 16,000 community service hours. The Princeton Review has described the Meelia Center as [...] "the nerve center of Saint Anselm's bustling service community", adding that [...] "the center, according to the school, 'employs nearly sixty student service leaders, who in turn recruit, place, and support over 200 volunteers and 210 service learners each semester who perform weekly service in over thirty community agencies. An additional 350 volunteers serve in occasional one-day service events. In 2010, the Meelia Center alone accounted for the coordination of 20,000 service hours by Saint Anselm students. New students are introduced to the service commitment through the New Student Day of Service.

500|$|First off, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, {{this had been a}} dream inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows <b>college</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> go up into the air in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. Faculty members were not allowed to go (Pausch called this a [...] "brick wall" [...] he faced), so he had to present himself as a web journalist, because local media was allowed on. Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept and read a World Book Encyclopedia in his home. As he progressed into a career, {{he became one of the}} leading professors in the field of virtual reality. World Book then called Pausch, interested in him writing for the encyclopedia.
