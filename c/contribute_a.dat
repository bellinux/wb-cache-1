5|$|By early July 1907 Shackleton {{had secured}} little {{financial}} support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and was lacking {{the funds to}} complete the refit of the ship. In mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of £2,000 (updated value £) provided that Shackleton found other backers to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> further £6,000. Shackleton {{was able to do}} this, the extra funds including £2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{head coach}} Slavoljub Muslin brought Žigić into Red Star's senior squad for the 2003–04 First League season, {{and gave him}} his debut in the {{starting}} eleven on the opening day. That first game ended in defeat, and Žigić's physical appearance– a growth spurt {{from the age of}} 16 had brought his height to – provoked suggestions that he might be better suited to basketball. He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2–0 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat-trick against Nistru in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6–5 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 3–0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid-season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali {{delegated}} {{the administrative}} affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar (also {{known by the}} title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar) {{and spent most of}} his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a Chettiar money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah. Sultan Ali signed an agreement with Shellapah to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> portion of his monthly allowance to repay his debt. However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Temenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.|$|E

5|$|That year Clements and Musker {{expanded}} the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating {{the role of}} the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with Oliver out of the way, Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release.|$|E
5|$|The Green Bay Packers {{had seven}} {{different}} players each <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> sack, and Randy Wright's 190 yards passing {{made him the}} second player in Packers history to throw for 3,000 yards in a season. The crowd cheered the news that an Indianapolis Colts win moved the Buccaneers into first place {{for the rights to}} the first overall draft pick, and pelted Buccaneer players with lemons. Ron Holmes's sack of Wright was the Buccaneers' first since Oct. 12, and Ivory Sully recorded the first blocked punt in Buccaneers (regular-season) history. Both teams went to their second-string quarterbacks in the second half, but Steve Young returned to the game after Steve DeBerg suffered a concussion, and Wright was reinserted after the Buccaneers threatened to start a comeback.|$|E
5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They {{may have been}} carved under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{bringing}} Professor Quatermass {{back for a}} fourth adventure dated back to at least 1965 when producer Irene Shubik asked Kneale to <b>contribute</b> <b>a</b> new Quatermass story for the first season of her science fiction anthology series, Out of the Unknown. Nothing came of this but the prospect of Quatermass making a reappearance arose again when, following {{the success of the}} film version of Quatermass and the Pit in 1967, Hammer announced they were in discussions with Kneale for a new Quatermass adventure. Again, this did not progress beyond the initial negotiation stage. In the meantime Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing plays such as The Year of the Sex Olympics (1968), Wine of India (1970) and The Stone Tape (1972). Following completion of The Stone Tape, Kneale was commissioned on 21 November 1972 by BBC Head of Drama Serials, Ronnie Marsh, to write a new four-part Quatermass serial.|$|E
