40|$|One of {{the major}} {{drawbacks}} of multicarrier modulation is the large envelope fluctuations which either require an inefficient use of high power amplifiers or decrease the system performance. Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a very well known measure of the envelope fluctuations and has become the cost function used to evaluate and design multicarrier systems. Several PAPR-reducing techniques have been proposed with the aim to alleviate back-off specifications or increase the system performance. Besides {{the fact that these}} techniques have varying PAPR-reduction capabilities, power, bandwidth and complexity requirements, it is interesting to notice that the performance of a system employing these techniques has not been fully analyzed. In this paper we, first, develop a theoretical framework for both PAPR and the distortion introduced by a nonlinearity, and then simulate an OFDM system employing several well known PAPR-reducing techniques from the literature. By means of the theoretical analysis and the simulation results we will show the relation between PAPR and the performance of OFDM systems when a <b>clipping</b> <b>device</b> is present and we will evaluate the real performance improvement capabilities of the PAPR-reducing methods.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the uplink transmission in multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) systems. As other multicarrier signals, MC-CDMA signals have high envelope fluctuations and a high peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which leads to amplification difficulties. This is particularly important for the uplink transmission, since an efficient low-cost power amplification is desirable at the mobile terminals (MTs). Moreover, the transmission over time-dispersive channels destroys the orthogonality between spreading codes, which might lead to significant multiple-access interference levels. To reduce the envelope fluctuations of the transmitted signals, while maintaining the spectral efficiency, the MC-CDMA signal associated to each MT is submitted to a <b>clipping</b> <b>device,</b> followed by a frequency-domain filtering operation. However, the nonlinear distortion effects can be high when an MC-CDMA transmitter with reduced envelope fluctuations is intended (e. g., a small clipping level and/or when successive clipping and filtering operations are employed).

40|$|Background and aims: After Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM), the mucosal {{incision}} {{is closed}} with endoscopically applied clips. After each clip placement, a subsequent <b>clipping</b> <b>device</b> {{has to be}} introduced through the working channel. With the Clipmaster 3, three consecutive clips can be placed without reloading which could reduce closure time. We performed a prospective study evaluating efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Closure using Clipmaster 3 was compared to closure with standard clips. Methods: Patients undergoing closure with the Clipmaster 3 were compared to patients who underwent POEM with standard clip closure. Results: In total, 12 consecutive POEM closures with Clipmaster 3 were compared to 24 standard POEM procedures. The Clipmaster 3 and the standard group {{did not differ in}} sex distribution, age (42 years [29 - 49] vs 41 years [34 - 54] P= 0. 379), achalasia subtype, disease duration, length of the mucosal incision (25. 0 mm [20 - 30] vs 20. 0 mm [20 - 30], P= 1. 0), and closure time (622 seconds [438 - 909] vs 599 seconds [488 - 664] P= 0. 72). Endoscopically successful closure could be performed in all patients. The proportion of all clips used that were either displaced or discarded was larger for Clipmaster 3 (8. 8 %) compared to standard closure (2. 0 %, P = 0. 00782). Ease of handling VAS (visual analogue scale) score for Clipmaster 3 did not differ between endoscopist and endoscopy nurse (7 out of 10). Conclusions: Clipmaster 3 is feasible and safe for closure of mucosal incisions after POEM. Clipmaster 3 was not associated with reduced closure time. Compared to standard closure, more Clipmaster 3 clips were displaced or discarded to achieve successful closure. A training effect cannot be excluded as a cause of these results.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The right kidney {{has been}} less {{frequently}} used in live donor nephrectomy, because of the shorter length of the right renal vein (RRV) {{that is associated with}} technical difficulties and higher rates of venous thrombosis. In live open donor or deceased donor transplant nephrectomy, an additional cuff of the inferior vena cava is usually removed, but this is a more difficult and risky maneuver in laparoscopic nephrectomy. For this reason, laparoscopic right nephrectomy (LRN) for renal transplantation (RT) is not frequently performed in most medical institutions. We evaluate the difference between RRV and left renal vein (LRV) lengths in cadavers, as harvested for RT by three clamping methods. Our objective was to obtain information that could clarify when LRN for RT should be encouraged or avoided with regard to conventional surgery. Materials and Methods: Ninety adult fresh unfrozen cadavers were randomly divided into three groups of 30, according to the clamping device used: Satinsky, stapler, and Hem-o-lok clip. The abdominal viscera were removed through a median xyphopubic incision, and the veins were measured on the bench. Two lateral limits were used: The renal hilum and the tangential line of the renal poles. As for medial limits, the inferior vena cava or the laparoscopic <b>clipping</b> <b>device</b> on the RRV were used on the right side, while on the LRV, the medial border of the emergence of the adrenal vein was considered. After section of the renal vein, a slight traction of the extremity was applied for the measurement. All measurements were obtained three times using a metallic millimetric ruler, and the arithmetic mean was considered. The chi-square, one-way analysis of variance, and paired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at P <= 0. 05. Results: The groups of cadavers were homogeneous in demographic characteristics. Regardless of the clamping method and considering the useful length of the LRV, the RRV was statistically smaller. The evaluation of the vein length did not depend on the lateral limit considered. Independent of the clamping method, on both sides, the lengths after the vein section were larger than before the section, a fact attributed to traction. Use of a stapler and a single Hem-o-lok presented the same waste of vein length on the right side. On average, the RRV was 13. 7 % shorter than the LRV. Conclusions: With the wide acceptance of laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy, the length difference between the veins of both kidneys is an important issue, and the right kidney is therefore used less than the left, compared with conventional surgery. This article represents the first step to quantify the anatomic length of renal veins in different situations. Certainly, more imagenologic or surgical studies should be carried out before decisions can be made for better selection of patients for LRN...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a significant}} risk factor for embolic stroke originating from the left atrial appendage (LAA). This is the first report of long-term safety and efficacy data on LAA closure using a novel epicardial LAA <b>clip</b> <b>device</b> in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS Forty patients with AF were enrolled in this prospective ‘first-in-man' trial. The inclusion criterion was elective cardiac surgery in adult patients with AF for which a concomitant ablation procedure was planned. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to exclude LAA thrombus at baseline and evaluate LAA perfusion after the procedure, while computed tomography (CT) was used for serial imagery workup at baseline, 3 -, 12 -, 24 - and 36 -month follow-up. RESULTS Early mortality was 10 % due to non-device-related reasons, and thus 36 patients {{were included in the}} follow-up consisting of 1285 patient-days and mean duration of 3. 5 ± 0. 5 years. On CT, clips were found to be stable, showing no secondary dislocation 36 months after surgery. No intracardial thrombi were seen, none of the LAA was reperfused and in regard to LAA stump, none of the patients demonstrated a residual neck > 1 cm. Apart from one unrelated transient ischaemic attack (TIA) that occurred 2 years after surgery in a patient with carotid plaque, no other strokes and/or neurological events demonstrated in any of the studied patients during follow-up. CONCLUSION This is the first prospective trial in which concomitant epicardial LAA occlusion using this novel epicardial LAA <b>clip</b> <b>device</b> is 100 % effective, safe and durable in the long term. Closure of the LAA by epicardial clipping is applicable to all-comers regardless of LAA morphology. Minimal access epicardial LAA clip closure may become an interesting therapeutic option for patients in AF who are not amenable to anticoagulation and/or catheter closure. Further data are necessary to establish LAA occlusion as a true and viable therapy for stroke prevention. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION The trial is registered at www.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new biomedical / open surgical instrument to assist surgeon in applying surgical clips to patient’s body tissue and blood vessel during surgical processes. The new clip delivery {{system is designed}} to better the clip’s distal advance through internal clip channel, jaw guiding track, and all other transition areas to keep surgical clip from accidental shooting out during clip’s distal move into jaws. Currently the clip distal move in normal surgical instrument is usually driven by compression springs and some complains of clip accidental drop-off were recorded in surgical procedures. Because higher request of dimensional tolerance and better component surface quality are needed in case the compression springs are used as driven force, a little dimensional devia-tion or less qualified part surface produced from manufacturing processes will potentially cause surgical <b>clip</b> <b>device</b> malfunction or misfiring of the clips. It is clearly known that the jaws can seriously sever or damage patient’s blood ves-sel or body tissue {{if there is no}} clip inside the jaws due to accidental clip drop-off, when surgeons close instrument handles. The improved internal system design in this new open surgical instrument can prevent clip from accidental drop-off because of well guided and controlled clip distal move through internal clip channel and track. Besides the operational force to fully form clip is lower than existing surgical <b>clip</b> <b>devices</b> due to better mechanical advantage in this new instrument design. In addition to the above, manufacturing and product cost can be decreased since lower requirement of dimensional tolerance and surface quality of instrumental parts is allowed in this new surgical instrument design. This new instrumental prototype is build upon the analysis of computer aided modeling and simulation to prove its good mechanical advantage, feasible function, reliable performance.
