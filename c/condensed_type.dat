30|$|Linkage {{between the}} phenylpropane units {{is one of}} the {{significant}} factors in the decomposition behavior of lignin. Lignin has two types of linkages which are ether type linkages such as β-O- 4, and <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages such as 5 – 5 ′. Ehara et al. [21] treated dimeric model compounds of β-O- 4 and 5 – 5 ′ types with the subcritical water (330  °C/ 50  MPa/ 10  s), and ether linkages were readily cleaved, while <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages had resistance to subcritical water.|$|E
30|$|A part of lignin in the {{insoluble}} residue might be intermolecularly condensed during hot-compressed water treatment. If the <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages in {{insoluble residue}} {{are the result}} of condensation during the treatment, condensation would be occurred not only in the middle lamella but also in the cell wall. However, as described already, the delignification behavior was different from each other. Thus, the distribution of the remaining lignin must be reflected from that in the original <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> lignin itself. Moreover, the semi-flow type of the hot-compressed water treatment may minimize its possibility due to prompt removal of the delignified products.|$|E
30|$|The {{rest of the}} {{remaining}} lignin to be one-third of the original one had resistance to hot-compressed water and remained as water-insoluble residue, which was mostly composed of lignin.

30|$|The {{difference}} in delignification from Japanese cedar and Japanese beech as treated by hot-compressed water was investigated from a topochemical viewpoint. Due to the preferential cleavage of ether linkages of lignin, lignin in cell {{walls of the}} tracheid and fiber was preferentially decomposed and removed in hot-compressed water. Consequently, lignin in middle lamella remained as insoluble residue after treatment. Although some alternation of the lignin through condensation might result during hot-compressed water treatment and obscure the data, overall the results obtained would suggest that middle lamella lignin is rich in <b>condensed</b> <b>type.</b> For cell wall lignin, on the other hand, Japanese cedar tracheids would have relatively higher <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> lignin than Japanese beech fibers. These results, thus, indicate that the decomposition behaviors of softwood and hardwood differ due to their intrinsic characteristics of lignin. Such information must elucidate the importance of topochemistry in the decomposition behaviors of lignin.|$|E
30|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} {{original}} lignin still remained as water-insoluble residue after two-step treatment, and the water-insoluble residue is 0.875  g/g in lignin concentration {{as shown in}} Table  1. The ratio of condensed-type linkages was observed to increase as the hot-compressed water treatment was prolonged. Consequently, lignin in the water-insoluble residue after two-step treatment was rich in <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> due to the cleavage of ether type linkages and possible recondensation reaction.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} the decomposition behavior of lignin from Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) as treated by two-step semi-flow hot-compressed water (1 st stage: 230  °C/ 10  MPa/ 15  min, 2 nd stage: 270  °C/ 10  MPa/ 15  min), water-soluble portion, precipitate, and water-insoluble residue obtained by hot-compressed water treatment were separated and characterized. Consequently, the water-soluble portion {{was found to}} contain lignin-derived monomeric compounds such as coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde and β- 1, β- 5, and 5 - 5 ′ linked dimeric compounds. These lignin-derived compounds maintained methoxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in aromatic rings. The water-soluble portion also contained lignin-derived oligomeric compounds up to heptamers. In contrast, the precipitate was found out to consist of higher molecular weight lignin with high ether type linkages. The water-insoluble residue, however, consisted mostly of lignin with high <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages. Based on these lines of evidence, <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> lignin must be resistant to hot-compressed water and remain as water-insoluble residue after two-step treatment. Such information provides {{a clue as to}} efficient utilization of lignin-derived products.|$|E

When modulating the actual boiler temperature lower, water temperature {{needs to have a}} low limit and be maintained above the flue gas condensation temperature for non-condensing type boilers, typically above 60 ⁰C. <b>Condensing</b> <b>type</b> boilers can be made to operate at temperatures below the flue gas condensation limit and raise stated efficiencies from the 85% - 95% range.|$|R

50|$|A subtle {{change in}} {{proportion}} impacts weight, perception, measure, and legibility. The letterform height compared to its stroke width modifies the aspect; this slight change in weight sometimes helps to create emphasis. The disparity between {{thick and thin}} strokes, known as stress, alters optical perception. As an example, the initial san serif typefaces used a constantly thin stroke. The technological advances allow drawing thinner strokes. <b>Condense</b> <b>type</b> occupies less space than expanded type, then the text written on a page {{can be reduced to}} half a page.The capline and x-height ratio improve or decrease word legibility.|$|R
30|$|Phenol and {{aromatic}} nuclear {{are known}} to be stable to supercritical water treatment through some experiments with various monomeric lignin model compounds [10 – 15]. The resistance of lignin to supercritical water differs, dependent on the types of its linkages, and ether linkages in lignin are readily cleaved by protic solvent such as supercritical water and methanol, while <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> of linkages and aromatic ring are difficult to be cleaved [16, 17].|$|E
30|$|The phenylpropane {{units with}} lower {{methoxyl}} content have higher possibility to form <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages at 3 or 5 position of aromatic ring. Based on these lines of evidence, lignin in middle lamella must be rich in condensed types, thus remaining after two-step treatment. Similarly, lignin in tracheid cell wall of Japanese cedar would have higher condensed types than lignin in fiber cell wall of Japanese beech. Thus, lignin in Japanese cedar had higher resistance to hot-compressed water {{than that in}} Japanese beech as shown in Table  1 and Fig.  4.|$|E

40|$|The {{crystallization}} {{behavior of}} isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (i-PMMA) in monolayers of mixtures with a noncrystallizable component was investigated. The monolayer {{crystallization process in}} mixtures with high molecular weight <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> polymers such as syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (s-PMMA) can be completely explained {{on the basis of}} additive behavior, as expected for monolayers with large phase-separated domains present, when compression speed effects are taken into account. When i-PMMA is mixed with noncrystallizable diluents, forming expanded monolayers, the monolayer crystallization of the i-PMMA component is shown to be a function of the molecular weight of the diluent. Whereas for high molecular weights crystallization approximately takes place as in an undiluted monolayer, low molecular weights of the diluent give rise to a suppressed monolayer crystallization, presumably the result of the demixing process that must take place upon crystallization. ...|$|E
30|$|Early studies {{conducted}} by the Domburg group [54, 58] reported the thermal stability of various model compounds, which were representative of the linkages between phenylpropane-units and side-chains. Analyses of the pyrolysis products of dimers along with NMR analysis of the pyrolyzed lignins revealed that α- and β-ether bonds are readily cleaved during the primary pyrolysis stage; however, condensed (C−C) type linkages are stable during depolymerization of lignin macromolecules [13, 20, 47]. The Ph β-aryl type dimers give stilbenes selectively, but this reaction {{does not lead to}} depolymerization of lignins [20, 47]. Normally, Ph dimers are more reactive than corresponding Non-Ph ones [20, 40, 41, 47, 49, 53]. Compared with hardwood lignins, softwood lignins contain a greater proportion of <b>condensed</b> <b>type</b> linkages. Thus, the differences in reactivity of these components can explain the observation that pyrolysis of softwood lignins tend to generate larger amounts of residue than hardwood lignins [59, 60].|$|E
