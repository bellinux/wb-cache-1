50|$|Unity is a 10,000 {{kilometer}} <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> between Chikura, located off {{the coast}} near Tokyo, and Los Angeles and other network points of presence on the West Coast of the United States. At Chikura, Unity is connected to other cable systems.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, {{the newly}} formed Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines began {{offering}} trans-Pacific steamship service from Vancouver with three large steel-hulled ships, the [...] "Empress" [...] liners: India, China and Japan.In 1902, Canadian Pacific completed a <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> telegraph, linking Vancouver with Australia and New Zealand. This reinforced Vancouver's position as a Pacific transportation and communication gateway.|$|R
5000|$|Unity {{comprises}} a 10,000 km linear {{cable system}} with a [...] "multi-terabit" [...] capacity of up to 7.68 Tbit/s. Construction of the cable was funded by a consortium formed in February 2008 comprising Bharti Airtel, Global Transit, Google, KDDI Corporation, Pacnet and SingTel. Unity's installation cost around US$300 million, and its completion increased <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> capacity by around 20 per cent.|$|R
50|$|In 1856, {{the first}} {{underwater}} telegraph cable in Canada was laid, linking Cape Ray, Newfoundland and Aspy, Nova Scotia. Ten years later, in 1866, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid between Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Foilhommerum, Valentia Island, in western Ireland. The first trans-Canada telegraph service {{was established by}} Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885. In 1902, Canadian Pacific completed a <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> telegraph, linking Vancouver with Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|The {{first job}} for the {{upgraded}} tug was to assist the Dock Express 20, a multi-purpose vessel of Dutch registry owned by Dock-Express Shipping B.V, in laying a fiber cable off Point Arena, California. Point Arena is north of San Francisco about 100 mi and is the closest point {{on the west coast}} of the continental United States to Japan, hence is the landing point for many <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first <b>trans-pacific</b> <b>cables</b> {{providing}} {{telegraph service}} were completed in 1902-03, linking the US mainland to Hawaii in 1902 and Guam to the Philippines in 1903. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji were also linked in 1902 with the trans-Pacific {{segment of the}} All Red Line. Japan was connected into the system in 1906. Service beyond Midway Atoll was abandoned in 1941 because of WWII, but the remainder remained in operation until 1951 when the FCC gave permission to cease operations.|$|R
50|$|Unity is {{expected}} to initially increase <b>Trans-Pacific</b> lit <b>cable</b> capacity by about 20 percent, {{with the potential to}} add up to 7.68 terabits per second (Tbit/s) of bandwidth across the Pacific.|$|R
25|$|TRANSPAC-1, {{the first}} <b>trans-Pacific</b> {{communications}} <b>cable</b> from Japan to Hawaii was also finished in June 1964 {{in time for}} these games. Before this, most communications from Japan to other countries were via shortwave.|$|R
50|$|Congress {{once again}} began to {{consider}} legislation on a <b>trans-Pacific</b> telegraph <b>cable</b> in 1895. Moreno unsuccessfully lobbied the United States House of Representatives for {{an extension of}} his 1876 charter for construction and maintenance of the cable.|$|R
50|$|Fanning was {{formally}} annexed to Great Britain by Captain William Wiseman of HMS Caroline on March 15, 1888. A deep opening was blasted, thereafter called the English Channel, {{on the west}} side of the atoll. Tabuaeran hosted a station on the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Cable</b> between Canada and Australia, a part of the All Red Line, beginning in 1902. Fanning Island Post Office opened on 29 November 1902. In September 1914 (World War I), the cable station was shelled by a German cruiser, the NÃ¼rnberg, and was slightly damaged. A landing force went ashore to complete the destruction. In 1939 the atoll was incorporated into the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. In 1979, it gained independence, becoming part of the Republic of Kiribati (pronounced kee-ree-bahs).|$|R

2500|$|In 1912, Port Alberni was {{incorporated}} {{with the arrival}} of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, and planned arrival of the Canadian National Railway, and the [...] <b>trans-Pacific</b> telegraph <b>cable</b> at Bamfield. Mining took place on the Alberni Inlet and, as with many fish camps and outports, depended on Port Alberni as a base.|$|R
25|$|In 1903, {{workers for}} the Commercial Pacific Cable Company took up {{residence}} on the island {{as part of the}} effort to lay a <b>trans-Pacific</b> telegraph <b>cable.</b> These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the canary, cycad, Norfolk Island pine, she-oak, coconut, and various deciduous trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.|$|R
50|$|As a {{representative}} of the American and Asiatic Telegraph Company, Moreno promoted Li Hung-chang's idea of an undersea telegraph cable between Asia and the mainland United States. He spent time in California lobbying among influential leaders in hopes of gaining financial support for the project, then began lobbying the United States Congress. Senator Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen introduced a bill on May 18, 1874, to grant a charter to Moreno and thirteen others for the construction and maintenance of the <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable.</b> Moreno addressed Congress four months later on September 26, detailing the specifics of the proposal. A bill was passed and signed by President Grant, for a non-exclusive charter requiring the project to begin no later than three years after the bill's August 15, 1876 passage. Subsequent fund raising efforts for the project were unsuccessful, and the deadline expired without the cable being started.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} two decades of the century the {{increased}} popularity of bathing led to an increased number of drownings. This publicity surrounding deaths at the Southport beaches concerned the Southport Chamber of Commerce and, {{in an effort to}} reduce the number of fatalities beach inspectors were hired. However, because of their inexperience and lack of equipment the inspectors were rarely successful in their attempts at surf lifesaving. The Southport branch of the Surf Lifesaving Club was established in 1912, just six years after the first branch in Australia was formed at Bondi Beach. It was disbanded soon after but reformed in 1919 as the Cable Surf Lifesaving Club, named after the first <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> between Australia and Canada which was located on Main Beach. Again the club disbanded when the cable station closed in 1923, but reformed under its previous and current name soon after. By 1931 there were nine clubs in the South Coast Branch of the Lifesaving Association of Queensland.|$|R
50|$|FASTER is a <b>trans-Pacific</b> {{submarine}} communications <b>cable</b> {{that went}} live {{during the last}} week of June 2016. The cable has a total length of approximately 11,629 km and a capacity of 60Tb/s.|$|R

50|$|Pacific Fibre is a New Zealand-based {{company that}} {{proposed}} {{to build a}} <b>trans-Pacific</b> undersea <b>cable</b> that was to have competed with the Southern Cross Cable operated by Telecom New Zealand. The cable would have totalled 12,750 km (7,920 miles) in length, and the initial investment was projected to be US$350 million. Customers included Vodafone New Zealand, Australian ISP iiNet, and the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network in New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1885 the Colonial Office {{accepted}} an offer by New Zealand, {{which was then}} a self-governing British colony, for New Zealand {{to pay for a}} British Consul for Rarotonga on condition that he be nominated by New Zealand and act as the country's official agent. This [...] "Resident" [...] was also to act as adviser to the ariki in drafting and administering laws and he would sign all acts of the local legislature {{in the name of the}} Governor of New Zealand. He would also have the right to reject proposed legislation. In 1888 Queen Makea Takau formally petitioned the British to set up a Protectorate to head off what she believed to be imminent invasion by the French. The British Government agreed to permit its then vice-consul in Rarotonga to declare a Protectorate over the Southern Group islands to protect pro-British islanders and New Zealand trade. The Colonial Office also decided that certain other Northern Group islands should be annexed for possible future use as <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable</b> stations.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>trans-pacific</b> {{telephone}} <b>cable</b> {{was laid}} from Hawaii to Japan in 1964, with an extension from Guam to The Philippines. In 1991, the North Pacific Cable system {{was the first}} regenerative (repeatered) system to completely cross the Pacific from the US mainland to Japan. The US portion of NPC was manufactured in Portland, Oregon, from 1989 to 1991 at STC Submarine Systems, and later Alcatel Submarine Networks. The system was laid by Cable & Wireless Marine on the CS Cable Venture.|$|R
50|$|Nedonna Beach is an unincorporated {{community}} in Tillamook County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It {{serves as the}} U.S. terminus of the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> Express undersea <b>cable</b> and Southern Cross Cable. Nedonna Beach is west of U.S. Route 101 between Rockaway Beach and Nehalem Bay.|$|R
25|$|In 1902, the Pacific Cable Board {{laid the}} first <b>trans-Pacific</b> {{telegraph}} <b>cable</b> from Bamfield, British Columbia to Fanning Island (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands and from Fiji to Fanning Island, thus completing the All Red Line, {{a series of}} telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the British Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were disfavored {{due to the lack}} of adequate landing sites.|$|R
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the SpanishâAmerican War, Bennington was in Hawaiian waters. After spending the first two months of the war in the Hawaiian Islands, she departed Honolulu on 16 June and steamed to the west coast of the United States. The warship arrived in San Francisco on 26 June and patrolled the California coast for the remainder of hostilities. On 18 September, Bennington stood out of San Francisco on her way ultimately to the Philippines. She arrived in Hawaii on 27 September and devoted a little over three months to operations in nearby waters. On 7 January 1899, she resumed her voyage west. Ten days out of Honolulu, she stopped at Wake Island. There Commander Edward D. Taussig, Benningtons commander, under direct orders from President William McKinley claimed the atoll for the United States, despite protests from Germany (which considered the island group a part of its claim of the Marshall Islands). Wake eventually became an important link in the HonoluluâManila <b>trans-Pacific</b> <b>cable.</b> Bennington later made a stop at San Luis d'Apra, Guam, from 23 January to 15 February where Commander [...] (later Rear Admiral) [...] Taussig accepted the relinquishment of Guam from her Spanish colonial governor. [...] Taussig briefly served as the first naval governor of Guam and established a native ruling council, before continuing on to Manila where Bennington arrived on 22 February.|$|R
50|$|The Trans-Pacific Express is a {{telecommunications}} project {{to connect the}} United States with China with a fiber-optic cable {{that is designed to}} meet increasing internet traffic between the regions, with 60 times more capacity than existing cables. It is to be the first undersea or submarine telecommunications cable that directly links the US with China and the first independent <b>trans-Pacific</b> connection. Current <b>cable</b> links between China and the US run through Japan.|$|R
50|$|Celso Caesar Moreno (1830 - March 12, 1901) was {{a soldier}} of fortune, a {{controversial}} political figure on the world stage, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii under KalÄkaua. Born in Italy, he fought in the Crimean War and lived throughout Asia, Hawaii and the United States. He moved from one career to another, one grand scheme to another, usually trying to convince governments to pay huge sums of money for his proposals. His efforts at establishing a <b>trans-Pacific</b> telegraph <b>cable</b> got official government authorization, but no financial backers. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1878, and a naturalized citizen of Hawaii in 1880. Moreno spent his final years living in Washington, D. C., trying to eliminate the padrone system that created slavery conditions within the immigrant Italian labor force.|$|R
50|$|By 1871, the {{strategy}} of a railway connection was being used to bring British Columbia into federation and Fleming was offered the chief engineer post on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Although he hesitated because {{of the amount of}} work he had, in 1872 he set off with a small party to survey the route, particularly through the Rocky Mountains, finding a practicable route through the Yellowhead Pass. One of his companions, George Monro Grant wrote an account of the trip, which became a best-seller. By 1880, with 600 miles completed, a change of government brought a desire for a private company to own the whole project and Fleming was dismissed by Sir Charles Tupper, with a $30,000 payoff. It was the hardest blow of Fleming's life, though he obtained a promise of monopoly, later revoked, on his next project, a <b>trans-pacific</b> telegraph <b>cable.</b> Nevertheless, in 1884 he became a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and was present as the last spike was driven.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its construction, 5,547 gigabits per second of {{capacity}} was available across the Atlantic Ocean, but only 2,726 gigabits per second existed across the Pacific Ocean. [...] Most links to China had to go through a hub in Japan, and access topped out at 155 Mbit/s. The TPE is more than 60 times the overall capacity of the existing cable directly linking the U.S. and China, and thus its construction was a major enhancement to the cable systems between the two nations. [...] It is the first next-generation undersea optical cable system directly linking the U.S. and China, [...] and was also the first major undersea system to land on the U.S. West Coast in more than seven years. [...] Initially, the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> Express <b>cable</b> was configured to handle traffic at 1.28 terabits per second (Tbit/s), but the system has a design capacity of up to 5.12 Tbit/s.
