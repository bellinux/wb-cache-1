Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon.

5|$|The {{resulting}} Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) {{conducted an}} extensive three-year study and consultation with Canadians.

Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning, research and development.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{presents}} psychotherapeutic work with „JD‟, an African male in his mid-twenties {{with a history}} of sexual abuse and early deficiencies in maternal provision. The focus of the study is on the difficulty of attempting to comprehend and provide <b>containment</b> (the operationalization <b>of</b> <b>containment),</b> as a trainee therapist working with this particular patient. „JD‟ presented with a number of interpersonal fears, complaints of isolation, an unbearable sense of confusion and uncertainty as well repressed anger and resentment. This clinical combination of difficulties, when mixed in with the author‟s own challenges as a trainee therapist, made therapeutic work challenging. The therapist employed a broadly defined psychodynamic framework, with a particular emphasis on „containing‟ „JD‟s unbearable levels of distress and anxiety whilst attempting to aid in the process of ascribing meaning to his confusing and difficult experiences. This undertaking was a challenging task, given that the concept <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is not necessarily clear-cut (particularly for a trainee therapist) and in addition, that the patient seemingly lacked a sense <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> whilst growing up. The case study aims to illustrate and explore the challenges of operationalizing and providing the function <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> in psychotherapy with due consideration to the contributions of both the therapist‟s and patient‟s dynamics. In assessing the difficulties involved in attempting to provide containment in this therapy, it becomes apparent that for a beginner therapist the provision <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is easily complicated by his/her narcissistic anxieties and countertransference reactions. It is proposed that aspects <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> as elaborated by more contemporary theorists may be possible to provide as a trainee therapist, but that working with projective identification as understood by a more classic Bion informed notion <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is more difficult to master. It seems that this latter capacity is a skill that develops with time and experience. The provision of a holding environment as a possible precursor to the provision <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> appeared to be what was evidenced in this particular therapeutic interchange...|$|R
