5|$|Harry Bassett was a {{chestnut}} stallion, foaled on 27 April 1868, {{that was}} sired by Lexington {{and out of}} the mare <b>Canary</b> Bird. <b>Canary</b> Bird was by the imported stallion Albion {{and out of the}} mare Panola, who was sired by the imported stallion Ainderby. <b>Canary</b> Bird's second dam, or maternal grandmother, was the imported mare Sweetbriar by Recovery. Harry Basset was bred either by R. A. Alexander or by A. J. Alexander, both of the Woodburn Stud of Woodburn, Kentucky, and was the second of <b>Canary</b> Bird's foals. He was sold at the 1869 S. D.

40|$|Recently, {{behavioural}} thresholds {{obtained in}} <b>canaries</b> of the Belgian Waterslager strain showed that these birds have an inherited auditory deficit. Canaries of this strain have absolute auditory thresholds at frequencies above 2. 0 kHz {{that are as}} much as 40 dB above the threshold of <b>canaries</b> of other strains. We obtained audiograms from cochlear microphonics and from compound action potentials from the 8 th nerve of Waterslager and non-Waterslager <b>canaries</b> and compare these results to previous behavioural data on hearing in this species. We also examined the growth of evoked potential amplitude-intensity functions in Waterslager and non-Waterslager <b>canaries.</b> Together with reflectance measurements of middle-ear function from both Waterslager and non-Waterslager <b>canaries,</b> we conclude that {{the origin of the}} auditory deficit in Waterslager <b>canaries</b> lies in the cochlea...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{auditory}} nerve fibers was determined for non-Belgian Waterslager <b>canaries</b> (non-BWS) and Belgian Waterslager <b>canaries</b> (BWS) that {{are affected by}} a sensorineural high frequency hearing loss and a 30 % {{reduction in the number}} of auditory hair cells. Counts were obtained from semithin cross sections of the Durcupan-embedded auditory nerve at the level of the internal auditory meatus. In addition, the number of lagenar fibers was determined from cross sections near the apical end of the cochlear duct in order to separate them from the total number of auditory nerve fibers. The mean number of auditory nerve fibers was 6076 in non-BWS and 5363 in BWS <b>canaries,</b> representing a 12 % reduction in BWS. This small {{reduction in the number of}} auditory nerve fibers, as compared to the larger reduction in hair cell number, might be explained by a predominant loss of abneural hair cells in BWS, since it has been shown for other species that a large proportion of abneural hair cells are devoid of afferent innervation. In addition, we observed that despite the prominent hair cell pathologies documented for BWS <b>canaries,</b> the mean diameter of auditory nerve fibers from non-BWS <b>canaries</b> (2. 22 +/- 0. 81 microm) did not differ from those of BWS <b>canaries</b> (2. 21 +/- 0. 96 microm) ...|$|R
5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards the <b>Canary</b> Islands and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in the <b>Canary</b> Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach the <b>Canary</b> Islands by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the <b>Canary</b> Islands, was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E

40|$|We {{used the}} {{bromodeoxyuridine}} technique {{to study the}} proliferative activity in the basilar papilla of normal and Belgian Waterslager <b>canaries</b> with and without preceding sound trauma. Without sound trauma, there were, on average, six supporting cell divisions per day in the basilar papilla of Waterslager <b>canaries.</b> This rate of supporting cell proliferation corresponds well with estimates of the rate of hair cell differentiation derived from counts of immature-appearing hair cells obtained by using scanning electron microscopy of the Waterslager basilar papilla. Thus, supporting cell division appeared correlated with hair cell differentiation in Waterslager <b>canaries.</b> Bromodeoxyuridine labeling of cells in undamaged non-Waterslager <b>canaries</b> also indicated a very low rate of supporting cell division. In contrast with Waterslager <b>canaries,</b> this low rate of proliferation {{was not associated with}} a measurable rate of hair cell differentiation. In both normal and Waterslager <b>canaries,</b> exposure to traumatizing sound induced a dramatic increase in the rate of cell proliferation. These data show that a very low rate of supporting cell proliferation is normally present in birds, but it is not associated with a corresponding rate differentiation of hair cells. Only an increase above this low ambient rate of supporting cell proliferation, such as that following loss of hair cells, induces the differentiation of new hair cells in birds. The reason why Waterslager <b>canaries</b> do not completely compensate for their inherited hair cell deficit of 30 % is not clear, when they can clearly respond to additional cochlear trauma from noise exposure with an increase in proliferation rate...|$|R

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the <b>Canary</b> Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the <b>Canary</b> Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that organizational effects are not always permanent. In <b>canaries,</b> only the males produce song. Brain regions associated with bird song, including the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale (HVc) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), are larger in male <b>canaries.</b> However, the HVc and RA grow significantly larger in gonadectomized female <b>canaries</b> if given testosterone at 11 months of age and these females even begin to sing. These two brain regions change morphologically due to testosterone, indicating that neural tissue can be changed due to steroid hormones despite being organized to react to sex hormones in a female- or male-specific way.|$|R

Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, Hitler {{considered}} the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish <b>Canary</b> islands to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe.

Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a <b>canary,</b> only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the <b>canary</b> in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female <b>canary</b> as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
