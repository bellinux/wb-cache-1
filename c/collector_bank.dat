40|$|The paper {{conducted}} analyzing collector {{activity in}} Ukraine, bringing the arguments ?for? and ?cons? {{of this type}} of financial activity, the advantages and disadvantages for today. Analyzed the level of progress for collector agencies in Ukraine, Europe and the USA. Investigated the market of collector services, defined demand and supply {{of this type of}} service. The analyze is the consideration of the problematic aspects of <b>collector,</b> <b>banking</b> and legal activities. Research shows that the collector business development in Ukraine is important and promising. Therefore, for the further successful development and formation to create a proper legal framework that would properly regulate the activities of collector services, a program of training for work in this area; borrow European experience of arrears and, as a consequence - Collector ethics; establish the relationship between creditors and collectors and so on. Further study needs antycolector business and its interaction with collector services. ? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????????? ? ???????, ??????????? ????????? ???? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???? ?????????? ????????????, ???????????? ? ?????????? ?? ???????. ??????? ????????? ? ???????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ???????, ?????? ? ???. ?????????? ????? ????????????? ?????, ????????? ????? ? ??????????? ??????? ???? ?????. ????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????, ?????????? ? ??????????????? ????????????. ???????????? ??????????, ??? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ? ?????????????. ??????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????-???????? ????, ??????? ?? ?? ??????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????; ??????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ? ?????? ?????; ?????????????? ??????????? ???? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ?, ??? ????????? ? ????????????? ?????; ???????? ??????????? ????? ??????????? ? ????????????. ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ??? ?????????????? ? ?????????????? ????????...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{knowing the}} Yogyakarta police efforts in {{tackling}} the criminal act of molestation {{done by the}} debt collector and knowing the constraints experienced by the Yogyakarta police in tackling crime done by debt collectors. This study focuses on positive law {{in the form of}} legislation. The method used is qualitative analysis. After carrying out this study, the Yogyakarta police efforts in tackling the crime of molestation done by the debt collectors and the constraints faced by police in tackling crime done to debt collectors can be learned. After that analysis, it can be found that by hiring the services of debt <b>collectors,</b> <b>banks</b> / leases do not need to bother in the case of troubled borrowers in payment of debts. It can be concluded that Yogyakarta Police efforts in tackling crime to done by debt collectors, amongs other things, are pre-emptive, preventive and repressive efforts, and obstacles faced by Yogyakarta Police in tackling crime done by debt collectors, among others, is not knowing the name of the original principal perpetrator fleeing. As a suggestion, the police should be more active in sozializing the rights of the societ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1798, Brown {{heard that}} Mungo Park had {{withdrawn}} from a proposed expedition {{into the interior}} of New Holland (now Australia), leaving a vacancy for a naturalist. At Brown's request, Correia wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: [...] Science is the gainer in this change of man; Mr Brown being a professed naturalist. He is a Scotchman, fit to pursue an object with constance and cold mind. [...] He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though George Caley was sent to New South Wales as a botanical <b>collector</b> for <b>Banks.</b> In 1800, however, Matthew Flinders put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders' proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately.|$|R

50|$|Originally an actor, Morgan {{had many}} {{jobs as a}} young man, {{including}} sewing machine salesman, debt <b>collector</b> and <b>bank</b> clerk. In 1951, Morgan emigrated to Canada where he spent some time working in the Bank of Nova Scotia. In 1955, he emigrated again, this time to Southern Rhodesia. He resumed his acting career there, and was sponsored to return to London after winning a Best Actor award. Upon returning to London, Morgan featured mostly in voice-overs, although {{he did have a}} small role in the James Bond film Dr. No playing the Concierge in the casino who first introduces Sean Connery as James Bond. Whilst between acting jobs in the late 1960s, Morgan began to write seriously and his first novel The Sewing Machine Man was published in 1968. Allegedly autobiographical, the novel revolved around the character Russ Tobin and Morgan has gone on to write a further 18 novels in the series. The latest of the Russ Tobin novels was published in 2005 after Morgan came out of retirement, mainly due to renewed interest in his work via the internet.|$|R

2500|$|Charles the Bald {{permitted}} many economic {{advantages for}} the Jews; as mint-masters, tax <b>collectors,</b> and <b>bank</b> owners, the Jews held significant financial {{power in the}} Frankish kingdoms. [...] In the case of Radhanite merchants, flourishing economic activity in southern Gaul also extended into the Mediterranean {{and parts of the}} Emirate of Cordoba. [...] As Islamic forces claimed hegemony over the Mediterranean, Christian trading networks out of Syria had largely disappeared – leaving a strong power gap in the market for Carolingian Jews. [...] It is here that many Jewish merchants spread their faith, and rumours that Gallic Christian slaves were being sold across the borders in became a major controversy. [...] There are many stories of Christians slaves being [...] "redeemed" [...] from their owners and there were also rumours of [...] "kidnapping" [...] and forced castration by Jewish slave owners. [...] Charles was aware of this power imbalance: he attempted to reform Louis' policies, most nobly prohibiting Jewish bankers to accept Christian slaves as [...] "collateral" [...] for unpaid debts. [...] Amulo was rightly concerned that the Jewish monopoly over tax-collection and trade put Charles into a tight political position; in his Contra Judeos, Amulo encourages Charles to reconsider a more “anti-Jewish policy." ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{plate type}} of solar <b>collector</b> having tube <b>banks</b> {{attached}} to the absorber plate the collector efficiency (Eq. 1) is directly dependent on the heat losses from the absorber plate to surrounding {{as well as on}} a goodness of the absorber plate cooling by working media. Convective and radiate heat losses, for a given glazing and its distance from the absorber plate, are lower when the absorber temperature is kept lower as a consequence of a more efficient heat transfer between the working media passing in tubes {{attached to the}} absorber. Therefore, it is a crucial task to ensure a good contact between the tubes and absorber plate. In practice that is normally done by applying different types of welding or, alternatively, by special gluing procedures. The geometry of the contact area can be preliminary evaluated by means of a numerical computation of the heat transfer from the heated absorber to the fluid passing throughout tubes. Such numerical model is developed in the both 2 D and 3 D domain and provided here together with the results concerning the influence of different geometries, flow conditions and number of the contacts. The resulting efficiency obtained is compared with the performed measurements on the simulated solar collector. The comparison indicates fairly good agreement (within 4 %) between the computed and test results (Fig. 1). The additional method for inspection of the absorber plate cooling efficiency is based on use of IR camera for recording a temperature H. 19. 2 field profile over the absorber plate. The recorded IR images (Fig. 2) clearly indicate places of the improperly performed contact between tubes and plate as well as inefficiently cooled absorber plate areas due to the position and geometry of the tube bank. The recorded temperature field is compared against the numerically obtained one for the case without glazing. The overall collector efficiency is defined as ksu...|$|R
