5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} <b>Circular</b> <b>Economy,</b> with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the <b>Circular</b> <b>Economy,</b> and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the <b>circular</b> <b>economy,</b> namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

40|$|Transforming linear {{businesses}} to <b>circular</b> <b>economies</b> is anticipated by industry and policy {{as a way}} to conciliate economic, societal and environmental interests in a life cycle perspective. This integration of aspects however comes at the price of complexity in manifold facets. In this paper, we suggest a conclusive categorization of complexity through a literature review and collect drivers of complexity. Through coding the literature for weighted interdependencies, we are able to show how drivers and categories interrelate in a contingency matrix. The results help companies to better leverage existing means of complexity planning and management for developing <b>circular</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{environmental}} terms, reuse {{ought to}} be more common than recycling and energy recovery, with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If {{we are going to be}} serious about living in a <b>Circular</b> <b>Economy</b> we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E
2500|$|While it is choices made by {{consumers}} {{that will ultimately}} determine the success of such ventures, there is huge potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and environmental benefits. The EU <b>Circular</b> <b>Economy</b> Package, the Scottish <b>Circular</b> <b>Economy</b> Strategy and the national reuse target set by the Spanish Government are examples of governments recognising that second-hand goods should be a good value mainstream option and are working towards making reuse easier for consumers.|$|E

40|$|Pilot and {{prototyping}} scale investigations were {{undertaken in}} order to evaluate the technical feasibility of producing value-added biopolymers (polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)) as a by-product to essential services of wastewater treatment and environmental protection. A commonly asked question concerns PHA quality that may be expected from surplus biomass produced during biological treatment for water quality improvement. This paper summarizes the findings from a collection of investigations. Alongside the summarized technical efforts, {{attention has been paid}} to the social and economic networks. Such networks are needed {{in order to}} nurture <b>circular</b> <b>economies</b> that would drive value chains in renewable resource processing from contaminated water amelioration into renewable value-added bioplastic products and services. We find commercial promise in the polymer quality and in the process technical feasibility. The next challenge ahead does not reside so much any more in fundamental research and development of the technology but, rather, in social-economic steps that will be necessary to realize first demonstration scale polymer production activities. It is a material supply that will stimulate niche business opportunities that can grow and stimulate technology pull with benefit of real life material product market combinations...|$|R
40|$|The co-production of {{resilience}} in European urban neighbourhoods is explored {{based on the}} experiences from a case study. Within the current ‘resilience imperative’, co-production processes involving multiple stakeholders can be a key factor for increasing cities’ resilience. Co-produced resilience processes are more successful when embedded in collaborative forms of governance such as those associated with urban commons and when fulfilling needed roles with a community. Through {{the application of the}} R-Urban approach in a neighbourhood of Colombes (near Paris), the co-production of a commons-based resilience strategy is described. This involved a group of designers as initiators and a number of citizen as stakeholders of a network of civic hubs. The specific strategies involving a participatory setting, collective governance aspects and <b>circular</b> <b>economies</b> are analysed in the light of co-production theories and practices. Internal and external challenges are identified within the implementation process. The nature of conflicts and negotiations in this co-production approach are discussed, {{and the role of the}} architects/designers as agents within the process is investigated. Reflections from this example are provided on the limits and promises of this approach and the lessons learned from R-Urban for collaborative civic resilience...|$|R

40|$|Current and pending {{legislation}} in the EU and its member {{states as well as}} the environmental awareness of customers are forcing manufacturers to assume end-of-life (EOL) responsibility for their products. This is often done by forcing them to take back out-of-use products. This is not simply and EU issue, as even world-wide, more attention is being placed on the waste from technical products at EOL. The move towards forcing the producer to be responsible for the EOL impact of their products is a major concern for the whole manufacturing industry, as manufacturers are unsure how it will finance this responsibility, paricularly with regard to the cost of disposal and recycling. However, economical recycling can be the ultimate incentive for companies to support <b>Circular</b> <b>Economies.</b> Product design, intended to minimize recycling cost and generate EOL value, requires the simultaneous optimisation of the entire product, including the numerous components and modules from suppliers, which are mainly SMEs. First generation Design for Recycling (DFR) solutions, such as the TOPROCO software, show significant shortcomings. These deficiencies have resulted in a very low degree of adoption within manufacturing industry. ElectSME, a three year European Commission funded research project, has the mandate to identify and address these deficiencies. This paper summarized the findings and efforts of ElectSME. The project endeavours to demonstrate the potential economic benefit to manufacturing supply chains of properly designed products for EOL.

40|$|In {{most current}} farming system classifications (e. g. "conventional"versus "organic"), {{each type of}} farming system {{encompasses}} {{a wide variety of}} farming practices and performances. Classifying farming systems using concepts such as "ecological", "sustainable intensification"or "agro-ecology"is not satisfactory because the concepts "overlap in. definitions, principles and practices, thus creating. confusion in their meanings, interpretations and implications". Existing classifications most often focus either on biotechnical functioning or on socio-economic contexts of farming systems. We reviewed the literature to develop an original analytical framework of the diversity of farming systems and agriculture models that deal with these limits. To describe this framework, we first present the main differences between three biotechnical types of farming systems differing in the role of ecosystem services and external inputs: chemical input-, biological input-and biodiversity-based farming systems. Second, we describe four key socio-economic contexts which determine development and functioning of these farming systems: globalised commodity-based food systems, <b>circular</b> <b>economies,</b> alternative food systems and integrated landscape approaches. Third, we present our original analytical framework of agriculture models, defined as biotechnical types of farming systems associated with one or a combination of socio-economic contexts differing in the role of relationships based on global market prices and "territorial embeddedness". We demonstrate the potential of this framework by describing six key agriculture models and reviewing key scientific issues in agronomy associated with each one. We then analyse the added value of our analytical framework and its generic character. Lastly, we discuss transversal research issues of the agriculture models, concerning the technologies required, their function in the bioeconomy, their multi-criteria and multi-level assessments, their co-existence and the transitions between them...|$|R
