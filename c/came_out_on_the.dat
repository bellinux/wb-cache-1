5|$|Macnamara {{they spent}} 15 days in September 1795 blockading a French grain convoy {{in the port}} of Genoa. The convoy was {{protected}} by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene.|$|E

A key point was the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 41, given that he had scored big centuries in the first innings of the previous two tests. Andrew Flintoff was dismissed cheaply and Sri Lanka had gained momentum in reducing England to 118/5.|$|E

25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side and could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it to plow the tracks and the section from the tracks to the sidewalk. It remained in operation until 1950.|$|E
25|$|Black began 2007 with RQW's No Pain, No Gain event, {{having to}} defend her Women's Championship against American wrestlers Cheerleader Melissa and MsChif but went on to lose singles matches against both of them, first to MsChif the next day for 3 Count Wrestling. The day after {{this was the first}} ChickFight to be held in the UK where Black {{advanced}} to the finals of a three-round tournament after defeating Daizee Haze and Lacey, but coming up short against Melissa. Her feud with Melissa continued at RQW's Taking on the World where she tagged with fellow Melissa enemy MsChif to take on the Cheerleader and her own long-standing rival Jetta. The match also served as a warm up for ChickFight VIII where Black was booked to meet Melissa again to crown the first TransAtlantic Champion; Black <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> losing end of both matches.|$|E
25|$|The early Pacers <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{short end}} {{of two of the}} most one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was long past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on {{to become one of the}} {{greatest}} scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens, who played one year for the Pacers with little impact. In 1983–84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history—including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton.|$|E

Wisconsin's first drive would result in a three–and–out. On the Nittany Lions next drive, they drove down to the Badgers 17-yard line but would have to settle for a field goal attempt. The 34-yard field goal attempt by K Sam Ficken was blocked by the Badgers. Wisconsin would take over but after one first down, they would again punt. Penn State would punt they ball back to Wisconsin after their own three–and–out. The Badgers then were driving into Penn State territory as the first quarter came to an end. The Badgers continued their drive and would score on a 4-yard touchdown pass to TE Brian Wozniak from QB Joel Stave. Another three–and–out for the Nittany Lions would lead to another scoring drive for the Badgers. This was after an 11–play drive for the Badgers which was capped with a 20-yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. Penn State answered on their next drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to WR Eugene Lewis from Christian Hackenberg. Wisconsin then got to about midfield but were forced to punt. Penn State then ran one final play before halftime. The game was tied 14–14 at the half.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} the song {{on two of}} her tours. On her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour where it was performed {{as a part of}} the encore. Madonna <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage in a bright red flamenco dress and {{performed the}} song, assisted by her backup singers Niki Haris, Donna De Lory and Debra Parson. Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987. Almost 30 years later, Madonna performed an acoustic, guitar-driven version of the song during the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). The wardrobe for the performance consisted of a gypsy inspired ensemble, made up of shawl, lace gloves, long black skirt with silk fringes, a hat with silk flowers on it, and high-heeled knee-high lace-up leather boots. After the song, the singer admitted that it took her [...] "a hell of a long time" [...] to answer who the titular girl was in the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was the [...] "I Quit" [...] {{match for the}} WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a {{turntable}} mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL {{were able to get}} in offense. One part of the match saw Cena backdrop JBL through the announce table. Shortly after, JBL hit Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. Back in the ring, JBL hit Cena with a Clothesline from Hell thrice. Cena later hit JBL with a Five Knuckle Shuffle and a FU. Later in the match, up the ramp area, Cena threw JBL face first through a television monitor. The match ended when JBL said [...] "I quit", as Cena prepared to hit him with an exhaust pipe, which came from the semi truck that was at the ramp area. As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E

Robinson, however, noticed that Fullmer was {{vulnerable}} to the left hook. Fullmer headed into their May rematch as a 3–1 favorite. In {{the first two rounds}} Robinson followed Fullmer around the ring, however in the third round he changed tactics and made Fullmer come to him. At the start of the fourth round Robinson <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attack and stunned Fullmer, and when Fullmer returned with his own punches, Robinson traded with him, as opposed to clinching as he had done in their earlier fight. The fight was fairly even after four rounds. But in the fifth, Robinson was able to win the title back for a fourth time by knocking out Fullmer with a lightning fast, powerful left hook. Boxing critics have referred to the left-hook which knocked out Fullmer as [...] "the perfect punch".*, ibhof.com. Retrieved June 6, 2007. [...] It marked the first time in 44 career fights that Fullmer had been knocked out, and when someone asked Robinson after the fight how far the left hook had travelled, Robinson replied: [...] "I can't say.

500|$|Brittan {{married his}} {{deceased}} wife's sister Sophia as his second wife. This was not legal in England or {{acceptable to the}} Church of England. He intended to marry in Denmark where it was legal and the necessary documents for the application were eventually collected and countersigned by the lord Mayor of London on 1 September 1851. However, {{for some reason the}} wedding was performed in Gretna Green in Scotland. As was not unusual at the time, having caused such a scandal was responded to by emigrating, which the newly-weds did a month after the ceremony. [...] They sailed for Christchurch in New Zealand on the William Hyde with his other sister-in law and her 2 children, which left Deal, Kent on 21 October 1851.

[...] Guise Brittan had married Louisa Chandler, a sister of Joseph's wives.

500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side of it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
