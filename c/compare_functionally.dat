Teleost fishes have {{a single}} MR and duplicate GRs that show variable sensitivities to mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. How these receptors <b>compare</b> <b>functionally</b> to tetrapod MR and GR, and the evolutionary significance of maintaining two GRs, remains unclear. Results: We used up to seven steroids (including aldosterone, cortisol and 11 -deoxycorticosterone [DOC]) to compare the ligand specificity of the ligand binding domains of corticosteroid receptors between a mammal (Mus musculus) and the midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus), a teleost model for steroid regulation of neural and behavioral plasticity. Variation in mineralocorticoid sensitivity was considered in a broader phylogenetic context by examining the aldosterone sensitivity of MR and GRs from the distantly related daffodil cichlid (Neolamprologus pulcher), another teleost model for neurobehavioral plasticity. Both teleost species had a single MR and duplicate GRs. All MRs were sensitive to DOC, consistent with the hypothesis that DOC was the initial ligand of the ancestral MR.

40|$|Levels of {{linguistic}} {{structure and the}} rate of change Until recently, most studies of language change have nec€ssadly tteated one area of language at a time: phonology, grammar, or the leicon. r At present, however, we know relatively little about relationships between changes in different areas of language structue. We do know, for example, that c€rtain types of vocabulary are more resistent to replacement han others, that cer-tain morphological configurations are more susceptible to analogic leveling than othen, and that certain combinations of syntactic rules are morc stable than othe$, but we have as yet had little opportunity to <b>comPare</b> <b>functionally</b> equivalent changes {{in different parts of the}} grammar. Just such an opportuniiy exists among the Northem Iroquoian languages' Two sets of mechanisms intenct pervasively tfuoughout all levels of struc-ture in all of these languages. One set reflects primarily the speaker's evalua' tion of the hearer's knowledge. Speakers exploit these mechanisms primarily to arange infomation in such a way as to be most easily and readily under-stood. The other set, sometimes termed evidential, reflects the speaker's evaluation of his/her own knowledge, i. e., the reliabitty of the information communicated.

40|$|An {{environmental}} risk assessment for the introduction of genetically modified crops includes assessing the consequences for biodiversity. In this study arthropod biodiversity was measured using pitfall traps in potato agro-ecosystems in Ireland and The Netherlands over two years. We tested the impact of site, year, potato genotype, and fungicide management regime on arthropod community composition. Three potato genotypes were compared: the cultivar Désirée, susceptible to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans, a genetically modified cisgenic clone of Désirée resistant to P. infestans and the cultivar Sarpo Mira, also resistant to late blight. We aimed to test several ways to measure biodiversity {{in the context of}} risk assessment by using both univariate biodiversity indices and multivariate ordination methods, categorizing the pitfall trap catch by taxonomic or functional category. The Shannon-Wiener and Simpson biodiversity indices both showed strong differences between sites, years and potato genotypes, but showed no effects of the fungicide management regime. The effect of genotype was due to cultivar differences between Désirée and Sarpo Mira rather than between the GM-event (A 15 - 31) and its isogenic comparator Désirée. Multivariate permutation analyses and RDA ordination confirmed these findings and also showed interactions between year, site and either genotype or treatment. The added value of the multivariate analysis was that it provided information on the specific arthropod groups or taxa that contributed to community structure. Multivariate analyses are recommended for use as a sensitive method to <b>compare</b> <b>functionally</b> important arthropod groups driving community structure within the framework of {{environmental risk}} assessments, or for the process of indicator species selection...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{observed}} an incredible increase in location-specific information provided voluntarily by individuals and disseminated via the internet. The emergence of this Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as Goodchild first described it in 2007 has attracted considerable interest within the GIScience research community. As a special type of user generated content, it offers great potential to produce up-to-date and near real-time information related to any place on Earth, even though overall accuracy remains an issue of debate. Location sharing services (LSS) such as ‘foursquare’, ‘Gowalla’, and ‘Facebook Places’ collect {{hundreds of millions of}} user-driven footprints or ‘check-ins’. Those footprints provide a unique opportunity to study social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and model patterns of human mobility. However, the amount and frequency of VGI is not evenly distributed and recent research considers it directly related to socioeconomic characteristics of its contributors (i. e.,geographic and economic constraints, individual social status). Particularly in the context of population dynamics studies, VGI may provide a data source that is more accessible and current as well as less expensive and timeconsuming than traditional activity survey data. VGI generated on micro-blogging services and location-based social networks (LBSN) bear the greatest resemblance to the activity diary that time geographers are familiar with.

Homology modeling of SpaK and SpaR yielded preliminary structural models based on a best template for SpaK comprising a dimer of a histidine kinase, and for SpaR a response regulator protein. Our LGA code was used to identify multi-domain proteins with structure homology to both modeled structures, yielding a set of domain-fusion templates then used to model a hypothetical SpaK/SpaR complex. The models were used to identify putative functional residues and residues at the protein-protein interface, and bioinformatics was used to <b>compare</b> <b>functionally</b> and structurally relevant residues in corresponding positions among proteins with structural homology to the templates. Models of the complex were evaluated in light of known properties of the functional residues within two-component systems involving His-Asp phosphorelays. Based on this analysis, a phosphotransferase complexed with a beryllofluoride was selected as the optimal template for modeling a SpaK/SpaR complex conformation. In vitro phosphorylation studies performed using wild type and site-directed SpaK mutant proteins validated the predictions derived from application of the structure-driven domain-fusion method: SpaK was phosphorylated in the presence of (32) P-ATP and the phosphate moiety was subsequently transferred to SpaR, supporting the hypothesis that SpaK and SpaR function as sensor and response regulator, respectively, in a two-component signal transduction system, and furthermore suggesting that the structure-driven domain-fusion approach correctly predicted a physical interaction between SpaK and SpaR.

40|$|Abstract: The {{specific}} function of interstitial macro-phages (IM) in the lung is poorly understood because of difficulties in isolating these cells in high purity or large number. In the present studies, a pure population of en-zymatically isolated IM and lung macrophages obtained mechanically from the lung were <b>compared</b> <b>functionally</b> with alveolar macrophages recovered by lavage (AM). Macrophages isolated mechanically from the tissue and AM displayed similarly {{high levels of}} Fc-receptor mcdi-ated phagocytosis. In contrast, IM phagocytized significantly fewer opsonized sheep red blood cells per macrophage than AM. In addition, although some varia-tions in the amounts of nitric oxide and superoxide anion produced by AM and macrophages obtained by mechani-cal tissue disruption were observed, these subpopulations released significantly more of these mediators than IM. These data support the concept that macrophages isolated by mechanical disruption of the tissue represent a sub-population of AM. We also found that, in contrast to AM, IM did not respond synergistically to combinations of IFN-’y and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor a in terms of nitric oxide production. Furthermore, regulation of superoxide anion release in AM and IM by LPS and/or IFN-’y was distinct.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of as-sociation aspects, which are a linguistic mechanism for the AspectJ lan-guage that concisely associates aspect instances to object groups by ex-tending the per-object aspects in AspectJ. This mechanism allows an aspect instance to be associated {{to a group of}} objects, and by providing a new pointcut primitive to specify aspect instances as execution context of advice. With association aspects, we can straightforwardly implement crosscutting concerns that have stateful behavior related to a particular group of objects. The new pointcut primitive can more flexibly specify aspect instances when compared against previous implicit mechanisms. We implemented a compiler for association aspects by modifying the AspectJ compiler, which reduces the size of data structures for keeping associations. Our benchmark tests confirm that the overheads of associ-ation aspects are reasonably small when <b>compared</b> against <b>functionally</b> equivalent aspects in pure AspectJ that manually manage associations. The expressiveness of association aspects is demonstrated through de-velopment of an integrated development environment with and without association aspects. ...|$|R

Artificial Intelligence concepts, such as expert systems focus {{on the problem of}} representing, in high-level code, complex real-world decision making problems. The author therefore proposes that the use of expert system technology may provide an improved means of representing operational decision tasks and that as a consequence, apriori possibilities may exist in the context of model experimentation based on alternative operational policies. The thesis further investigates the nature of operational decision making and the potential need to represent within a model, inter-dependencies between decision makers. A prototype system called ESSIM is developed which comprises of two interlinked components, a discrete event simulation module and expert system module. The benefits of the proposed approach are then assessed by <b>comparing</b> the <b>functionally</b> of ESSIM with conventional modelling techniques. The comparison is carried out by developing three alternative models of an automated container port, one of these using ESSIM. Experiments were then devised and executed which seek to draw conclusions on the thesis proposal...|$|R
