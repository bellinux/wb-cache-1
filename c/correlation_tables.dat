40|$|Data {{prefetching}} is {{a popular}} technique for tolerating long memory access latencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of prefetching: memory-side correlation prefetching implemented in a user-level thread. The prefetching thread runs on a general-purpose processor embedded in the main memory. By allocating the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> in main memory, we can afford the large space required by the table. In addition, the scheme can be supported with few modifications to the L 2 cache and no modification to the main processor core. We introduce a new organization of the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> and a new prefetching algorithm that enable fast and accurate farahead prefetching with high coverage. Overall, our evaluation shows that the algorithm effectively prefetches irregular applications, speeding up three applications {{by an average of}} 1. 28.

40|$|In her thesis, {{the author}} {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} education and selected types of crime (economic, property and violent crime) {{in the context of}} the national economy. The aim of the thesis is to show that the relationship between crime and education is much more complex than it may appear on the basis of current findings and observations and that, besides education, the criminal career of an offender is also significantly influenced by his/her family background and, therefore, it is appropriate to include this factor into the analysis. The analytical section of the thesis is divided into two separate parts. The first part, which deals with the phenomenon of crime in general, describes the dependency of individual crime types, education and family background by means of tables and diagrams showing percentages of individual variables and using contingency tables and <b>correlation</b> <b>tables.</b> The analysis confirms that there is a significant relationship between crime and the combination of education and family background.

40|$|RNames (rnames. luomus. fi/) is an {{open access}} {{relational}} database linking stratigraphic units with each other that {{are considered to be}} time-equivalent or time overlapping. RNames is also a tool to correlate among stratigraphic units. The structure of the database allows {{for a wide range of}} queries and applications. Currently three algorithms are available, which calculate a set of <b>correlation</b> <b>tables</b> with Ordovician stratigraphic units time binned into high-resolution chronostratigraphic slices (Global Ordovician Stages, Stage Slices, Time Slices). The ease of availability of differently binned stratigraphic units and the potential to create new schemes are the main advantages and goals of RNames. Different timebinned stratigraphic units can be matched with other databases and allow for simultaneous up-to-date analyses of stratigraphically constrained estimates in various schemes. We exemplify these new possibilities with our compiled Ordovician data and analyse fossil collections of the Paleobiology Database based on the three different binning schemes. The presented diversity curves are the first sub-stage level, global, marine diversity curves for the Ordovician. A comparison among the curves reveals that differences in time slicing have a major effect on the shape of the curve. Despite uncertainties in Early and Late Ordovician diversities, our calculations confirm earlier estimates that Ordovician diversification climaxed globally during the Darriwilian stage...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes using a User-Level Memory Thread (ULMT) for {{correlation}} prefetching. In this approach, a user thread runs on a general-purpose processor in main memory, {{either in}} the memory controller chip or in a DRAM chip. The thread performs correlation prefetching in software, sending the prefetched data into the L 2 cache of the main processor. This approach requires minimal hardware beyond the memory processor: The <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> is a software data structure that resides in main memory, while the main processor only needs a few modifications to its L 2 cache {{so that it can}} accept incoming prefetches. In addition, the approach has wide applicability, as it can effectively prefetch even for irregular applications. Finally, it is very flexible, as the prefetching algorithm can be customized by the user on an application basis. Our simulation results show that, through a new design of the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> and prefetching algorithm, our scheme delivers good results. Specifically, nine mostly-irregular applications show an average speedup of 1. 32. Furthermore, our scheme works well in combination with a conventional processor-side sequential prefetcher, in which case the average speedup increases to 1. 46. Finally, by exploiting the customization of the prefetching algorithm, we increase the average speedup to 1. 53...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 56 - 61. This study aims {{to explore}} the effects of gender, income and education level on environmental concern. This aim is based upon a general understanding that environmental problems {{have to be considered}} in urban areas for a sustainable world. The empirical study has been conducted in a developing site of Ankara; Çukurambar in which people from different income and education levels live. 64 participants (16 from each group; 8 males, 8 females) from different income levels (low income, middle income, upper- middle income and high income) have been selected through stratified random sampling method. (A questionnaire which includes questions about both demographic information; education, income, family population etc. and environmental issues has been made). The results derived from <b>correlation</b> <b>tables</b> and T- tests show that gender has no significant effect on environmental concern in this case. Education level has a small affect on people in terms of environmental consciousness, however, it increases peoples’ interest and make them watch programs about environmental issues. The most significant determinant of the selected variables; gender, education and income level, is the income level. Although there is no significant difference among other groups, the high income group is significantly different. People, who belong to high income level, show less concern about environment.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods may create barriers to {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) since the focus and outcomes generated could be quite different. Furthermore, these could lead to different interpretations and hence affect the robustness of LCA. While previous studies have attempted to compare various LCIA methods, their results are limited to the cases {{that were used in}} their respective studies. To assist LCA participants in selecting a suitable LCIA method to achieve the LCA goals, it is necessary to identify both the similarities and the differences between the commonly used LCIA methods. The most reliable and consistent way to carry out such analysis is by referring to the environmental impact categories of the various LCIA methods. This paper proposes a new approach to compare the LCIA methods by using a set of <b>correlation</b> <b>Tables,</b> which describe the differences of the impact categories being investigated. It is found that the results generated by different LCIA methods in terms of climate change, acidification, ozone depletion, and energy resources are indeed quite consistent. However, ecotoxicity and human toxicity are the two impact factors with the greatest variations amongst different LCIA methods. The results of this study are cross-validated by referring to previous studies, and the results confirm that they are generally in line with the previous observations. This study should help deepen our understanding of the divergences of various LCIA methods and thus facilitate the choice of appropriate LCIA methods for LCA...|$|E
