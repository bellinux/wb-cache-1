5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant {{that it did not}} survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his <b>control.</b> <b>His</b> destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help <b>control</b> <b>his</b> time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E

5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|After the Black Order is rebuilt, Lenalee and {{her friends}} learn Allen is the vessel of the 14th Noah; {{eventually}} the Noah will <b>control</b> <b>his</b> body forcing the other exorcists to kill him if he becomes a Noah. Later, when Allen is imprisoned because of his transformations and escapes from the Order {{with the other two}} Noah, Lenalee tries to make him return. However, she fails as Allen confirms he still considers the Order his home before his departure. Three months later, Lenalee tries to conceal Yu Kanda's journey to find Allen from Komui. When Allen's mind is about to disappear from his body {{as a result of the}} Noah, Lenalee appears in an illusion allowing him to regain his desire to live.|$|E

5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} <b>control</b> <b>his</b> destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|As Hand of the King, Tyrion {{attempts}} to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> cruel and incompetent nephew Joffrey, and defend Kings Landing from Stannis Baratheon, the rival claimant to the Iron Throne.

Shae implores Tyrion to move to Pentos with her, but he opts to remain in Kings Landing.|$|E

5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance {{with the}} earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to {{take the form of}} Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E

5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can <b>control</b> <b>his</b> symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E

5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train stop system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} an {{immediate}} success when published– by Beilby and Bewick themselves– in 1797. Just prior to its publication, Bewick published an anthology in 1795 {{on the study of}} character in the Kings and Queens of England. Given the success of the 1797 publication of his bird illustrations, Bewick started work at once on the second volume, Water Birds, but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby. Bewick was unable to <b>control</b> <b>his</b> feelings and resolve issues quietly, so the partnership ended, turbulently and expensively, leaving Bewick with his own workshop. Bewick had to pay £20, equivalent to about £20,400 in 2011, in lawyer's fees, and more than £21 for Beilby's share of the workshop equipment.|$|E
