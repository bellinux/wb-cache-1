40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} {{materials such as}} recycled <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and recycled glass account for a major proportion of the waste materials present in landfills in Australia. Using recycled glass and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> in <b>road</b> pavement applications would significantly {{reduce the need for}} quarry-based virgin materials. Furthermore, recycled materials could be used in parts of the country where aggregate sources are scarce. This paper discusses the suitability and applicability of recycled glass when used in blends with <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> for <b>road</b> pavement applications. Performance of the blends was measured using an extensive suite of geotechnical engineering laboratory tests including basic classification tests along with modified compaction, California Bearing Ratio and Los Angeles abrasion tests.

40|$|Road {{aggregate}} is {{the largest}} component contributing to road construction. In Sri Lanka, naturally occurring sources that suits construction work are not available. Therefore, this requirement is most commonly fulfilled by excavating <b>rocks</b> and <b>crushing</b> them to suitable sizes. Demand for road aggregate has increased due to the current development of highway sector in Sri Lanka, {{and it is difficult}} to satisfy the requirement. In some areas of the country, especially in the Northern region, it is hard to fulfill these requirements due to several reasons such as archeological sites and environmental-sensitive forest areas. Therefore, quality control and fulfillment of the requirement with the available limited sources is a challenge. Considering the use of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> for <b>road</b> construction, it is important to select materials in an acceptable quality. Especially when <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> is used for the road bases and surfacing, these properties play a vital role in ensuring durability. To ensure the quality, various tests have been introduced by relevant authorities. When selecting a source to produce <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> as <b>road</b> construction material, production from the selected source have to satisfy certain requirements. The los angeles abration value (LAAV) and aggregate impact value (AIV) is the two important tests which ensure the strength requirement of road aggregate. With the blasting operation, a considerable variation of rock fragmentation is noted. This is mainly due to the explosive quantity used for blasting operation. Types and features of explosives and blasting design also play an important role of rock mass fragmentation. In Sri Lanka, blasting design patterns and the explosives used do not vary considerably. But usage of explosives changes in continuous operation even the place is unchanged. These changes may be due to environmental conditions such as rainy seasons or due to some significant change of nature and properties of rock mass. The objective of this study was to identify the changes of AIV and LAAV with the use of explosive percentage used for the blasting operation and improve the strength of road aggregate by controlling the explosive usage for aggregate production. There was not found a relationship between explosive usage for blasting and the aggregate strength properties. But the significant relationship was found between the LAAV and AIV of the aggregate...|$|R

Construction and Demolition (C&D) materials such as concrete, excavation stone (basalt) and brick make up a significant proportion of the waste materials present in landfills in Australia. Substituting the quarry produced <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> with recycled materials in road pavement subbase applications would significantly reduce the demand for landfill sites and would potentially provide an opportunity to use recycled material as aggregates in parts of the state where aggregates sources are becoming scarce. This paper discusses the suitability of using blends of recycled glass and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> as <b>road</b> pavemcnt subbase materials with mixtures of 10 % to 50 % by mass of recycled glass. The experimental works undertaken in this study includes basic classification tests along with modified compaction, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Los Angeles Abrasion tests to assess the suitability of the blends.

40|$|Bottom ash, {{originating}} from {{municipal solid waste}} incineration (MSWI), is a potential road construction material. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe what differences in resource use and emissions that can be expected if <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> in the sub-base of a road in the Stockholm region in Sweden were to be substituted by MSWI bottom ash, taking into account the whole life cycle of the road and including alternative disposal of the bottom ash. An environmental systems analysis approach based on a life cycle perspective was outlined and used in a case study. It was found that the studied alternatives would cause different types of potential environmental impact; whereas, <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> in the <b>road's</b> sub-base would lead to larger use of resources, the alternative with MSWI bottom ash in the sub-base leads to a larger contaminant leaching. The results are sensitive to the transport distance for the road material and to conditions affecting the leaching from the road. The differences between energy uses in the two alternatives derive mainly from production of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and from landfilling of MSWI bottom ash, whereas, the metal emissions occur in the use stage of the road's life cycle.

50|$|Trap rock, i.e. basalt or diabase, has {{a variety}} of uses. A major use for basalt is <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> for <b>road</b> and housing {{construction}} in concrete, macadam, and paving stones. Because of its insensitivity to chemical influences, resistance to mechanical stress, high dry relative density, frost resistance, and sea water resistance, trap rock is used as ballast for railroad track bed and hydraulic engineering rock (riprap) in coast and bank protection for paving embankments. It is also used for the production of cast rock that is used in corrosion and abrasion protection, as for sewage pipes and acid-resistant rocks. Other uses of trap rock include gardening and landscaping, for the production of millstones, for the production of mineral fibres (basalt wool), as a flux in ceramic masses and glazes, for the production of glass ceramics, crushed as a filter aggregate (air filtration of poison gas in ABC bunkers), as filter bed material water treatment facilities, and ground as a soil improvement product. Trap rock has been used to construct buildings and churches: Trinity Church on the Green with trap rock quarried from Eli Whitney's quarry, is a particularly colorful example of a red-orange-brown-colored, natural-faced trap rock. It was also used for foundations and railroad beds in the New Haven area.|$|R

On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made of asphalt and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock.</b> The other <b>road</b> segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|R
40|$|Roads in many {{northern}} climates like Saskatchewan can undergo {{structural failure}} caused by frost action and substructure moisture problems. Frost action can be efficiently controlled by eliminating {{at least one}} of the following conditions: moisture; freezing temperatures; and frost susceptible soils. However, effective use of shredded tire material could provide an environmentally sustainable solution for waste tires and could relieve pressure on limited quality aggregate resources. The City of Saskatoon has successfully incorporated <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and <b>crushed</b> recycled concrete as a subsurface road drainage layer to mitigate substructure drainage and frost issues. However, the price of crushed high value aggregates can be cost prohibitive and at times these materials are not available in quantities required. Previous research has documented that shredded tires are efficient in controlling frost action by providing thermal insulation and free drainage, but shredded tires performed poorly as a structural support layer with low mechanical stiffness and high compressibility properties. The goal of this research was to provide improved pavement performance with respect to road substructure moisture drainage and frost mitigation. The specific objectives of this research were to: •	Quantify the mechanical properties of shredded tires and investigate the mechanical behavior of mixes of shredded tires with and without sand blended into the tire matrix as compared to conventional subbase and base coarse materials; •	Determine the permeability of shredded tires and investigate the effect of sand on the permeability of shredded tire/sand mixes as compared to conventional granular base and subbase materials, and; •	Compare the structural primary response behavior and capital cost of alternate road structures constructed with shredded tires and mixes of shredded tire and sand as a free draining subbase material compared to conventional drainage layers and road structures. The hypothesis of this research was that the mechanical behavior of shredded tire material, used as a road substructure layer, can be improved by blending it with free draining sand. It was also hypothesized that blending shredded tire with free draining sand will have improved drainage compared to conventional granular subbase and base course materials. Volumetric and mechanistic material properties and structural performance behavior of shredded tires and shredded tire/sand mixes in the mix ratios (by volume) of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were evaluated and compared to City of Saskatoon subbase materials: <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and granular base; as well as Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SMHI) Type 6 subbase. Laboratory characterization showed that 100 % shredded tire materials were uniformly graded indicating high amounts of voids. The addition of sand resulted in a reduction of interparticle air voids. Results from strength and stiffness characterization tests indicated that 100 % shredded tires exhibited low structural stiffness, but this behavior was improved as the quantity of sand in the shredded tire was increased. The 100 % shredded tire material was determined to have a dynamic modulus value of 5 MPa, whereas shredded tires/sand blends at the ratios of 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand gave dynamic moduli values of 30 MPa, 110 MPa and 158 MPa, respectively. For comparison, SMHI Type 6 subbase, City of Saskatoon <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and granular base exhibited dynamic moduli values of 94 MPa, 174 MPa and 471 MPa, respectively. Permeability characterization indicated that the 100 % shredded tire materials were free draining at 1. 42 cm/s. Permeability decreased from 1. 42 cm/s with 100 % shredded tire to 0. 0026 cm/s with 1 Tire: 3 Sand. However, the shredded tire/sand mixes maintained permeability values higher than sand (0. 0013 cm/s). SMHI Type 6 subbase and granular materials were found to have a permeability of 0. 0018 cm/s and 0. 000025 cm/s, respectively, while <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> was free draining with a permeability of 1. 12 cm/s. Structural behavior of 100 % shredded tire, shredded tire/sand mixes and City of Saskatoon subbase materials were studied in road models using a 3 -D numerical road modeling software that encoded triaxial material constitutive relationships determined in this research. A typical City of Saskatoon road structure was assumed for all road structures considered in this study with varying subbase material so as to directly compare the structural effect of the shredded tire with conventional road materials under primary load limits. Modeled results of the 100 % shredded tire and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> <b>roads</b> showed peak surface deflections of 2. 19 mm and 0. 73 mm, respectively. Peak surface deflection under primary load limits was found to decrease with an increase in sand quantity within the shredded tire layer. Based on the modeling results, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand yielded peak surface deflections of 1. 01 mm and 0. 96 mm, respectively. For comparative purposes, road structures with SMHI Type 6 subbase deflected at 1. 14 mm. Field test sections were constructed at Adolph Way in Saskatoon to compare the structural performance of shredded tire to <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> (currently specified by City of Saskatoon for drainage layers) in a typical residential road in Saskatoon. Unfortunately, both <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> (control) and shredded tire sections were found to deflect above acceptable limits due to high moisture conditions within the deep subgrade. Therefore, deeper excavation was required and the test sections were not constructed. The Adolph Way field experimentation of shredded tire showed that shredded tire road systems can be effectively constructed in the field, but showed the same sensitivity to poor subgrade conditions as <b>crushed</b> <b>rock.</b> Capital cost analysis showed the 100 % shredded tire and shredded tire/sand subbase layers to be less expensive than City of Saskatoon specified <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> drainage layers. The 100 % shredded tire layer was estimated at a total cost of $ 2. 93 /m 2 while 1 Tire: 1 Sand, 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand were estimated at $ 4. 39 /m 2, $ 4. 88 /m 2 and $ 5. 12 /m 2, respectively. SMHI Type 6 subbase, <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> and granular base layers were estimated at a total cost of $ 5. 85 /m 2, $ 13. 95 /m 2 and $ 9. 00 /m 2, respectively for equivalent thickness. From the structural, permeability and economic perspective of this research, the 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand materials proved to be cost efficient as well as technically viable options for mitigating frost action as compared with City of Saskatoon <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> materials evaluated. The use of shredded tire/sand mixes of 1 Tire: 2 Sand and 1 Tire: 3 Sand in urban local road structures with low traffic volumes are therefore recommended as a cost effective subbase drainage layer material...|$|R

40|$|Concrete in Sweden has {{traditionally}} been manufactured with natural aggregate from glaciofluvial eskers. There {{is a need to}} preserve the remaining eskers because of their cultural value and importance for water filtration, thus natural aggregate has to be replaced. The most realistic alternative is to use <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks.</b> The major problem with <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> in concrete production is the workability. This is because <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> have less favorable properties. The fragments are flakier and have a rougher surface than natural aggregates that have been rounded in water. Without any amelioration of the <b>crushed</b> <b>rock,</b> to reach a certain workability and strength, the amount of cement in the mix has to be increased. Cement production requires large amounts of energy and the decarbonation of limestone releases large amounts of CO 2. Combined, the release of CO 2, due to burning and decarbonation of limestone, accounts for about 5 % of the global CO 2 emissions. An increase in cement consumptions is less desirable. Thus to replace natural aggregates, the use of <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> has to be optimized as regard cement consumption. Several crushed aggregates, most from granitic rocks, from all over Sweden were analysed in this study. These <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> were characterized according to their grading, specific surface, shape and petrography and compared to natural sand. Rheological tests that reveals the workability in detail was performed on mortars. The tests showed that as regard workability the 0 - 2 mm fraction is the most important factor. Further, the maximum aggregate size was gradually increased up to 16 mm, to have a more realistic approach to the concrete produced by the building industry. The results showed that with grading optimization and superplasticizer, some <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> can be used for concrete production without increasing, and even decreasing, the cement consumption. This research also contemplated the use of filler. As a mineral admixture it can improve the compressive strength. It {{can also be used to}} replace cement; a replacement up to 20 kg/m 3 of cement by filler can be done without significant effect on compressive strength...|$|R

The <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> used in this study originates from 'basalt floaters' or surface excavation rock (basalt), which commonly occurs near the surface to the north and west of Melbourne, Australia. The engineering characteristics of various proportions of crushed brick blends with <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> obtained from extensive laboratory testing are presented in this paper. The engineering properties obtained were compared with existing local road authority specifications for pavement sub-base or light-duty base material and backfill material for drainage systems to ascertain the potential use of crushed brick blends. The materials for the experimental works were collected from a recycling facility in Victoria, Australia...|$|R
