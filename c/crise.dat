25|$|Editors Douglas <b>Crise</b> and Stephen Mirrione were {{involved}} in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrone that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.|$|E
2500|$|Birdman was {{edited by}} Douglas <b>Crise</b> and Stephen Mirrione, who had both {{worked with the}} {{director}} before on 21 Grams and Babel. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but <b>Crise</b> and Mirrone already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they {{had the ability to}} introduce cuts. Mirrone said that in Birdman Iñárritu had [...] "let go of that safety net". Because of this the editors needed {{to be involved in the}} project early on, and during principal photography <b>Crise</b> was on set every day. (Mirrone was busy so unable to be in New York.) <b>Crise</b> was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu [...] "dragged it out" [...] of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director <b>Crise</b> also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to <b>Crise</b> early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, <b>Crise</b> described it as [...] "pretty traditional". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.|$|E

2500|$|The fort's {{construction}} was improved under the German Empire, which renamed it Fort Goeben after a Prussian general who had distinguished {{himself at the}} Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870. Immediate German construction focused on dispersing gun batteries to flanking positions and reinforcing protection for personnel and ammunition against shellfire. In 1885, new explosives led to a massive increase in the explosive power of artillery projectiles, the so-called <b>crise</b> de l'obus-torpille ("torpedo-shell crisis). This development made unprotected artillery and masonry construction entirely obsolete, as the new shells could easily destroy masonry structures. [...] In response, concrete and earth sheltering was employed in new forts, and older forts were reinforced under the new principles. In 1885 a program of reinforcement covered some critical areas of Queuleu with concrete and provided better infantry shelters. As an early fort, Queuleu has relatively few underground passages compared to the Moselstellung forts of the 1890s, but does feature countermine passages extending {{from the front of}} the fort.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival in}} France {{of the first}} sound film, The Jazz Singer in 1927 caused a {{revolution}} in the French movie business, and was quickly followed by the production of French film musicals at the studios just outside Paris. [...] New French films featured the singing talents of Jean Gabin (Pépé le Moko, Cœur de lilas), and Danielle Darrieux (La <b>crise</b> est finis, Mon cœur t'appelle, Un mauves garçon), Maurice Chevalier et Claudette Colbert (La Chanson de Paris) both made successful careers in Hollywood; [...] Colbert remained in the U.S., [...] but Chevalier returned to Paris and continued his singing career on the Paris music hall stage. [...] Music hall singers, including Fernandel, Frehel and Josephine Baker, began making musical films. [...] The 1934 musical film Zouzou, with Jean Gabin and Josephine Baker, was the first film to star a black actress. The French music industry was born, as movie studios merged with record companies and used films to promote records. The route to success for Paris singers became the recording and film.|$|E

It is impossible, in an article which is already too long, to inquire how it may be replaced by a better; and it is the less necessary to do so, as a second edition of Mr. Spencer's remarkable essay on this subject has just been published.

6000|$|On a {{farm near}} the cure's house in Cideville was another shepherd, named Thorel, {{a man of}} forty, {{described}} as dull, illiterate, and given to boasting about his powers as a disciple of the venerable G. Popular opinion decided that G. employed Thorel to procure his vengeance; it was necessary that a sorcerer should touch his intended victim, and G. had not the same conveniency for doing so as Thorel. In old witch trials we sometimes find the witch kissing her destined prey. {277} Thorel, so it was said, succeeded in touching, on Nov. 25, 1850, M. Tinel's two pupils, in a crowd at a sale of wood. The lads, of fifteen and twelve, were named Lemonier and Bunel. For what had gone before, we have, so far, only public chatter, for what followed we have the sworn evidence in court of the cure's pupils, in January and February, 1851. According to Lemonier, on Nov. 26, while studying, he heard light blows of a hammer, these recurred daily, about 5. p.m. When M. Tinel, his tutor, said plus fort, the noises were louder. To condense evidence which becomes tedious by its eternal uniformity, popular airs were beaten on demand; the noise grew unbearable, tables moved untouched, a breviary, a knife, a spit, a shoe flew wildly about. Lemonier was buffeted by a black hand, attached to nobody. 'A kind of human phantasm, clad in a blouse, haunted me for fifteen days wherever I went; none but myself could see it.' He was dragged by the leg by a mysterious force. On a certain day, when Thorel found a pretext for visiting the house, M. Tinel made him beg Lemonier's pardon, clearly {{on the ground that}} the swain had bewitched the boy. 'As soon as I saw him I recognised the phantasm which had haunted me for a fortnight, and I said to M. Tinel: [...] "There is the man who follows me".' Thorel knelt to the boy, asked his pardon, and pulled violently at his clothes. As defendant, perhaps, the cure could not be asked to corroborate these statements. The evidence of the other boy, Bunel, was that, on Nov. 26, he heard first a rush of wind, then tappings on the wall. He corroborated Lemonier's testimony to the musical airs knocked out, the volatile furniture, and the recognition in Thorel of the phantom. 'In the evening,' said Bunel, 'Lemonier en eut une <b>crise</b> de nerfs dans laquelle il avait perdu connaissance.' ...|$|E
