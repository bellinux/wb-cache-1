5000|$|Motorcycle tire <b>changers</b> {{are less}} {{sophisticated}} than passenger cars and light truck or heavy-duty tire <b>changers</b> because {{they deal with}} smaller and lighter tires and wheels. Motorcycle tire <b>changers</b> mainly provide a simple bead loosening system and rim clamps powered manually. Certain motorcycle tire <b>changers</b> can accommodate wheel diameters as small as 10" [...] and wheels at least 1-1/2" [...] wide. [...] In addition, small atv wheels and tires are used on motorcycle tire <b>changers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} mostly {{composed}} and entirely produced by Madonna and Ahmadzaï. Both had previously collaborated on Madonna's studio album Music (2000). The recording sessions for American Life started in late 2001, then {{was put on}} hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End play Up for Grabs. She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios and Sarm West Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions in London and Los Angeles in early 2003. For the instrumentation featured {{in some of the}} song, Ahmadzaï played the guitars, and Stuart Price played the piano. Tom Hannen and Simon <b>Changer,</b> both of them worked as assistant engineer during the recording.|$|E
5|$|Magadheeras success turned Kajal {{into one}} of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted her into the foray of leading Telugu actresses. The film was also {{considered}} a fate <b>changer</b> in the career of Ram Charan. The role of Sher Khan played by Srihari was considered as one of the best roles in his career and also catapulted S. S. Rajamouli to stardom. Dev Gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of Magadheera, people began recognising him as Ranadheer. According to writer Gopimohan, Magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like Panchakshari (2010), Nagavalli (2010), Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011), Mangala (2011), Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) and Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara? (2012).|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2013, Charlene Johnson, the {{minister}} responsible for trade, along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings {{announced that the}} government supported the agreement in principle for CETA, that had been announced early that day. The ministers said the trade agreement would a game <b>changer</b> for the fishing industry. The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union {{three years after the}} ratification of the deal, which is expected to occur in 2015. In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement, high tariffs and import restrictions on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect. Currently only 13.1 per cent of seafood is duty-free. But by 2022, all seafood would be 100 per cent duty-free. Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a deal that would eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away, in exchange for concessions on tariffs later. Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement. Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries could compete with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants, due to higher operating costs in those countries.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether mid-life career <b>changers</b> were significantly different from non-career <b>changers</b> on selective characteristics. The characteristics studied were attitudes toward work and career path; mid-life behavior, values, and changes; external and internal influences on career decisions; demographic factors; and self-concept. The subjects consisted of 60 students enrolled in the Board of Governors (BOG) Degree Program during the Spring/Summer and Fall Trimesters, 1979, at Governors State University in Park Forest South, Illinois. The subjects were divided into two groups of 30 each: (1) career <b>changers</b> [...] those enrolled in the BOG program primarily for the purpose of either initiating or completing a career change, and (2) non-career <b>changers</b> [...] those enrolled in the program primarily for other reasons. A questionnaire, based on the factors associated with adult development and career change, and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale were used to obtain the data. The data were analyzed by categories established by the characteristics studied and either the chi square test for independence, or the t test for significance was conducted for each item on the questionnaire and for the self-concept total positive score to determine whether there was any significant difference between the responses of the career <b>changers</b> and non-career <b>changers.</b> The null hypothesis for each category was then accepted or rejected at the. 05 level of probability. The findings indicated that there were significant differences between the career <b>changers</b> and non-career <b>changers</b> on three items: (1) the career <b>changers</b> spent fewer years in their present jobs than the non-career changers; (2) the career <b>changers</b> spent more time in volunteer work than the non-career changers; and (3) the career <b>changers</b> had achieved their original goal/dream or an alternative, while the non-career <b>changers</b> either had achieved an alternative goal, or were still working toward their original goal/dream. There were no significant differences between the career <b>changers</b> and non-career <b>changers</b> on the other 149 characteristics studied. The major conclusion derived from this study was that the mid-life characteristics of career <b>changers</b> were not significantly different from those of non-career <b>changers</b> among students enrolled in the Board of Governors Degree Program at Governors State University. From this conclusion, it was suggested that the lack of significant difference between the two groups may be attributed to a basic similarity among all the subjects resulting from their common decision to complete a bachelor's degree during mid-life. It was recommended that assumptions which state that mid-life career <b>changers</b> are significantly different from non-career <b>changers,</b> and that mid-life crises and transitions have significant effects on career decisions need to be further researched...|$|R
50|$|Heavy-duty tire <b>changers</b> require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} <b>changers</b> deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. Heavy-duty tire <b>changers</b> {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. Heavy-duty tire <b>changers</b> are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the heavy-duty tire <b>changers</b> are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated self-centering four jaw chuck with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the center bore.|$|R

25|$|Unwilling {{to accept}} and license Columbia's system, in February 1949 RCA Victor, in {{cooperation}} with its parent, the Radio Corporation of America, released the first 45rpm single, 7inches in diameter with a large center hole. The 45rpm player included a changing mechanism that allowed multiple disks to be stacked, much as a conventional <b>changer</b> handled 78s. The short playing time of a single 45rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA claimed that the new high-speed <b>changer</b> rendered side breaks so brief as to be inaudible or inconsequential. Early 45rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene. They had a playing time of eight minutes.|$|E
