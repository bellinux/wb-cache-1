5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of earlier studies.|$|E

50|$|However, another eusocial wasp species, Polistes dominula, {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{as a threat to}} P. fuscatus. P. dominula has been displacing P. fuscatus at many of the formerly P. fuscatus-dominated areas.

30|$|From {{the results}} of phylogenetic {{analysis}} using the complete 16 S rRNA sequences, strains NGRI 0001 and 0130 were identified as L. buchneri and L. rapi, respectively (Figure  6). Because L. buchneri, L. kefiri, L. parabuchneri and L. rapi are phylogenetically the most closely related species (Watanabe et al. 2009), this result is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that <b>the</b> partial sequence of the 16 S rRNA from strain NGRI 0001 was similar with that from L. buchneri and L. kefiri (Figure  2 A).|$|R
30|$|Table  4 {{presents}} {{the determinants of}} household demand for dietary diversity (DD) when DDI and DDS are used as indicators of food security in the study. The Table shows that both the DDI and DDS provide similar significant results. On this basis, as income increases, household diet becomes more diverse. This is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> of Langat et al. (2010), and Woldehanna and Behrman (2013) for households in Kenya, and Ethiopia respectively. Our finding, according to Thiele and Weiss (2003), is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that consumption evolves along hierarchical order as income increases.|$|R
30|$|Both SPR and HR {{measures}} were reduced {{in response to}} loud noises under the bilateral skin pressure condition compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> no-pressure.

The results are also <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that skin pressure modulates emotion-related autonomic arousal (Hayashi 1952). However, this previous investigation was descriptive. To my knowledge, {{this is the first}} statistically supported evidence that emotion-related autonomic arousal can be inhibited by bilateral skin pressure.|$|R

30|$|Attractiveness may {{incorporate}} a non-sexual element. For female participants, the right vertical eye-to-face ratio affected attractiveness in the first-block model. Right side {{information may be}} an advantage for judging attractiveness, but not beauty. This is also <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that <b>the</b> right vertical eye-to-face ratio affected judgments of attractiveness among male participants, while the left vertical eye-to-face ratio affected beauty. It may therefore be suggested that participants distinguish between beauty and attractiveness. Accordingly, when asked solely about attractiveness, non-sexual attraction may be easily estimated.|$|R
40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} {{recognition and}} binding in human cells has been {{thought to be}} mediated by the hMSH 2 protein. Here it is shown that the mismatch-binding factor consists of two distinct proteins, the 100 -kilodalton hMSH 2 and a 160 -kilodalton polypeptide, GTBP (for G/T binding protein). Sequence analysis identified GTBP as a new member of the MutS homolog family. Both proteins are required for mismatch-specific binding, a result <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that tumor-derived cell lines devoid of either protein are also devoid of mismatch-binding activity...|$|R
5000|$|Labelling RAN as {{a measure}} of reading ability ignores many {{complexities}} of the task. Schatschneider et al. argue [...] "that rapid naming tasks are composed of attentional, visual, lexical, temporal, and recognition sub-processes that all contribute to naming speed performance. Lumping all these sub-processes under the category of phonological processes obscures the complexity of rapid naming tasks.

50|$|The {{rates of}} {{infanticide}} are {{very low in}} other monogamous groups of larger mammals, which {{can be explained by}} the fact that males care for their offspring and their mother by protecting them from predators and the threat of other males. This is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of Borries, Savini, & Koeng (2011) who indicated that the percentage of infant loss was significantly lower in monogamous species than in polyandrous ones. However, there still needs to be more empirical evidence in order to further test this hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The anthropologists {{studied the}} autopsy X-rays in {{conjunction}} with premortem X-rays of the President.
