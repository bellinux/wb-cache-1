50|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> {{facilitates}} multiple {{electron-hole pair}} generation for each photon absorbed. Efficiency limits for photovoltaic cells can be theoretically higher considering thermodynamic effects. For a solar cell {{powered by the}} Sun's unconcentrated black body radiation, the theoretical maximum efficiency is 43% whereas for a solar cell powered by the Sun's full concentrated radiation, the efficiency limit is up to 85%. These high values of efficiencies are possible only when the solar cells use radiative recombination and <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{solar cell}} research, <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> is the {{phenomenon}} wherein {{the absorption of}} a single photon leads to the excitation of multiple electrons from the valence band to conduction band. In the theory of a conventional solar cell, each photon is only able to excite one electron across the band gap of the semiconductor, and any excess energy in that photon is dissipated as heat. In a material with <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication,</b> high-energy photons excite on average more than one electron across the band gap, and so in principle the solar cell can produce more useful work.|$|E

As the three dimensional analogues of graphene, Dirac semimetal Cd 3 As 2 processes all advantages of graphene as a photosensitive material but potentially has stronger interaction with light as bulk material and thus enhanced responsivity 5, 6, which promises great potential in improving the performance of photodetector in various aspects. In this work, we report the realization of an ultrafast broadband photodetector based on Cd 3 As 2. The prototype metal-Cd 3 As 2 -metal photodetector exhibits a responsivity of 5. 9 mA/W with response time of about 6. 9 ps without any special device optimization. Broadband responses from 0. 8 eV to 2. 34 eV are measured with potential detection range extendable to far infrared and terahertz. Systematical studies indicate that the photo-thermoelectric effect plays important roles in photocurrent generation, {{similar to that in}} graphene. Our results suggest this emerging class of exotic quantum materials can be harnessed for photo detection with high sensitivity and high speed (~ 145 GHz) in challenging middle/far-infrared and THz range.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{contains}} {{the second part}} of the set of articles concerning the theory of algebraic structures, based on the [9], pp. 9 - 12 (pages 4 - 6 of the English edition). First the basic structure 〈F, +, ·, 1, 0 〉 is defined. Following it the consecutive structures are contemplated in detail, including double loop, left quasi-field, right quasi-field, double sided quasi-field, skew field and field. These structures are created by gradually augmenting the basic structure with new axioms of commutativity, associativity, distributivity etc. Each part of the article begins with the set of auxiliary theorems related to the structure under consideration that are necessary for the existence proof of each defined mode. Next the mode and proof of its existence is included. If the current set of axioms may be replaced with a different and equivalent one, the appropriate proof is performed following the definition of that mode. With the introduction of double loop the ”− ” function is defined. Some interesting features of this function are also included. MML Identifier: ALGSTR 2. The terminology and notation used here have been introduced in the following articles: [11], [10], [3], [4], [1], [2], [6], [5], [7], and [8]. We consider double loop structures which are systems 〈a carrier, an addition, a multiplication, a unity, a zero〉, where the carrier is a non-empty set, the addition is a binary operation on the <b>carrier,</b> the <b>multiplication</b> is a binary operation on the carrier, the unity is an element of the carrier, and the zero is an element of the carrier.

Here, we present evidence of <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> in closely spaced silicon nanocrystals contained in a silicon dioxide matrix by measuring enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. As the photon energy increases, the quantum yield is expected to remain constant, or to decrease as a result of new trapping and recombination channels being activated.

40|$|Abstract—The {{dependence}} {{of the performance of}} separate-absorption-multiplication (SAM) single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) on the width of the multiplication region is theoretically investigated. The theory is applied to SAM SPADs with InP homojunction multiplication regions and InAlAs-InP heterojunction multiplication regions. In both cases the absorber layer is InGaAs. Two scenarios for the dark counts are considered: (i) low-temperature operation, when the number of dark carriers is dominated by field-assisted mechanisms of band-to-band tunneling and tunneling through defects; and (ii) room-temperature operation, when the number of dark <b>carriers</b> in the <b>multiplication</b> region is dominated by the generation/recombination mechanism. The analysis utilizes a generalized theory for breakdown probability, which takes into account the random locations where dark and photogenerated carriers are produced in each layer. Depending upon the detector temperature, as the width of the multiplication region is increased the effects from the {{reduction in the number of}} dark carriers due to field-assisted generation mechanisms are counteracted by the effects from the elevation in the number of generation/recombination dark carriers. Thus, there exists an optimal width of the multiplication region that achieves the best performance of the SPAD.

We report on the spectroscopic performance of simple p-i-n diodes and avalanche photodiodes (APDs). A number of diode types with different layer thicknesses have also been characterised. X-ray spectra from 55 Fe and 109 Cd radioactive sources show these diodes can be used for spectroscopy with promising energy resolution (1. 0 – 1. 25 keV) over a - 30 to + 90 °C temperature range. The temperature dependence of the avalanche multiplication process at soft X-ray energies in Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As APDs was also investigated at temperatures from - 20 to + 80 °C. The temperature dependence of the pure electron initiated multiplication factor (Me) and the mixed <b>carrier</b> initiated avalanche <b>multiplication</b> factor (Mmix) were extracted from the X-ray spectra. The experimental results are compared with a spectroscopic Monte Carlo model for Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As diodes from which the temperature dependence of the pure hole initiated multiplication factor (Mh) is determined. Monte Carlo simulations for the avalanche gain of absorbed X-ray photons have also been developed to study the relationship between avalanche gain and energy resolution for semiconductor X-ray avalanche photodiodes. The model showed that the distribution of gains, which directly affects the energy resolution, depends on the number of injected electron-hole pairs (and hence the photon energy), {{the relationship between the two}} ionization coefficients, and the overall mean gain.

40|$|The {{multiplication}} {{rates of}} hot carriers in CdSe quantum dots are quantified using an atom-istic pseudopotential approach and first order perturbation theory. Both excited holes and elec-trons are considered, and electron-hole Coulomb interactions are accounted for. We find that holes have much higher multiplication rates than electrons {{with the same}} excess energy due to the larger density of final states (positive trions). When electron-hole pairs are generated by photon absorption, however, the net <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> rate is dominated by photogenerated electrons, because they have on average much higher excess energy. We also find, contrary to earlier studies, that the effective Coulomb coupling governing <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> is energy dependent. We show that smaller dots result in {{a decrease in the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> rate for a given absolute photon energy.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> (CM) time constant {{is complicated by the}} fact that this process occurs within the initial few hundreds of femtoseconds after excitation and, in transient-absorption experiments, cannot be separated from the buildup time of the 1 p-state population. This work provides an accurate theoretical determination of the electron relaxation lifetime during the last stage of the p-state buildup, in CdSe nanocrystals, in the presence of a single photogenerated hole (no CM) and of a hole plus an additional electron–hole pair (following CM). From the invariance of the 1 p buildup time observed experimentally for excitations above and below the CM threshold producing hot carriers with the same average per-exciton excess energy, and the calculated corresponding variations in the electron decay time in the two cases, an estimate is obtained for the <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> time constant. Unlike previous estimates reported in the literature so far, this result is model-independent, i. e., is obtained without making any assumption on the nature of the mechanism governing <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication.</b> It is then compared with the time constant calculated, as a function of the excitation energy, assuming an impact-ionization-like process for <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> (DCM). The two results are in good agreement and show that <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> can occur on timescales of the order of tens of femtoseconds at energies close to the observed onset. These findings, which are compatible with the fastest lifetime estimated experimentally, confirm the suitability of the impact-ionization model to explain <b>carrier</b> <b>multiplication</b> in CdSe nanocrystals. ...|$|E
