In learning-related hippocampus, LTP contains at least two different phases: early-phase LTP (E-LTP), which does not need new protein synthesis or transcription, and late phase LTP (L-LTP), which is tran-scription and translation-dependent [2, 8 - 10].

Global changes such as habitat losses, invasions of exotic species and climate change have been suggested as the main causes {{of the decline of}} pollinators. In this study, the influence of climate change on the distribution of 10 species of Brazilian bees was estimated with species distribution modelling. We used Maxent algorithm (maximum entropy) and two different scenarios, an optimistic and a pessimistic, to the years 2050 and 2080. We also evaluated the percentage reduction of species habitat based on the future scenarios of climate change through Geographic Information System (GIS). Results showed that the total area of suitable habitats decreased for all species but one under the different future scenarios. The greatest reductions in habitat area were found for Melipona bicolor bicolor and Melipona scutellaris, which occur predominantly in areas related originally to Atlantic Moist Forest. The species analysed have been reported to be pollinators of some regional crops and the consequence of their decrease for these crops needs further clarification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Medulloblastoma is {{a highly}} {{malignant}} primary tumor of the central nervous system. It represents the most frequent type of solid tumor and {{the leading cause of}} death related to cancer in early childhood. Current treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy which may lead to severe cognitive impairment and secondary brain tumors. New perspectives for therapeutic development have emerged with the identification of stem-like cells displaying high tumorigenic potential and increased radio- and chemo-resistance in gliomas. Under the cancer stem cell hypothesis, transformation of neural stem cells and/or granular neuron progenitors of the cerebellum are though to be involved in medulloblastoma development. Dissecting the genetic and molecular alterations associated with this process should significantly impact both basic and applied cancer research.

60|$|When first {{examining}} the parasites of S. rostratum, S.

Peronii are ordinarily attached, in a certain definite position, to horny corallines, and considering that the exact points of attachment in these three parasites, (of which I have seen no other instance amongst common Cirripedes,) namely, between the scuta, would inevitably cause their early destruction, either directly or indirectly, by their living supports being destroyed. Nevertheless, I carefully examined a young specimen of S. rostratum only thrice as large as the parasite; and not having very young specimens of S. Peronii and villosum, I procured the young of closely-allied forms, namely, of S. vulgare, (with a capitulum only 4/100th of an inch in length,) and of Pollicipes polymerus, (with a capitulum of less size than that of one of the parasites,) and there was not the least sign of anything abnormal in the development of the valves. In S. vulgare, at a period when the calcified scuta could have been only 1/100th of an inch in length, (and therefore considerably less than the scuta in the parasites,) the upper latera must have been as much as 4/1000ths of an inch in length, and the valves of the lower whorl certainly distinguishable.|$|E
60|$|The {{religious}} ceremonies of the Jews had not at {{all times}} the restraint and delicacy which {{it is to be}} wished the Lord had exacted, for we read of King David himself dancing before the Ark in a condition so nearly nude as greatly to scandalize the daughter of Saul. By the way, this incident has been always a stock argument for the extinction and decent interment of the unhappy anti dancer. Conceding the necessity of his extinction, I am yet indisposed to attach much weight to the Davidian precedent, for it does not appear that he was acting under divine command, directly or indirectly imparted, and whenever he followed the hest of his own sweet will David had a notable knack at going wrong. Perhaps the best value of the incident consists in the evidence it supplies that dancing was not forbidden--save possibly by divine injunction--to the higher classes of Jews, for unless we are to suppose the dancing of David to have been the mere clumsy capering of a loutish mood (a theory which our respect for royalty, even when divested of its imposing externals, forbids us to entertain) we are bound to assume previous instruction and practice in the art. We have, moreover, the Roman example of the daughter of Herodias, whose dancing before Herod was so admirably performed that she was suitably rewarded with a testimonial of her step father's esteem. To these examples many more might be added, showing by <b>cumulative</b> <b>evidence</b> that among the ancient people whose religion was good enough for us to adopt and improve, dancing was a polite and proper accomplishment, although not always decorously executed on seasonable occasion.|$|E

To investigate the potential preclinical relevance, K 562 cells were transiently transfected with the siRNA targeting cyclin A 2 by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes.

40|$|Drinking water {{distribution}} networks {{may be viewed}} as a large reactor where a number of chemical and microbiological processes are taking place. Control of microbial growth in drinking {{water distribution}} systems (DWDS) often achieved through the addition of disinfectants, is essential to limit the spread of waterborne pathogens. However, microorganisms can resist disinfection through protection within biofilms and resistant host cells. Recent studies into the microbial ecology of DWDS have found that microbial resistance to disinfectants is affected by microbial community diversity and interspecies relationships. The dynamics of the microbial growth and multispecies biofilm formation in drinking water networks is very complex, as a large number of interacting processes are involved. Coaggregationlcoadhesion of microorganisms and other interspecies relationships are processes that are believed to {{play a significant role in}} the formation of single and multispecies biofilms in drinking water distribution systems, but remain poorly understood.

40|$|We {{estimated}} neutral {{diversity of}} 21 European cattle breeds with 105 microsatellites. Nine of them resembled unselected Balkan Buša strains with diffuse breeding barriers and the 12 others were strongly differentiated, isolated breeds. Because {{of the impact}} of neutral genetic diversity on long-term population adaptive capacity, we discuss the long-term outcome of different conservation priorities in a subdivided metapopulation of the investigated cattle breeds. The optimal contribution to a pool of total genetic diversity allocated more than 95 % of long-term relevant neutral diversity to virtually unselected strains of the Balkan Buša, while the maximization of total variance preferred inbred breeds. Current artificial selection methods, such as genomic selection sped up and a recovery of underestimated traits becomes quickly impossible. We emphasize that currently neutral and even deleterious alleles might be required for future genotypes in sustainable and efficient livestock breeding and production systems of a 21 st century. We provide <b>cumulative</b> <b>evidences</b> that long-term survival relies on genetic complexity and complexity relies on allelic diversity. Our results suggest that virtually unselected, nonuniform strains harbor a crucial proportion of neutral diversity and should be conserved with high global priority.

You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] (28th June, 1862.) We shall seek no epithet to characterize language like this. All but the most bigoted partisans will qualify it as it deserves. We have here a glaring example of that warping of good sense and good feeling which the consciousness of having a political stake at risk will produce in a gallant soldier and a courteous gentleman. Can General McClellan, after a year to grow cool in, either himself believe, or expect any one else to believe, that the President and the Secretary of War would [...] "do their best to sacrifice" [...] an army of a hundred and fifty thousand brave men, in order to lessen his possible chances as a candidate for the Presidency? It was of vastly more importance to them than to him that he should succeed. The dignified good temper of Mr. Lincoln's answer to this wanton insult does him honor: [...] "I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements; I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself." [...] Mr. Stanton could only be silent; and whatever criticisms may be made on some traits of his character, he is quite safe in leaving the rebuke of such an imputation to whoever feels that earnestness, devotion, and unflagging purpose are high qualities in a public officer.|$|E

The wild type (wt) BRCA 1, mutant BRCA 1, BRCA 1 knocked-down and BRCA 1 overexpressed breast cancer cells were treated with the cucurbitacin B and determined for the inhibitory effects on the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth. The gene expressions in the treated cells were analyzed for p 21 /(Waf 1), p 27 (Kip 1) and survivin. Our previous study revealed that loss of BRCA 1 expression leads to an increase in survivin expression, which is responsible for a reduction in sensitivity to paclitaxel. In this work, we showed that cucurbitacin B obviously inhibited knocked-down and mutant BRCA 1 breast cancer cells rather than the wild type BRCA 1 breast cancer cells in regards to the cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, forcing the cells to overexpress wild type BRCA 1 significantly reduced effectiveness of cucurbitacin B on growth inhibition of the endogenous mutant BRCA 1 cells. Interestingly, cucurbitacin B promotes the expression of p 21 /(Waf 1) and p 27 (Kip 1) but inhibit the expression of survivin.
