5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to delineate variation in mental and physical health outcomes over a 10 -year period among parents <b>with</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> health needs as compared to parents of a typically developing child; and evaluate the possible protective effects of parental perceived control and social support. The sample con-sisted of 646 parents from the longitudinal Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study. Nearly one-quarter of the sample (n 128; 22. 3 %) reported having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> health care need. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that parents of a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> care needs reported poorer self-rated mental health, greater depressive symptoms, and more restrictions in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Parents of a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> health care needs had greater increases in depressive symptoms over time and greater declines in instrumental activities of daily living than parents of typically developing children. Perceived control was a robust predictor of all health outcomes over time. The added stressors of parenting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> health needs may undermine the long-term health of parents. Behavioral interventions and clinical practices that facilitate parental perceived control may enable resilience and better health...|$|R

5|$|In May 2011, {{the first}} rushes of Ra.One {{were shown to}} the cast of Khan's other home {{production}} Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011). Subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. A few days prior to the theatrical release, Khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in Yash Raj Studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. Between 24 and 26 October 2011, Ra.One had international premieres in Dubai, London and Toronto, {{all of which were}} chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations. The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas, Wafi. A high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where Khan raised AED30,000 (approximately US$8,200) to build a workshop for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs. The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public. The premiere in London took place at the O2 Cineworld the following day, and the premiere in Toronto took place at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on 26 October 2011.|$|E

5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization. Under his rule, Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves, and they called for Epsilon to reclaim his position. More or less {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} group, Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself. He planned an attack on an A-Human research laboratory, where <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on. Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys. However, he was unsure because he couldn't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon, who had entered the boy's body and was now living as a parasite. Xi-Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself. The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself. Xi seemed to sense this strange power, and in fear, killed the girl and fled. Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart; with both good and evil Epsilons now chasing after Xi-Tiger.|$|E

40|$|Birth of a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs has a {{big impact}} on the family {{dynamics}} and it affects every family member. Family urgently needs help and support with the adaptation process and with the balance reestablishment, but it often occurs that siblings remain lonely and overlooked, especially from the experts. With the systematic examination of the literature we wanted to research the problems and emotions with which the siblings have to confront, what are their needs, and finally propose the framework for helping siblings in their childhood. In the first part we have focused on the dynamics, organization and adaptation of the family <b>with</b> the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs, because all this also affects the siblings. Everything parents experience, siblings experience also, but their needs are nevertheless not completely identical. Consecutively we have in the second part researched the problems, emotions and needs of the siblings and investigated what systems of help and support for the siblings already exist in Slovenia and in the world. We have concluded that having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs greatly affects the whole family. How the family will adapt to different life depends on different factors {{on the side of the}} <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs, their siblings, parents and extended community. Siblings need information and support when they are growing up and also when they are older. They have to face different positive and negative emotions and experiences, with which they need the help of the family and the experts. Review of the programs and services has shown that there is not enough programs in Slovenia which would offer help and support to the siblings of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> needs. ...|$|R

Like Chivenor Junior and Infant School, the primary school was constructed on the side of a tower block named Topcliffe House, and during the regeneration of the estate in the 1990s, Birmingham City Council were unwilling to demolish the primary school and so retained the tower block and refurbished it. Upon the last OFSTED inspection of the school in June 2007, there were approximately 250 pupils and the headteacher was Chris Robinson, although Ian Lowe now holds this position with Chris Robinson holding the Deputy Headteacher position. The school has provision for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational needs as a result of the fact that the attainment of pupils when they enter the school at the age of 4 is below average.
