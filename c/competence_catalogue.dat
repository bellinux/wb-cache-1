The article first details the reasons, and the actors who put the search for a catalogue of competencies on to the European agenda. Drawing from comparative federalism, it then lists five arguments why a detailed and rigid <b>competence</b> <b>catalogue</b> is neither feasible nor desirable. Finally, alternatives are provided leading to competence delimitation by other means. The main arguments are illustrated with reference to the European Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty.

40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of a <b>competence</b> <b>catalogue</b> in the TFEU by the Treaty of Lisbon eliminated the overlap between the preclusion of national lawmaking powers attributable to the exclusive character of EU competences and that stemming from the enactment of EU legislation, thus opening the doors to scholarly investigation of Union Preemption as a general theory {{of the effects of}} EU legislation in non-exclusive competence areas. The first aim of this work is to describe what Union Preemption is (“ Sein ”) {{in the context of the}} EU single market, thus allowing, given an item of EU legislation, to determine its preemptive scope by reference to certain “markers”, such as its legal form and the harmonization model it embodies. Against the background of the existing application uncertainties, this work further seeks to suggest what Union Preemption ought to be (“ Sollen ”) to meet the current needs of European integration, taking into account the diversity of situations where preemption issues arise and the changes in the legal, political, and economic context that have occurred in the single market since 1957. competences; harmonisation; subsidiarity; supremacy...|$|E

This article will show how qualification profiles of machine building companies are affected by servitization and which aspects of servitized businesses induce new modes of working for the employee groups concerned. A comprehensive key <b>competences</b> <b>catalogue</b> for servitized machine building companies is developed {{and in order to}} show the current impact of servitization on human resources in operational practice, data from the German Manufacturing Survey is used. To conclude, two specific qualification profiles for sales and after-sales employees in machine building companies are elaborated in detail...|$|R
40|$|The GMA {{committee}} for dentistry of the German Society for Medical Education (GMA) considers its’ main purpose the representation and interconnection of {{all aspects of}} dentistry with and within the GMA. Teaching and assessing practical skills during training is traditionally of great importance in dental education. This is also reflected in the National <b>Competence</b> Based <b>Catalogue</b> of Learning Objectives for Dental Education (NKLZ). Practical skills are not comprised in a separate chapter {{as they are in}} the National <b>Competence</b> Based <b>Catalogue</b> of Learning Objectives for Medical Education (NKLM), but are considered in all sections of the NKLZ for the purpose of interdisciplinary patient- or disease-specific application, targeting the educational level of acting competency. The implementation of the associated joined interdisciplinary integrated educational concept has undoubtedly been a challenge for dental curriculum development against the backdrop of German Dental Licensure Act dating back to 1955...|$|R

In this global web, organizations seek new ways to deliver projects and services more efficiently. One way to increase efficiency is restructuring {{in order to become}} more customer oriented through flattening organizational structure and distributing work across the globe. This kind of decentralized organization relies heavily on distributed teams and several IT tools, such as global Enterprise Systems (ES, and their primary form Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP) and different collaboration devices. In this dissertation I take an exploratory approach on the interaction between a knowledgeintensive project organization and an enterprise system. In the case study I follow how a large project organization transforms from a silo organization into a more integrated matrix model. This case study extends over a period of two and a half years. During the same period, the company implements new ES functionalities in order to support its strategic change relating to a new operating model. I demonstrate the interaction between the ES and the organization by using a part of the new operating model, a project staffing process, as an example of organizational processes that are supported by new enterprise system functionalities. The project staffing process exploits traditional HR data such as <b>competence</b> <b>catalogues</b> and employees’ workload data to optimize resource use. By applying grounded theory I investigate research questions that emerged from the empirical data. Despite the growing literature regarding the interplay between the enterprise system and organization, this complex interaction is not thoroughly understood. I employ theories and models relating to neo-institutional theory, organizational change, sociomateriality, human and machine agencies, affordances, loose coupling, system usage, boundary objects and boundary spanning. In the four research papers forming the body of this thesis I provide new perspectives on the interplay between the enterprise system and knowledge-intensive project organization in managing resources in project business. The main contribution of my study is that the knowledge-intensive project organization sets special challenges for the assimilation and use of new ES functionalities. Particularly, the complexity of the company’s professional services and projects creates different managerial implications and organizational responses within the company. In addition, the new HR-related ES functionalities set some specific challenges for the system assimilation and use in the knowledge-intensive project organization...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Competence orientation, {{often based}} on the CanMEDS model, has become an {{important}} goal for modern curricula in medical education. The National <b>Competence</b> Based <b>Catalogue</b> of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM) has been adopted in Germany. However, it is currently unknown whether the vision of competence orientation has also reached the licensing examination procedures. Methods: Therefore, a prospective, descriptive, single-centre, exemplary study design was applied to evaluate 4051 questions/tasks (from 28 examiners at 7 two-day licensing oral-practical exams) for undergraduate medical students at the University of Ulm. The oral and practical questions/tasks {{as well as the}} real bedside assessment were assigned to specific competence roles (NKLM section I), categories (NKLM section II) and taxonomy levels of learning domains. Results: Numerous questions/tasks were set per candidate (day 1 / 2 : 70 ± 24 / 86 ± 19 questions) in the licensing oral-practical exam. Competence roles beyond the “medical expert” were scarcely considered. Furthermore, practical and communication skills at the bedside were hardly addressed (less than 3 / 15 min). Strikingly, there was a significant predominance of questions with a low-level taxonomy. Conclusions: The data indicate a misalignment of competence-oriented frameworks and the “real world” licensing practical-oral medical exam, which needs improvement in both evaluation and education processes...|$|R
40|$|As J. P. Spencer et al. (2009) argue, the {{theories}} of some developmental psychologists continue to be nativistic, even though nativism is an inherently nondevelopmental school of thought. Psychologists interested in development study the emergence of human characteristics—including predispositions—and are not content to simply <b>catalogue</b> <b>competences</b> that characterize human newborns; instead, they recognize that all human characteristics, including those present at birth, reflect the circumstances of development. A truly developmental science of behavior requires rejecting the nativism–empiricism debate outright, abandoning ideas such as “core knowledge” and psychological “endowments,” and adopting a process perspective that focuses on how traits emerge from the co-actions of biological and experiential factors. Unlike nativism, the process perspective advocated by J. P. Spencer et al. encourages research that can reveal the developmental origins of psychological characteristics of interest...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Germany, a {{national}} <b>competence</b> based <b>catalogue</b> of learning objectives in medicine (NKLM) {{was developed by}} the Society for Medical Education and the Council of Medical Faculties. As many of its international counterparts the NKLM describes the qualifications of medical school graduates. The definition of such outcome frameworks indents to make medical education transparent to students, teachers and society. The NKLM aims to amend existing lists of medical topics for assessment with learnable competencies. All outcome frameworks are structured into chapters, domains or physician roles. The definition of the scholar-role poses a number of questions such as: What distinguishes necessary qualifications of a scientifically qualified physician from those of a medical scientist? Methods: 13 outcome frameworks were identified through a systematic three-step literature review and their content compared to the scholar role in the NKLM by means of a qualitative text analysis. The three steps consist of (1) search for outcome frameworks, (2) in- and exclusion, and (3) data extraction, categorization, and validation. The results were afterwards matched with the scholar role of the NKLM. Results: Extracted contents of all frameworks may be summarized into the components, and. Compared to the included frameworks the NKLM emphasises competencies necessary for research and teaching while clinical application is less prominently mentioned. Conclusion: The scholar role of the NKLM differs from other international outcome frameworks. Discussing these results shall increase propagation and understanding of the NKLM and thus contribute to the qualification of future medical graduates in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The German Council of Science and Humanities {{as well as}} {{a number}} of medical {{professional}} associations support the strengthening of scientific competences by developing longitudinal curricula for teaching scientific competences in the undergraduate medical education. The National <b>Competence</b> Based <b>Catalogue</b> of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM) has also defined medical scientific skills as learning objectives in addition to the role of the scholar. The development of the Mannheim science curriculum started with a systematic inventory of the teaching of scientific competences in the Mannheim Reformed Curriculum of Medicine (MaReCuM). Methods: The inventory is based on the analysis of module profiles, teaching materials, surveys among experts, and verbatims from memory. Furthermore, science learning objectives were defined and prioritized, thus enabling the contents of the various courses to be assigned to the top three learning objectives. Results: The learning objectives systematic collection of information regarding the current state of research, critical assessment of scientific information and data sources, as well as presentation and discussion of the results of scientific studies are facilitated by various teaching courses from the first to the fifth year of undergraduate training. The review reveals a longitudinal science curriculum that has emerged implicitly. Future efforts must aim at eliminating redundancies and closing gaps; in addition, courses must be more closely aligned with each other, regarding both their contents and their timing, by means of a central coordination unit. Conclusion: The teaching of scientific thinking and working is a central component in the MaReCuM. The inventory and prioritization of science learning objectives form the basis for a structured ongoing development of the curriculum. An essential aspect here is the establishment of a central project team responsible for the planning, coordination, and review of these measures...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{skills are}} very {{important}} in companion animal and food animal practice. In Germany nearly 68 % of the graduates are working as a veterinarian in private practice. More than 31 % of German vets are working in other fields, whereas almost 16 % are working in industry. So far, limited information is available about communications skills in veterinary industry. To gain more knowledge about communication skills in veterinary industry we conducted semi-structured interviews as a qualitative research approach. All interviewees worked five or {{more than five years}} in industry. The interview focused on those communication skills needed in a daily work routine. Another focus was on meeting the expectations of new colleagues’ in this field. The interviewees were also asked about predicted challenges in communication skills in the future. After a qualitative content analysis of the interviews the outcomes were compared to two established European learning outcomes catalogues, the German National <b>Competence</b> Based <b>Catalogues</b> of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education, and the Swiss learning outcome catalogue of the Vetsuisse-Faculty. The qualitative analysis demonstrated an overlapping of several required communication skills in veterinary industry with the skill set listed in both learning outcome catalogues. However, the interviewees mentioned a lack of communication skills in the field of professional skills. Particularly the personal development of the graduates represents a central aspect of the requirements in veterinary industry. Furthermore, basic skills in economics are required. In the future more qualitative research will be necessary to derive more concrete learning outcomes. Moreover, the integration of specific learning and communication skills for veterinary industry into the curriculum could also prepare the students for better accomplishments in the formation of private practices.
