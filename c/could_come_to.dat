5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a playing experience that newcomers to the series <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to.</b> Its presentation was compared to that of a fairy tale, as depicting the usual style of the series would have been difficult on the platform. Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The men at Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée.

A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive {{at least a day}} without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E
5|$|From Ravenna, Diocletian {{left for}} the Danube. There, {{possibly}} in Galerius' company, he {{took part in a}} campaign against the Carpi. He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a litter. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304–5 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumors alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, he seemed to have finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it was only retrieved by public declarations of his survival. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.|$|E

5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.|$|E
5|$|Victory {{joined the}} British fleet off Cádiz on 27 September, Nelson taking over from Rear Admiral Collingwood. He spent the {{following}} weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains {{to ensure they}} understood his intentions. Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional line of battle. Drawing on his own experience from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and Rodney at the Saintes, Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy. These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line {{in a number of}} places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> their aid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} off-season, the Canucks {{announced}} they had re-signed Bure to a five-year, $24.5million contract on June 16. The deal {{was reported to}} have been signed before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals against New York. It also included Bure's marketing rights and put his father, Vladimir, on the team payroll as a fitness and marketing consultant. The average annual salary of $4.9million made Bure the league's third highest-paid player, behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. In fact, Bure and the Canucks had entered into contract negotiations {{at the beginning of the}} 1993–94 season, although two years remained in his original deal. Neither side <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an initial agreement; one of the major factors was the Canucks' demands for the contract to be in Canadian dollars on account of the American exchange rate. Numerous accusations were made in the media during the Canucks' playoff run that Bure threatened not to play if a contract could not be agreed upon. A Toronto Star article, published before the first game of the Finals on May 31, 1994, claimed Bure had signed a five-year, $30million contract that, if the Canucks had not agreed to, would have seen him pull out of game five of the Conference Finals against the Maple Leafs. The article was followed by two additional claims in the following two days in the Vancouver-based newspaper The Province and Toronto Sun. The Toronto Sun held the contract was a five-year, $22.5 million deal, and that it was signed before either game six or seven of the opening round against the Flames after Bure's agent, Ron Salcer, told general manager Quinn that Bure would not play if the deal was not made. As the story continued well into the next season, Pat Quinn appeared in a segment on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Hockey Night in Canada on March 27, 1995, publicly denying the claims.|$|E
