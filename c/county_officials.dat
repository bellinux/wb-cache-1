5|$|Ranking Erie {{city and}} <b>county</b> <b>{{officials}},</b> {{as well as}} officials of the Erie School District, began looking into {{the need for a}} community college in the Erie area in 2006. , <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> and representatives of Penn State-Behrend, Mercyhurst and Gannon were in serious discussions expected to lead to the creation of Northwest Pennsylvania Community College by September 2009. Besides accreditation issues, officials must resolve whether to use local four-year educational institutions or to build a separate site in Summit Township for community college classes.|$|E

5|$|After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in September 2008, Galveston <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> {{offered a}} debris removal program to {{residents}} in unincorporated areas, including Bacliff. Flooding from hurricane Ike was minimized {{due in part}} to Bacliff's relatively high elevation of 16 feet.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Montgomery <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> {{announced}} they were considering adding more slip ramps along the turnpike to ease traffic congestion. Possible locations include PA 63 near Willow Grove, Upper Merion Township, and around Norristown and Plymouth Meeting. In addition, the county wants to add eastbound ramps at the existing Virginia Drive interchange.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the storm made landfall, several Florida {{counties}} were monitoring {{the progress of the}} storm. Though no serious impact was anticipated, Brevard <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> identified possible shelters if warranted. Putnam <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> placed several shelters on standby, and utility crews in Duval County were placed on standby in the event of power failure. Several media releases of information were issued regarding the storm. The State Emergency Operation Center was on Level 2, or partial activation, and the state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to the storm. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch hours before Edouard made landfall for much of eastern Florida due to the expected rainfall from the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{service for}} McLaughlin {{was held on}} December 8, 1998, at KeyArena in Seattle. Numerous state and <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> and over 100 transit drivers {{attended}} the service, which included a procession of over eighty Metro buses and vans. Metro retired the number 359 as a route designation {{and replaced it with}} route 358 in February 1999, as part of a restructure of service on Aurora Avenue. On February 15, 2014, Route 358 was retired, and replaced with the RapidRide E Line.|$|E

5|$|<b>County</b> <b>officials</b> did {{not take}} care of the problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the {{presence}} of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E
5|$|Florida Governor Jeb Bush {{issued a}} state of {{emergency}} two days before the storm's final landfall. Recovery teams were also deployed for the area. An evacuation order was issued for all areas south of the Gulf Coast Highway, including Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key, and Inerarity Point. Walton <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> issued a voluntary evacuation for low line areas and mobile homes. Walton County also opened a shelter in Freeport, and four shelters and one special needs shelter were opened in Escambia County.|$|E
5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning. In addition, one computer model predicts the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This causes Cape May <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E

5|$|The Cripple Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used {{the success of the}} strike to {{organize}} almost every worker in the Cripple Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM flourished in the Cripple Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> (including the new sheriff).|$|E
5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to <b>county</b> <b>officials.</b> A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> {{admitted}} {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas brought upon {{numerous}} {{political changes}} and introduced a civic {{government of the}} Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as part of Austria-Hungary, which in turn proceeded to absorb the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontiers in 1881. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century Croatian counties went through various reorganizations (1848-1850, 1850-1854, 1854-1861, 1861-1870, 1870-1874, 1874-1886, 1886-1914) that also reflected the position of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austrian Empire (after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy); the last major reorganisation of the counties was in 1886, when eight counties were established within the kingdom. This layout largely remained in effect until the Croatian counties were abolished in 1922, while some minor adjustments of county boundaries happened in 1913. The counties were set up as self-governmental units in contrast to earlier county incarnations since the Middle Ages. Each had an assembly (Croatian županijska skupština) with the wealthiest taxpayers comprising half the assembly members and elected members comprising the remaining half. Supreme prefect (Croatian veliki župan) was appointed by the king and <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> by the ban. Managing board of each county had 6 members elected by the county assembly, while the remaining members were <b>county</b> <b>officials</b> ex officio (supreme prefect, viceprefect, county health supervisor etc). Counties were divided into districts (Croatian kotari as government units similar to Austrian Bezirke), while municipalities (Croatian općine) and cities (Croatian gradovi) were units of local self-government.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> {{brought the}} {{extension}} of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> {{continued}} {{to worry that}} cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} Tropical Storm Warning from Englewood to Indian Pass, Florida while Henri was a {{tropical}} depression; however, warnings were discontinued {{by the time}} Henri made landfall. Flood warnings were issued across the state prior to the storm making landfall, with predictions of 5 to 10inches (125 – 255mm) of rainfall. As {{a result of the}} storm's approach, twelve shelters were placed on standby. Similarly, the Hurricane Shelter Information Hotline was placed on standby and ready to be activated within 10minutes. Levy <b>County</b> <b>officials</b> declared a state of emergency. There, sand bags and sand were sent to Cedar Key, Yankeetown, and Inglis in anticipation for storm surge and flooding.|$|E
