5|$|Five {{years after}} his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben Washer to found Reach Records, and {{at the age of}} 25 he {{released}} his first album, Real Talk. The following year it was re-released by <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement</b> Records and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks. The album later received a nomination at the 2007 Stellar Awards. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015), which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible and relevant to hip-hop culture. Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, The Compilation Album, was released.|$|E

25|$|In his {{continued}} pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further {{in debt and}} being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary {{member of the national}} Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement,</b> even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including Stuttgart, Rome, Corfu, Basel, and Karlsruhe. In Stuttgart he met the Tübingen University student Rudolf Müller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village Heiden for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent {{the rest of his life}} there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.|$|E

25|$|Tunnel Rats is a West Coast {{underground}} hip hop collective {{founded in}} 1993 in Whittier, California. Named after the tunnel rats in the Vietnam war, the mixed-gender, multi-racial collective consists of some seventeen individual members and incorporates four affiliated groups, LPG, Future Shock, Foundation, and New Breed, which have recorded both within Tunnel Rats and independently. Several members also formed two additional side-projects, Footsoldiers and The Resistance, which recorded one album in 2006 and collaborated with KRS-One. Pioneers in the Christian hip hop genre, Tunnel Rats often met with resistance from church leaders who disliked the collective's aggressive style {{and felt that}} Tunnel Rats praised their rapping skills more than glorifying God. In the early 2000s, the East Coast group The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement</b> likewise criticized Tunnel Rats, claiming it did not place enough emphasis on the Gospel. Due to {{a high number of}} Mexicans in the collective, Tunnel Rats also encountered racism when performing in the South. Despite these hardships, Tunnel Rats managed to garner critical acclaim and significantly impacted the Christian hip hop movement. The collective has released four albums, plus numerous additional recordings from its affiliated groups and individual members. Though currently on hiatus, Tunnel Rats has not disbanded, according to a statement by member Peace 586.|$|E
500|$|Regarding which musical {{artists have}} {{influenced}} him, Lecrae, {{in an interview}} with Essence, cited Tupac, Nas, DJ Quik, Scarface, and The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement.</b> In an interview with The Christian Post, Lecrae listed his top favorite five hip hop artists as Tupac, Nas, The Ambassador, Snoop Dogg, and, though for his business approach rather than his music, Jay Z. Lecrae also names Outkast and Lauryn Hill as major influences, particularly their albums Aquemini and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, respectively, and considers Hill's song [...] "Adam Lives in Theory" [...] as the top song that nourishes him spiritually. In the song [...] "Non-Fiction", he lists the Tunnel Rats alongside The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement</b> as an influence when he was newly converted to Christianity. Theologically, Lecrae follows the Reformed tradition of theology and is considered an influential figure in the New Calvinist movement. He cites Tommy Nelson, John MacArthur, and John Piper, among others, as early influences on his Christian faith, and Lecrae even titled one of his hit songs, [...] "Don't Waste Your Life", after the book of the same name by Piper. Lecrae explains that through Nelson, MacArthur, and Piper, he subsequently discovered Spurgeon, Calvin, and Francis Schaeffer, the last of whom Lecrae calls his [...] "personal hero". Other theologians cited by Lecrae include Tim Keller, Andy Crouch, Randy Alcorn, and Abraham Kuyper. He also looks to Martin Luther King, Jr. for inspiration on working out faith in social issues.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement.</b> Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, The Tonic, {{a member}} of Christian hip hop group The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement,</b> criticized the Tunnel Rats in an interview, accusing the group of placing more {{importance}} on musical credibility than sharing the Gospel. Fans of The <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement</b> also criticized The Tunnel Rats, claiming {{that they did not}} distinguish themselves enough from aggressive, secular West Coast rappers. In response to the accusations, Tunnel Rats released Tunnel Vision, which featured a raw, turbulent sound which, according to Imade Nibokun in LA Weekly, [...] "was a musical middle finger to anyone who found their battle-rap bravado sinful." [...] Nibokun cited in particular the song [...] "T.R.'z", which criticizes Christian rappers with sub-par musical ability, where Dax Reynosa aggressively opens with the rapped line [...] "I pull a pistol out my pocket and I cock it".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the rest}} of the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement</b> many be multi-national, the Committee {{believes}} that its mono-national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss. Thanks to permanent Swiss neutrality, conflicting parties can be sure that no one from [...] "the enemy" [...] will be setting policy in Geneva. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 showed that even Red Cross actors (in this case National Societies) can be so bound by nationalism that they are unable to sustain neutral humanitarianism.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{researchers}} have shown in recent studies how roundabouts speed distribution, {{together with other}} features (entering flow, circulating flow, entry curvature, entry path radius, entry width, approach width, ratio of inscribed circle diameter/central island diameter, angle to next leg, etc.), {{can be used as}} a measure of safety level for these intersections. The wide use of different micro-simulation models for a preventive analysis of roundabouts performance (capacity, delays, levels of service, etc.) highlights the need for a deeper study of the most sensitive parameters for a better fitting between simulated and observed traffic conditions. This work is based on an experimental analysis of the <b>crossing</b> <b>movement</b> in two roundabouts characterized by different values of the inscribed circle diameter (D 1 ≈½•D 2) and located close together on the same road in the University Campus of Arcavacata, Italy. The main aim of the research is the suggestion of a methodological approach to the simulation process of the through movement by the use of VISSIM® micro-simulation software. Resultsconcern the following issues: (i) coherence validation of experimental data regarding speed distributions along the <b>crossing</b> <b>movement</b> as a function of roundabout radius; (ii) methodological and procedural issues related to the implementation of simulation parameters in VISSIM, particularly referring to speed distributions along the <b>crossing</b> <b>movement,</b> in order to better understand the effects of the change of roundabouts geometric features on simulation results...|$|R

2500|$|In 1919, {{representatives from}} the {{national}} Red Cross societies of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US came together in Paris to found the [...] "League of Red Cross Societies". The original idea was Henry Davison's, then president of the American Red Cross. This move, led by the American Red Cross, expanded the international activities of the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>movement</b> beyond the strict mission of the ICRC to include relief assistance in response to emergency situations which were not caused by war (such as man-made or natural disasters). The ARC already had great disaster relief mission experience extending back to its foundation.|$|E
2500|$|By {{virtue of}} its age and place in {{international}} humanitarian law, the ICRC is the lead agency in the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Movement,</b> but it has weathered some power struggles within the movement. The ICRC has come into conflict with the Federation and certain national societies at various times. The American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as [...] "a real international Red Cross" [...] after the First World War. Elements of the Swedish Red Cross desired to supplant the Swiss authority of the ICRC after WWII. Over time the Swedish sentiments subsided, and the IFRC grew to work more harmoniously with the ICRC after years of organizational discord. Currently, the IFRC's Movement Cooperation division organizes interaction and cooperation with the ICRC.|$|E

2500|$|During {{parts of}} May through June 1944, some 10,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed {{on a daily}} basis at Auschwitz-Birkenau, a pace with which the crematoria could not maintain, so many of the bodies were burned in open pits. The 410,000 Jews killed during this period {{represents}} the [...] "largest single group of Jews murdered after 1942" [...] according to historian Christian Gerlach. Much of the efficiency with which the Germans were able to deport and kill Hungarian Jews stemmed from the “frictionless cooperation of Hungary’s politicians, bureaucracy, and gendarmerie”, and popular Hungarian anti-Semitism served to block any Jews trying to escape. Historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia report that members of Hungary’s [...] "fascist Arrow <b>Cross</b> <b>movement</b> shot Jews in Budapest and force-marched Jewish labor battalions into Germany under horrific conditions." [...] Hungarians aligned with Arrow Cross shot as many as 20,000 Jews and dumped their bodies into the Danube River between December 1944 and the end of January 1945.|$|E
60|$|It was all {{perfectly}} clear now to even such a novice as Sparrer. It {{was a set}} for beaver. He knew enough about the animals to know that their favorite food is poplar bark. The green poplar stick was bait. It seemed queer {{to think of a}} stick of wood as bait, but this is what it was, and nothing else. He saw that it was securely fastened at the butt end {{in a corner of the}} pen and was staked down near the opening so that there could be no <b>cross</b> <b>movement.</b> It could not be pulled out. The only way for a hungry beaver to get it would be to enter the pen and cut it off and in doing this he could hardly fail of stepping in the trap. Then he would drown miserably under the ice. The part left sticking out beyond the pen was by way of a teaser. It would be the first part touched by the animal and would undoubtedly be cut off close to the pen. Having had a taste of the fresh green bark and no harm having come from it the animal would unsuspectingly enter the pen to secure the remainder, whereas with the bait wholly within the pen in the first place the animal would be suspicious and wary of entering. It was all very simple, clever and diabolical.|$|E
