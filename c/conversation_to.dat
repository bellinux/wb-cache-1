5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov {{to be the}} man in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed the <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E

5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E

25|$|Membership in the Klan is secret. Like many fraternal organizations, the Klan has signs {{which members}} {{can use to}} {{recognize}} one another.

The response AKIA (A Klansman I am) completes the greeting.|$|E
25|$|MTL amnesic {{patients}} with localized {{damage to the}} hippocampus retain other perceptual abilities, {{such as the ability}} to intelligently function in society, to make <b>conversation,</b> <b>to</b> make one's bed, etc. Additionally, anterograde amnesics without combined retrograde disorders (localized damage to the MTL system) have memories prior to the traumatic event. For this reason, the MTL is not the storage place of all memories; other regions in the brain also store memories. The key is the MTL is responsible for the learning of new materials.|$|E

While initially cold and distant from others, Yasuna gradually changes and becomes much easier to approach. Her friends in the musical ensemble tell her this, and ask her if she changed due to someone she likes, and Yasuna affirms this. Yasuna has shown herself to be very devoted to Hazumu, and in a <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Tomari, Yasuna tells her that she wants Hazumu all to herself.|$|E

If a user starts chatting to the volunteer and turns the <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> sex, the volunteer responds positively and encourages them to divulge personal details, particularly a telephone number, ostensibly needed to verify their identity so that a meeting can be arranged.|$|E
25|$|Despite Genie's {{increased}} willingness {{and ability}} to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less than most people in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance {{to that of a}} person who had not been socialized. The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> her lack of socialization during childhood instead of her language constraints.|$|E

25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the <b>conversation.</b> <b>To</b> study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{building}} {{proved to}} be a location that was ideal for his crimes, both in providing victims, and in concealing the evidence of their murders. Sailors arriving in the port of Aberdeen would usually visit the Sailor's Union building soon after disembarking. There they could collect their mail and, if they wished, set some money aside in savings. Gohl would usually be on duty, alone. Typically Gohl would ask if the sailors had any family or friends in the area. Then he would turn the <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> the topic of money and valuables. If the sailor was just passing through, and would not be missed by anyone in the area, and had more than a trivial amount of cash or valuables on hand, Gohl would choose him as his next victim.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 March 1603 Queen Elizabeth died without naming a successor. A few days {{beforehand}} De Vere at his house at Hackney had entertained the Earl of Lincoln, a nobleman known for erratic and violent behaviour similar to his host's. Lincoln reported that after dinner De Vere spoke of the Queen's impending death, claiming that the peers of England should decide the succession, and suggested that since Lincoln had 'a nephew of the blood royal…Lord Hastings', he {{should be sent to}} France to find allies to support this claim. Lincoln relayed this <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Sir John Peyton, Lieutenant of the Tower, who, knowing how physically and financially infirm De Vere was, refused to take Lincoln's report as a serious threat to King James' accession.|$|E

25|$|All cars, taxis, {{buses and}} trucks {{go through a}} {{preliminary}} security checkpoint before entering the airport compound. Armed guards spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may strike up a <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> further assess the person's intent. Plainclothes armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden surveillance cameras operate at all times. Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last {{as little as a}} minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and body searches may be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{reported}} the <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, who submitted the ambassador's comments and offer to Congress. Jefferson argued that paying tribute would encourage more attacks. Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, {{he believed that}} circumstances forced the U.S. to pay tribute until an adequate navy could be built. The U.S. had just fought an exhausting war, which put the nation deep in debt. Federalist and Anti-Federalist forces argued over {{the needs of the}} country and the burden of taxation. Jefferson's own Democratic-Republicans and anti-navalists believed that {{the future of the country}} lay in westward expansion, with Atlantic trade threatening to siphon money and energy away from the new nation, to be spent on wars in the Old World. The U.S. paid Algiers the ransom, and continued to pay up to $1million per year over the next 15 years for the safe passage of American ships and the return of American hostages. A $1million payment in ransom and tribute to the privateering states amounted to approximately 10% of the U.S. government's annual revenues in 1800.|$|E
