5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{points out}} that Earth is a closed system in the {{thermodynamic}} sense of the term: Earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) {{with the rest of}} the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of 'low entropy' are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the Earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the Sun. Since the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come, the Earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the Earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu {{points out that}} this 'asymmetry' helps explaining the historical subjection of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E

Waveform tomography has become a feasible method <b>of</b> revealing <b>the</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth’s</b> interior at various spatial scales. We used waveform tomography with iterative waveform inversion to obtain a fine structure model through the adjoint method, referred to as “adjoint tomography” (e.g., Tape et al. 2007, 2010).|$|R

It is less often noted that in large regions, this solid mass is actually a two-phase or multiphase medium, containing varying amounts of fluid (usually liquid) interspersed throughout the granular solid. Processes in fluid-rock media play an essential role in many important geological phenomena. It is percolation through such a medium (a partial melt) that permits melts to escape prior to volcanic eruptions and other igneous emplacements. Nearer <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> surface, <b>the</b> migration <b>of</b> aqueous or hydrocarbon fluids in <b>the</b> <b>crust</b> is <b>of</b> interest in metamorphic and sedimentary geology as well as in hydrology and hydrocarbon exploration. Fluid migration at all levels within <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> can profoundly influence heat flow and material transport. <b>The</b> layering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> including <b>the</b> existence and nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core and <b>the</b> stratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle and <b>crust,</b> is likely to be due in part to <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> fluid-rock systems. There are many different fluid-rock systems in geology, and this review considers only a subset <b>of</b> these. <b>The</b> primary emphasis is on two geologic environments where the coupling between fluid flow and rock deformation is important: high-temperature systems where a melt coexists with a solid matrix that can deform by creep as the melt migrates; and low-temperature systems where a fluid, usually aqueous, saturates a matrix that has varying degrees of cohesion and fracturing. We do not consider suspensions (e. g. crystals in a convecting magma chamber or rock fragments carried in <b>the</b> plume <b>of</b> a volcanic eruption). At the opposite extreme, we exclude solidlike systems where fluid is present but little or no fluid movement occurs (e. g. fluid inclusions in crystals). Minor consideration is given to systems where the fluid moves but the solid is essentially rigid (e. g. <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> oil, water, and gas in hydrocarbon reservoirs). We also limit ourselves to processes where inertia is negligible: Both <b>the</b> microscopic motion <b>of</b> fluid through cracks and pores and <b>the</b> macroscopic motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid matrix are assumed to be characterized by a small Reynolds number. For example, we do not consider seismic-wave propagation in poroelastic media. Even with these restrictions, more important geodynamic phenomena are covered than can be effectively reviewed in detail. Our goal is rather to identify common ground between studies of different geological environments, and to demonstrate to practitioners <b>of</b> fluid mechanics <b>the</b> interesting range <b>of</b> phenomena that fluid-rock systems exhibit. We have divided <b>the</b> main body <b>of</b> this review into three sections: theory, material properties, and modeling and applications. The latter section is necessarily eclectic but encompasses studies ranging from laboratory experiments on analogue systems to computer simulations of large-scale processes in the crust and mantle...|$|R
