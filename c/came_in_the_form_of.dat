5|$|During {{the month}} of April 1917, German U-boats succeeded in sinking 860,334 tons of Allied and neutral shipping, a total {{unsurpassed}} by any month in {{either of the two}} world wars. U-70s contribution <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> ten ships of 23,530 tons sent to the bottom, four of them on the same day, 24 April.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans {{in the first five}} years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E

5|$|Recognition also <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> honorary doctorates by the University of Leeds (1967), the University of Mysore (1976) and Delhi University (1973). Towards {{the end of}} his career, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the upper house of the Indian Parliament for a six-year term starting in 1989, for his contributions to Indian literature. A year before his death, in 2001, he was awarded India's second-highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan.|$|E
5|$|The British, with no army in {{the field}} and behind in rearmament, was in no {{position}} to challenge French strategy, which had assumed the prominent role of the Western Alliance.

5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 {{forced the}} zoo to close {{to protect the}} animals from {{possible}} infection. Since the zoo could not welcome any visitors, it faced significant financial losses. Questions were posed about the zoo's future, though {{in the end the}} park was able to reopen after only five weeks. Further help <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a £1.9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of the city in early April, just as the zoo reopened.|$|E

5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time to regroup and receive reinforcements, which <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E

His first loss <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a Raw dark match, at the TV taping on August 18, 2008, when he lost to William Regal. He also lost to D'Lo Brown in a dark match, before {{defeating}} Jamie Noble in a dark match prior to a SmackDown taping on August 29. He then lost the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship to Sheamus O'Shaunessy on September 18, after debuting for the ECW brand.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> piano lessons, which he later {{said in his}} instructional video A Work in Progress {{did not have much}} impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Madhavan {{appeared}} in a supporting role as an Indian police officer in Fred Olen Ray's English film, Inferno, which was shot in India. His first chance in Indian cinema <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Shanti Shanti Shanti (1998), a Kannada film, in which he appeared as a carefree youngster alongside actor Abbas. However, the film failed {{to make an impact}} and went unnoticed at the box office. During the period, Hindi film director Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a Bollywood hero, with a project titled Akeli, however the film was shelved before the production process had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Local {{defense in}} I Corps was {{provided}} by 50 battalions and five companies of Regional and Popular Forces, and six companies of military police. Support for ground forces in the area <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Air Force Division (commanded by Brigadier-General Nguyen Van Khanh), with two naval squadrons operating on the coast and another two along the rivers. Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were regular soldiers and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. Those forces were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M-42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of different sizes.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> helping Allied airmen escape, {{and numerous}} lines {{were set up}} to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line {{had a series of}} safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E
5|$|Since the Romans used a form {{of direct}} democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E

5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Tzemah, the Haganah command {{realized}} {{the importance of the}} campaign in the region, and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley, and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and Iraq to the south. On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having been charged with creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans.|$|E
