5000|$|Crataegus azarolus is {{a species}} of {{hawthorn}} known by the common names azarole, azerole, and Mediterranean medlar. It is native to the Mediterranean Basin and is a common plant there, growing on sites comparable to those the European <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> grows on. In the Arab countries it is the commonest of the hawthorn species; in the Arabic language the term [...] "common hawthorn" [...] means the azarole hawthorn. When growing in the wild the azerole bears plentiful crops of haw fruits, which {{are similar to the}} haws of the European <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> but plumper.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these major crops, various mushroom species are harvested; several species of berries are harvested, sometimes from the wild; and <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn,</b> Thyme, and Hypericum are important medicinal species.|$|R
50|$|The adult beetles can {{be found}} from April to August feeding on pollen of {{valerians}} (Valeriana species), <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> (Crataegus monogyna), elderberry (Sambucus species), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and European pear (Pyrus communis).|$|R
50|$|Crataegus monogyna, {{known as}} <b>common</b> <b>{{hawthorn}}</b> or single-seeded hawthorn, is {{a species of}} hawthorn native to Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia. It has been introduced in {{many other parts of}} the world. It can be an invasive weed.|$|R
50|$|Linnaeus {{introduced}} the name Crataegus oxyacantha for {{a species of}} Northern European Hawthorn and the name gradually became used for several similar species which were assumed to be the same, particularly the Midland Hawthorn C. laevigata and the <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> C. monogyna. In 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed and described a single-styled species similar to the <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn,</b> and the Midland Hawthorn was effectively a later discovery. However, Byatt showed that confusion over the true identity of C. oxyacantha remained, and the name was formally rejected as ambiguous by the International Botanical Congress. More recently, Christensen concluded that the species studied by Linnaeus matches C. rhipidophylla Gand., a relatively rare species.|$|R
5000|$|In the Basque language, elorrio is {{the word}} for the red fruit (haw) of the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> The Basque word elorri means [...] "hawthorn". The coat of arms of the town shows a hawthorn. Colloquially, the town was called Elorrixo in Basque.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is notable}} for (in the {{grassland}} areas) Festuca ovina (sheep's fescue), Avenula pratensis (meadow oat-grass), Brachypodium pinnatum (tor-grass), and Polyommatus bellargus (Adonis Blue) - a nationally scarce species of butterfly, {{and in the}} scrub areas, Crataegus monogyna (<b>common</b> <b>hawthorn),</b> and Hedera helix (ivy).|$|R
5000|$|Dasineura crataegi (Winnertz, 1853), the {{hawthorn}} button-top gall-midge, is a dipteran gall-midge. It {{causes the}} hawthorn button-top gall, which develops {{in the terminal}} shoots of <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> Crataegus monogyna Jacq., midland hawthorn C laevigata (Poir.) DC and their hybrid, C × media Bechst. [...] Synonyms are Perrisia crataegi and Cecidomyia crataegi (Winnertz, 1853).|$|R
50|$|In the past, midland {{hawthorn}} {{was widely}} but incorrectly {{known by the}} name C oxyacantha, a name that has now been rejected as being of uncertain application. In 1753 Linnaeus introduced the name C oxyacantha for the single species {{of which he was}} aware, but described {{it in such a way}} that the name became used for various species, including both the midland and the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> In 1775 Jacquin formally separated the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> naming it C monogyna, and in 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed a different plant, and this would be C. oxyacantha. However, by this time confusion over the true identity of C oxyacantha was so great that Byatt proposed that the name should be formally rejected as ambiguous, and this proposal was accepted by the International Botanical Congress, although the name continues to be used informally.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> is {{extensively}} planted {{as a hedge}} plant, {{especially for}} agricultural use. Its spines and close branching habit render it effectively stock- and human-proof, with some basic maintenance. The traditional practice of hedge laying is most commonly practised with this species. It is a good fire wood which burns with a good heat and little smoke.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> is {{distinguished}} from the related but less widespread Midland hawthorn (C. laevigata) by its more upright growth, the leaves being deeply lobed, with spreading lobes, and in the flowers having just one style, not two or three. However they are inter-fertile and hybrids occur frequently; they are only entirely distinct in their more typical forms.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{growing in}} the reserve include oak (found in {{the centre of the}} wood on sandy ground), field maple, wild service tree, small-leaved lime, midland <b>hawthorn</b> and <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> Conifers were planted {{throughout}} as timber, disturbing the original distribution of stand types; they are being removed. Areas have been indiscriminately sprayed with herbicides in the past.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} the ground, and low down in bushes, its food mainly {{consisting}} of seeds, which it also feeds to its chicks. It likes small to medium-sized seeds from most arable weeds, knotgrass, dock), crucifers (including charlock, shepherd's purse), chickweeds, dandelions, thistle, sow-thistle, mayweed, <b>common</b> groundsel, <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> and birch. They {{have a small}} component of Invertebrates in their diet.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a large}} shrub {{or small}} tree growing to 8 m or rarely to 12 m tall, with a dense crown. The leaves are 2-6 cm long and 2-5 cm broad, with two to three shallow, forward-pointing lobes {{on each side of}} the leaf. The {{hermaphrodite}} flowers are produced in corymbs of six to twelve, each flower with five white or pale pink petals and two or sometimes three styles. The flowers are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dark red pome 6-10 mm diameter, slightly broader than long, containing two or three nutlets.It is distinguished from the closely related <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> C monogyna, in the leaves being only shallowly lobed, with forward-pointing lobes, and in the flowers having more than one style. Each style produces a seed, so its fruits also have more than one seed and these make them slightly oval, in contrast with the single-seeded and therefore round fruits of <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> The two species hybridise, giving rise to C × media.|$|R
50|$|Procyanidin B2 can {{be found}} in Cinchona pubescens (Chinchona, in the rind, bark and cortex), in Cinnamomum verum (Ceylon cinnamon, in the rind, bark and cortex), in Crataegus monogyna (<b>Common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> in the flower and blossom), in Uncaria guianensis (Cat's claw, in the root), in Vitis vinifera (Common grape vine, in the leaf), in Litchi chinensis (litchi, in the pericarp), in the apple, and in Ecdysanthera utilis.|$|R
5000|$|Hethel {{is noted}} for {{containing}} the oldest known living hawthorn tree in East Anglia and possibly in the United Kingdom (reputed {{to be more}} than 700 years old).

5000|$|Reports {{that it is}} {{native to}} Spain appear {{to be based on}} {{misidentification}} of the <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> (Crataegus monogyna). Some report it is only known in cultivation and not in the wild. It is thought by some [...] to be a hybrid between the Crataegus monogyna and another species, perhaps the Azarole hawthorn (Crataegus azarolus). If it is of hybrid origin it may have arisen more than once.|$|R
50|$|Numerous hybrids exist, some {{of which}} are used as garden shrubs. The most widely used hybrid is C. × media (C. monogyna × C. laevigata), of which several cultivars are known, {{including}} the very popular 'Paul's Scarlet' with dark pink double flowers. Other garden shrubs that have sometimes been suggested as possible hybrids involving the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> include the various-leaved hawthorn of the Caucasus, which is only very occasionally found in parks and gardens.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} native tree in North Saanich is Douglas-fir. The other common large {{conifers}} are grand fir and western red cedar. Western hemlock is occasionally found. Pacific yew {{is a frequent}} understory tree. The arbutus is a large broadleaf evergreen species. Large deciduous trees are black cottonwood, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Garry oak. Small deciduous species include bitter cherry, cascara, Pacific crab apple, Pacific dogwood, quaking aspen, Douglas maple, <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> and willow.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> is a shrub {{or small}} tree 5-14 metres (15 to 45 feet) tall, with a dense crown. The bark is dull brown with {{vertical}} orange cracks. The younger stems bear sharp thorns, approximately 12.5mm (half an inch) long. The leaves are 20 to 40mm (1 to 1½ inches) long, obovate and deeply lobed, sometimes {{almost to the}} midrib, with the lobes spreading at a wide angle. The upper surface is dark green above and paler underneath.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species and}} hybrids {{are used as}} {{ornamental}} and street trees. The <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> is extensively used in Europe as a hedge plant. During the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, hawthorn saplings were mass propagated in nurseries to create the new field boundaries required by the Inclosure Acts. Several cultivars of the Midland hawthorn C. laevigata have been selected for their pink or red flowers. Hawthorns are among the trees most recommended for water conservation landscapes.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "haws" [...] or {{fruits of}} the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> C. monogyna, are edible but the flavour has been {{compared}} to over-ripe apples. In the United Kingdom, they are sometimes used to make a jelly or homemade wine. [...] The leaves are edible and, if picked in spring when still young, are tender enough to be used in salads. The young leaves and flower buds, which are also edible, are known as [...] "bread and cheese" [...] in rural England.|$|R
5000|$|The Glastonbury thorn {{is a form}} of <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> Crataegus monogyna 'Biflora' (sometimes {{incorrectly}} called Crataegus oxyacantha var. praecox), {{found in}} and around Glastonbury, Somerset, England. Unlike ordinary hawthorn trees, it flowers twice a year (hence the name [...] "biflora"), the first time in winter and the second time in spring. The trees in the Glastonbury area have been propagated by grafting since ancient times. The tree is also widely called the holy thorn, though this term strictly speaking refers to the original (legendary) tree.|$|R
5000|$|Nuts are not {{gathered}} in England in May. The lyrics are probably a corruption of [...] "knots of may", {{referring to the}} blossom of the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> [...] Another possible [...] "nut" [...] is the corm or tuber of Conopodium majus, commonly called pignut, groundnut etc. and easily found in May when the plant flowers. These [...] "nuts" [...] were commonly gathered by children as they grow under the ground sparsely, so they were not a viable food source to be {{gathered in}} quantities by adults.|$|R
5000|$|Trees held an {{important}} place in Gaelic culture {{from the earliest}} times. Particularly large trees were venerated, and the most valuable such as oak, Common Hazel and Apple were classed as [...] "nobles". The less important <b>Common</b> Alder, <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> and Gean were classed as [...] "commoners", and there were [...] "lower orders" [...] and [...] "slaves" [...] such as Eurasian Aspen and Juniper. The alphabet was learned as a mnemonic using tree names. Rowan was regularly planted close to Highland houses as a protection from witchcraft.|$|R
