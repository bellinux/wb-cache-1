5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E

5|$|At its {{congress}} {{in the summer of}} 1978, the International Ice Hockey Federation approved proposals to hold the second and third Canada Cup tournaments in 1979 and 1982. However, tensions between Canada's rival governing bodies, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and Hockey Canada, increased after the latter body accused the CAHA of reneging on promises it had made regarding Hockey Canada's control of international events involving professional players. Hockey Canada's chief negotiator for international events, Alan Eagleson, accused the CAHA of attempting to sabotage the Canada Cup and threatened to <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> tournament if the CAHA refused to compromise with his body.|$|E
5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus {{was simply not}} worth deploying.

5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Guthy-Renker sells Proactiv {{as part of}} a {{continuity}} program, {{also known}} as a negative-option offer, whereby customers are sent repeat orders until they cancel. When purchasing directly from the company, customers automatically become members of a Proactiv club. A month after ordering, and every three months thereafter, they are sent a three-month supply costing $60 (in the US as of 2011), plus shipping and handling. They are billed monthly until they <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> subscription. The approach is based on the customer lifetime value model.|$|E
