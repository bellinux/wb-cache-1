40|$|The authors {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of a suspended floor element <b>connection</b> (<b>sheet</b> steel hangers) employed in the Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) system. The hangers are mounted with screws and are pre-attached to the floor elements at manufacturing. This arrangement makes {{the design of the}} hanger critical with respect to safety and load transfer redundancy, since the screws transfer all the loads, both withdrawal and shear forces can act simultaneously. Tests have been carried out to examine the structural behaviour of the hanger. The two most critical load cases, vertical floor load and horizontal wind suction load, and three different screw joint configurations were investigated. The results indicate that the vertical distance between the screw joint and the upper edge of the rim beam should be increased and that withdrawal forces on the screws should be kept as low as possible. Some suggestions for improving the present design are given and a modified design is proposed to enhance the load-bearing capacity and to improve the overall safety and redundancyGodkänd; 2012; 20121205 (ysko...|$|E

In this context, we address a prominent theme of morphological variation in clonal organisms: the relative investment in vascular versus ramet tissue. The colonial hydroid Hydractinia is characterized by colonies with widely spaced polyps and long stolonal connections (runners) and colonies with closely packed polyps and short stolonal <b>connections</b> (<b>sheets).</b> Surgical manipulations of gastrovascular architecture were used to alter flow patterns within developing runner and sheet colonies, and subsequent morphological development of colonies was assessed. Reducing within-colony variation in patterns of gastrovascular flow of runner colonies resulted in a lower rate of production of peripheral stolons and a sheet-type morphology. Experimentally increased variation in flow patterns within sheet colonies resulted {{in the development of}} peripheral stolons-hence, the initiation of a runnerlike growth trajectory. In both experiments, control colonies, in which stolonal architecture was not manipulated, maintained the runner or sheet morphology characteristic of their respective clones.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules.

A parametric study on the bearing strengths of 182 single shear bolted connections at 7 different temperatures was performed using the verified FEM. Bearing factors that included the effects of elevated temperatures were proposed for the bearing strengths of single shear bolted connections with and without considering bolt hole deformation. The bearing strengths of single shear bolted <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels obtained from the tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the deterioration of material properties at elevated temperatures.

30|$|FRP {{materials}} {{to the form}} of outer coverage {{have been used for}} enhancing the resistance and improvement of the existing concrete structures from 1980 s so far. The related FPR strengthening projects have been dramatically increased all over the world. This growth rate has started from a couple of projects to thousands during last decade. The EMPA Switzerland Institute can be mentioned as the primary researchers in the field of FPR strengthening. The researches were performed on CFRP strengthened RC beams in 1984. The most important advantages of using FRP sheets are the high ratio of resistance to weight and also high ratio of resistance to corrosion (Jankowiak 2012). The first quality would cause the ease of application in place and reduction of the wage cost. The second characteristic would cause the durability of execution. Different parts of strengthened structures with FRP systems with the forms of outer coverage are: beams, columns, walls, joints, chimneys, circular arches, tunnels, bins, pipes, and trusses. FRP coverage as an alternative for other strengthening strategies such as using steel sheets and ducts around concrete columns has been invented. The FRP coverage has been developed {{for the first time in}} 1980 s in Japan and Europe for improvement of concrete structures. Nowadays, FRP systems have been used as steel sheet alternatives. FRP sheets are 2 – 10 times stronger than steel sheets, while they weigh 20 % of steel sheets (Ahmad and van Gernert 1999). The limitations to use this sort of materials in civil engineering applications are just because of high cost. FRP composites are so resistant against the corrosion, salty, and alkali environment. Nowadays, FRP composites have been topic of wide spread studies as alternatives of steel bars and pre-stressed cables. The <b>connection</b> of steel <b>sheets</b> to tensile part of concrete pieces by epoxy resins to enhance bending strength of such pieces is a normal and durable method. This method has been used for strengthening of many bridges and buildings around the world. Since steel sheets would corrode and cause destruction of steel <b>sheet</b> <b>connections</b> with concrete, and also they are hard to establish and should be installed using extremely heavy machines, researchers have tried to replace FRP materials instead of steel (Darby 1999; Holloway 1999).|$|R

By purchasing sheet music and carrying it into their homes, American citizens literally bought into the war propaganda, heeding the siren call of the female imagery in CPI advertising to invest materially and emotionally in the war effort.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{characterisation}} and numerical modelling of advanced sheet metal components reinforced by light metal cast structures (SADH). The modelling is focused on full car simulation. One major aspect is the discretisation of form closure <b>connections</b> between <b>sheet</b> metal and aluminium cast structure which realise the compound between both materials. A SADH structure consists of a steel sheet metal and an integrated stiffening structure of aluminium. For the manufacturing process a perforated sheet metal is placed in a high pressure die casting tool before the casting. During the casting the holes of the sheet metal are filled with aluminium and a fixed form closure connection is generated. At a demonstrator structure of a SADH typical characteristics are named and analysed. Resulting from different thermal expansion coefficients and manufacturing temperatures residual stresses and distortion are analysed. Static loading tests are carried out to analyse the mechanical performance. For a virtual development process a numerical model of a SADH is generated. To model the material characteristics thermal loading test become necessary for the sheet metal. The sheet metal is exposed to a short and high thermal treatment during the high pressure die casting process which has to be considered for the material card. At a special form closure specimen manufacturing details are investigated. This specimen is further used to generate a loading profile of form closure connections under different conditions. Based on the test data a numerical model of the form closure connections is developed on full car modelling level. The verified form closure model is then transferred to the SADH structural model. Concluding the correlation between numerical calculation and experiments is shown on the SADH structural tests...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} have {{advantages in}} quality and shorter construction time. The connection of a precast concrete structures {{is important for}} the successful construction. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the flexural capacity of the portal system beam-column connection of precast concrete using CFRP sheet. The study was conducted to develop a connection system using CFRP sheet on a precast concrete frame of a highway bridges. A series of specimens with parameter of CFRP sheet patterns was prepared. A shear key on the column was prepared to support the beams connected to the column. Therefore the CFRP sheet was patched to sustain only the flexural forces occurred on the <b>connection.</b> The CFRP <b>sheet</b> patterns applied were combined with CFRP belt to increase the bonding capacity of the main CFRP sheet. A monolith specimen was also prepared as control specimens. Initially the columns and beams were casted separately to produce a precast concrete. The shear key on the column was strengthened using anchored steel plate. Results indicated that the specimens using CFRP <b>sheet</b> as <b>connection</b> has flexural capacity of approximately 85 % of the monolith specimens...|$|R
40|$|The current {{design rules}} on bolted <b>connections</b> of thin <b>sheet</b> steels for cold-formed steel {{structures}} are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. Investigation of single shear bolted connections at elevated temperatures is limited. In this study, 120 single shear bolted connection specimens involving three different thicknesses of thin sheet steels and 30 coupon specimens {{were conducted by}} using steady state test method in the temperature range from 22 to 900 °C. There are three main failure modes observed in the single shear bolted connection tests, namely the net section tension, bearing, and tear out. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that {{the strengths of the}} single shear bolted connections predicted by the specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. The comparison between the deterioration of the tested connection strengths and that of the material properties at elevated temperatures showed a similar tendency of reduction. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
