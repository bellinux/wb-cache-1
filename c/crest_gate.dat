It was built by Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the king of Mysore under the {{guidance}} of his Diwan, Sir M Visweswaraiah. It was built to irrigate 6070 hectares of land and has a masonry structure of 139 m and a pair of earth dams extending to 1470 metres on either side. The reservoir has a catchment area of [...] and can hold a volume of 68 million m³ of water at a full reservoir level of 731.57 m above the mean sea level. 27 species of fish, including 13 species of commercial fishes have been recorded in the reservoir with Puntius being the dominant species of fish found here. Cirrhinus reba and Labeo calbasu and other transplanted carps are also found here. However, the maintenance of the dam has been poor. In 2000, a part of the dam had to be demolished to prevent floods and save 25 villages. Water started overflowing the dam and only 1 <b>crest</b> <b>gate</b> could be opened.

40|$|After the {{existing}} Tempe Town Lake downstream dam failed unexpectedly in 2010, the City of Tempe, AZ, USA was tasked with designing and constructing a replacement dam {{to maintain their}} lake, pass flows in the ephemeral Salt River, and deliberately lower to avert flooding. Through an alternatives evaluation process, a hydraulically operated steel gate system was selected from a field of twenty studied alternative configurations to replace {{the existing}} rubber bladder system. The gate design produced eight 32. 3 meter (106 foot) long, 6. 4 meter (21 foot) tall, and 118, 000 kilogram (260, 000 pound) steel gates operated by single-acting hydraulic cylinders and powered by a power unit featuring two 1, 893 cm 3 /s (30 gpm) axial piston pumps each powered by a 37 kW (50 hp) motor. With local and remote monitoring and control capability, the system is designed to control the gates under automatic or manual control mode. The design also includes a foundation seepage control and collection system using a cement-bentonite cutoff wall and drainage blanket; a scour wall; a stilling basin designed to accommodate variable crest elevations; instrumentation and controls designed to maintain the recreational lake while preventing unintended flooding; and an operations, maintenance and dam monitoring plan all designed to maintain dam safety, avert flooding, and preserve the City of Tempe’s valuable resource, Tempe Town Lake.

25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as <b>crest</b> <b>gates.</b> In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|R

50|$|Stoplogs are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. Stoplogs are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or <b>crest</b> <b>gates.</b> Stoplogs are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a weir, gate, or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing stoplogs is not manual, but done with hydraulic stop log lifters and hoists. Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of stoplogs, finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as stoplogs as well. Stoplogs are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|R

40|$|Nappe {{oscillation}} {{may affect}} {{a variety of}} free overflow hydraulic structures operating at low heads such as <b>crest</b> <b>gates</b> and various types of weirs. This phenomenon produces oscillations in the thin nappe cascading downstream of the control structure. These oscillations {{can result in a}} high noise levels that may affect people and structures located nearby. With long linear and thin overtopping walls, piano key weirs might be subject to strong nappe oscillation risks, as a few documented cases with labyrinth weirs. However, the specific geometric features of piano key weirs, such as the outlet ramps or the limited width of the inlet apex, could perhaps prevent the development of nappe oscillation. In this paper, a prototype-scale linear weir is operated to assess the risk of nappe oscillations on a piano key weir like configuration (sidewall). In particular, the effect of the weir width and inclined apron is analyzed. The experimental results show that nappe oscillation development should not occur on piano key weir, contrary to what might be observed on a labyrinth weir with the same crest. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Nappe {{vibration}} is {{a phenomenon}} that has been witnessed {{in the field for}} a variety of different free overflow hydraulic structures operating at low heads, such as fountains, <b>crest</b> <b>gates,</b> and weirs. This phenomenon is visually characterized by oscillations in the thin nappe cascading downstream of the control structure. These oscillations can produce a significant level of noise and acoustic pressure waves, which can increase the environmental and societal impacts of the hydraulic structure. As a result, a detailed investigation has been undertaken to identify practical and effective mitigation solutions for free-overfall structures where nappe vibration may be of concern. Research is being performed with a prototype-scale linear weir (weir length of 3. 5 m and fall height of 3 m) located at the Engineering Hydraulics laboratory of the University of Liège, to assess the effectiveness of various crest modifications and any corresponding impacts to hydraulic efficiency (i. e., flow rate). The test matrix includes the optimization (position and spacing of elements) of three mitigation solutions which are projecting bolts, deflectors and step. In addition, a high-speed camera and audio equipment have been used to evaluate effectiveness of the configurations in reducing nappe vibration. Finally, this practical study has identified countermeasures suitable for retrofits and new construction, easy to construct, durable, hydraulically efficient, and with minimal potential for debris collection.

40|$|Under {{relatively}} low-head discharges, {{the occurrence}} of nappe oscillation, otherwise known as nappe vibration, may be observed on hydraulic structures with a free overfall, such as weirs, <b>crest</b> <b>gates</b> and fountains. This phenomenon, which has been early identified as undesirable and potentially dangerous on gates, is characterized by oscillations in the thin flow nappe cascading downstream of the crest. In addition, these oscillations produce a significant level of noise and acoustic pressure waves that increase the environmental and societal impacts of the structure. A review of the scientific literature shows a lack of consensus regarding the causes and source of the oscillations development. In this context of relatively poor understanding of the dominant processes, a detailed investigation has been undertaken to identify and quantify the nappe vibration mechanism. The research is being performed with a prototype-scale linear weir located at the Engineering Hydraulics laboratory of the University of Liège. The study employs high-speed cameras and audio equipment to characterize the nappe vibration. This paper presents first characteristics of the nappe vibrations gained from images and sound analysis, {{especially in terms of}} vibration frequency, for a quarter round and a half round weir crest.

Simulation were performed to replicate the flow phenomenas in the physical model and to find out how well STAR-CCM+ is suited to cope the complex flow structures.
