5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt}} to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if your partner cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E

500|$|During her research, Brodie {{discovered}} {{primary sources}} {{that had previously}} been overlooked or neglected. She presented the young Joseph Smith as a good-natured, lazy, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker, who, in an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, first developed the notion of golden plates and then the concept of a religious novel, the Book of Mormon. This book, she claims, was based in part on an earlier work, View of the Hebrews, by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. [...] Brodie asserts that at first Smith was a deliberate impostor, who at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, became convinced that he was indeed a prophet—though without ever escaping [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon. Jan Shipps, a preeminent non-LDS scholar of Mormonism, who rejects this theory, nevertheless has called No Man Knows My History a [...] "beautifully written biography...the work of a mature scholar [...] represented the first genuine effort to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> contradictory evidence about Smith's early life." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch {{had little}} grass, {{perhaps as a}} result of earlier wet weather. [...] Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his {{spinning}} partner, Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459runs. [...] In reply, the Australians could not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to follow-on. [...] A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170runs. [...] Laker's performance was historic. [...] He took 10/53, {{the first time in a}} Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. [...] With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19wickets for the match, still a world record in first-class cricket. [...] Wisden reported that the Australians were [...] "extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose." [...] Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: [...] "When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain."

[...] Landing in great force on a weakly defended point, the Athenians swamped the beachfront defenses and moved inland, harassing the Spartans with missile fire whenever they attempted to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Athenian hoplites.

2500|$|Genesis {{followed}} Nursery Cryme with Foxtrot (1972), {{which included}} Hackett's classical guitar solo [...] "Horizons", which {{became one of}} his signature pieces. The next album, Selling England by the Pound (1973), features Hackett continuing the tapping technique and sweep picking, which was later popularised in 1984 by Yngwie Malmsteen. Both techniques are used on [...] "Dancing with the Moonlit Knight". One of Hackett's best known guitar solos is performed on [...] "Firth of Fifth" [...] and has remained a favourite in concert, even after Hackett's departure. Hackett's role in the group was reduced from what he had contributed on Selling England by the Pound during the recording of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974). He attributed this to {{not being able to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> material presented, and his failing marriage. Another factor was that Hackett had injured his left hand after he accidentally crushed a wine glass in his hand which severed a nerve and a tendon, causing the album's tour to be delayed and seven shows cancelled. This also reflected the tension within the band during this time as Gabriel was to leave the group at its conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The Spartans, {{under their}} {{commander}} Epitadas, attempted to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Athenian hoplites and push their enemies {{back into the}} sea, but Demosthenes detailed his lightly armed troops, in companies of about 200 men, to occupy high points and harass the enemy with missile fire whenever they approached. [...] When the Spartans rushed at their tormentors, the light troops, unencumbered by heavy hoplite armor, were easily able to run to safety; dust and ash from the recent fire, stirred up by the commotion, further contributed to the Spartans' predicament by obscuring their attackers from their sight. Unable to make any headway, the Spartans withdrew in some confusion to {{the northern end of}} the island, where they dug in behind their fortifications and hoped to hold out. [...] A stalemate took hold for some time, with the Athenians trying unsuccessfully to dislodge the Spartans from their strong positions. [...] At this point, the commander of the Messenian detachment in the Athenian force, Comon, approached Demosthenes and asked that he be given troops with which to move through the seemingly impassable terrain along the island's shore. [...] His request was granted, and Comon led his men into the Spartan rear through a route that had been left unguarded on account of its roughness. [...] When he emerged with his force, the Spartans, in disbelief, abandoned their defenses; the Athenians seized the approaches to the fort, and the Spartan force stood on the brink of annihilation.|$|E
