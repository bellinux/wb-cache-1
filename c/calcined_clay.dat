50|$|The main {{components}} of LC3 are clinker, <b>calcined</b> <b>clay,</b> limestone, and gypsum. Its manufacturing process involves synergetic hydration. Adding {{large amounts of}} <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> and ground limestone to concrete mixtures, the aluminates from the clay interact with the calcium carbonates from the limestone. The additional alumina in the metakaolin reacts with the ground limestone, leading to a less porous material than other cements and providing equal strength {{with higher levels of}} clinker substitution.|$|E

Among the different family of geopolymers, two Tunisian clays (a kaolinite clay from Tabarka and illito/kaolinitic clay from Medenine) are tested for their feasibility of geopolymers at low temperature.

40|$|Concrete is the {{building}} material {{with the greatest}} potential for meeting the increasing housing demand in developing countries. Locally available materials {{should be considered as}} cement replacement in order to lower the costs and the environmental impact associated with the production of cement. Hence, this study investigated the potential use of calcined clayey soils to be used as reactive mineral admixtures in concrete, with special emphasis on a Cuban clayey soil. The study of the thermal behaviour of common clay types such as kaolinite, illite and montmorillonite was of key importance for the understanding of more complex locally available soils generally composed of a mixture of clays with companion minerals and impurities. <b>Clays</b> were <b>calcined</b> at temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C. The characterization of the raw and <b>calcined</b> <b>clays</b> included XRD, TGA, DTA, NMR, PSD, BET and SEM. The study of the pozzolanic activity was done in cement pastes by replacing 30 % of cement by <b>calcined</b> <b>clays</b> at a water/binder ratio of 0. 4. Curing was done in water at 30 °C to simulate the Cuban climate. CH depletion was monitored using XRD and TGA up to 90 days. The degree of hydration of the clinker component was assessed by BSE-image analysis. The identification of the hydrated phases in pastes was done by XRD, NMR and SEM. Long-term Isothermal Calorimetry as well as chemical shrinkage allowed the chemical contribution of the pozzolans to be identified independently of the filler effect and the hydration of cement [...] To see how did the different reactivities of <b>calcined</b> <b>clays</b> translate into mechanical properties, standard mortar bars (w/b 0. 5) were prepared and cured under the same conditions as the pastes for testing in compressive strength at 1, 7, 28 and 90 days. Sorptivity measurements were also performed to assess the durability properties. Kaolinite was found to have the highest potential for activation when calcined in the range of 600 °C to 800 °C. Locally available clays with only around 40 % of kaolinite showed good pozzolanic properties in pastes. The time at which the pozzolanic activity starts to be significant varied between 1 and 7 days. <b>Calcined</b> <b>clays</b> in cement tend to favour the formation of AFm phases such as hemicarboaluminate or monocarboaluminate. Strätlingite was also detected by 27 Al NMR. The Compressive strength of mortars incorporating kaolinite-based <b>calcined</b> <b>clays</b> was systematically similar or higher than the 100 % OPC mortar from around 7 days and the sorptivity of the blended systems was reduced.

40|$|The skinned {{portions}} of baseball and softball infields vary widely {{with respect to}} soil texture, applied amendments and conditioners, and water management. No studies have been reported that quantify {{the effects of these}} varying construction and maintenance practices on the playability of the skinned {{portions of}} infields. In Connecticut, USA, skinned infield plots were constructed from five different soils (silt loam, loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand) and amended with four rates of <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> (0, 4. 9, 9. 8, 19. 6 kg m– 2) to determine the effects on surface hardness, traction, and ball-to-surface friction (static and dynamic) at varying soil moisture contents (10, 14, and 18 %). Bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and shear strength of the different soil–calcined clay rate combinations were determined. Increasing the rate of <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> decreased bulk density and shear strengths, and increased saturated hydraulic conductivity. Surface hardness increased more with coarse-textured soils and increasing <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> rate, but decreased more with fine-textured soils and increasing soil moisture. Increasing the <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> rate resulted in decreases in ball-to-surface static friction across all soils and decreased dynamic friction with the fine-textured soils. Increases in soil moisture increased friction in all soils. The fine-textured soils had greater traction than the sandy soils, but no consistent <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> or moisture effects on traction were observed. Shear strength of the soils was highly correlated with traction and friction. The results suggest that differences in skinned infield soils are quantifiable, which could lead to the development of playing surface standards...|$|E

Mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 and percentage replacement level: 0, 10, 20, and 30 percents of cement by the various pozzolanas were used. Concrete cubes of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were cast, cured in aggressive media (CuSO 4 and NaCl solutions) and crushed at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days to determine their compressive strength hence durability. Test results indicated that fly ash, <b>calcined</b> <b>clay,</b> and rice husk ash were pozzolanic. Compressive strength increases for <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> as its contents increases from 10 %- 30 % signifying improved durability, while it is the opposite for fly ash and rice husk ash. All three pozzolanas showed improved durability, with fly ash been the most workable and <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> the least workable. Though, the results of the compressive strength of the concrete cubes made from portland-pozzolana cement (PPC) were not higher than that of the control (0 % Portland cement replacement), they were all higher than the minimum strength specified in the British Standard code (ASTM C 618, 1992). It was also observed that NaCl solution have a more severe effect on the durability for all three pozzolanas.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The Missouri Gravel Bed (MGB) is a system that uses pea gravel with 10 % sand (v/v) as a root growth medium, allowing bare root plants to be removed from the gravel and planted during the growing season.

Portland cement (CEM I) in concrete is normally partially replaced by supplementary cementitious materials such as ground granulated blastfurnace slag or pulverised fuel ash.

This study has investigated use of waste London clay as a supplementary cementitious material. The optimum <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> was produced at 900 °C and concrete made with 30 wt% of CEM I replaced by <b>calcined</b> <b>clay</b> had 28 -day strengths greater than control samples.
