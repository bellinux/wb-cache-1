40|$|Two {{models of}} an {{electronic}} hotel <b>key</b> <b>card</b> <b>system</b> are contrasted: a state based and a trace based one. Both are defined, verified, and proved equivalent in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. It is shown {{that if a}} guest follows a certain safety policy regarding her <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> she {{can be sure that}} nobody but her can enter her room. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nitpick is a {{counterexample}} generator for Isabelle/HOL {{that builds}} on Kodkod, a SAT-based first-order relational model finder. Nitpick supports unbounded quantification, (co) inductive predicates and datatypes, and (co) recursive functions. Fundamentally a finite model finder, it approximates infinite types by finite subsets. As case studies, we consider a security type {{system and a}} hotel <b>key</b> <b>card</b> <b>system.</b> Our experimental results on Isabelle theories and the TPTP library indicate that Nitpick generates more counterexamples than other model finders for higher-order logic, without restrictions on {{the form of the}} formulas to falsify. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{a general}} sense {{non-repudiation}} involves associating actions or changes to a unique individual. For a secure area, for example, it may be desirable to implement a <b>key</b> <b>card</b> access <b>system.</b> Non-repudiation would be violated {{if it were not}} also a strictly enforced policy to prohibit sharing of the <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> and to immediately report lost or stolen cards. Otherwise determining who performed the action of opening the door cannot be trivially determined. Similarly, for computer accounts, the individual owner of the account must not allow others to use that account, especially, for instance, by giving away their account's password, and a policy should be implemented to enforce this. This prevents the owner of the account from denying actions performed by the account.|$|R
40|$|The new Quickcheck is a {{counterexample}} generator for Isabelle/HOL that uncovers faulty specifications and invalid conjectures using various testing strategies. The previous Quickcheck only tested conjectures {{by random}} testing. The new Quickcheck extends {{the previous one}} and integrates two novel testing strategies: exhaustive testing with concrete values; and symbolic testing, evaluating conjectures with a narrowing strategy. Orthogonally to the strategies, we address two general issues: First, we extend the class of executable conjectures and specifications, and second, we present techniques to deal with conditional conjectures, i. e., conjectures with premises. We evaluate the testing strategies and techniques {{on a number of}} specifications, functional data structures and a hotel <b>key</b> <b>card</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Stallman {{refers to}} mobile phones as [...] "portable {{surveillance}} and tracking devices", {{and says he}} refuses to own a cell phone until there's one that runs entirely on free software. He also avoids using a <b>key</b> <b>card</b> to enter his office building since <b>key</b> <b>card</b> <b>systems</b> track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, {{with the exception of}} a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites - the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, then the script emails the user the web page content. [...] More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via Tor, except for Wikipedia (which generally disallows editing from Tor).|$|R

50|$|Server {{licensing}} {{on early}} versions of NetWare 286 {{was accomplished by}} using a <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>card</b> was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and had a serial number encoded on a ROM chip. The serial number had to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server. To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.x did not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks were used {{in place of the}} <b>key</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R

The name Transcash was formerly used by Girobank.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{mobility}} {{seems to}} be {{at the edge of a}} transition towards a new mobility concept. Transport users will not buy and own a car anymore. Rather they will have a contract with a mobility service provider that will fulfil the whole variety of urban mobility needs, including offering the users shared cars. This concept is nowhere fully implemented, yet. However, the building blocks of such a concept seem to form in Europe, in Asia and even in some US cities. The paper describes such a new urban mobility concept based on sharing-instead-of-owning. It eplains the status of the emerging building blocks that form such an urban mobility concept. New mobility options, ICT technologies both on front-end applications (smart-phones, <b>key</b> <b>card</b> <b>systems</b> for vehicles) and on back-end (reservation and payment systems) seem currently to become available. However, the market is still forming, but with some public transport operators, most car-manufacturers and large system operators setting-up mobility service schemes the competition is driving the development of a new mobility concept. It seems to us that transport research has largely neglected the emergence of such new mobility concepts. We are lacking behavioural studies e. g. on how a user would perform modal choice in such new concept, as well as modeling studies providing us with impacts on transport demand...|$|R

The Railroad operated over <b>Key</b> <b>Systems</b> A, B and C lines and the <b>Key</b> <b>Systems</b> freight-only tracks on 26th Street and along the waterfront. In 1943 the <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> sold the Oakland Terminal Railroad to the Western Pacific and the Santa Fe Railway. The Oakland Terminal Railroad was renamed the Oakland Terminal Railway.

5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the <b>key</b> <b>system</b> of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the <b>key</b> <b>system</b> that is now used for the transverse flute.

50|$|The modern {{version of}} this type of key is harder to {{duplicate}} as it is less common and requires a different machine from regular keys. These keys typically come in four and eight-pin models. Tubular keys were invented in 1934 by the Chicago Lock company in Chicago, IL under the ACE Branding.==== Maison <b>key</b> <b>system</b> ==== A Maison <b>key</b> <b>system</b> is a <b>keying</b> <b>system</b> that permits a lock to be opened with a number of unique, individual <b>keys.</b> Maison <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> are often found in apartment building common areas, such as main entrance or a laundry room where individual residents can use their own apartment key to access these areas.

50|$|Streetcar service {{across the}} East Bay was {{historically}} {{provided by the}} <b>Key</b> <b>System,</b> incorporated in 1902 as the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway. An amalgamation of several streetcar companies established in the late part of the century, the <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> provided interurban routes across Alameda county, with connections to San Francisco ferries via their private <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> Pier. Southern Pacific ran a competing system, East Bay Electric Lines, until they, too, had the <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> take over operations. When the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge opened in 1936, <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> cars could make the trip directly to the Transbay Terminal across the lower deck. Streetcars were replaced with busses in 1948 and transbay service halted in 1958. The system's assets were sold to the newly formed AC Transit in 1960.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} more {{commonly}} used form, known as Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood (RKCB), the 4NT bid is used to ask partner {{about the number of}} <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> held where the five <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> are the four aces and the king of trumps. Responses are stepwise: 5 for 0 or 3 <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> 5 for 1 or 4, 5 for 2 without the trump queen, 5 for 2 with the trump queen. Some prefer to reverse the meaning of the first two responses and the variants are referred to in abbreviation as RKCB 3014 and RKCB 1430 respectively. Various methods are used to continue with king-asking bids.|$|R
