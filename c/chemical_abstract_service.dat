30|$|Ideally, a {{chemical}} {{is properly identified}} {{through the use of}} a <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> number (CAS-number or Registry number) which is far more convenient than dealing with the full chemical IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) -name or CA-index name). The CAS number designates a unique chemical substance and is extremely useful for scientific and technical communication. For example, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) relies on CAS numbers for the definite identification of chemical substances (EPA-United States Environmental Protection Agency 1998). Also in the European Union (EU), the REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) candidate list relies on a proper identification of these problematic substances (REACH 2007). Here we meet the first obstacle because WoS do not register CAS numbers in a proper index. Registration only takes place when the numbers are present in the title or abstract of the publications. We assume that chemical substance identification is more carefully treated by CAS. Obviously, this is the case through the unique identification by CAS numbers. However, in performing a practical analysis a number of problems showed up which may distort the results obtained.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} to recover natural gas depends on undisclosed types and amounts of toxic chemicals. A list of 944 products containing 632 chemicals used during natural gas operations was compiled. Literature searches {{were conducted to}} determine potential health effects of the 353 chemicals identified by <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> (CAS) numbers. More than 75 % of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.

40|$|A 2001 {{study of}} Cleveland, Ohio {{brownfield}} surface soil contamination {{led to the}} examination of state regulatory guidance values for soils. Surface soils were of particular interest since these generally pose the greatest risk to human health at brownfield sites. This investigation initially focused on heavy metals, common contaminants at Cleveland brownfields. However, the observation of significant variability in guidance values applied to Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn led to questions about other state-regulated components and ultimately to research examining the origins, magnitudes, and explanations for regulatory guidance value variability.

40|$|AbstractEver {{since the}} {{interest}} in organic environmental contaminants first emerged 50 years ago, {{there has been a}} need to present discussion of such chemicals and their transformation products using simple abbreviations so as to avoid the repetitive use of long chemical names. As the number of chemicals of concern has increased, the number of abbreviations has also increased dramatically, sometimes resulting in the use of different abbreviations for the same chemical. In this article, we propose abbreviations for flame retardants (FRs) substituted with bromine or chlorine atoms or including a functional group containing phosphorus, i. e. BFRs, CFRs and PFRs, respectively. Due to the large number of halogenated and organophosphorus FRs, it has become increasingly important to develop a strategy for abbreviating the chemical names of FRs. In this paper, a two step procedure is proposed for deriving practical abbreviations (PRABs) for the chemicals discussed. In the first step, structural abbreviations (STABs) are developed using specific STAB criteria based on the FR structure. However, since several of the derived STABs are complicated and long, we propose instead the use of PRABs. These are, commonly, an extract of the most essential part of the STAB, while also considering abbreviations previously used in the literature. We indicate how these can be used to develop an abbreviation that can be generally accepted by scientists and other professionals involved in FR related work. Tables with PRABs and STABs for BFRs, CFRs and PFRs are presented, including CAS (<b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service)</b> numbers, notes of abbreviations that have been used previously, CA (Chemical Abstract) name, common names and trade names, as well as some fundamental physico-chemical constants...|$|E

30|$|Water {{quality in}} many European rivers {{improved}} significantly {{over the last}} 30 years, and river waters exhibiting acute lethality to fish or invertebrates are an exception today. However, toxic pressure by pesticides [1], biocides [2], endocrine disruptors [3, 4] and many other chemicals [5] still presents a large-scale risk and causes community shifts and the disappearance of sensitive species in many river basins. The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) [6] provides a new holistic approach for the assessment {{and management of the}} ecological status of water bodies. However, the WFD chemical monitoring and classification is still centered on the traditional approach of regulating individual chemicals, the priority substances (PS) and the river basin specific pollutants, via compliance with environmental quality standards. This approach, based on chemical analysis of single substances, cannot cover the enormous variety of potentially hazardous chemicals present in the environment, which occur in complex and time variable mixtures. Subsequently, the observation of adverse effects in biota is often not reflected by the occurrence and concentrations of PS but caused by other non-regulated contaminants of emerging concern. In a discussion paper by Christian Daughton, US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) stated that ‘an ever-expanding universe of unique chemicals, untold numbers of which have yet to be recognized or revealed, continually perfuse our environment and contact living systems’ [7]. In 2005, 26 million individual chemical substances were identified and registered in the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> ([URL] with one-third being commercially available [7]. By June 2013, this number had increased to 72 million. The continuous increase in the diversity of chemicals being used makes identifying those that occur in our environment an increasingly difficult task. The screening of environmental samples, such as extracts of water, sediments, or biota, with liquid or gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) typically reveals tens of thousands of peaks, the majority of which are unknown.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{processing}} respiratory specimens to improve culture and acid-fast staining of mycobacteria is introduced. This new method utilized N,N-dimethyl-N-(n-octadecyl) -N-(3 -carboxypropyl) ammonium inner salt (<b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> no. 78195 - 27 - 4), {{also known as}} C 18 -carboxypropylbetaine (CB- 18). In a blinded, five-center study, CB- 18 -based processing was compared to the standard method combining NALC and NaOH (NALC/NaOH). A total of 573 respiratory specimens were tested. Individual specimens were split approximately equally; the host institutions processed half of each specimen by the NALC/NaOH method, while the other half was processed with CB- 18 at Quest Diagnostics—Baltimore. A total of 106 specimens were culture positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Replacement of the primary decontamination agent with CB- 18 caused changes in all diagnostic parameters. Aggregate culture sensitivity improved by approximately 43 % (P < 0. 01), and smear sensitivity improved by approximately 58 % (P < 0. 01). The sensitivity of smear relative to that of M. tuberculosis isolates exceeded 93 % (P < 0. 01) when specimens were processed with CB- 18. The average times to a positive result were reduced by 7. 3 days in liquid culture (P < 0. 01) and 5. 3 days on solid media (P < 0. 05); however, the CB- 18 method had a 20. 8 % contamination rate in liquid culture versus a rate of approximately 7. 5 % with NALC/NaOH processing. There were also unusual reductions in liquid culture sensitivity and smear specificity among CB- 18 -processed specimens. The characteristics of the latter parameters suggested that refinement of the CB- 18 processing method should allow further improvements in culture sensitivity. This study showed that the CB- 18 method {{has the potential to}} improve both smear and culture detection for these important human pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While {{environmental}} research addresses scientific questions of possible societal relevance, {{it is unclear}} to what degree research focuses on environmental chemicals in need of documentation for risk assessment purposes. Methods In a bibliometric analysis, we used SciFinder to extract <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> (CAS) numbers for chemicals addressed by publications in the 78 major environmental science journals during 2000 - 2009. The Web of Science was used to conduct title searches to determine long-term trends for prominent substances and substances considered in need of research attention. Results The 119, 636 journal articles found had 760, 056 CAS number links during 2000 - 2009. The top- 20 environmental chemicals consisted of metals, (chlorinated) biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, and ethanol and contributed 12 % toward {{the total number of}} links- Each of the top- 20 substances was covered by 2, 000 - 10, 000 articles during the decade. The numbers for the 10 -year period were similar to the total numbers of pre- 2000 articles on the same chemicals. However, substances considered a high priority from a regulatory viewpoint, due to lack of documentation, showed very low publication rates. The persistence in the scientific literature of the top- 20 chemicals was only weakly related to their publication in journals with a high impact factor, but some substances achieved high citation rates. Conclusions The persistence of some environmental chemicals in the scientific literature may be due to a 'Matthew' principle of maintaining prominence for the very reason of having been well researched. Such bias detracts from the societal needs for documentation on less well known environmental hazards, and it may also impact negatively on the potentials for innovation and discovery in research. </p...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{metabolomics}} {{is increasingly}} used for pathway discovery and to elucidate gene function. However, the main bottleneck is {{the identification of}} the detected compounds. This is more pronounced for secondary metabolites as many of their pathways are still underexplored. Here, an algorithm is presented in which liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry profiles are searched for pairs of peaks that have mass and retention time differences corresponding with those of substrates and products from well-known enzymatic reactions. Concatenating the latter peak pairs, called candidate substrate-product pairs (CSPP), into a network displays tentative (bio) synthetic routes. Starting from known peaks, propagating the network along these routes allows the characterization of adjacent peaks leading to their structure prediction. As a proof-of-principle, this high-throughput cheminformatics procedure was applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf metabolome where it allowed the characterization of the structures of 60 % of the profiled compounds. Moreover, based on searches in the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> database, the algorithm led to the characterization of 61 compounds that had never been described in plants before. The CSPP-based annotation was confirmed by independent MSn experiments. In addition to being high throughput, this method allows the annotation of low-abundance compounds that are otherwise not amenable to isolation and purification. This method will greatly advance the value of metabolomics in systems biology.

The {{two types of}} resins and curing agents share the same <b>chemical</b> <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> (CAS). The weight ratio of resin to curing agent was 100 : 26.4. The dispersion of the VGCNF in the epoxy resin was performed by four different methods: Method 1 : hand mixing with a Haeger blender for 2 min [12], where the velocity field and stress levels should generate a predominantly distributive mixing of the clusters; Method 2 : one pass extrusion through a Capillary Rheometer fitted {{with a series of}} rings with alternating directions [14], where the strong extensional fields are anticipated to result in a good filler dispersion but limited cluster distribution Method 3 : roll milling (using a Lehmann 3 roll miller) for 5 min, with a gap of 25.4 μm {{between the first and second}} rolls and 600 r.p.m. for the third roll, which is expected to result in a good filler dispersion and a relatively good cluster distribution; Method 4 : a planetary-type Thinky ARE- 250 mixer, at revolution and rotation speeds of 2000 and 800 rpm, respectively, for 10 min, which should ensure a good cluster distribution. In all cases, the resin and curing agent were pre-mixed by hand [11]. After mixing, all samples were subjected to a 20 -mbar pressure, then cast into a mold and cured at 80 and 150 °C for 90 min each. Composites with VGCNF concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt% were prepared, corresponding to volume fractions of 0.0006, 0.003, 0.006, and 0.009, respectively. The samples were rectangular bars with 1 × 10 × 70 mm. VGCNF dispersion in the matrix was investigated by observing surface and cross section images by SEM Phillips X 230 FEG. The volume d.c. electrical resistivity of the samples was obtained using the two-probe method, by measuring the characteristic I-V curves at room temperature with a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage source. The samples were coated on both sides by thermal evaporation with circular Al electrodes of 5 -mm diameter. The current and voltage were measured and the resistivity was calculated taking into account geometric factors. The capacity and tan δ, dielectric loss, were measured at room temperature in the range of 500 Hz to 1 MHz with an applied signal of 0.5 V with an automatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter. The real component of the dielectric function ε ε was obtained from the measurement of the capacity and geometrical factors.|$|E
40|$|In this Current Intelligence Bulletin, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{reviews the}} animal and human data {{relevant}} to assessing the carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) (Chapters 2 and 3), presents a quantitative risk assessment using dose-response data in rats for both cancer (lung tumors) and noncancer (pulmonary inflammation) responses and extrapolation to humans with lung dosimetry modeling (Chapter 4), provides recommended exposure limits (RELs) for fine and ultrafine (including engineered nanoscale) TiO 2 (Chapter 5), describes exposure monitoring techniques and exposure control strategies (Chapter 6), and discusses avenues of future research (Chapter 7). This report only addresses occupational exposures by inhalation, and conclusions derived here should not be inferred to pertain to nonoccupational exposures. TiO 2 (<b>Chemical</b> <b>Abstract</b> <b>Service</b> [CAS] Number 13463 - 67 - 7) is a noncombustible, white, crystalline, solid, odorless powder. TiO 2 is used extensively in many commercial products, including paints and varnishes, cosmetics, plastics, paper, and food as an anticaking or whitening agent. Production in the United States was an estimated 1. 45 million metric tons per year in 2007 [DOI 2008]. The number of U. S. workers currently exposed to TiO 2 dust is not available. TiO 2 is produced and used in the workplace in varying particle size fractions including fine (which is defined in this document as all particle sizes collected by respirable particle sampling) and ultrafine (defined as the fraction of respirable particles with a primary particle diameter of 100 nm), the data on which to assess carcinogenicity are limited. Generally, the epidemiologic studies for fine TiO 2 are inconclusive because of inadequate statistical power {{to determine whether they}} replicate or refute the animal dose-response data. This is consistent for carcinogens of low potency. The only chronic animal inhalation study [Lee et al. 1985], which demonstrated the development of lung tumors (bronchioalveolar adenomas) in response to inhalation exposure of rats to fine sized TiO 2 did so at a dose of 250 mg/m 3 but not at 10 or 50 mg/m 3. The absence of lung tumor development for fine TiO 2 was also reported by Muhle et al. [1991] in rats exposed at 5 mg/m 3. However, the responses observed in animal studies exposed to ultrafine and fine TiO 2 are consistent with a continuum of biological response to TiO 2 that is based on particle surface area. In other words, all the rat tumor response data on inhalation of TiO 2 (ultrafine and fine) fit on the same dose-response curve when dose is expressed as total particle surface area in the lungs. However, exposure concentrations greater than 100 mg/m 3 are generally not considered acceptable inhalation toxicology practice today. Consequently, in a weight-of-evidence analysis, NIOSH questions the relevance of the 250 mg/m 3 dose for classifying exposure to TiO 2 as a carcinogenic hazard to workers and therefore, concludes that there are insufficient data at this time to classify fine TiO 2 as a potential occupational carcinogen. Although data are insufficient on the cancer hazard for fine TiO 2, the tumor-response data are consistent with that observed for ultrafine TiO 2 when converted to a particle surface area metric. Thus to be cautious, NIOSH used all of the animal tumor response data when conducting dose-response modeling and determining separate RELs for ultrafine and fine TiO 2. NIOSH also considered the crystal structure as a modifying factor in TiO 2 carcinogenicity and inflammation. The evidence for crystal-dependent toxicity is from observed differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated on the surface of TiO 2 of different crystal structures (e. g., anatase, rutile, or mixtures) in cell-free systems, with differences in cytotoxicity in in vitro studies [Kawahara et al. 2003; Kakinoki et al. 2004; Behnajady et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2008, Sayes et al. 2006] and with greater inflammation and cell proliferation at early time points following intratracheal instillation in rats [Warheit et al. 2007]. However, when rats were exposed to TiO 2 in subchronic inhalation studies, no difference in pulmonary inflammation response to fine and ultrafine TiO 2 particles of different crystal structure (i. e., 99 % rutile vs. 80 % anatase/ 20 % rutile) was observed once dose was adjusted for particle surface area [Bermudez et al. 2002, 2004]; nor was there a difference in the lung tumor response in the chronic inhalation studies in rats at a given surface area dose of these fine and ultrafine particles (i. e., 99 % rutile vs. 80 % anatase/ 20 % rutile) [Lee et al. 1985; Heinrich et al. 1995]. Therefore, NIOSH concludes that the scientific evidence supports surface area as the critical metric for occupational inhalation exposure to TiO 2. NIOSH also evaluated the potential for coatings to modify the toxicity of TiO 2, as many industrial processes apply coatings to TiO 2 particles. TiO 2 toxicity has been shown to increase after coating with various substances [Warheit et al. 2005]. However, the toxicity of TiO 2 has not been shown to be attenuated by application of coatings. NIOSH concluded that the TiO 2 risk assessment {{could be used as a}} reasonable floor for potential toxicity, with the notion that toxicity may be substantially increased by particle treatment and process modification. These findings are based on the studies in the scientific literature and may not apply to other formulations, surface coatings, or treatments of TiO 2 for which data were not available. An extensive review of the risks of coated TiO 2 particles is beyond the scope of this document. NIOSH recommends airborne exposure limits of 2. 4 mg/m 3 for fine TiO 2 and 0. 3 mg/m 3 for ultrafine (including engineered nanoscale) TiO 2, as time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations for up to 10 hr/day during a 40 -hour work week. These recommendations represent levels that over a working lifetime are estimated to reduce risks of lung cancer to below 1 in 1, 000. The recommendations are based on using chronic inhalation studies in rats to predict lung tumor risks in humans. In the hazard classification (Chapter 5), NIOSH concludes that the adverse effects of inhaling TiO 2 may not be material-specific but appear to be due to a generic effect of PSLT particles in the lungs at sufficiently high exposure. While NIOSH concludes that there is insufficient evidence to classify fine TiO 2 as a potential occupational carcinogen, NIOSH is concerned about the potential carcinogenicity of ultrafine and engineered nanoscale TiO 2 if workers are exposed at the current mass-based exposure limits for respirable or total mass fractions of TiO 2. NIOSH recommends controlling exposures as low as possible, below the RELs. Sampling recommendations based on current methodology are provided (Chapter 6). Although sufficient data are available to assess the risks of occupational exposure to TiO 2, additional research questions have arisen. There is a need for exposure assessment for workplace exposure to ultrafine TiO 2 in facilities producing or using TiO 2. Other research needs include evaluation of the (1) exposure-response relationship of TiO 2 and other PSLT particles and human health effects, (2) fate of ultrafine particles in the lungs and the associated pulmonary responses, and (3) effectiveness of engineering controls for controlling exposures to fine and ultrafine TiO 2.
