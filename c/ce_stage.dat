40|$|Starting {{from recent}} {{determination}} of Fe, O, Na abundance on a restricted sample (N= 67) of halo and thick disk stars, {{a natural and}} well motivated selection criterion is defined for the classification of globular cluster stars. An application is performed to M 13 using a sample (N= 112) for which Fe, O, Na abundance has been recently inferred from observations. A comparison is made between current and earlier M 13 star classification. Both O and Na empirical differential abundance distributions are determined for each class and the whole sample (with the addition of Fe in the last case) and compared with their theoretical counterparts due to cosmic scatter obeying a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are inferred from related subsamples. The procedure is repeated with regard to four additional classes according if oxygen and sodium abundance is above (stage CE) or below (stage AF) a selected threshold. Both O and Na empirical differential abundance distributions, related to the whole sample, exhibit a linear fit for AF and <b>CE</b> <b>stage.</b> Within the errors, the oxygen slope for <b>CE</b> <b>stage</b> is equal and opposite in sign with respect of the sodium slope for AF stage, while the contrary holds {{in dealing with the}} oxygen slope for AF stage with respect to the sodium slope for <b>CE</b> <b>stage.</b> In the light of simple models of chemical evolution applied to M 13, the O-Na anticorrelation and the primordial to current M 13 mass ratio are discussed.

40|$|Understanding post-common-envelope {{evolution}} {{is important in}} the studies of close-binary systems. The majority of all interacting binaries with a compact object in their system (e. g. cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries) are thought to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase. Current models of interacting binaries all assume, as a starting point, that there is no significant modification of the secondary star compared with a normal star of similar spectral type. The extent to which the CE significantly alters the composition of the secondary star has yet to be determined. We are studying the M-type secondary in the pre-CV system EG UMa, in order to determine its atmospheric parameters by comparison with synthetic spectra generated using phoenix. Absorption lines due to several elements have been used in investigating the stellar parameters of effective temperature, gravity and over elemental abundance. In addition, we are searching for anomalies due to s-process elements (such as Ba, Sr, Rb, Y), which may have been deposited in the atmosphere during the <b>CE</b> <b>stage,</b> and prove that CE evolution has occurred. EG UMa displays strong YO absorption bands, which are normally associated with giants and S stars.

40|$|Background: Imaging {{plays the}} {{key role in}} {{diagnosing}} and <b>staging</b> of <b>CE.</b> The description of CE-specific imaging features and the WHO CE cyst classification is based on ultrasound. The reproducibility of the ultrasound-defined features of CE cysts is variable in MR- and CT-imaging. This is of particular importance for cysts that are not accessible by US {{and because of the}} increasing availability and overuse of CT and MR imaging. Methodology/Principal Findings: Retrospective analysis of patients with abdominal CE cysts of an interdisciplinary CE clinic who had CT and/or MRI scans performed additionally to US imaging. All images were read and interpreted by the same senior radiologist experienced in the diagnosis of CE. US, CT and MR images were staged according to the WHO classification criteria. The agreement beyond chance was quantified by kappa coefficients (k). 107 patients with 187 CE cysts met the inclusion criteria. All cysts were assessed by US, 138 by CT, and 125 by MRI. The level of agreement beyond chance of the individual <b>CE</b> <b>stages</b> 1 – 4 was clearly lower for CT, with k ranging from 0. 62 to 0. 72, compared to MRI with values of k between 0. 83 and 1. 0.

We find that CE evolution, besides from producing WD-WD and NS-NS binaries, may, in principle, also produce massive BH-BH systems with individual BH component masses up to ~ 50 - 60 Msun, in particular for donor stars evolved to giants. However, the physics of envelope ejection of massive stars remains uncertain.

40|$|Context The {{recently}} detected {{gravitational wave}} signals (GW 150914 and GW 151226) {{of the merger}} event {{of a pair of}} relatively massive stellar-mass black holes (BHs) calls for an investigation of the formation of such progenitor systems in general. Aims We analyse the common-envelope (<b>CE)</b> <b>stage</b> of the traditional formation channel in binaries where the first-formed compact object undergoes an in-spiral inside the envelope of its evolved companion star and ejects the envelope in this process. Methods We calculated envelope binding energies of donor stars with initial masses between 4 and 115 M⊙ for metallicities of Z = ZMilky Way ≃ Z⊙=/ 2 and Z = Z⊙/ 50, and derived minimum masses of in-spiralling objects needed to eject these envelopes. Results In addition to producing double white dwarf and double neutron star binaries, CE evolution may also produce massive BH-BH systems with individual BH component masses of up to ~ 50 60 M⊙, in particular for donor stars evolved to giants beyond the Hertzsprung gap. However, the physics of envelope ejection of massive stars remains uncertain. We discuss the applicability of the energy-budget formalism, the location of the bifurcation point, the recombination energy, and the accretion energy during in-spiral as possible energy sources, and also comment on the effect of inflated helium cores. Conclusions Massive stars {{in a wide range of}} metallicities and with initial masses of up to at least 115 M⊙ may shed their envelopes and survive CE evolution, depending on their initial orbital parameters, similarly to the situation for intermediate- and low-mass stars with degenerate cores. In addition to being dependent on stellar radius, the envelope binding energies and λ-values also depend on the applied convective core-overshooting parameter, whereas these structure parameters are basically independent of metallicity for stars with initial masses below 60 M⊙. Metal-rich stars≳ 60 M⊙ become luminous blue variables and do not evolve to reach the red giant stage. We conclude that based on stellar structure calculations, and in the view of the usual simple energy budget analysis, events like GW 150914 and GW 151226 might be produced by the CE channel. Calculations of post-CE orbital separations, however, and thus the estimated LIGO detection rates, remain highly uncertain. </p...|$|E

The mineralogy of their hydrothermally altered counterparts includes phillipsite, calcite and analcime which are secondary phases developed in response to hydrothermal fluid events.

40|$|Video codec is {{a process}} which permits to encode or decode a video data stream. We have to be {{attentive}} to the efficiency of the codec that we choose in function of our goals. For instance, if we want to provide the best quality with the best speed, we will need a powerful system with different processors and which has a large memory. In the contrary, if we want to execute our video codec software in an embedded system, we will search to optimize the code and try to find out which are the bottlenecks of our encoder. In our case, we want to implement Kvazaar encoder on a DSP. Kvazaar encoder is a free software developped by a squad of finnish researchers and whose the architecture is really similar to HEVC. The main difference between these two entities is that Kvazaar was programmed in C language which makes it less complex and easier to implement on an embedded system. The main goal of this master thesis was to complete with success, the implantation of Kvazaar on the chosen platform and then to evaluate the performances. Concerning the implementation of Kvazaar on the DSP TI C 66 x, the main executed action was to suppress the use of threads during the compilation. Indeed, even if that DSP is multicore, threading is not allowed in that platform but parallelism can be done thanks to the use of DSP/BIOS which provides interruption use. Then, we had to study the program in order to find the main blocks which compose the video encoding for evaluating the encoding time mandatory to the execution of each block and then find which blocks can be optimized concerning the CPU cycles consumption. Indeed, the main blocks that we wanted to study concern the execution of transform, inverse transform, cabac, inter and intra prediction, quantization and inverse quantization and scaling. We noticed that, after doing many tests in order {{to increase the number of}} frames per second and the speed, the main block which needs the most CPU encoding time is the inter-prediction. The next work can be to find a way to decrease the time needed by that block to be executed because it is the main obstacle in order to obtain a better efficiency and speed of the video encoder Kvazaar. RÉSUMÉ. Le codec video est un precede qui permet de compresser ou decompresser des flux videos. On doit toujours tenir compte des performances permises par le codec en function de l'usage que l'on souhaite en faire. Par example, si on veut obtenir la meilleure qualite possible tout en assurant une certaine rapidite, on va utiliser un systeme multi-processeurs puissant avec une capacite memoire elevee. Si au contraire, on souhaite que notre codec s'execute sur un systeme embarque, on va chercher a optimiser le programme et trouver quelles sont les parties du code qui demandent le plus de temps a s'executer. Dans notre cas, on voudrait implementer l'encodeur video Kvazaar sur un DSP. L'encodeur Kvazaar est un logiciel gratuit developpe par une equipe de chercheurs finlandais et dont l'architecture est similaire au codec HEVC. La difference entre les deux logiciels reside notamment dans le fait que Kvaavar est code en langage C ce qui le rend moins complexe et plus facile implementer sur un systeme embarque. Le but premier de <b>ce</b> <b>stage</b> etait d'arriver a faire fonctionner Kvazaar sur la plateforme choisie et d'evaluer ses performances. En ce qui concerne l'implantation de Kvazaar sur le DSP TI C 6 Gx, la principale action effectuee etait de supprimer l'utilisation des threads dans l'execution du code. En effet, meme si notre DSP est multi coeur, le threading n'est pas autorise sur cette plateforme mais le parallelisme peut se realiser grace a DSP/BIOS qui permet l'usagc d'interruptions. Ensuite, il fallait etudier le code afin de trouver les principaux blocs qui constituent un encodage video pour evaluer le temps d'execution de chacun de ces blocs et trouver quels blocs seraient utiles a optimiser d'un point de vue du nombre de cycles du CPU necessaires. En effet, les principaux blocs que nous souhaitions etudier concernaient l'execution de la transformed et son inverse, Cabac, inter et intra prediction, la quantification et son inverse et le scaling. Il s'avere que parmi tous les tests effectues afin d'augmenter le nombre de frames encodees par seconde et la vitesse, le principal bloc qui monopolise le processeur est l'inter-prediction. Le prochain travail serait done de trouver un moyen pour diminuer le temps necessaire a ce bloc pour s'executer car c'est le principal rempart pour obtenir une plus grande efficacite et rapidite de l'encodeur video Kvazaar...|$|E

The later stage is dated from the 1st to 2nd century <b>CE.</b> The third <b>stage</b> is dated from the 2nd century CE to the 3rd or 4th century CE. According to Gift Siromony, the types of Tamil Brahmi writings do not follow a very clear chronology and can lead to confusion in dating. According to K. Rajan, the Ashokan Brahmi corresponds with the Stage II of Tamil Brahmi per Mahadevan’s classification. Hence according to him, Stage I may have to be reassessed from the proposed time line. From the 5th century CE onwards Tamil is written in Vatteluttu in the Chera and Pandya country and Grantha or Tamil script in the Chola and Pallava country. Tamil Brahmi inscriptions in cave beds and coins have provided historians with identifying some kings and chiefs mentioned in the Sangam Tamil corpus as well as related Ashokan pillar inscriptions.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Rare {{quiescent}} retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) {{have been}} {{isolated in the}} adult mammalian (including human) CE. We have reported a CE proliferation with retinal neuronal and photoreceptor cell (rhodopsin+) differentiation in three human eyes eviscerated for longstanding RD and PVR. The CE strongly expressed EGFR. We have hypothezised that the disease RD and PVR might stimulate a dormant population of RPCs in the CE in presence of a niche constituted by EGF. The aim of the present work was to study the CE in the porcine eye with experimental DR and PVR. Methods Two porcine eyes with experimental surgical RD and PVR enucleated at Day 15 and Day 35 were studied with light microscopy and immunocytochemistry with antibodies against EGFR, Ki 67, CD 133, NSE, rhodopsin, GFAP. The fellow porcine eyes, one non operated porcine eye, and one human eye exenterated for orbital tumor served as controls Results Wwe observed in the CE of both porcine eyes a discrete hyperplasia of the non pigmented CE with an overexpression of EGFR and an expression of NSE. All CE controls were negative for NSE. Ki 67, CD 133, GFAP and rhodopsin were negative in the CE of the eyes with RD and of the control eyes Conclusion The CE of the porcine eye in vivo with shorter duration experimental RD and PVR showed hyperplasia with neuronal differentiation, in presence of an overexpression of EGFR, as in the human eye with longer duration RD. Photoreceptor differentiation was not observed in the porcine <b>CE</b> at this <b>stage...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: IL- 19 is {{expressed}} in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but its biological effect on esophageal cancer remains unclear. We determined the correlation between IL- 19 expression levels and clinicopathological variables and explored the effects of IL- 19 on the esophageal SCC in vivo and in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined the expression levels of esophageal SCC tissues from 60 patients using immunohistochemistry. We {{examined the effects of}} IL- 19 on intracellular signaling, cytokines production as well as proliferation, colonization, and migration in the human esophageal SCC cell line CE 81 T. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IL- 19 (1 BB 1) and its receptor IL- 20 R 1 (51 D) were used to antagonize the effects of IL- 19. We injected SCID mice with CE 81 T cells and then treated them with anti-IL- 19 mAb or control IgG every 3 days and determined tumor growth for 32 days. Of the 60 esophageal SCC patients, 36 patients (60 %) were IL- 19 strongly stained, which was associated with advanced tumor <b>stage.</b> <b>CE</b> 81 T cells expressed IL- 19 and its receptors. IL- 19 induced phosphorylation of STAT 3, P 38, JNK, ERK 1 / 2, Akt, and NF-kB in CE 81 T cells. IL- 19 promoted the proliferation, colonization, and migration of CE 81 T cells, which were antagonized by 1 BB 1 and 51 D. IL- 19 also induced expression of the transcripts of TGF-b, cyclin B 1, CXCR 4, and MMP- 1 in CE 81 T cells. In CE 81 T tumor-bearing mice, 1 BB 1 reduced tumor growth and downregulated TGF-b, cyclin B 1, MMP- 1, and CXCR 4 expression in tumors...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the most informative pair of sequences in magnetic resonance (MR) for T-staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: The MR images of 134 patients with newly diagnosed NPC, from 1 996 to 2002, were retrospectively reviewed. All {{the patients were}} scanned using 1. 5 Tesla MR systems. The images of the nasopharynx were reviewed by two qualified radiologists to determine the positive findings and the T-stage by UICC (6 th edition) System, using each sequence separately. The T-stage derived from a single MR sequence was then compared with the T-stage based on the five selected sequences to assess the number and percentage of patients who were being understaged. Therefore, the overall percentage accuracy of each single sequence could be determined. A pair of sequences providing information to achieve almost 100 % diagnostic accuracy was then derived. Results: The overall percentage accuracy of five individual sequences of the nasopharynx is as follows: Contrast-enhanced (CE) fat suppression (FS) axial T 1 (94. 8 %), CE FS coronal T 1 (88. 1 %), FS axial T 2 (85. 8 %), non-contrast enhanced (NE) axial T 1 (78. 4 %) and non-contrast enhanced (NE) coronal T 1 (77. 6 %). CE FS axial T 1 has the best accuracy. All the structures that are missed in CE FS axial T 1, which lead to apparent understaging, are appreciated in NE axial T 1 -weighted images. Conclusion: Individual sequences supplement {{each other in the}} NPC <b>staging.</b> <b>CE</b> FS axial T 1 is the most informative individual sequence. Combination of CE FS axial T 1 and NE axial T 1 of the nasopharynx provides sufficient information to achieve almost 100 % diagnostic accuracy in T-staging; therefore, both {{should be included in the}} MR-staging protocol. © 2004 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

40|$|Overdiagnosis and {{overtreatment}} {{are rarely}} {{discussed in the}} context of NTDs despite their relevance for patients under the care of health services with limited resources where the risks of therapy induced complications are often disproportionate to the benefit. The advantages of cyst staging-based management of patients with cystic echinococcosis (CE) are not yet fully explored. Questions are: Do inactive cysts (CE 4 and CE 5) need treatment and is there a difference between cysts which reach CE 4 and CE 5 naturally or by benzimidazole therapy?Analysis of long-term follow-up data from a prospective CE patient cohort of 223 patients of a national clinical center for echinococcosis. The event of interest "relapse" was defined as the reversal of a cyst from an inactive <b>stage</b> (<b>CE</b> 4, CE 5) back to an active stage. The watch &wait (ww) group included 30 patients with 46 inactive cysts who never received medical treatment. The benzimidazole-treated (med) group included 15 patients with 17 cysts. There was no relapse in the ww-group whereas 8 / 17 cysts showed relapse within 18 months after treatment in the med-group. Loss to follow-up was 15. 5 %. Data from the watch & wait group impressively show how stable naturally inactivated cysts are in contrast to cysts which reach inactivity through treatment with benzimidazoles. A substantial proportion of patients can be spared from treatment through cyst staging. Cysts which inactivated through a natural course do not relapse with very high likelihood. We recommend follow up of 5 years to confirm the stability of the inactive stage. Cysts driven into inactivity through benzimidazole therapy instead need careful monitoring to identify those which reactivate (around 50 % within 18 months). 5 years follow-up appears safe to make a final decision on the need for further monitoring...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The optimal {{acquisition}} time for staging colo-rectal carcinoma with a contrast enhanced multidetector CT colonography (CE CTC) {{has not yet}} been established. A dual phase with both arterial and portal venous acquisition has been proposed. The purpose of our study is to assess the value of single portal venous phase CE CTC in the preoperative staging of colo-rectal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty two (30 M, 22 F; aged 35 - 82 years) consecutive patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of colo-rectal adenocarcinoma or a highly suspected colo-rectal cancer on conventional colonoscopy underwent a four-slice CE CTC. The procedure was performed 70 s (portal phase) after the intravenous bolus (3 ml/s) administration of 120 ml iodinated non-ionic contrast agent (370 mg iodine/ml). Scans were performed using the following parameters: 2. 5 mm beam collimation, pitch 1. 25, 120 kV, 200 mAs, rotation time 0. 75 s. Images were reconstructed with an effective thickness of 3. 2 mm at intervals of 1. 6 mm. Two radiologists independently evaluated the depth of tumour invasion into the colo-rectal wall (T), regional lymph node involvement (N), and extracolonic metastases (M). Disagreement was resolved by means of a consensus decision. The pathological results served as the standard of reference. Assessment was made of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, as well as positive and negative predictive values were assessed. RESULTS: <b>CE</b> CTC correctly <b>staged</b> the pT of 52 / 56 (93 %) and the N of 40 / 56 (71 %) lesions, as well as properly identifying 13 / 14 (93 %) extracolonic findings.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the correlation of the specific antibody responses and the disease phase is essential in evaluating diagnostic values of immunological tests in human echinococcosis. In this study, 422 echinococcosis patients diagnosed by ultrasonography, including 246 with cystic echinococcosis (CE), 173 with alveolar echinococcosis (AE), and 3 with dual infection, were tested for specific IgG in sera against recombinant AgB (rAgB) and recombinant Em 18 (rEm 18) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As a result, rAgB-specific antibody was detected in 77. 6 % of CE and 86. 1 % of AE patients, while rEm 18 -specific antibody was present in 28. 9 % of CE and 87. 3 % of AE patients. Additionally, all three patients with dual infection exhibited specific antibodies responding to rAgB and rEm 18. Further analysis revealed that rAgB-specific antibody was elevated in a significantly greater proportion (87. 3 %) of CE patients with cysts at active or transitional <b>stages</b> (<b>CE</b> 1, CE 2, or CE 3), compared to 54. 8 % of other patients with cysts at an early or an inactive <b>stage</b> (CL or <b>CE</b> 4 or CE 5). Furthermore, rAgB-specific antibody was detected in 95. 6 % of CE 2 cases, which was statistically greater than that (73. 7 %) in CE 1 patients. Although rEm 18 -specific antibody was elevated in 28. 9 % of CE patients, the positive reaction was much weaker in CE than in AE cases. Serum levels and concentrations of rEm 18 -specific antibody were further indicated to be strongly disease phase correlated in AE patients, with positive rates of 97. 4 % in cases with alveolar lesions containing central necrosis and 66. 7 % in patients with early alveolar lesions that measured ≤ 5 cm...|$|R

40|$|During the {{outbreak}} of influenza due to A (H 3 N 3) viruses in Finland in 1985 / 6 virus pairs were isolated from the same clinical specimens in embryonated hens' eggs (CE) and in canine kidney cell cultures (MDCK). Some of these isolates, the E and M pairs, were distinguished by their reactions in haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests carried out using polyclonal antisera, and by receptor-binding properties, as evidenced by differences in their elution activity from erythrocytes. Passage of the E- and M-virus isolates in the foreign host affected their serological characteristics, but the E virus did not convert to an M-like virus and the M virus did not convert to an E-like virus. Returning the viruses {{to grow in the}} host used for their isolation changed the serological reactions so that they were once more close to the reactions of the original isolates. This contrasts with the changes in receptor-binding properties. Rapid elution from hen erythrocytes, which {{has been described as a}} property of viruses binding to the SA alpha 2, 3 Gal sequence in preference to SA alpha 2, 6 Gal, characterized the virus passages grown solely in MDCK cell cultures. Cultivation of the M virus in <b>CE,</b> at any <b>stage</b> of its passage history, made the virus irreversibly incapable of elution. The M virus was more sensitive than the E virus to HI antibodies against heterologous viruses of the H 3 N 2 subtype, and, when used as an antigen in HI serology, it more frequently (90 % vs. 69 %; P less than 0. 01) detected diagnostic antibody responses in patients infected with viruses of this subtype in 1985 / 6. Use of antigens with a different passage history in HI serology provided evidence that this superiority, which may be due to the ability of the virus to pick out anamnestic antibody responses, is unrelated to the receptor-binding peculiarity of the M virus under consideration. The results support the concept that the host cell can select a diversity of virus variant subpopulations from a single clinical specimen during isolation and subsequent cultivation procedures. Moreover, the MDCK-grown influenza viruses may correspond better than the egg-grown isolates to the natural epidemic viruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{determine}} the prevalence of human echinococcosis in Tibetan communities of Sichuan Province, undertake genotyping of human echinococcosis isolates from the Tibetan Plateau, and assess the clinical efficacy of albendazole in human cystic and alveolar echinococcosis. In addition, specific IgG serologic responses against recombinant antigens (AgB and Em 18) were also examined in Tibetan cystic and alveolar echinococcosis patients. Abdominal ultrasound screening programmes for echinococcosis were conducted in 31 Tibetan townships in Ganze and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures of northwest Sichuan Province during 2001 - 2008. Hospital records (1992 - 2006) in a major regional treatment centre for echinococcosis in Aba Prefecture were also reviewed. Of 10. 186 local residents examined by portable ultrasound scan, 645 (6. 3 %) were diagnosed with echinococcosis: a prevalence of 3. 2 % for cystic echinococcosis (CE), 3. 1 % for alveolar echinococcosis (AE) and 0. 04 % for dual infection (both CE and AE). Further analysis revealed that human cystic and alveolar echinococcosis in pastoral areas was highly co-endemic, in comparison to much lower human prevalences found in semi-pastoral or farming regions. The high ultrasound prevalence of hepatic echinococcosis in these co-endemic areas in northwest Sichuan Province was also reflected in the hospital study, and hospital records furthermore indicated another possibly highly co-endemic transmission focus in Guoluo Prefecture of Qinghai Province, located at the border of northwest Sichuan. Parasite isolates from 68 human cases originating from Sichuan and Qinghai provinces in eastern China were postoperatively examined by histopathology and PCR-RFLP for specific identification of Echinococcus spp. Histopathologically, 38 human isolates were confirmed as E. granulosus and 30 as E. multilocularis. PCR-RFLP with rrnL as the target gene confirmed 33 of 53 of the isolates to have the Gl genotype of sheep/dog strain of E. granulosus as {{the only source of}} infection, while the remaining 20 were confirmed as E. multilocularis. No human infections were shown to be caused by E. shiquicus which is also endemic in wildlife hosts in the region. Specific IgG responses to recombinant antigen B and Eml 8 in ELISA were examined in 422 ultrasound-detected echinococcosis patients, including 246 with CE, 173 with AE, and 3 · with dual infection. As a result, rAgB-specific antibody was detected in 77. 6 % of CE and 86. 1 % of AE cases, while rEmlS-specific antibody was present in 28. 9 % of CE and 87. 3 % of AE patients. All three patients with dual infection exhibited specific antibodies responding to rAgB and rEml 8. Further analysis revealed that rAgB-specific antibody was elevated in a significantly greater proportion (87. 3 %) of CE patients with cysts at active or transitional <b>stages</b> (<b>CE</b> 1, CE 2 or CE 3), compared to 54. 8 % of other patients with cysts at an early or an inactive <b>stage</b> (CL or <b>CE</b> 4 or CE 5). Additionally, rAgB-specific antibody was detected in 95. 6 % of CE 2 cases, which was statistically greater than that (73. 7 %) in CE 1 patients. Although rEmlS-specific antibody was elevated in 28. 9 % of CE patients, the positive reaction was much weaker in CE than in AE cases. Serum levels and concentrations of rEmlS-specific antibody were further indicated to be strongly disease phase correlated in AE patients, with positive rates of 97. 4 % in cases with alveolar lesions containing central necrosis and 66. 7 % in patients with early alveolar lesions that measured < 5 cm. Efficacies of cyclic albendazole treatment were longitudinally assessed in 49 CE patients using ultrasonography and ELISA with rAgB as antigen. Of these 49 cases, 32. 7 % (16) were considered to be cured by ultrasound, 49. 0 % (24) were improved, 14. 3 % remained unchanged, whereas 4. 1 % were aggravated. Based on rAgB in ELISA, IgG 4 was indicated to be the most predominant IgG subclass in serum of CE patients. However, the changes of specific antibodies (IgG and IgG 4) were poorly correlated with the outcomes of treatment. Even so, positive antibody seroconversion (IgG and IgG 4 antibodies) in patients who were originally seronegative, and simultaneous observation of detachment of cyst membrane and/or partial degeneration of cyst content occurred in 46. 2 % (6 / 13) of CE 1 patients after 6 - 12 months chemotherapy. In 28 AE patients following cyclic albendazole therapy (mean course = 23. 4 months), ultrasound examination indicated that 25 (89. 3 %) had static alveolar lesions, whereas 3 (10. 7 %) had aggravated disease. In response to rEml 8, IgG 4 was the predominant IgG subclass in AE cases, and it was broadly correlated with the outcomes of treatment. In conclusion, human cystic and alveolar echinococcosis proved to be highly co-endemic in pastoral areas of Tibetan communities of Sichuan Province, with the Gl genotype of E. gmnulosus as the only identified source of human CE infection. Recombinant AgB proved to be highly useful for serodiagnosis of human echinococcosis, whereas rEmlS was more species-specific in differential diagnosis of human AE. Cyclic albendazole therapy was effective for treatment of human CE and AE. The changes of specific antibody against rAgB were poorly correlated with the outcomes of treatment in CE patients, whereas serum concentrations of rEmlS-specific antibody were strongly correlated with parasite activities in AE cases.
