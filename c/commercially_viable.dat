5|$|As of December 2013, in {{anticipation}} of the rescheduling of alprazolam to Schedule 8 in Australia—Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it is no longer <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The airline {{announced}} {{intentions to}} commence flights to Guangzhou and Kunming in China in summer 2014. Former Biman board director Kazi Oahedul Alam criticised the expansion as poorly planned and not <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hybrid {{positioning}} systems {{are increasingly being}} explored for certain civilian and commercial location-based services and location-based media, which need to work well in urban areas {{in order to be}} <b>commercially</b> and practically <b>viable.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{recently}} has <b>commercially</b> valuable and <b>viable</b> seed for St. Augustine become available, {{so it has}} typically been propagated by plugs, sprigs, or sod. Once the grass is cultivated, it can propagate on its own.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{attractive}} to hummingbirds {{as well as}} bees. The fruits are rich in saponins, which are poisonous to humans, although not particularly dangerous {{because they are not}} ingested easily. The oils can be extracted to make soap, although this is not <b>viable</b> <b>commercially.</b>|$|R
5|$|Today, most <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> diamond {{deposits}} are in Russia (mostly in Sakha Republic, {{for example}} Mir pipe and Udachnaya pipe), Botswana, Australia (Northern and Western Australia) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|When {{only the}} outside is affected, the inner ivory is still <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b> As {{there are not}} yet {{verified}} techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use {{of some of the}} burned stockpiles.|$|E
5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E
50|$|On 22 December 2014 the World Bank {{approved}} an $88 {{million loan}} that would support Kazakhstan’s efforts to facilitate <b>commercially</b> and socially <b>viable</b> innovation in technology. The Fostering Productive Innovation Project aims {{to improve the}} country {{in areas that are}} able to foster and support technological innovation.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the inefficient {{production}} process, {{the current}} price of bacterial cellulose remains {{too high to}} make it <b>commercially</b> attractive and <b>viable</b> on a large scale. [...] Traditional production methods cannot produce microbial cellulose in commercial quantities, so further advancements with reactor based production must be achieved {{to be able to}} market many microbial cellulose products.|$|R
50|$|Oil Palm is {{the richest}} source of oil. While Oil Palm can give around 3 to 5 Tons of oil per hectare, the {{yield per hectare}} of oil seeds like ground nut, sun flower, soyabean etc. would come to about 1 ton only. The {{cultivation}} of Oil Palm is <b>commercially</b> very much <b>viable</b> in comparison with other commercial crops like Rubber, Coconut etc.|$|R
5|$|In 1896, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab started {{tours to}} Hotellneset. To {{accommodate}} tourists, {{they built a}} prefabricated hotel, {{but it was not}} profitable and was closed after the 1897 season. However, two families overwintered in 1898–99 and Norway Post operated a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899. The first <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> coal on Svalbard was harvested by Søren Zakariassen in 1899. In 1901, Bergen-Spitsbergen Kullgrube-kompani started mining coal in Adventtoppen.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Drax Power Limited, in {{response}} to a government consultation, stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage (CCS), but noted that it was not then <b>commercially</b> <b>viable,</b> with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power. On 17 June 2009, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans to require all UK coal-fired power stations should be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure.|$|E
5|$|In the November/December 1982 {{issue of}} American Film, Chuck Ross {{claimed that he}} retyped the {{screenplay}} to Casablanca, changing the title back to Everybody Comes to Rick's {{and the name of}} the piano player to Dooley Wilson, and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as Casablanca), three declared it <b>commercially</b> <b>viable,</b> and one suggested turning it into a novel.|$|E
40|$|Approaching {{four decades}} have elapsed {{since the first}} patents were filed on fibre optic sensor technology. During that time basic {{principles}} have become well characterised and established and technological approaches and sensor realisation have become <b>commercially</b> and practically <b>viable.</b> This paper reviews {{just some of the}} progress in fibre sensors highlighting in particular the mechanisms involved in turning the bench demonstrator into competitive and effective product...|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempts}} to make fe-EDDHA <b>commercially</b> and agriculturally <b>viable</b> were made by Dr.Ramesh Patel of Agricon Chemicals,a leading plant nutritiononist and industrialist from India.He was awarded Padma Bhushan for this service to the agricultural world.In India the development, and use of EDDHA, EDTA and other such chelate fertilizers today is largely successful due to the pioneering efforts of such private players in India.|$|R
5000|$|Later, in {{the twentieth}} century, the {{publication}} of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien enormously influenced fantasy writing, establishing the form of epic fantasy. This also did much to establish the genre of fantasy as <b>commercially</b> distinct and <b>viable.</b> And today fantasy continues as an expansive, multi-layered medium encompassing many subgenres, including traditional high fantasy, sword and sorcery, magical realism, fairytale fantasy, and horror-tinged dark fantasy.|$|R
5|$|National grids {{are usually}} {{tailored}} towards {{the operation of}} centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b> This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the West Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b> This {{would be even more}} likely if proposals are adopted for a new high-speed line from London to the north of Britain.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} shoot, Silk dances with veteran actor Suryakanth (Naseeruddin Shah), her {{childhood}} idol. Enamoured with him, Silk gains his affection and attention {{by offering a}} long-term sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganesh and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism, to make the film more <b>commercially</b> <b>viable,</b> angers Abraham. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry {{and goes on to}} do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a Southern sex symbol.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{with this}} {{spectacular}} performance (and {{even though it}} had been built relatively cheaply, using existing parts), the project was not considered <b>viable</b> <b>commercially.</b> The railroad gathered valuable test data regarding the stresses of high-speed rail travel on conventional equipment and tracks then existing in America. The data was largely ignored, as the NYC was headed for merger with its arch rival Pennsylvania Railroad. The PRR was already heavily involved in the Metroliner project, funded by the United States Department of Transportation.|$|R
30|$|The {{practical}} {{significance of}} this study is the existence of a mature commercial market for CWS dispersant and the valorization of LS from wood biorefinery as a co-product. Furthermore, with the gradual closing of sulfite pulp mills in the last 40  years around the world, {{there is a shortage of}} commercial LS products. Some regions rely on a low quality LS derived from sulfonation of kraft lignin—from kraft pulping [20] to meet market demand. Therefore, LS from SPORL can be a <b>commercially</b> and economically <b>viable</b> co-product for biorefinery.|$|R
30|$|To {{solve these}} problems, {{microfinance}} institutions (MFIs) have created social innovations which {{permit them to}} offer financial products which were otherwise not <b>viable</b> <b>commercially</b> (Armendàriz and Morduch 2010). Seeing the success of MFIs, hitherto conservative commercial financial institutions are also downscaling {{to profit from the}} vast market {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid. All of these are trying to use advanced technologies such as management information systems, mobile banking, and online financing to increase their outreach (Ashta et al. 2011). The question is whether their own ideological heritage will permit conservative institutions to foster entrepreneurship or to turn the system to their advantage.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{alternative}} rock's declining popularity, {{some artists}} retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> into {{the start of}} the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5000|$|This {{management}} system could work if a viable cropping pattern would be available, {{but this was}} and is lacking at Bura. Tenants planted cotton in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 most tenants made a small profit, {{but in the next}} year the crop failed, leaving the tenants without income and with debts with Equity Bank. Since then no cotton has been cultivated as it is considered non-profitable. For food the tenants grew maize, but this crop was <b>commercially</b> not <b>viable</b> and although it has provided the tenants with the necessary subsistence food, it also resulted in more arrears. Moreover, when the tenants wanted to market their surplus maize, there was no market available. Alternative crops (chillies) have also not been successful and left tenants with debts as well. The only crop which has been grown with success is seed maize. Unfortunately, due {{to the quality of the}} soils, the margins for this crop are low at Bura and do not make it possible for the tenants to repay already existing debts or to pay for the cost of their food maize.|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{volume of}} large computational computer codes were developed for NASA {{over the past}} twenty-five years. This code represents algorithms developed for machines of earlier generation. With {{the emergence of the}} vector supercomputer as a <b>viable,</b> <b>commercially</b> available machine, an opportunity exists to evaluate optimization strategies to improve the efficiency of existing software. This result is primarily due to architectural differences in the latest generation of large-scale machines and the earlier, mostly uniprocessor, machines. A sofware package being used by NASA to perform computations on large matrices is described, and a strategy for conversion to the Cray X-MP vector supercomputer is also described...|$|R
40|$|Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Augmented Intelligence {{happens to}} be the most talked about {{technology}} that would {{have a major impact on}} the way the current day world functions. The next step in evolution of digital world is AI. The safety of the world with more and more use of AI also becomes necessity. Safety rules and regulations of the digital world need to be drafted and redrafted as AI evolves and becomes a new normal in every one’s life just as mobile phone has become in the current scenario. Every day, several articles are being published about the new areas of applications of AI. This paper makes an attempt to track the evolution of AI as subset of evolution of digital world, various applications of AI that have been published and <b>commercially</b> made <b>viable</b> and the future of AI as predicted by the experts in this area.

5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E
5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> ore of lutetium is the rare-earth phosphate mineral monazite, (Ce,La,etc.)PO4, {{which contains}} 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Pure lutetium metal {{is one of}} the rarest and most expensive of the rare-earth metals with the price about 10,000 USD/kg, or about one-fourth that of gold. Lanthanum is much more common, being the second most abundant rare earth, and in addition to monazite can also be extracted economically from bastnäsite.|$|E
5000|$|Ravikumar {{has often}} chose {{to work with}} {{established}} actors rather than newcomers, indicating that they are <b>commercially</b> more <b>viable</b> than newcomers, and are easier to handle them as they are more experienced. He has regularly worked on his scripts only after finalising the lead actor, adding changes in the original plot line in order to blend it into the actor's image. Describing his collaborations with Rajinikanth, Ravikumar noted he ensured that each scene was discussed with the actor during the making of Padayappa (1999) and that Rajinikanth decided exactly where to place punch dialogues {{in order to attract}} audiences. Referring to his work with Kamal Haasan, he noted that the actor would describe a detailed scene on how to make his core audience of [...] "city-slickers" [...] laugh during the making of Thenali (2000) and Panchathanthiram (2002), and then request Ravikumar to add a slapstick element to make it applicable to village audiences too. Ravikumar has also often collaborated with Sarath Kumar, who has since dedicated his success to the director's opportunities, with the pair working on several quickly shot village action films in the 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|Tosham Hill: The main Tusham hill is {{the second}} largest hill in the range. It has ancient rock {{inscriptions}} and rock pantings, paelo eroded rocky glacial channels and water cascades, and small hilltop lakes. It consists of a quartz porphyry ring dyke, felsite, welded tuff and muscovite biotite granite. The country rocks (Archean Bhilwara basement rocks) native to the area are quartzite with chiastolite belonging to the Delhi Supergroup. The Tosham Sn-W-Cu rocks {{are the source of}} primary tin as well as Tungsten and copper, but found to be not <b>viable</b> <b>commercially.</b> The granites and granite porphyries are high heat producing type. Spectroscopy studies indicate that they have high abundance of potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th), a sign of radioactivity. Highest heat flow in India is recorded from this area.|$|R
