500|$|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times {{said that is}} difficult to recognize Lady Gaga [...] "out of her usual get-ups: the meat dresses, seashell bikinis, towering stilettos and skyscraper hair" [...] and praised Bennett's vocals [...] "his voice still strong at 88, take on the Great American Songbook and prove again that the classics can bridge many divides." [...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from <b>Channel</b> <b>Guide</b> said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the network itself, TXCN has maintained a website, which listed headlines and weather reports across the state, sports scores, Texas Lottery results, daily Texas History, programming guide for TXCN's original shows, anchor biographies, and a channel finder. Until April 30, 2015, the webpage remained somewhat active, but many features have gradually shut down since the 2004 staffing cuts, leaving only the news headlines and weather updates from the 4 aforementioned stations via their websites' RSS feeds, and an outdated <b>channel</b> <b>guide</b> (still listed that DFW was being served by Comcast and Houston being served by Time Warner Cable even though the 2 clusters swapped providers in August 2006). On April 30, 2015, the website was changed to a message stating that TXCN would be discontinued on May 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. Central time.

5000|$|Windows Media Center is {{the most}} widely used {{software}} available for use with the Prime, and the only one with Digital Rights Management (DRM) to view and record premium cable channels like HBO. Many other software options are available; please see the list in this Wiki and the Silicondust website for details. When running WMC, an additional, separate ATSC tuner can be used with the PC and WMC will combine both the Prime and ATSC tuner in the guide for live TV and recording. By default WMC has a 4 tuner limit for each type (ATSC, CableCard) of tuner, but a 3rd party software product called TunerSalad increases the number of tuners to 32 per type; you can use up to 32 cable tuners (11 Primes = 33 cable tuners) and 32 ATSC tuners, for a total of 64 tuners. There is also another 3rd party software called My Channel Logos that adds channel logos to the WMC <b>channel</b> <b>guide.</b> For detailed discussion of WMC, please see TheGreenButton.tv website.|$|E

50|$|The {{acquisition}} made NTVB Media {{the largest}} owner of consumer television publications in the United States, {{with a combined}} reach of more than 20 million readers. NTVB already owned TV Weekly and <b>Channel</b> <b>Guide,</b> both of which provide national editorial content and - through syndication agreements with 160+ newspapers throughout the country, {{in which they are}} distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each paper's Sunday editions - listings customized for individual regions (the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008, as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to cost-cutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue); it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Dish Network. As such, it is undetermined whether NTVB will reach deals to distribute TV Guide to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications. Staff with TV Guide and NTVB's other titles will collaborate on feature content included in the respective magazines, while the company will fold advertising sales for the magazine with its existing television magazine titles.|$|E

While sobbing, Lisa {{explains}} to them what Moe has done, and Bart and Homer quickly run off to exact revenge for her. That night, at the dinner honoring Moe, Moe begins reading his poems. However, the crowd begins to murmur, as they realize that the new poems that Moe is reading are just the information from an elevator warning sign and a <b>channel</b> <b>guide.</b> The door opens {{in the back of the}} dining hall and Moe stops in mid-sentence as he sees a sad and bitter Lisa walk through. Moe suddenly comes to his senses and, in an original poem of his own, he credits Lisa for her influence and friendship. Lisa is touched by Moe's words and she forgives him. Just then, Homer calls out from a catwalk above Moe, telling him that he never should have made Lisa cry. Homer and Bart tip over a giant drum of maple syrup intended for Moe, but the extremely thick syrup flows so slowly out of the drum that Moe has plenty of time to get away before the syrup reaches him. The episode ends with Moe and Lisa walking out of the dining hall, hand in hand.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a widened X-branch optical {{waveguide}} by K$ sp+$-Na$ sp+$ ion-exchange in glass, {{to be used}} as a single mode-optical wavelength division demultiplexer (WDM) at the wavelengths 1. 31 $ mu$m is designed, fabricated, and tested. The widened X-branch is a <b>channel</b> <b>guide</b> structure. To carry out the design, the effective-index method (EIM) together with the 2 D-beam propagation method (FD-BPM), are employed. In order to get an accurate model for the lateral effective index in the <b>channel</b> <b>guide,</b> in the EIM, the diffusion process related to the ion-exchange is numerically simulated using an explicit 3 D finite difference scheme. Experimentally, extinction ratios about $-$ 20 dB are obtained for TM mode devices, and in reasonably good agreement with the design predictions. These results are discussed and possible improvements to the present work are pointed out...|$|E

The signal bandwidth is {{characterized as a}} function of mode relative energy, mode propagation delay time, and mode pulse broadening in the multimode section of MMI coupler. The model is used to evaluate the signal bandwidth of specific couplers. Results indicate that the signal bandwidth decreases seriously with the increase of channel number and <b>channel</b> <b>guide</b> space. Compared with the straight MMI coupler, the tapered MMI coupler has an improved signal bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|High-quality {{electron}} beams, {{with a few}} 109 electrons {{within a}} few percent of the same energy above 80 MeV, were produced in a laser wakefield accelerator by matching the acceleration length to the length over which electrons were accelerated and outran (dephased from) the wake. A plasma <b>channel</b> <b>guided</b> the drive laser over long distances, resulting in production of the high-energy, high-quality beams. Unchanneled experiments varying {{the length of the}} target plasma indicated that the high-quality bunches are produced near the dephasing length and demonstrated that <b>channel</b> <b>guiding</b> was more stable and efficient than relativistic self-guiding. Consistent with these data, particle-in-cell simulations indicate production of high-quality electron beams when trapping of an initial bunch of electrons suppresses further injection by loading the wake. The injected electron bunch is then compressed in energy by dephasing, when the front of the bunch begins to decelerate while the tail is still accelerated...|$|R

40|$|Integrated optic {{waveguide}} circuits with a {{phase bias}} and modulator {{on the same}} chip were designed, fabricated, and tested {{for use in a}} fiber-optic rotation sensor (gyro) under development.

The control of the coupling was achieved by electro-optically varying the phase propagation constants of each guide. Fiber-to-chip interfacing required the development of appropriate fixturing and manipulation techniques to achieve the close tolerance needed for high coupling efficiency between a fiber with an approximately 5 micron m core and a <b>channel</b> <b>guide</b> with a roughly 2 micron m by 5 micron m cross section.
