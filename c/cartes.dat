In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, Carte produced Jane Annie, by J. M.

25|$|To {{prevent their}} camp being located or {{compromised}} by German {{radio direction finding}} equipment or informers, Tonkin regularly moved its location. The location of new camps had {{to be close to}} water and a drop zone for parachute supply. The camp located near to Verrières was near to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson and had an adequate water supply. The SAS Squadron had been at Verrières between 25 June and 1 July. The local population had also become aware of the camp and Tonkin was warned by Maingard that if the locals knew, informers would soon tell the Germans. Tonkin ordered the squadron to move to a new camp just south in the Bois des <b>Cartes.</b> This new camp was also close to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson where they were expecting a supply drop over the night of 3/4 July. On their arrival at the new camp at Bois des <b>Cartes,</b> the water supply from the well failed and due to this Tonkin decided to return to Verrières until a more suitable camp site could be found.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: School {{districts in}} the U. S. {{regularly}} offer foods that compete with the USDA reimbursable meal, known as `a la <b>carte</b> 2 ̆ 7 foods. These foods must adhere to state nutritional regulations; however, the implementation of these regulations often differs across districts. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare two methods of offering a la <b>carte</b> foods on student 2 ̆ 7 s lunch intake: 1) an extensive a la <b>carte</b> program in which schools have a separate area for a la <b>carte</b> food sales, that includes non-reimbursable entrees; and 2) a moderate a la <b>carte</b> program, which offers the sale of a la <b>carte</b> foods on the same serving line with reimbursable meals. ^ Methods: Direct observation was used to assess children 2 ̆ 7 s lunch consumption in six schools, across two districts in Central Texas (n= 373 observations). Schools were matched on socioeconomic status. Data collectors were randomly assigned to students, and recorded foods obtained, foods consumed, source of food, gender, grade, and ethnicity. Observations were entered into a nutrient database program, FIAS Millennium Edition, to obtain nutritional information. Differences in energy and nutrient intake across lunch sources and districts were assessed using ANOVA and independent t-tests. A linear regression model was applied to control for potential confounders. ^ Results: Students at schools with extensive a la <b>carte</b> programs consumed significantly more calories, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, calcium, and sodium compared to students in schools with moderate a la <b>carte</b> offerings (p 3 ̆c. 05). Students in the extensive a la <b>carte</b> program consumed approximately 94 calories more than students in the moderate a la <b>carte</b> program. There was no significant difference in the energy consumption in students who consumed any amount of a la <b>carte</b> compared to students who consumed none. In both districts, students who consumed a la <b>carte</b> offerings were more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, chips, and pizza compared to students who consumed no a la <b>carte</b> foods. ^ Conclusion: The amount, type and method of offering a la <b>carte</b> foods can significantly affect student dietary intake. This pilot study indicates that when a la <b>carte</b> foods are more available, students consume more calories. Findings underscore the need for further investigation on how availability of a la <b>carte</b> foods affects children 2 ̆ 7 s diets. Guidelines for school a la <b>carte</b> offerings should be maximized to encourage the consumption of healthful foods and appropriate energy intake. ...|$|R
