40|$|Abstract—The prologue of new High Voltage (HV) {{transmission}} mains {{into the}} community necessitates earthing design to ensure safety compliance of the system. <b>Concrete</b> <b>poles</b> are widely used within HV transmission mains; many retired transmission mains with timber poles are being replaced with concrete ones, green transmission mains are deploying <b>concrete</b> <b>poles.</b> The earthing arrangement of the <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> could {{have an impact on}} the earth grid impedance also on the input impedance of the system from the fault point of view. This paper endeavors to provide information on the soil resistivity of the area and the deployments of <b>concrete</b> <b>poles.</b> It introduce the cut off soil resistivity value ρSC, this value aid in determine the impact of deploying the <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> on the earthing system.

50|$|While Hartshorne {{acknowledges}} {{the importance of}} Whitehead's philosophy on his own ideas, he did not entirely agree with Whitehead. In Hartshorne's process theology God and the world exist in a dynamic, changing relationship. God is a 'di-polar' deity. By this Hartshorne meant that God has both abstract and concrete poles. The abstract pole refers to those elements within God that never vary, such as God's self-identity, while the <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> refers to the organic growth in God's perfect {{knowledge of the world}} as the world itself develops and changes. Hartshorne did not accept the classical theistic claim of creatio ex nihilo (creation out of nothing), and instead held to creatio ex materia (creation out of pre-existent material).|$|E

40|$|Unique conductor-pole {{couplings}} {{complicate the}} dynamic behaviors of electric transmission pole line systems. Finite element modeling is performed on two typical transmission poles used in southeastern USA – a steel pole and a prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pole.</b> The two poles {{are representative of}} unique structure types: a heavy rod-like structure and a lightweight, shell-type structure. Since coupling issues between the pole and the cable introduce great complexities for modeling the pole line system, simplified numerical models are used. Limited full-scale modal test results are presented to verify the numerical models. The prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> is shown to be easier for mode identification than the steel pole – but both numerical models show complicated coupled vibration modes.

40|$|Transmission line {{structures}} play a {{vital role}} in transmitting electricity from the source of production to the distribution system. The main components of a transmission line are the conductors, the insulator strings, the ground wires and the supporting towers. Among the different types of supporting towers, prestressed <b>concrete</b> transmission <b>poles</b> have the advantages of low installation and maintenance costs, appropriate delivery time, and corrosion resistivity. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper represents the first investigation conducted to assess the response of cantilever prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> to tornadoes. The localized nature of the tornadoes and the extended length of the conductors introduce some challenges in predicting the critical response of power transmission towers to tornadoes. The current study is conducted numerically using an in-house numerical model that includes the following: (1) a three-dimensional tornado wind field developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations; (2) a non-linear simulation of the structural behaviour of a prestressed <b>concrete</b> transmission <b>poles</b> taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the concrete and of the prestressed strands, and (3) a simulation of the non-linear behaviour of the conductors including the effects of the pretension force, sagging, the insulator’s stiffness and the non-uniform distribution of wind loads. Details of this numerical model are briefly discussed in this paper. A case study is considered to assess the importance of including the effect of tornadoes in the design of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>poles...</b>|$|R

This project {{work is to}} determine the quality characteristics of <b>concrete</b> electric <b>poles</b> used to carry overhead conductors in the Ibadan metropolis of Nigeria. Samples of broken <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> were collected from various sites within Ibadan metropolis. Core, permeability, cube and tensile tests were carried out on samples of stumbled <b>poles</b> and fresh <b>concrete</b> mix collected from companies producing poles.

For the core test, only one sample had the average values of 46, 200 KN/m and 50, 400 KN/m 2 at 7 days and 28 days respectively which exceeded the standard minimum value. The results showed that the manufacturers did not use the right ratio of materials, the mode of mixing of the aggregates was not adequate and casting allowed voids/air space which made the poles permeable and the period of curing (the number of days) of the poles was not adequate.

Thus, guidance is provided about how thin the concrete walls can be made without risking failure – which also means how low the weight of such a pole can be. The failure most likely to occur is a compressive failure in the concrete with a ductile behavior. The result shows that a geometry change, which implies a thinner concrete wall, is possible. This means a weight reduction between 30 - 75 % or even more, depending on which network the poles are designed for...|$|R
