5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the <b>castoring</b> behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
25|$|The CFM Shadow is a two-seat {{ultralight}} of pod and boom layout, either factory or home-built from kits. It is a {{high wing}} aircraft, with a short fuselage constructed of Fibrelam with a fibreglass nose cone and plywood sides, seating two in tandem in an enclosed cockpit. Dual control can be fitted and was standard on later models. The fuselage carries a tricycle undercarriage, with a <b>castoring</b> nosewheel; wheel fairings are an option. A Rotax two-cylinder two-stroke engine is mounted, exposed, immediately behind this pod in pusher configuration. The unusual empennage is carried on a fine aluminium boom and consists of an inverted narrow rectangular tail fin and large rudder below the boom plus a swept tailplane with small tapered upright end plate fins. The elevators are full span, with electrically operated trim tabs. All rear surfaces have aluminium structures covered with polyester fabric.|$|E
25|$|The second Type 173 was {{designated}} Type 173 Mk 2 and allocated military serial XH379, {{and had a}} revised landing gear, with <b>castoring</b> front wheels and fixed rear wheels. It was also fitted with small stub wings at {{the front and rear}} to improve the cruise speed, the stub wings being removed after a few flights when the helicopter was used for Naval trials, and an unswept tailplane was added. As a result of the trials the Royal Navy showed an interest in ordering the type for carrier duties. In August 1956 the second prototype was leased to British European Airways for evaluation. The Mk 2 aircraft was destroyed in an accident during an air show at Filton in September 1956. The helicopter crashed into the ground nose first while making the transition from hover to forward flight. The crew escaped unharmed but the aircraft was written off. After the crash the tailplane was salvaged from the Mk 2 and fitted to the Mk 1 to investigate the best configuration for stability.|$|E

2500|$|The P.74 {{prototype}} (designated the Hunting Percival P.74 {{after the}} company change its name in 1954) was completed {{in the spring of}} 1956, and given the military serial number XK889. The final product looked decidedly ungainly, with a large bulbous fuselage that tapered to a tiny [...] "tailcone" [...] with an equally tiny tail rotor (deemed sufficient for control since there was no torque from the tip-rotors). The undercarriage consisted of four wheels on splayed-out stubs with <b>castoring</b> for the front two wheels. The large capacity of the P.74 was to show the possible commercial aspect.|$|E
2500|$|The wing carried large [...] "barn door" [...] flaps which, when lowered, made a steep, high rate-of-descent landing possible—this {{performance}} {{would allow}} the pilots to land in constricted spaces.

The Horsa is equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear {{and it was one of}} the first gliders equipped with a tricycle undercarriage for take off. On operational flights, the main gear could be jettisoned and landing was then made on the <b>castoring</b> nose wheel and a sprung skid set on the underside of the fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|The Yak-8 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} Yakovlev Yak-6. It was slightly enlarged but retained its predecessor's mixed construction and general layout. The wooden semi-monocoque forward and central fuselage sections were skinned with a [...] layer of plywood both inside and outside. The rear fuselage was made from a tubular steel framework covered by fabric. The two-spar wooden wing was made in a single piece with fabric-covered ailerons. The main undercarriage retracted rearwards into {{the rear of the}} engine nacelles, but the <b>castoring</b> tailwheel was non-retractable. Two [...] Kossov M-12 engines were originally intended to be used, but they were unavailable and the [...] Shvetsov M-11FM had to be used instead. The Yak-8 was a dedicated transport so its fuselage was deeper than that of the Yak-6. This gave much more headroom for passengers and six could be accommodated rather than the four of its predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} few flights K5054 was {{returned}} to the factory, reappearing about 10 days later with an overall pale blue-grey finish, using a high-gloss automotive nitrocellulose-lacquer applied by people from the Rolls-Royce car plant (there is still some uncertainty over the actual colour). The tailskid originally fitted {{had been replaced by}} a Dowty manufactured, fully <b>castoring</b> tail-wheel unit. This tailwheel was to be modified several times on the prototype, including using twin tailwheels each smaller than the single wheel which was later standardised. The engine cowlings had been altered slightly and the angled fin tip had become straight topped – the rudder balance was correspondingly reduced in size. Undercarriage fairings had now been fitted to the legs. Although the propeller was still the fixed-pitch, wooden bladed unit the pitch had been changed in an attempt to increase the top speed. Several different types of propeller unit were to be fitted to the prototype. Later in 1936, the wings were replaced with a set which, for the first time, incorporated the famous eight [...]303" [...] Browning machine-gun armament.|$|E
2500|$|The Scion and {{the later}} Scion II version were [...] high wing {{cantilever}} monoplanes with fabric-covered metal wings and fuselage, the latter providing an enclosed cabin {{for the pilot}} and 5–6 passengers. The tail unit comprised a cantilever tailplane with a single fin and rudder. The prototype aircraft was powered by two 80hp Pobjoy R radial engines; the production aircraft however were fitted with the 90hp Pobjoy Niagara III radial engines. The engines in the Scion were mounted below the wing spar; in the Scion II they were raised so that the leading edge axis ran through the centre of thrust of the engines. Both the Scion and the Scion II were produced as either landplanes or floatplanes, the majority as landplanes (see the table below). On the landplanes the landing gear comprised a single wheel {{on each side of}} the fuselage, mounted on a vertical coil-spring and oleo leg inboard of the engine; there was a small <b>castoring</b> tailwheel mounted below the rear end of the fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Sherwood Ranger has an {{aluminium tube}} structure, with ply formers and spruce stringers, and is fabric covered apart from glass fibre mouldings {{in the engine}} and cockpit areas and forming the rear decking. [...] The nose is quite slender; the separate open cockpits are {{in tandem with the}} forward one a little behind {{the leading edge of the}} wing and the other under the trailing edge, where a slight upper wing cut-out improves the pilot's view. [...] The fin is integral with the fuselage structure and carries a deep, rounded rudder which extends to the lower fuselage. [...] The tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, has an unusually low aspect ratio and is almost semicircular in plan. These horizontal surfaces are thin and without camber. Separate elevators allows rudder movement between them. The tailplane is braced to the top of the fin and to the fuselage bottom. The fixed conventional undercarriage has mainwheels, fitted with brakes, on split axles mounted from a bungee [...] sprung compression frame below the central fuselage and hinged by faired, V-form legs to its lower longerons. [...] There is a bungee sprung, <b>castoring</b> tailwheel.|$|E
2500|$|The CR.100 is a {{conventional}} single engine, low-wing monoplane, {{with the large}} control surface areas and absence of dihedral expected in an aerobatic aircraft. [...] The structure is mostly wood and fabric, though the main wing spar is a plywood and carbon laminate composite and carbon covered ply is an option for the wing surfaces. All the flying surfaces are straight edged and tapered. [...] The ailerons take up about 60% of the wing's trailing edge. The ailerons have spades to reduce control loads. The remainder of the wing trailing edge is three-position flaps. The rudder and elevators are horn balanced {{and there is a}} fixed rudder trim tab. The width of the flat sided fuselage is determined by the side by side seating arrangement. Full dual controls, including a pair of left hand throttles, are fitted. [...] A sliding bubble canopy covers the cockpit and is faired behind into a raised and rounded fuselage top decking. [...] The wide track main conventional undercarriage has cantilever legs in fairings, with wheels usually in spats. The tailwheel is freely <b>castoring.</b> The CR.100T variant offers the alternative of a tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Crusader {{was not an}} easy {{aircraft}} to fly, and was often unforgiving in carrier landings, where it suffered from poor recovery from high sink rates, and the poorly designed, <b>castoring</b> nose undercarriage made it hard to steer on the deck. Safe landings required the carriers to steam at full speed to lower the relative landing speed for Crusader pilots. The stacks of the oil-burning carriers on which the Crusader served belched thick black smoke, sometimes obscuring the flight deck, forcing the Crusader's pilot to rely on the landing signal officer's radioed instructions. [...] It earned a reputation as an [...] "ensign eliminator" [...] during its early service introduction. The nozzle and air intake were so low when the aircraft was on the ground or the flight deck that the crews called the aircraft [...] "the Gator". Not surprisingly, the Crusader's mishap rate was relatively high compared to its contemporaries, the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and the F-4 Phantom II. However, the aircraft did possess some amazing capabilities, as proved when several Crusader pilots took off with the wings folded. One of these episodes took place on 23 August 1960; a Crusader with the wings folded took off from Napoli Capodichino in full afterburner, climbed to [...] and then returned to land successfully. The pilot, absentminded but evidently a good [...] "stick man," [...] complained that the control forces were higher than normal. The Crusader was capable of flying in this state, though the pilot would be required to reduce aircraft weight by ejecting stores and fuel before landing. In all, 1,261 Crusaders were built. By the time it was withdrawn from the fleet, 1,106 had been involved in mishaps. Only a handful of them were lost to enemy fire in Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|A six-year {{trial was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the vegetative and productive performance of low-chill, early-ripening 'Tropic Snow' peach grown on five peach x almond rootstocks, different for their vigor. The {{study was conducted in}} south-western Sicily using 45 V-trained peach trees planted in 2005 and grafted on GF 677, the most common rootstock in Sicily, and four low-vigor rootstocks selected at the Department of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences, University of Pisa, namely IS 5 / 8 (Polluce), IS 5 / 19 (<b>Castore),</b> IS 5 / 23, and IS 5 / 29. Trunk circumference, winter and summer pruning weight, total number and weight of fruits per tree, and major fruit quality traits were recorded starting at the 3 rd leaf. After fruit harvest in the 5 th leaf, irrigation was withheld during the dry summer period (July-September). All IS selections reduced trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and pruning weight compared to GF 677, with IS 5 / 23 reducing TCSA by 62 % and <b>Castore,</b> Polluce and IS 5 / 29 by 32 % by the 8 th leaf. Yield efficiency was inversely related to tree vigor, with IS 5 / 23 inducing the highest increase over GF 677. Trees on IS 5 / 23 exhibited 24 - 28 % reductions of crop load and yield, whereas only IS 5 / 29 increased fruit size compared to GF 677. Postharvest water deficit induced significant yield declines in GF 677, IS 5 / 29 and IS 5 / 23 in the following year. Low-vigor trees on <b>Castore,</b> Polluce and IS 5 / 23 were more sensitive to changes in stomatal conductance in terms of carbon fixation, performing better than trees on GF 677 and IS 5 / 29 under non-limiting water conditions. Only minor rootstock effects on fruit quality were observed, with IS 5 / 23 reducing significantly the final grower's profit. Overall, all low-vigor rootstocks performed decently, and in particular IS 5 / 29 exhibited a good compromise between growth reduction, yield and fruit size, whereas <b>Castore</b> and Polluce may represent valid alternatives to GF 677 for early peach production in dry Mediterranean areas...|$|R
