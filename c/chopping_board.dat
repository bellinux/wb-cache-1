25|$|One of the {{adventure}} tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, {{there is a}} 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (<b>Chopping</b> <b>Board),</b> a chopping-board-shaped stone. But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear under the ground. The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, creating jobs for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day. This income is relatively high for peasants in this province. This centre also launched a programme in 2000 to train former loggers to work as photographers taking pictures for tourists and about 300 former loggers are now doing this.|$|E

50|$|The wood is {{generally}} hard, tough and heavy, hornbeams particularly so; several species were of significant {{importance in the}} past where very hard wood capable of withstanding heavy wear was required, such as for cartwheels, water wheels, cog wheels, tool handles, <b>chopping</b> <b>boards,</b> and wooden pegs. In most of these uses, wood has now been replaced by metal or other man-made materials.|$|R

50|$|A {{characteristic}} of this homemade dish is the rhythmic pounding of the cleaver against the <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> during preparing the hand-minced pork. Steam minced pork is popular and common among cantonese families because cantonese {{people find it}} goes well with rice, and the preparation and ingredients are also simple. For this reason, it is familiar to hear this hand-mincing sound from each home during lunch or dinner time in Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria or allergens {{can easily}} be {{transmitted}} {{from one part of}} the kitchen to another or from one food to another via knives, hands, or surfaces such as <b>chopping</b> <b>boards.</b> To reduce the chance of this it is advised to use separate boards for different types of food such as raw meat, cooked meat, dairy and vegetables.

There is a gas hob, <b>chopping</b> <b>board,</b> cutlery drawer, cold store (depending on the trolley type), and general working area.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, Spätzle {{are made}} by {{scraping}} long, thin strips of dough off a wooden (sometimes wet) <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> (Spätzlebrett) into boiling salted water where they cook until they rise to the surface. Altogether, the dough should thus be as viscous as to slowly flow apart if cut into strips with a knife, yet hold the initial shape for some seconds. If dropped into boiling water, the albumen will congeal quickly in the boiling water, while the yolk will keep the dough succulent. After the noodles have become firm, they are skimmed and put aside.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the occurrence of microbiological contamination of kitchen utensils and environments of food service operations at university located in Seoul, Korea. Methods: We collected swab samples from the surfaces of knives, <b>chopping</b> <b>boards,</b> floors, and drains, as well as drinking water and airborne bacteria samples from 20 food service operations. Three bacterial indicators and five food poisoning bacteria were measured quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively. We used selective culture media and the PCR assay targeting 16 S rRNA gene for the microbiological analysis. Results: We detected bacterial indicators on knives or <b>chopping</b> <b>boards</b> in eight different food service operations and, three food service operations(I, M, and O) showed more than 3 log colony forming units(CFU) / 100 cm 2 on their knives, significantly higher than the others. The levels of bacterial indicators on the floors and drains in the cooking areas were much higher than those on the cooking utensils. S. aureus was detected on 10 floors and 8 drains. Culturable bacteria were identified in 5 drinking water samples, and food service operation B (431. 1 CFU/m 3) and C(551. 2 CFU/m 3) showed more than 400 CFU/m 3 of total airborne bacteria. Conclusions: These results suggest that some of food service operations in this study may require additional investigation to secure the microbial safety of cooking environments.

25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' <b>chopping</b> <b>boards.</b> It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements.

50|$|In the 1950s, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of the director Roy Midwinter, the company became one of the leading innovators in British tableware production. A large part of this was due to the noted ceramicists and designers who worked for the pottery, including Jessie Tait, Terence Conran, Hugh Casson, John Russell and Peter Scott. The Midwinter Pottery was also an innovator in producing 'accessories' to their basic dinner services and tea sets. The Clayburn Pottery, a sister company to Midwinter, made pieces such as lamp bases that could be added to a Midwinter dinner service. In the 1960s, the Spanish Garden design, which was very successful on dinner ware and tea sets, adorned articles such as a bread bin and <b>chopping</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

50|$|Royds individualistic {{approach}} to her woodcuts - applying pigments to printing blocks using a brush {{rather than a}} roller - resulted in unique variations of each of her prints. Additionally, Royds preferred to produce on demand, rather than creating limited edition runs, further ensuring a one-of-a-kind piece. To prepare, Royds often created colored paper collages before her final drawing. Although cherry wood was ideal, Royds usually used Woolworth’s 6d pastry boards - a cheaper alternative. Despite using <b>chopping</b> <b>boards</b> that cost her only sixpence, Royds' prints remained professional and sophisticated, proving her mastery of the technique. After carving the woodblocks, she printed impressions by rubbing the sheet with a Japanese barren. In her later works, Royds would either eliminate the keyblock entirely or print it in multiple colors - creating direct relationships between the colors instead of having them separated by borders.|$|R

30|$|With the {{exception}} of one or two who said that they have always been concerned about food safety before and after immigration, the majority {{of the participants in the}} focus group said that they became more aware of food safety, nutrition and health since they came to Canada. Many also reported learning new practices in purchasing, preparing/cooking, and storing food. These include checking food labels for expiry date, using separate <b>chopping</b> <b>boards</b> for cutting raw meats and cooked food, and avoiding heating food in Styrofoam boxes. Many also reported changing their old habit of taking food with their own chopsticks by learning to use service spoons or chopsticks when serving meals and when eating from shared dishes. Several participants re-discovered some traditional ways of dish cleaning in order to reduce the use of detergents. These include using water from boiling noodles and dumplings in washing off grease from the dishes, and saving water from washing rice to help remove pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables. Many respondents found that these practices are effective, economical, and beneficial to their own health and the environment.|$|R
50|$|Wooden countertops {{can come}} in a variety of designs ranging from butcher block to joined planks to single wide stave. Wood is {{considered}} to be the most eco-friendly option when it comes to choosing a kitchen countertop as wood is a renewable resource. Wood countertops must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after contact with foods such as raw meat. Although the use of wooden work surfaces is prohibited in commercial food production areas in the EU, and the US Department of Agriculture advises against the use of wooden <b>chopping</b> <b>boards,</b> research by the Food Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin has shown that wooden work surfaces are no more dangerous, and in some cases safer than plastic alternatives.

While brand new plastic work surfaces are indeed easy to disinfect, once they have become heavily knife scarred they are nearly impossible to completely disinfect. This is not a problem with wooden work surfaces where the number of knife cuts made little difference.|$|R
