5000|$|NRB is India's largest {{needle and}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} producer headquartered in Mumbai. NRB was incorporated in 1965 as an Indo-French venture with Nadella and pioneered {{the production of}} needle roller bearings in India. Its eight manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand produce needle roller bearings, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, tapered roller bearings, special ball bearings, thrust bearings and other anti friction solutions such as planetary shafts and pins.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{consists}} in {{analysis of the}} contact stress and deformations appeared to the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> with variable center of gravity who equips large bearings, with finite elements method. Also it proposed an innovative model of lubrication system mounts in the hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> of the large bearings where it is stored the lubricant who is driven to the raceways through holes fitted with closing/opening systems made in the cover, controlled by a command system, monitoring and control, equipped with temperature sensors and wireless command. Elimination of lubricant, in stages, leads to changes in position of center of gravity of roller, thus to change its behavior in functioning. Comparison of deformations occurred in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers,</b> solid, with hollowness, and with variable center of gravity, allow favorable conclusions, on {{the implementation of the}} proposed lubrication system...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cylindrical</b> thrust <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} {{consist of}} small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> arranged flat with their axes {{pointing to the}} axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend to wear due to the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{ball bearing}} and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing are over-determined, having more points of contact than {{required}} for kinematic determinacy. This leads to decreased precision as the joints wear.|$|E
50|$|The Particle Transfer Roller, often {{abbreviated}} to PTR, is a device for cleaning motion picture film. It {{consists of a}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> coated with urethane, over which {{the surface of the}} film passes.|$|E
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts. Common designs are Thrust ball bearings, spherical roller thrust bearings, tapered roller thrust bearings or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust bearings. Also non-rolling-element bearings such as hydrostatic or magnetic bearings see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} types of rolling {{elements}} {{that are used in}} rolling-element bearings: balls, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers,</b> spherical rollers, tapered rollers, and needle rollers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Roller</b> mills use <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> for {{grinding}} different materials, especially grains, {{which can}} even be an appropriate substitution for hammer mill and ball mills. Sifting is used in order to adjust the distribution of endosperm particle ...|$|R
40|$|In metal {{rolling and}} in {{calendaring}} operations, {{the raw material}} is squeezed through two horizontal <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> rotating in opposite directions. The thickness of the sheet {{coming out of the}} two rollers must be kept within a certain tolerance so that the sheet can go to the next stage in the production process...|$|R
50|$|Traditional Barden {{products}} are predominantly radial, single row, super precision angular contact (separable and nonseparable) and deep groove ball bearings. Bearings {{are classified as}} either instrument or spindle bearings, and are made to exacting ABEC-7 or ABEC-9 specifications. Barden also sells ball screw support bearings, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings and double direction angular contact thrust ball bearings.|$|E
50|$|Orders for the {{subsequent}} Class 5E1, Series 3 and later models made provision for roller suspension bearings incorporating a lip-type <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing {{to replace the}} self-aligning ball bearing at the pinion end, and alternatively for tapered roller bearings at both ends. Since the external dimensions of the bearing housings would remain the same, the traction motors would still be freely interchangeable.|$|E
50|$|The {{input shaft}} is mounted {{eccentrically}} to a Rolling-element bearing (typically a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearing), causing the cycloidal disc {{to move in}} a circle. The cycloidal disc will independently rotate around the bearing as it is pushed against the ring gear. This is similar to planetary gears, and the direction of rotation is opposite {{to that of the}} input shaft.|$|E
5000|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a special type of roller bearing which uses long, thin <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> {{resembling}} needles. Ordinary roller bearings' rollers are only slightly longer than their diameter, but needle bearings typically have rollers that are {{at least four times}} longer than their diameter. [...] Like all bearings, they are used to reduce the friction of a rotating surface.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical comparison using dynamic modeling techniques, of physical phenomena occurring at collisions between two rollers {{in a lot}} of distinct situations: impact on the edge at angles of 0 °, 10 °, 20 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 70 °, 80 ° and impact on generator. These situations occur frequently in the manufacturing process of small <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{resembles a}} roller bearing but, instead of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers,</b> non-revolving {{asymmetric}} figure-eight shaped sprags are used. When the unit rotates {{in one direction}} the rollers slip or free-wheel, but when a torque is applied in the opposite direction, the rollers tilt slightly, producing a wedging action and binding because of friction. The sprags are spring-loaded so that they lock with very little backlash.|$|R
5000|$|Roundness is {{the measure}} of how closely {{the shape of an}} object {{approaches}} that of a mathematically perfect circle. Roundness applies in two dimensions, such as the cross sectional circles along a cylindrical object such as a shaft or a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> for a bearing. In geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, control of a cylinder can also include its fidelity to the longitudinal axis, yielding cylindricity. The analogue of roundness in three dimensions (that is, for spheres) is sphericity.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer dot printer, patented by Seikosha in 1982. The smooth <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> of a conventional printer {{was replaced by a}} spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.|$|E
50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller {{and ball}} bearings to the United States industrial, automotive and recreational clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement bearings, angular contact ball bearings, automotive bearings, ball and roller bearing mounted units, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature ball bearings, needle roller bearings, radial ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and ultra-class bearing units.|$|E
50|$|Crush, tear, curl (sometimes cut, tear, curl) is {{a method}} of {{processing}} black tea in which the leaves are passed {{through a series of}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> with hundreds of sharp teeth that crush, tear, and curl the tea into small, hard pellets. This replaces the final stage of orthodox tea manufacture, in which the leaves are rolled into strips. Tea produced using this method is generally called CTC tea or mamri tea.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the collision phenomenon that occurs during the manufacturing process of axial bearings rollers. The manufacture of rollers is made on automatic production centers. During the transport process on automated lines, collisions occur between rollers. A study on <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> Φ 16 x L 24, in the simplified cases of head-head collision and head-circular surface collision, was made in Solid Works Simulation. Stress and deformation results are presented...|$|R
50|$|Roller mills are mills {{that use}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers,</b> either in {{opposing}} pairs or against flat plates, to crush or grind various materials, such as grain, ore, gravel, plastic, and others. Roller grain mills are {{an alternative to}} traditional millstone arrangements in gristmills. Roller mills for rock complement other types of mills, such as ball mills and hammermills, in such industries as the mining and processing of ore and construction aggregate; cement milling; and recycling.|$|R
50|$|Mostly large {{rolling element}} bearing are used as pitch bearings. The bearing is {{subjected}} to high bending moments, radial and axial loads in both directions. Therefore, the rolling elements for {{state of the art}} wind turbines are ball bearings, which are used in a double rowed four-point contact. This means each raceway carries on two points, and in sum four points are carrying. Other possible options are different arrangements of the rolling elements or multirow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings. Pitch bearing of modern wind turbines can reach diameters of more than 4 meters.|$|E
50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller,</b> they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical roller bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
50|$|From 1984 to 1985, NTN Toyo {{concentrated}} on {{tapered roller bearings}} at its United States facilities such as their Elgin factory. This building was added onto in 1984 {{in order to produce}} such bearings at a higher rate of production. In 1985, NTN Toyo Nagano Works, a designer and manufacturer of precision miniature bearings, also opened for business. That same year, NTN Toyo partnered with Federal-Mogul Corporation to produce tapered bearings and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> bearings. The new joint venture, NTN-Bower Corporation, inherited two Federal-Mogul facilities and an additional research facility. NTN Toyo initially owned 60% of this joint venture, but purchased the remaining 40% of NTN-Bower Corporation two years later to fully acquire the company.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, a {{substance}} {{was found with}} the right adhesion and elasticity to make suitable <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers.</b> Composition for use in inking was developed in England in the 1810s by Robert Harrild and another individual named Forster; they first used it for making ink balls, though they soon turned to making rollers. Bryan Donkin {{was the first to}} apply the composition roller to machine press. By 1826, they had begun to be introduced to the United States.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{essence of}} the paper was to design {{technical}} condition monitoring and failure diagnostic evaluation method of low rotation speed rotors with self-aligning antifriction roller bearings. The technical condition of bearings and failures of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> and <b>cylindrical</b> wheels surfaces were tested in situ using mechanical vibration parameters measurement method. The theoretical part of the paper was constrained to the modeling of two cylinders {{in the case of}} different damages levels of the spherical roller bearings...|$|R
50|$|Roller chain or bush {{roller chain}} {{is the type}} of chain drive most {{commonly}} used for transmission of mechanical power on many kinds of domestic, industrial and agricultural machinery, including conveyors, wire- and tube-drawing machines, printing presses, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. It consists of a series of short <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> held together by side links. It is driven by a toothed wheel called a sprocket. It is a simple, reliable, and efficient means of power transmission.|$|R
50|$|Olive oil {{extraction}} installation (işlik) {{dating back to}} the third quarter of the 6th century BC uncovered in Klazomenai is the only surviving example of a level and weights press from an ancient Greek city and precedes by at least two centuries the next securely datable earliest presses found in Greece. It was restored and reconstructed in 2004-2005 through collaboration between Ege University, a Turkish olive-oil exporter and a German natural building components company, as well as by local artisans, {{on the basis of the}} clearly visible millstone with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> and three separation pits. The olive oil obtained turned out to be quite a success in business terms as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parallel}} ruler {{was invented in}} about 1584 by Fabrizio Mordente, {{but it was not}} in common use until the 18th century.In the 19th century a retired sea captain, Captain William Andrew Feild (c. 1790/1 - 1870) of Fold Farm, Herbrandston in Pembrokeshire, improved the design by adding a protractor-style scale to the upper edge of one rule, and compass points to the opposing edge, which made reading bearings easier. Examples exist of boxwood, ivory or ebony, usually with brass hinges. The instrument usually had two links, but longer models sometimes had three, and sometimes the links were scissored. Another variation is the [...] "roller" [...] model which included a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> for ease of use.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pillow block}} usually {{refers to a}} housing with an {{included}} anti-friction bearing. A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller,</b> spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block. These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation on an innovative cycloidal speed reducer is presented. The typical cycloid drive has a planet wheel, {{the profile of}} which is the internal offset of an epitrochoid meshing with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> connected to the case. This reducer, on the contrary, has an external ring gear, the transverse profile {{of which is the}} external offset of an epitrochoid and engages with the planet wheel by means of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers.</b> This paper investigates the structural characteristics and the kinematic principles of this type of reducer. A theoretical approach based on the theory of gearing (following Litvin’s approach) is developed and compared to a development of Blanche and Yang’s approach. Furthermore, a simplified procedure to calculate the force distribution on cycloid drive elements, its power losses, and theoretical mechanical efficiency is presented. The effects of design parameters on the values of forces are studied for an optimal design of this type of reducer. The theoretical model is tuned {{on the basis of the}} results of tests made on purpose. The mechanical efficiency dependency on speed and torque is described. The main aim of this work is to tune {{a theoretical}} model in order to predict the operating behavior of the cycloid drive and to improve its design procedure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a computer-aided design for {{design of the}} concave globoidal cam with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rollers</b> and indexing turret follower. Three models with different modeling methods are made from the same input data. The input data include some basic dimensions of the globoidal cam system and a table of angular input and output displacements of the cam and the follower. The cam model must have no interference with the rollers when their motions are simulated in assembly conditions. In this study, Pro/ENGINEER® Wildfire 2. 0 is used for modeling the cam, simulating motions and checking interference and errors of the system...|$|R
