40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the interaction between}} Kerr nonlin-earity and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in homogeneous multi-channel polarization division multiplexing <b>coherent</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> transmissions. Assuming linear distortions can be fully equalized by the coherent receiver, we concentrate the investigation on the residual nonlinear penalty. We introduce a novel simulation procedure to discriminate intra-channel PMD, i. e., PMD within the channel, from inter-channel PMD, i. e., PMD among different channels, showing their relative impact on system performance in the nonlinear regime. A simple yet effective de-scription of intra-channel PMD is proposed, which helps identify the PMD realizations giving the best/worst performance in the nonlinear regime. We show that on average PMD improves the performance of dispersion-managed links by reducing both non-linear interactions among signals and nonlinear phase noise, while it has no effect in non-dispersion managed links.

A widely recognized practice for combating fading in digital communications over such a timevarying channel is to use diversity techniques. More recently, the transmit diversity technique, which may provide the same order of diversity gain as the receive diversity does, has received great attention for some applications where the receive diversity is impractical. It has also been known that M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) is an attractive modulation technique for wireless communications due to its high spectral efficiency. This thesis presents simple bit error rate results for M-QAM transmitted over slow, flat, identically independently distributed (i. i. d) Rician fading channels and using space diversity. We use an approximate formula for bit error rates (BER) for M-QAM modulation over a Gaussian channel. This approximation is bounded within 1 dB for M ≥ 4 and 0 ≤ SNR ≤ 30 dB. Two cases are considered: the first is optimum receive diversity, with channel side information known at the receiver (CSIR), and the second is the simple space-time transmit diversity (STTD) with no channel side information available at the transmitter (CSIT). Recently exact analysis of symbol error rate (SER) has been presented in the literature for M-ary differentially encoded/ differentially decoded <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MDPSK) and <b>coherent</b> M-ary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MPSK), transmitted over Rician fading channel using N branch receive diversity with maximal-ratio-combining (MRC). The results are presented in an integral form. Our analysis has followed the same track and the simplicity of the SER expressions used has resulted in simple closed form expression of the SER of N order diversity at Rician fading channel. Our expressions contain only exponential functions. vii Alamouti has presented the well known simple space time transmit diversity (STTD) analysis which has been well received by the scientific community around the world. His work has shown that optimum transmit diversity can be accomplished without the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The results were presented for two transmit antennas over Rayleigh fading channel. The results have been extended to the cases of Nakagami fading channels, and bit error rate analysis was presented for MQAM. However, the results are in the form of Hyper-geometric infinite series. Unfortunately its use leads to numerical un-stability. In this thesis, we have used an approximate expression for the SER of M-QAM over Gaussian channels and obtained a simple closed form expression for the SER for dual branch STTD over Rician channel. On comparing the SER of the exact and the approximate M-QAM scheme under i. i. d Rician fading with STTD, we found that the maximum difference between the two is 0. 8 dB at SER of 10 - 5...|$|R

40|$|An {{architecture}} and a hardware prototype of a flexible trellis modem/codec (FTMC) transmitter are presented. The theory of operation is built upon a pragmatic approach to trellis-coded modulation that emphasizes power and spectral efficiency. The system incorporates programmable modulation formats, variations of trellis-coding, digital baseband pulse-shaping, and digital channel precompensation. The modulation formats examined include (uncoded and coded) binary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (BPSK), quatenary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QPSK), octal <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (8 PSK), 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM), and quadrature quadrature <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (Q squared PSK) at programmable rates up to 20 {{megabits per second}} (Mbps). The FTMC {{is part of the}} developing test bed to quantify modulation and coding concepts...|$|R
40|$|In Digital {{modulation}} {{the message}} signal {{is in the}} digital form and the carrier wave is in sinusoidal form. In this technique the Amplitude, Frequency or Phase of carrier varies according to message (Baseband) signal. There are various type of digital modulation technique like Amplitude <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (ASK), <b>Phase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (PSK), Frequency <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (FSK), Quadature <b>Phase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (QPSK), Differential <b>Phase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (DPSK) and other digital demodulation technique. Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents {{the operation of the}} system over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. So in this paper we will simulate and verify the waveform of modulating wave, carrier wave and modulated wave of Amplitude <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (ASK), <b>Phase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (PSK), Frequency <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> FSK, Quadature <b>Phase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QPSK) ...|$|R
