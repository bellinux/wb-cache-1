30|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether these {{findings}} are generalizable outside the population of <b>clinicians</b> and the domain of mental health. It is possible that <b>clinicians</b> are a special case, because in their intensive initial training and continuing education, <b>clinicians</b> generally learn biological explanations for behavior in abstract form. Much like laypeople, <b>clinicians</b> frequently encounter psychological explanations in their ordinary concrete interactions, and in their training, <b>clinicians</b> are exposed to psychological evaluations of individual case studies in clinical practice and through client case formulations (Eells, Kendjelic, & Lucas, 1998). Importantly, however, <b>clinicians</b> are also exposed throughout their training to biological explanations through more abstract discussions in textbooks and research articles (e.g. describing new evidence for the neurochemical bases of schizophrenia). By contrast, laypeople {{have a great deal of}} concrete experience with psychological explanation, but compared to <b>clinicians,</b> they typically have far less exposure to abstract discussions of biological explanation. One might therefore predict that laypeople would not show the effect observed among trained <b>clinicians.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: An {{estimated}} 1. 2 million Americans have indications {{for using}} antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV acquisition. For {{many of these}} at-risk individuals, the best opportunity to learn about and receive PrEP will be during routine visits to their generalist primary care <b>clinicians.</b> However, few generalist <b>clinicians</b> have prescribed PrEP, primarily because of practical concerns about providing PrEP in primary care settings. The experiences of specialized primary care <b>clinicians</b> who have prescribed PrEP can inform the feasibility of PrEP provision by generalists. Methods: During January to February 2015, 35 primary care <b>clinicians</b> at a community health centre in Boston that specializes {{in the care of}} sexual and gender minorities completed anonymous surveys about their experiences and practices with PrEP provision. Responses were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results and discussion: Thirty-two <b>clinicians</b> (response rate= 91 %) completed the surveys. Nearly all <b>clinicians</b> (97 %) had prescribed PrEP (median 20 patients, interquartile range 11 – 33). Most <b>clinicians</b> reported testing and risk-reduction counselling practices concordant with U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for PrEP. <b>Clinicians</b> indicated that patients using PrEP experienced medication toxicities infrequently and generally reported high adherence. However, some clinicians’ practices differed from guideline recommendations, and some <b>clinicians</b> observed patients with increased risk behaviours. Most <b>clinicians</b> (79 %) rated PrEP provision as easy to accomplish, and 97 % considered themselves likely to prescribe PrEP in the future. Conclusions: In a primary care clinic with specialized expertise in HIV prevention, <b>clinicians</b> perceived that PrEP provision to large numbers of patients was safe, feasible and potentially effective. Efforts to engage generalist primary care <b>clinicians</b> in PrEP provision could facilitate scale-up of this efficacious intervention...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American <b>clinician</b> Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options.

As insight is on a continuum, the <b>clinician</b> should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

40|$|Background: People {{with mental}} {{disorders}} experience difficulties with finding competitive jobs. In countries with longer psychiatric hospitalization periods, the vocational rehabilitation process can start during hospitalization. Yet, rehabilitation can be hindered {{by a lack}} of focus by <b>clinicians</b> on the patients’ vocational goals and a lack of agreement between <b>clinicians</b> and patients. Aims: To compare (i) vocational goals, (ii) barriers to employment and (iii) support needed to overcome barriers faced by patients. Method: The paired data-set comprised 733 hospitalized patients and their 279 <b>clinicians.</b> Patients selected their vocational goals and <b>clinicians</b> indicated options that seemed realistic. Patients and <b>clinicians</b> indicated how many barriers exist and what support is needed to overcome barriers. Results: Almost 45 % of patients prefer competitive jobs, while 32 % of <b>clinicians</b> find this realistic, indicating a moderate relationship between patients’ goals and clinicians’ perceptions. Patients and <b>clinicians</b> also differ in their perception of the level of barriers and types of support to overcome them. Patients perceive fewer vocational barriers than <b>clinicians</b> and prefer less intense vocational support options. Conclusions: Patients and <b>clinicians</b> have different perspectives concerning vocational recovery. Improving vocational rehabilitation requires a stronger alignment between patients and clinicians’ vocational goals and barriers.

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a <b>clinician</b> in {{deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the <b>clinician,</b> usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases.

40|$|This study investigated: clinicians’ {{perspectives}} {{of the scope of}} self-management, which self-management support initiatives are used, and the factors <b>clinicians</b> consider when deciding which initiative to use with individual patients. Three phases of data collection were used. First, <b>clinicians</b> were interviewed about their attitudes toward self-management (n = 14).

40|$|Previous results (Houghtaling, Merritt, Witt, Burns 2 ̆ 6 Kost, 1994) found <b>clinicians</b> did not assign antisocial {{personality}} disorder diagnoses very accurately when given case history information, especially for female clients. In the present study, both a case history and an MMPI {{profile of a}} fictional client, were given to <b>clinicians</b> of both genders. Client gender, assessment condition, and presentation order were manipulated. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether adding assessment information would allow <b>clinicians</b> to use a more statistical approach to boost diagnostic accuracy, and whether it would reduce the inaccuracy associated with female clients. The case history met antisocial diagnostic criteria, and had sub-clinical borderline personality disorder presence. The MMPI was a 4 - 9 profile, typical of {{antisocial personality}} disorder (Greene, 1991). Half of subjects received the case history first, while half received the MMPI first. They then made a tentative diagnosis. Each was then given the supplemental information, and asked to make final diagnoses. Results were analyzed at both stringent categorical-levels (where the full-clinical diagnosis criteria were met), and less-stringent dimensional-levels (where both full-clinical presence and sub-clinical presence constituted the dependent variable). As predicted, <b>clinicians</b> generally were more accurate when they had only the MMPI profile, than with only case history information. However, final diagnoses did not differ between the two conditions; i. e., <b>clinicians</b> were equally accurate after examining both pieces of information. Client gender differences typically were non-significant. A three-way interaction for the dimensional-level, tentative diagnosis analysis, found that female <b>clinicians</b> were more accurate with female clients in the MMPI-first, but not case history-first, condition; male <b>clinicians</b> were more accurate with male than female clients, in the MMPI-first condition. Findings suggest <b>clinicians</b> used theoretical prototypes, sometimes erroneously including male gender as a prototype of antisocial disorder. Implications are: <b>clinicians</b> are able to incorporate probabalistic information; <b>clinicians</b> should use assessment information in formulating diagnoses; and <b>clinicians</b> should be careful to examine information that may not fit their theoretical prototypes. Additionally, both researchers and <b>clinicians</b> would likely benefit incorporating a dimensional approach to diagnosis. ...|$|R
