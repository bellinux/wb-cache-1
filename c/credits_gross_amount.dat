40|$|The paper {{estimates}} <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows for the U.

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows, the paper studies the cyclical behavior of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net <b>credit,</b> <b>gross</b> flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger than GDP volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit expansion. Furthermore, the behavior of gross flows over the 1991 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The results lends some support to aggregate models that emphasize the asymmetric behavior of credit expansion and credit contractions. Address...|$|R
