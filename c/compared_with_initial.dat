40|$|OBJECTIVE: There {{have not}} been {{adequate}} studies of the safety of pneumococcal revaccination, especially for revaccination at intervals of less than five years. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess revaccination safety by determining whether pneumococcal revaccination is associated with greater utilization of postvaccination health care, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> vaccination. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 119, 990 New York State Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older who received pneumococcal vaccinations from February 1, 1999, through December 17, 1999. The study used a multivariate regression model with three primary outcome measures-emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and office visits during the two weeks postvaccination. Secondary outcome measures were specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) codes potentially related to adverse vaccine reactions. RESULTS: Of 119, 990 patients, 23, 663 had previous claims for pneumococcal vaccination, including 13, 466 for whom the revaccination interval was less than five years. After adjustment for demographic and comorbidity factors, revaccination at less than five years was associated with higher rates of emergency room visits (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02, 1. 34) and office visits (OR = 1. 13; 95 % CI 1. 09, 1. 18) during the two-weeks postvaccination, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> vaccination. In addition, several ICD- 9 -CM codes that might indicate vaccine reactions were recorded more frequently for the revaccination group than for the comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: Because of potential policy implications, further investigation is needed of the causes and consequences of short-interval revaccination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper’s {{focus is}} in {{reducing}} the torque ripple and increasing the average torque by optimizing switching angles of 8 / 6 switched reluctance motor while implementing a robust speed controller in the outer loop. The mathematical model of the machine is developed and it is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. An objective function and constraints are formulated and Optimum turn-on and turn-off angles are determined using Particle swarm optimization and Genetic Algorithm techniques. The novelty of this paper lies in implementing sliding mode speed controller with optimized angles. The results from both the optimization techniques are then <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> angles {{with one of them}} clearly being the better option.

40|$|Axons and {{dendrites}} {{can withstand}} acute mechanical strain despite their small diameter. In this study, we demonstrate that β-spectrin {{is required for}} the physical integrity of neuronal processes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Axons in β-spectrin mutants spontaneously break. Breakage is caused by acute strain generated by movement because breakage can be prevented by paralyzing the mutant animals. After breaking, the neuron attempts to regenerate by initiating a new growth cone; this second round of axon extension is error prone <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> outgrowth. Because spectrin is a major target of calpain proteolysis, it is possible that some neurodegenerative disorders may involve the cleavage of spectrin followed by the breakage of neural processes...|$|E

40|$|Rationale The MARAN (Macular Relocation in Age-related Neovascular disease) {{trial was}} planned {{to assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of full macular relocation (MR) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design Randomised, prospective, controlled clinical trial. Methods Patients suffering from visual loss because of AMD were randomised to either surgery or a control group receiving standard treatment (observation or photodynamic therapy (PDT)). The primary end point was the change of visual acuity (VA) (ETDRS) 52 weeks after randomisation <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> VA, and secondary end points included reading performance, contrast sensitivity, stability of fixation, eye-specific quality of life, and the absolute number of letters read correctly at 52 weeks <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>initial</b> examination. Results Owing to early determination, only 28 patients {{were included in the}} study. The study did not show a {{difference between the two groups}} with respect to the final visual result or any of the secondary outcomes measured. The study was limited by the low recruitment that was, at least in part, attributed to the inherent risks for those patients randomised to the surgical arm of the study as well as to the emerging new treatments for AMD. Conclusion The results of the MARAN trial failed to recruit a sufficient number of patients and a superiority of surgery over observation or PDT in patients with exudative AMD was not shown. There was a trend that the reading function was superior after surgery. In the light of the new pharmacological treatments, surgical options such as MR will be an option for only selected cases. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
