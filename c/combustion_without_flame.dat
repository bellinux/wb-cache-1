40|$|Droplet {{combustion}} experiments {{performed on}} board the International Space Station have shown that normal-alkane fuels with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) chemistry can support quasi-steady, low-temperature <b>combustion</b> <b>without</b> any visible <b>flame.</b> Here we review the results for n-decane, n-heptane, and n-octane droplets burning in carbon dioxidehelium diluted environments at different pressures and initial droplet sizes. Experimental results for cool-flame burning rates, flame standoff ratios, and extinction diameters are compared against simplified theoretical models of the phenomenon. A simplified quasi-steady model based on the partial-burning regime of Lin predicts the burning rate, and flame standoff ratio reasonably well for all three normal alkanes. The second-stage cool-flame burning and extinction following the first-stage hot-flame combustion, however, shows a small dependence on the initial droplet size, thus deviating from the quasi-steady results. An asymptotic model that estimates the oxygen depletion by the hot flame and its influence on cool-flame burning rates is shown to correct the quasi-steady results and provide a better comparison with the measured burning-rate results.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is an {{alternative}} internal combustion (IC) engine that can provide high efficiencies while producing ultra-low nitrous oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions compared to existing compression ignition (CI) and spark ignition (SI) engines. HCCI engines operate {{on the principle of}} having a dilute, premixed charge that reacts and burns volumetrically throughout the cylinder as it is compressed by the piston. The large amounts of charge dilution also dramatically reduce the peak burned gas temperatures resulting in low NOx emissions. Since there is no fuel-rich diffusion burning taking place, the PM emissions are at near zero levels. In theory, HCCI combustion can be achieved with any fuel that evaporates readily and autoignite under the conditions typically found in an internal combustion engine. In some regards, HCCI incorporates the best features of both SI and CI engine. As in a SI engine, the charge is well mixed, which minimises particulate emissions and as in a CI engine, the charge is compression ignited and has no throttling losses, which leads to high thermal efficiencies. However, unlike either of these conventional engines, the combustion occurs simultaneously throughout the <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>without</b> a <b>flame</b> front, eliminating the flammability limits associated with SI combustion. The HCCI engine can provide efficiencies as high as compression ignition engines while generating extremely low NOx emissions, as low as 1 - 5 % tailpipe NOx of a conventional SI engine...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} how to optimize parameters {{in order to}} maximize the amount of coaxial air that can be provided to a nonpremixed jet <b>flame</b> <b>without</b> causing the <b>flame</b> to blow out. Maximizing the coaxial air velocity is important in the effort to reduce the flame length and the oxides of nitrogen emitted from gas turbines and industrial burners, a majority of which use coaxial air. Previous measurements by the latter two authors have shown that a sixfold reduction in the NO x emission index of a jet flame is possible if sufficient coaxial air can be provided <b>without</b> blowing the <b>flame</b> out. The coaxial air shortens the flame and forces the reaction zone to overlap regions of higher gas velocity, which reduces the residence time for NO x formation. The present work concentrates on demonstrating ways to prevent flame blowout when the following two constraints are imposed: (1) the coaxial air velocities must be sufficient o shorten the flame to a specified length (in order to reduce NO x emissions) and (2) the coaxial air flow rate must be sufficient o complete <b>combustion</b> <b>without</b> he need for ambient air, which is a common practical constraint. The zero swirl case is considered first, and the effects of adding swirl are measured and directly compared. The following were systematically varied: fuel velocity, air velocity, fuel tube diameter, air tube diameter, fuel type, and swirl number. Measurements demonstrate that coaxial air alone (with zero swirl) can cause up to a twofold reduction in flame length. However, the flame is stable only if the velocity-to-diameter ratio of the fuel jet does not exceed a critica...|$|R

40|$|Colorless {{distributed}} combustion (CDC) {{has been}} demonstrated to provide ultra-low emission of NOx and CO, improved pattern factor and reduced combustion noise in high intensity gas turbine combustors. The key feature to achieve CDC is the controlled flow distribution, reduce ignition delay, and high speed injection of air and fuel jets and their controlled mixing to promote distributed reaction zone in the entire <b>combustion</b> volume <b>without</b> any <b>flame</b> stabilizer. Large gas recirculation and high turbulent mixing rates are desirable to achieve distributed reactions thus avoiding hot spot zones in the flame. The high temperature air combustion (HiTAC) technology has been successfully demonstrated in industrial furnaces which inherently possess low heat release intensity. However, gas turbine combustors operate at high heat release intensity and this result in many challenges for combustor design, which include lower residence time, high flow velocity and difficulty to contain the flame within a given volume. The focus here is on colorless distributed combustion for stationary gas turbine applications. In {{the first part of}} investigation effect of fuel injection diameter and air injection diameter is investigated in detail to elucidate the effect fuel/air mixing and gas recirculation on characteristics of CDC at relatively lower heat release intensity of 5 Â MW/m 3 Â atm. Based on favorable conditions at lower heat release intensity the effect of confinement size (reduction in combustor volume at same heat load) is investigated to examine heat release intensity up to 40 Â MW/m 3 Â atm. Three confinement sizes with same length and different diameters resulting in heat release intensity of 20 Â MW/m 3 Â atm, 30 Â MW/m 3 Â atm and 40 Â MW/m 3 Â atm have been investigated. Both non-premixed and premixed modes were examined for the range of heat release intensities. The heat load for the combustor was 25 Â kW with methane fuel. The air and fuel injection temperature was at normal 300 Â K. The combustor was operated at 1 Â atm pressure. The results were evaluated for flow field, fuel/air mixing and gas recirculation from numerical simulations and global flame images, and emissions of NO, CO from experiments. It was observed that the larger air injection diameter resulted in significantly higher levels of NO and CO whereas increase in fuel injection diameter had minimal effect on the NO and resulted in small increase of CO emissions. Increase in heat release intensity had minimal effect on NO emissions, however it resulted in significantly higher CO emissions. The premixed combustion mode resulted in ultra-low NO levels (Colorless distributed combustion Distributed combustion Towards zero emission combustion Diffusion and premixed combustion Gas turbine combustion Performance improvement of gas turbine combustion...|$|R
40|$|Fuel cell is an {{electrochemical}} device that converts the chemical energy of fuel directly into {{electricity and heat}} <b>without</b> <b>combustion</b> with <b>flame.</b> The range of potential applications is from small-scale portable electronics to transportation and large-scale power production. An interesting approach for small-scale applications are free-breathing fuel cells, i. e. cells that take the oxygen needed in the reactions passively from ambient air. This thesis concentrates on performance limitations caused {{by the use of}} passive air supply in small-scale polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and aims to find solutions for these limitations. A conventional free-breathing PEMFC with vertical cathode channels was studied with a current distribution measurement system at different cell temperatures and ambient conditions. In addition, different overpotential distributions were determined with a flow pulse method, and a mass transport model for the cathode side of the cell was developed. The results showed that with this kind of a cell design, the main limiting factor is the mass transfer in the cathode channels. In order to enhance the air flow and thus to improve mass transfer, there should be a high temperature difference between the cell and ambient air. High cell temperature would also decrease liquid water saturation, which would be beneficial since it causes additional mass transfer limitations. The mass transfer limitations can also be reduced with wider channels. However, wide channels require a rigid gas diffusion backing in order to offer adequate support for the membrane. A potential mechanically rigid material, titanium sinter, was introduced in the thesis. Another possible solution for reduction of mass transfer limitations is a so-called planar free-breathing cell design in which there is more effective area for cathode side mass transfer than in traditional design. This cell design was introduced and its performance with different cathode structures was studied in the thesis. The results with certain cathode structure showed very high power densities for a free-breathing fuel cell. According to the results achieved in this thesis, it seems that free-breathing PEMFCs are a very potential power source for small-scale applications such as consumer electronics. As an outcome of this thesis the performance limitations of free-breathing PEMFCs are better known, and possible solutions for them are introduced. reviewe...|$|R
