5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{negative}} differential resistance devices, so as more current flows through them, the electrical {{resistance of the}} fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more current to flow. Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> through the lamp.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} diodes, <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> easily from p-type to n-type material.However, no <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> and no light is emitted if a small voltage is {{applied in the}} reverse direction. If the reverse voltage grows large enough to exceed the {{breakdown}} voltage, a large <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> and the LED may be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful noise diode.|$|R
50|$|Two {{variants}} of GMR {{have been applied}} in devices: (1) current-in-plane (CIP), where the electric <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> parallel to the layers and (2) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP), where the electric <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> in a direction perpendicular to the layers.|$|R
25|$|Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) {{have the}} optical cavity axis along the {{direction}} of <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> rather than perpendicular to the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> as in conventional laser diodes. The active region length is very short compared with the lateral dimensions so that the radiation emerges {{from the surface of}} the cavity rather than from its edge as shown in the figure. The reflectors at the ends of the cavity are dielectric mirrors made from alternating high and low refractive index quarter-wave thick multilayer.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} PN junction blocks reverse <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> This {{means that}} unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> is needed, an additional diode (called a freewheeling diode) {{is placed in}} parallel (actually anti-parallel) with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn't overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.|$|E

30|$|The {{bottom panel}} of Fig.  2 shows the current density, that is, the {{electric}} current per unit area. The westward <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> {{in the outer}} region, and the eastward one flows in the inner region. The current density also shows the asymmetric distribution during the main phase, {{which is consistent with}} the observation (Le et al. 2004). Because of the dipolar geometry, the cross-sectional area of the outer region where the westward <b>current</b> <b>flows</b> is larger than the inner region where the eastward <b>current</b> <b>flows.</b> Thus, the net <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> westward is larger than that flowing eastward (Ebihara and Ejiri 2000). The dominance of the net westward current causes the decrease in the geomagnetic field on the ground.|$|R
30|$|Pressure {{gradients}} {{are created}} in the magnetosphere which induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> orthogonally to the magnetic field. These pressure gradients are mainly due to the ions, because their pressure {{is larger than the}} one of the electrons. The divergence of these orthogonal electric currents generates electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> along the magnetic field lines, the so-called field-aligned currents. They close in the ionosphere and induce electric <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> horizontally in the ionosphere. They correspond to a second coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.|$|R

25|$|During {{discharging}} {{the internal}} {{construction of the}} capacitor reverses the internal polarity. The cathode (-) gets an anode (+), and changes the <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> direction. Two voltages arise over these electrode. In principle the voltage distribution over both electrodes behaves as the reciprocally CV product of each electrode.|$|E
50|$|The {{proximity}} effect is {{result of a}} changing magnetic field which influences the distribution of an electric <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> within an electrical conductor due to electromagnetic induction. When an alternating <b>current</b> (AC) <b>flows</b> through an isolated conductor, it creates an associated alternating magnetic field around it. The alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in adjacent conductors, altering the overall distribution of <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> through them.|$|R

50|$|Any node of {{a circuit}} that is {{available}} for connection to an external circuit is called a pole (or terminal {{if it is a}} physical object). The port condition is that a pair of poles of a circuit is considered a port if and only if the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> into one pole from outside the circuit is equal to the <b>current</b> <b>flowing</b> out of the other pole into the external circuit. Equivalently, the algebraic sum of the <b>currents</b> <b>flowing</b> into the two poles from the external circuit must be zero.|$|R

25|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} of engineering future nanoscale transistors is the design of gates.

25|$|The back-emf is {{the source}} of the {{opposition}} to <b>current</b> <b>flow.</b> A constant direct current has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a short-circuit (it is typically made from a material with a low resistivity). An alternating current has a time-averaged rate-of-change that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.|$|E

25|$|As an {{inrush current}} limiter device in power supply circuits, they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> during normal operation.

25|$|If an {{external}} voltage is placed across the diode {{with the same}} polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues {{to act as an}} insulator, preventing any significant electric <b>current</b> <b>flow</b> (unless electron–hole pairs are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see photodiode).
