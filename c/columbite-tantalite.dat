Coltan, the industrial name for a <b>columbite–tantalite</b> mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire).

Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small.

40|$|The Separation Lake area is host to {{the most}} {{important}} rare-element pegmatites in Ontario, Canada. They include the Big Whopper and Big Mack petalite pegmatite systems which potentially represent the world's second largest lithium deposit of this type. The pegmatites occur in two distinct clusters adjacent to the Separation Rapids pluton which {{is thought to be}} the source of the rare-elements. Beryl-type and complex-, petalite-subtype pegmatites are the most common and a few pegmatites have characteristics similar to the lepidolite-subtype.

This example of the rare-element class of granitic pegmatites hosts both beryl- and petalite-subtype pegmatites. <b>Columbite-tantalite</b> and cassiterite are the predominant oxide species. On the basis of <b>columbite-tantalite</b> compositions, the pegmatites have been divided into an Fe-suite and a Mn-suite. Both beryl and petalite pegmatites occur in each suite.

The first group occurred during a compres-sive deformation phase D 1 about 582 Ma and 550 ˚C- 700 ˚C and 4 - 5 kb. The second pegmatites group was formed during the decompression phase D 2 (520 - 500 Ma) of the Brasiliano metamorphic rock fusion. The geochemical pa-rameters of the P-Li-Be bearing pegmatites of the first group show the same trend fractionation, as suggested by the mineralogical composition.

The pegmatites of the Gatumba area (western Rwanda) have historically been mined for their <b>columbite-tantalite</b> and cassiterite mineralisation, but contain also beryl, apatite, spodumene, amblygonite, and rare phosphates. <b>Columbite-tantalite</b> formed during the crystallisation of the pegmatites, followed by intense alkali metasomatism, i. e. widespread growth of albite and white mica. The major part of the cassiterite mineralisation is, however, concentrated in zones associated with intense phyllic alteration. U–Pb ages of <b>columbite-tantalite</b> samples vary between ∼ 975 Ma and ∼ 930 Ma. The oldest ages (975 + 8. 2 /− 8. 3 Ma and 966 + 8. 7 /− 8. 6 Ma) overlap with previous reported Rb–Sr ages of the emplacement of the pegmatites (∼ 965 Ma) and are interpreted to reflect the crystallisation of the Nb–Ta mineralisation. The youngest ages (951 ± 15 Ma to 936 ± 14 Ma) are apparently related to variable degrees of resetting by (metasomatic) post-crystallisation processes. The resetting could either be due to recrystallisation of early Nb–Ta minerals or due to the disturbance of the U–Pb isotopic signature of the Nb–Ta minerals. The 40 Ar– 39 Ar spectra of muscovite samples associated with different steps in the paragenesis of the pegmatites show a spread of apparent ages between ∼ 940 Ma and ∼ 560 Ma that reflect Late Neoproterozoic tectonothermal events.

About 130 different minerals contain tantalum and niobium, of which only about 80 {{are found in}} economical deposits. The remainder contains Nb and Ta as impurities. The most commercialised source of Nb and Ta is a <b>columbite-tantalite</b> ore {{often referred to as}} coltan containing pyrochlorite.

Conventional TIMS analyses of these <b>columbite-tantalite</b> crystals produce scattered data and reverse discordance even after HF leaching of the grains prior to dissolution, possibly reflecting the incomplete removal of the open-system metamict segments during sample preparation. LA-MC-ICP-MS analyses of unleached, primary columbite free from inclusions and alteration give consistent and precise (< 0. 5 %) Pb-Pb ages, demonstrating the utility of this approach. However, normal and reverse discordance is also observed in U-Pb data from LA-MC-ICP-MS analyses. This discordance represents either U-Pb mobilisation during recent weathering, sample preparation and/or an analytical artefact originating from variable elemental fractionation between U and Pb during ablation and ionisation that itself may have its origin in the contrasting metamictization of the dated columbite and the monazite standard used. Best age estimates of columbite from pegmatites in the Superior Province are; 2670 ± 5 Ma for the Pakeagama Lake pegmatite, 2644 ± 7 Ma for the Separation Rapids group, and 2665 ± 8 Ma for the Mavis Lake group.

Mn/(Mn + Fe) largely decreased, by as much as 0. 40, by introduction of Fe from the host hornblende gneisi; Mg and Ti also were enriched. During the second metamorphic stage ' the Tal(Ta + |r{!) value of columbite-tintalite wis locally further homogenized, but Mn/(Mn + Fe) did not change. Fersmite and microlite were almost completely obliterated. Significant ordering of the originally intermediate structural slate of <b>columbite-tantalite</b> was piomoted during metamorphic recrystallization. This study documents extensiv...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{tourmaline}} group minerals (schorl to elbaite) typically {{occur in}} the Li-bearing pegmatites from the São José da Safira region (the Oriental Pegmatitic Province (OPP) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil). The Fe/Mn ratios of the tourmalines are compared to those measured in <b>columbite-tantalite</b> and garnet and decrease northward continuously from the beryl-bearing pegmatites to the spodumene-bearing ones. The Fe/Mn ratio {{has been used as}} a qualitative index of fractionation which seems to reflect the regional zoning of the pegmatites around a hidden granite body. The Fe/Mn ratio values correlate negatively with the Na and Li contents. The REE, Nb, Co and Zn contents are controlled by the mineral assemblages...|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} studies are Gaafar et al. (2006), {{who studied the}} gamma ray spectrometry of a promising vein type uranium mineralization associated with El Sela granite, {{and concluded that the}} detailed ground gamma ray spectrometric survey on Sela shear zone clearly reflects the outline of this zone, where the sheared lamprophyre dyke of this zone show sharp increase of the eU contents and Aly and Lentz (2011), they studied the mineralogy, geochemistry and age dating of shear zone-hosted Nb-Ta-, Zr-Hf-, Th and U-bearing granitic rocks in the Ghadir and El-Sella areas, South Eastern Desert, Egypt. They concluded that the rare metal minerals of mineralized altered granites within El-Sella shear zones are <b>columbite-tantalite</b> minerals as ferrocolumbite, pyrochlore, and fergusonite, Th-minerals (cheralite, uranothorite, and huttonite monazite), Hf-zircon, monazite and xenotime.|$|E
40|$|The Central African Mesoproterozoic Kibara belt in Katanga (DRCongo) forms a metallogenic {{province}} that hosts {{a variety}} of granite-related mineralization, rich in cassiterite, <b>columbite–tantalite,</b> wolframite/ferberite, spodumene and beryl. This mineralization is mainly present in pegmatites and quartz veins that {{are thought to be}} associated with the youngest granite generation in the Kibara belt (i. e., so-called “E-group” granite generation). Manono-Kitotolo is one of the world's largest Sn, Nb–Ta and Li mineralized pegmatites, with a large resource of spodumene, <b>columbite–tantalite</b> and cassiterite still remaining. Mineralized pegmatites have intruded along the foliation in the Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks and dolerites of the Manono-Kitotolo area. The pegmatites have been emplaced very late during the climax of the Kibaran orogeny, probably during the transition from orogenic collapse to extensional tectonics, based on their structural position. The emplacement of the pegmatites resulted in an intense alteration of the doleritic and metasedimentary host-rocks, resulting in muscovitization, tourmalinization and silicification. A mineralogical and geochemical zonation typical for granitic pegmatites has been identified that was affected by metasomatic/hydrothermal alteration, mainly albitization and greisenization. The latter alteration is associated with the main phase of cassiterite mineralization. A first stage with Nb–Ta, Li and minor Sn, however, already formed pre-alteration, directly associated with pegmatite crystallization. 40 Ar– 39 Ar muscovite dating of unaltered pegmatites resulted in ages of 938. 8  ±  5. 1  Ma and 934. 0  ±  5. 9  Ma. These ages are overlapping with the U–Pb age of the Nb–Ta mineralization (940  ±  5. 1  Ma), also giving new temporal constraints on the fertile E-group granite generation in the KIB. The 40 Ar– 39 Ar muscovite age of a mineralized greisen is 923. 3  ±  8. 3  Ma, which is younger but still partly within error of the 40 Ar– 39 Ar ages of the unaltered pegmatites. Based on the partial overlap in age, but also on field and paragenetic relationships and the stable isotope composition of the fluids, this greisenization and associated cassiterite mineralization can still be linked to the pegmatite crystallization...|$|E
40|$|The quartz veins {{containing}} scheelite from Fonte Santa mine {{area were}} exploited for W between 1942 and 1982. At {{the end of}} November 2006, a flood event damaged the dam land of Fonte Santa mine and metal content of water increased. Fonte Santa mine area cuts the quartzites close to the Fonte Santa muscovite granite. The granite contains quartz, microcline, albite, muscovite, chlorite, <b>columbite-tantalite,</b> volframite, W-ixiolite and ilmenite. The quartz veins contain muscovite, chlorite, tourmaline, scheelite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, arsenopyrite, magnetite, jarosite, phosphates of Pb, Fe and AI. The waters related to the Fonte Santa mine are poorly mineralized, with electrical conductivity < 965 ~S / cm, of mixed type or HCO 3 - and SO 42 - types. These waters have Fe and Mn contents that forbid to use that for human consumption and agriculture.
