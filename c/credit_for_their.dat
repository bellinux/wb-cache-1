5|$|In his own 2003 thesis, Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond {{said the}} 2nd Ranger Company's {{performance}} in Korea had been exemplary, {{in spite of}} racial discrimination against it. The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> actions in Korea, noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also said many of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> performance and told the reporters that he had a feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E

He was evidently ransomed or released as he was killed, along with Muiredach mac Riain of Uí Cheinnselaig of south Leinster, fighting against the Dubliners in 978 at Belan (County Kildare). Úgaire's successor Domnall Claen was little more fortunate, being captured by the Dubliners the following year.|$|E

[...] The reasons for their conflict were both personal (both men married dancer Jeanne Coyne) and professional (Donen always felt that Kelly did not treat him as an equal). They disagreed over who deserved more <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> joint projects: three films as co-directors and four as co-choreographers.|$|E
