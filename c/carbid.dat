40|$|Within the {{presented}} project {{investigations of}} <b>carbid</b> coatings on precision parts for textile needles, plotter tops and car chain parts are reported. The <b>carbid</b> coatings are developed on {{basis of the}} arc-ionplating pvd-process. The coatings are deposited either in one thermodynamical phase or heterogenous two phase system. The nanodispers high carbon-metal <b>carbid</b> resulted as an effective coating system against wear: on the car chain system best fitted hardness of the layer is below 2000 HVO. 01 and the hardness of the plotter tops must be higher than 3000 HVO. 01 to guarantee an effective resistance against abrasion wear.

40|$|International audienceThe {{macroscopic}} elastic {{properties of}} two composites (Duralumin/air and Duralumin/tungsten carbide (WC)) have been calculated using periodical homogenisation methods and the elastic properties of each phase (measured by high frequency acoustic microscopy). In order {{to check the}} validity of such an approach, acoustical resonant spectroscopy has also been applied. Thanks to the comparison between the resonant frequencies predicted and measured, two major conclusions have been obtained: the homogenisation method is very accurate for the composite Duralumin/air, {{but not for the}} Duralumin/WC sample: the experimental results are not in very good agreement with the simulation. This result can be then explained by the major role of interfacial state between Duralumin and tungsten <b>carbid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{solid-state}} microwave annealing {{was performed}} {{for the first}} time on N+-, Al+-, and B+-implanted SiC, and the results were compared with the conven-tional furnace annealing. For microwave annealing, temperatures up to 2, 000 C were attained with heating rates exceeding 600 C/s. An 1, 850 C/ 35 s microwave anneal yielded a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 2 nm, which is lower than the 6 nm obtained for 1, 500 C/ 15 min conventional furnace annealing. For the Al implants, a minimum room-temperature sheet resistance (Rs) of 7 kW/h was measured upon microwave annealing. For the microwave annealing, Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements indi-cated a better structural quality, and secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry (SIMS) boron implant depth profiles showed reduced boron redistribution compared to the corresponding results of the furnace annealing.

40|$|Methods for {{selectively}} forming {{titanium silicide}} and titanium boride by vapor phase reaction of titanium chloride precursors with silicon or boron substrate surfaces are examined. By passing TIC 14 through aheated chamber packed with titanium metal turnings within the reactor tube, a reduced titanium halide is generated. It {{was found that}} the silicide or boride formation in the reactor can thus be controlled ata much lower temperature. Also, excessive silicon erosion nor-mally encountered at the higher operating temperature (> 775 ~ required for the direct TiCt 4 reaction is minimized. Char-acterization of the resulting films was conducted by use of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, sheet resist-ance measurements, and x-ray diffraction. Some refractory metal silicides, <b>carbid.</b> es, nitrides, and borides are known for their metal-like low resistivity and their high-temperature stability.

40|$|Multiple high {{temperature}} liquid cooled power converters {{are being developed}} for use in future military applications under several TARDEC funded efforts. All of these converters utilize multiple silicon carbide devices packaged into larger modules. This paper presents performance (volume, mass, efficiency, etc) and test results for four different converters where the inlet coolant temperatures range up to 100 C. The first converter provides 28 Volt isolated power at 30 kW from a nominal 300 volt DC bus. The second converter provides isolated exportable (AC) power at 30 kW from a nominal 300 volt DC bus. The exportable power converter provides 50 or 60 Hz power at 120 Volts as well as either single phase 240 Volts or three phase 208 Volts. The third converter is a simple motor drive inverter rated for operation from a 650 V DC bus and rated to continuously provide over 90 Arms with intermittent higher power levels. The fourth converter is a 180 kW, bi-directional, non-isolated 300 to 600 volt converter typically described as a ‘battery to bus converter’.

40|$|Nanometric <b>Carbid</b> Silicon (SiC) {{supported}} monometallic and bimetallic catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni {{transition metals}} were prepared by wet impregnation method. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized over the prepared catalysts from catalytic decomposition of acetylene at 850 °C by thermal {{chemical vapor deposition}} (TCVD) technique. The synthesized nanomaterials (catalysts and CNTs) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. In this paper, using of nanometric SiC powder as catalyst support was examined {{and the effect of}} applied catalyst type on characteristics of grown CNTs was investigated. The results revealed that iron, cobalt and nickel are in oxide, cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4) and nickel ferrite (NiFe 2 O 4) forms and nanometric SiC powder can be applied as an appropriate catalyst support in CNT growth process. It was observed that the produced CNTs on bimetallic Fe-Co possess smaller average diameter, less amorphous carbon and denser morphology compared to other binary metallic combinations. It was found that the catalytic activity of bimetallic composition decreased in the order of Fe-Co> Fe-Ni> Co-Ni. Furthermore, the monometallic Fe catalyst has the most catalytic activity compared to monometallic Co and Ni catalysts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Iron {{carbides}} containing from 31 to 17 atomic % carbon, with cohenite XRD {{structure and}} optical properties, were grown in experiments in Fe-Ni-S-C, Fe-Ni-C, and in Fe-C at 1, 6, and 7 GPa. X-ray cell volumes increase with C content. Compositions listed above vary considerably outside the nominal (Fe,Ni) 3 C stoichiometry of cohenite/cementite. Cohenites coexisting with Fe-C liquid are carbon-poor. The Eckstrom-Adcock carbide, nominally Fe 7 C 3, {{was found to}} show compositions from 29 to 36 atomic % C at 7 GPa in Fe-C. Both these materials are better regarded as solutions than as stoichiometric compounds, and their properties such as volume have compositional dependencies, as do the iron oxides, sulfides, silicides, and hydrides. The fraction of C dissolved in cohenite-saturated alloy is found to become smaller between 1 and 7 GPa. If this trend continues at higher pressures, the deep mantle should be easier to saturate with carbide than the shallow mantle, whether or not carbide is metastable as at ambient pressure. At temperatures below the cohenite-graphite peritectic, cohenite may grow as a compositionally zoned layer between Fe and graphite. The Eckstrom-Adcock <b>carbid...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{flows in}} a conducting rectangular duct with a non-conducting flow channel insert (FCI) {{in a constant}} transverse magnetic field. The computations based on the fully developed flow model are performed for three FCI mod-ifications: (i) without pressure equalization openings, (ii) with the pressure equalization slot (PES) in the FCI wall parallel and (iii) perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. The computed flow patterns and the current circuits in the duct with the FCI are ana-lyzed. The experiments are performed with In-Ga-Sn as a work fluid flowing in an outer rectangular duct made of stainless steel with the FCI made of epoxy for two cases: FCI with the PES, and with the pressure equalization holes (PEH), both made in the FCI wall parallel to the magnetic field. The experiments have confirmed significant reduction of the MHD pressure drop due to the flow insert (larger reduction {{in the case of}} PEH) compared to the non-insulated duct, but the experimental MHD pressure drop is different (larger) than the computed one. This difference is discussed and further modifications of both the flow model and the experiment are suggested. 1. Introduction. A flow channel insert (FCI) [1] made of silicon <b>carbid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} project, {{which started}} in May 2004, is to {{elucidate}} the chemical bonding and interface formation of metal fission products with the coating materials used in state-of-the-art TRISO fuel particles. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} an analysis of intermediate chemical phases at the interface, the intermixing/diffusion behavior, and the electronic interface structure as a function of material choice (metal and coating materials), temperature, and external stress. In detail, this project is devoted to studying the interface formation of Pd, Ag, and Cs with SiC and pyrolytic carbon. Using the TRISO coating materials and single crystal references as substrates, interfaces are prepared under controlled conditions in an ultra high vacuum environment and studied with a variety of different spectroscopic methods. The combination of surface sensitive techniques (e. g., photoelectron spectroscopy) with bulk sensitive methods (e. g., X-ray emission spectroscopy) probes the chemical properties as well as the diffusion behavior in several complementary ways. A variety of surface modification methods is and will be applied ex-situ (e. g., for stressed coating layers) or in-situ (e. g., by ion bombardment or plasma surface treatment) prior to or after the interface formation to study the dependence of the interface properties on thesurface/interface morphology and quality of the coating material.

40|$|Thermal induced gas {{evolution}} studies {{were performed on}} a-C:H-Ta films deposited by a sputtering process using a tantalum target and an argon-hydrocarbon gas mixture. Decreasing hydrocarbon concentration of the plasma atmosphere during the deposition results in an increasing tantal <b>carbid</b> (TaC) volume fraction, perceptible by x-ray diffraction measurements, while the a-C:H volume fraction decreases. Gas evolution spectra, {{similar to those of}} a-C:H and a-Si:C:N:H films, suggesting the presence of an a-C:H matrix with a void network structure. TaC forms precipitations in this matrix. The degree of crosslinking of the carbon atom network of the a-C:H matrix, which increases with an increasing volume fraction of TaC in the films, determines the thermal {{gas evolution}} concerning temperature and amount of hydrocarbons and argon. As shown also by gas effusion measurements, a more crosslinked matrix can also be obtained by reduction of the hydrogen content of the hydrocarbon gas, for instance, by substitution of methane by ethylene. Since the argon effusion temperature does not depend on film thickness, the argon effusion temperature may serve as a material property, which renders the comparison of different a-C:H materials possible, also in two phase systems like a-C:H:metal. The released hydrocarbon molecules were formed during the heating by alkyl group cleavage. Hydrocarbon gas release temperature is found to depend on the volume fraction of TaC, since bonding states of carbon atoms are influenced by the presence of tantalum, as indicated by x-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy...|$|E
