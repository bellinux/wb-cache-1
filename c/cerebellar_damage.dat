Phonological similarity and recency effects did not differ overall between patients and controls, but outlier patients with abnormal phonological similarity effects to either auditory or visual stimuli were found to have damage to hemispheral lobule VIII/VIIB on the left and right, respectively. We postulate that damage to left hemispheral lobule VIII may interfere with encoding of auditory stimuli into the phonological store.

40|$|Background/Aims: Childhood-acquired {{cerebellar}} {{studies to}} date have appeared to present a concordant pattern of specific neuropsychological profiles depending on lesion site. The aim {{was to determine the}} impact of a cerebellar tumour specifically on language function in children by reporting both the general and high-level language abilities of 4 cases with differing sites of hemispheric and vermal involvement. Methods: The language abilities of 4 children (aged from 7 years 9 months to 13 years), treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy for cerebellar tumour 6 months to 3 years previously, were examined. A standardized battery of general and high-level language assessments was administered. Results: Analysis revealed intact abilities across all 4 cases on measures of general language, including receptive language, expressive language, receptive vocabulary and naming. While 2 of the 4 cases also demonstrated intact high-level language skills across all measures, the remaining 2 demonstrated specific deficits in linguistic problem solving at 6 months after treatment. Follow-up assessment of 1 case also demonstrated further decline in this area 12 months later. Conclusion: Findings of high-level language deficits in problem solving in 2 of the 4 cases examined supported previous reports of specific impairments in high-level language and in thinking flexibility and problem solving following <b>cerebellar</b> hemispheric <b>damage</b> in childhood.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundThe {{posterior}} cerebellar lobules {{seem to be}} {{the anatomical}} substrate of cognitive cerebellar processes, but their microstructural alterations in multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unclear. ObjectivesTo correlate diffusion metrics in lobules VI to VIIIb in persons with clinically isolated syn- drome (PwCIS) and in cognitively impaired persons with MS (CIPwMS) with their cognitive performances. MethodsSixty-nine patients (37 PwCIS, 32 CIPwMS) and 36 matched healthy subjects (HS) under- went 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, including 3 D T 1 -weighted and diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated within each lobule and in the cerebellar peduncles. We investigated the correlations between cognitive outcomes and the diffusion parameters of cerebellar sub-structures and performed multiple linear regression analysis to predict cognitive disability. ResultsFA was generally lower and MD was higher in the cerebellum and specifically in the vermis Crus II, lobules VIIb and VIIIb in CIPwMS compared with PwCIS and HS. In hierarchical regression analyses, 31 % of the working memory z score variance was explained by FA in the left lobule VI and in the left superior peduncle. Working memory was also associated with MD in the vermis Crus II. FA in the left lobule VI and right VIIIa predicted part of the information processing speed (IPS) z scores.

Features of this disorder include irregular articulatory breakdowns, distorted vowels, excess and equal stress, prolonged phonemes, and abnormal pitch/loudness variation. However, heterogeneity within this disorder has been documented by clinicians and researchers for decades, suggesting that subgroups of ataxic dysarthria may exist. The {{purpose of this study}} was to extend this line of research to determine a feasible, reliable perceptual method for identifying and differentiating these proposed subgroups. Two hypotheses were tested based on existing theoretical frameworks: (1) speakers be classified into instability/inflexibility (or mixed presentation) subgroups, and/or (2) speakers be classified into subgroups based on differential speech subsystems involvement. Four dysarthria experts listened to speech samples of adults with ataxic dysarthria and completed rating forms of the speech features. Results suggested that five speakers fit the pattern of instability, two speakers aligned with inflexibility, and one speaker had a mixed presentation. Patterns did not emerge according to differential subsystem involvement. The emergence of subgroups has implications for clinical and research practice; additional research is warranted...|$|R
40|$|DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} occurring type of DNA damage arising in a cell and they are repaired by rapid repair pathways collectively termed single-strand break repair (SSBR). Recently several rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorders with mutations in genes associated with SSBR, spinocerebellar ataxia and axonal neuropathy- 1 (SCAN 1), ataxia oculomotor apraxia- 1 (AOA 1) and microcephaly with early onset seizures and developmental delay (MCSZ), have been discovered. A striking aspect that these disorders {{have in common is}} that they are all caused by mutations in end-processing factors. The majority of SSBs that arise via endogenous damage have ‘dirty' termini and require end-processing to restore DNA ends with conventional ‘ligatable' chemistry. Another common feature of these end-processing enzymes is their association with XRCC 1, a scaffolding protein that is a core component of SSBR. Complete loss of XRCC 1 is embryonically lethal and the conditional deletion of XRCC 1 in the developing mouse brain leads to persistent DNA <b>damage,</b> <b>cerebellar</b> interneurons loss and abnormal hippocampal function resulting in behavioural abnormalities such as seizures and episodic epilepsy. Taken together these observations suggest that neural cells are exquisitely sensitive to defects in chromosomal SSBR. In my thesis, I will describe biochemical and cellular data on lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with mutations in the end-processing factors aprataxin (APTX is mutated in AOA 1). I will include data showing that aprataxin is required for the short-patch SSBR of abortive ligation intermediates in vitro and that repair arrests in AOA 1 cell lines due to insufficient levels of non-adenylated DNA ligase.

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{cerebellar}} ataxia, and by extension dyschronometria, is <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage.</b> This can be by form of a trauma, or by disease and genetics. Examples of trauma include a car accident, stroke, epilepsy, and head trauma. These traumas are especially detrimental to elderly and children due to the decrease in brain matter, thus making these events if taken place have an increased risk of damaging the cerebellum. This also explains why dyschronometria is seen more commonly in the elderly due to the deterioration of physical brain matter. Other probable causes for the deterioration of brain matter in the elderly include increased supranational activation, decreased cerebellar activation (which is consistent with fronto-cerebellar dissociation).|$|E
5000|$|Intention tremor, {{also known}} as {{cerebellar}} tremor, is a dyskinetic disorder characterized by a broad, coarse, and low frequency (below 5 Hz) tremor.

An intention tremor is usually perpendicular to the direction of movement. When experiencing an intention tremor, one often overshoots or undershoots their target, a condition known as dysmetria.

40|$|Background: Demyelination and axonal damage are {{critical}} {{processes in the}} pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines elicited by inflammation mediates tissue damage. Methods/Principal Findings: To monitor the demyelination and axonal injury associated with microglia activation we employed a model using cerebellar organotypic cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia activated by LPS released pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNFα), and increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This activation was associated with demyelination and axonal <b>damage</b> in <b>cerebellar</b> cultures. Axonal <b>damage,</b> as revealed {{by the presence of}} non-phosphorylated neurofilaments, mitochondrial accumulation in axonal spheroids, and axonal transection, was associated with stronger iNOS expression and concomitant increases in ROS. Moreover, we analyzed the contribution of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in demyelination and axonal degeneration using the iNOS inhibitor ethyl pyruvate, a free-scavenger and xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, as well as via blockage of pro-inflammatory cytokines using a Fc-TNFR 1 construct. We found that blocking microglia activation with ethyl pyruvate or allopurinol significantly decreased axonal damage, and to a lesser extent, demyelination. Blocking TNFα significantly decreased demyelination but did not prevented axonal damage. Moreover, the most common therapy for MS, interferon-beta, was used as an example of an immunomodulator compound that can be tested in this model. In vitro, interferon-beta treatment decreased oxidative stress (iNOS and ROS levels) and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation, reducing axonal damage. Conclusion: The model of neuroinflammation using cerebellar culture stimulated with endotoxin mimicked myelin and axonal damage mediated by the combination of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This model may both facilitate understanding of the events involved in neuroinflammation and aid in the development of neuroprotective therapies for the treatment of MS and other neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

In Experiment 1, distinctions between discrete and continuous tasks and handedness effects were examined in neurologically healthy adults. Subjects performed repetitive and discrete finger tapping and circle drawing with their dominant and non-dominant limbs. Significant correlations were observed between temporal variability on discrete tapping and discrete drawing and between temporal variability on the discrete tasks and repetitive tapping. Temporal variability on repetitive continuous drawing did not correlate with temporal variability on the other tasks. Additionally, significant correlations were present between temporal variability of the dominant and non-dominant limb within each task. In Experiment 2, underlying impairments on discrete and continuous tasks in performance by subjects with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> were examined. Individuals with unilateral or bilateral <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> and neurologically healthy young and elderly adults performed three tasks: discrete finger tapping, discrete circle drawing, and continuous circle drawing. Increased temporal variability was observed when subjects with unilateral <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> performed the discrete tasks with the impaired limb relative to the unimpaired limb; however, these subjects exhibited no temporal impairment on the continuous drawing task. Additionally, subjects with bilateral <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> were more variable on the discrete tasks relative to control subjects, yet were not more variable on the continuous task.

However, subjects with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> tended to decompose movements, moving one joint at a time when possible. Together, these experiments support the hypothesis of a dichotomy in timing processes. Explicit timing utilizes the cerebellum for representation of the temporal goal.

The postural force used to hold the object is reduced in anticipation of unloading, indicating an accurate prediction of the change in load. We examined patients with unilateral or bilateral <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> as well as two individuals lacking the corpus callosum on the bimanual unloading task. The acallosal patients showed an intact APA, suggesting subcortical integration of motor signals for anticipatory adjustments during bimanual actions.

However, <b>cerebellar</b> <b>damage</b> abolished short-term adaptation of the APA, and the patients were unable to acquire an APA in a similar but previously untrained situation. These results indicate that while over-learned anticipatory adjustments are preserved after cerebellar lesions, adaptation of this response and the acquisition of a novel coordination requires the cerebellum ipsilateral to the postural hand. Furthermore, this structure appears to be essential for the accurate timing of previously learned behaviors.
