[...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2003 The Victorian {{government}} {{has embarked on}} a major initiative to introduce computers (New Learning Technologies) into state education system over the past eight years. This initiative has involved the <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> from the education budget to the purchase of computers for use in schools and has been undertaken on the premise that the use of new learning technologies in schools will enhance student learning. It is the contention of this thesis that {{the manner in which the}} new learning technologies policy has been implemented is at cross purposes with the stated goal of enhancing learning. The thesis will develop this contention through an exploration of the stated goals of four Victorian government reports released in the past seven years. This exploration reveals that key elements in the Victorian government's policy on the use of new learning technologies was centred on a notion that these technologies would support enhanced learning through a constructivist teaching and learning approach. The initiatives that were implemented in response to these policies are reviewed and are found to focus predominantly on the installation of various network and computer technologies but are lacking in the attention they pay to the key teaching and learning issues associated with the stated policy of supporting the initiatives by encouraging a shift to constructivist teaching and learning practices. Constructivism, as a key condition to the realisation of the Victorian government's new learning technology policy, is a far broader concept than is indicated in the descriptions provided in the Victorian government documents referred to in this thesis. The breadth of Constructivism and the philosophical links it has with post-modernist thought are contrasted to the behaviourist practices that still predominate in teaching practice. These philosophical links make change from behaviourist to constructivist strategies more than just a methodological change, being cultural in nature. As such they are harder to make than is indicated in the Victorian government documents, which fail to acknowledge the cultural dimension of the change that they are suggesting. The implementation strategies that have been adopted from these policies also fail to address the requirement for a cultural shift to a more constructivist approach. The failure to address the need for a change in the culture of teaching has meant that school based cultural issues continue to stand in the way of the successful adoption of new learning technologies. The thesis concludes with a number of recommendations, key amongst them, the adoption of situated, authentic professional development of teachers in the use of new learning technologies in a constructivist manner.

40|$|Debt {{relief and}} the scaling up {{of aid to}} low-income {{countries}} should allow for greater fiscal space for expenditure programs to create long-term growth and lower poverty rates. But designing a suitable medium-term fiscal framework that fosters a sustainable delivery of better public services and infrastructure while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal prudence confronts many challenges. This paper discusses what low-income countries can do to shape fiscal policy frameworks that are ambitious in trying to absorb additional aid while still ensuring longer-term sustainability for government expenditure programs and finances. It suggests what approaches {{can be used to}} manage the greater fiscal policy risks associated with a scaled-up aid environment, including coordination with monetary policy. The paper also discusses what institutional changes are needed if donors and countries are to facilitate the implementation of a higher level of aid-financed spending programs.

40|$|Improvements in {{the health}} and {{education}} of people {{are central to the}} development process. Clearly, people place a high value on the health and education of themselves and their family members, and thus their improvement must be a goal of development. At the same time, the health and education of an individual have an important effect on that individual’s capability to produce. A healthier, better educated person is capable of producing more, and this improved productivity is rewarded in the labor market. The <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> current resources to improving an individual’s health or education, therefore, increases that person’s future productivity and income. The use of the term “human capital ” as shorthand for the cluster of factors like nutrition, health, formal education and on-the-job training, which are embodied in an individual and which provide future advantages focuses attention on the role <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on these factors as investments. This focus is a powerful analytical device, and will prove particularly useful in exploring the links between the distribution <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on human capital and the distributions of income and wealth. At the same time, however, this focus should not detract from the recognition of the value that people place on good health and education in themselves, apart fro...|$|R

40|$|Evolutionarily stable {{strategy}} models {{suggest that}} biparental care will be stable when parents partially compensate {{for changes in}} care by the other parent Previous work has emphasized the relationship between parental expenditure and the current component of fitness (e. g., offspring survival and fecundity) in causing partial compensation. This study shows that partial compensation depends critically on the effect <b>of</b> current parental <b>expenditure</b> on a parent's future fitness (e. g., survival to and fecundity in subsequent breeding seasons). Partial compensation is favored and biparental care is stable when future fitness is a concave-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more costly than the previous). However, when future fitness is a convex-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is less costly) biparental care is unstable.
