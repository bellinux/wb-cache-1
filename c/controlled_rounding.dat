40|$|The {{technique}} of <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> is to replace each entry of an array by an adjacent integer multiple of the rounding base, preserving the additive {{structure of the}} array. The <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> {{is said to be}} zero-restricted, if it also satisfies the condition that the values which are already the integer multiples of the base, remain unchanged. The main purpose of <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> is to ensure confidentiality of aggregate statistics. Notable amongst the various authors, who have thoroughly discussed the problem of <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding,</b> are Nargundkar and Saveland (1972), Dalenius (1981), Ernst (1981), Cox and Ernst (1982), Causey, Cox and Ernst (1985) and Cox (1987). In a recent work on <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding,</b> Cox (1987) has developed a procedure for unbiased <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> in two dimensions. The purpose of this note is to improve upon the procedure of Cox (1987), so that it terminates in fewer steps. The example in the case of two-way statistical table, solved by Cox (1987), has been reconsidered to highlight the utility of the proposed procedure. <b>Controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> controlled selection zero-restrictedness tabular array...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adjusting {{a column}} of rounded {{percentages}} to sum to 100 percent is often done. Rounding of entries in statistical tables of counts has been a standard tool for preserving confidentiality of respondent data. Rounding has the disadvantage that the tables may no longer add up as expected. <b>Controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> addresses this problem but in turn introduces new problems. The rounding is no longer to the nearest value which is {{a benefit for the}} confidentiality application. However <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> may not be possible for hierarchical tables or for tables with three or more dimensions. Many heuristics have addressed these problems. A careful analysis of the structure of tables shows how to identify totals for which <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> is always possible. The analysis shows that some choice is possible in the identified totals. The guaranteed rounding may often be extended to other totals depending upon the data in any example...|$|E

A common definition of protection is introduced and used in four different methodologies.

Also two relaxed techniques are presented through two associated Linear Programming models, and called Interval Publication and Cell Perturbation, respectively. A final discussion shows how to combine the four methods and how to implement a cutting-plane approach for the exact and heuristic resolution of the combinatorial problems in practice. All the presented methodologies inherently guarantee protection levels on all cells and against a set of different intruders (possibly respondents), thus the post Disclosure Auditing phase to test the protection requirements is unnecessary...|$|E

40|$|When {{disseminating}} data on individuals, information organizations must {{balance the}} interests of data users in better access and {{the interests of}} data providers in confidentiality. Cyclic perturbation is a new method for protecting sensitive data in categorical tables. In the disseminated data product, the true table values are altered in a way that preserves the table’s marginal totals. Further, the method requires publicly announcing details of the procedure, so that a user can determine not only the range of values that a table cell may have had in the original table, but also the exact posterior distribution over those possible values, given the user’s prior probabilities over a relatively small set of possible true tables. This permits Bayesian analysis of the published table.

Several target systems are highlighted. In stochastic traffic modeling, the computation of workload distributions plays a prominent role since they influence the quality of service parameters. INoWaTIV is a workload analysis tool that uses two different techniques: the polynomial factorization approach and the Wiener-Hopf factorization to determine the work-load distributions of GI/GI/ 1 and SMP/GI/ 1 service systems accurately. Two extensions of a multibody modeling and simulation software were developed to model kinematic and dynamic properties of multibody systems in a validated way.

In PascalSC, solutions of linear systems of equations, inverses of matrices, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed with guaranteed error bounds, and scalar products of vectors and sums of arbitrary length of floating-point numbers are computed to the closest floating-point number, or rounded upward or downward as desired. These basic features of Pascal-SC will be described, together with some applications...|$|E

The advantage of using a riot shotgun for riot control is that the shotgun is a dual use firearm, and can switch quickly {{to and from the}} riot control role by changing the ammunition. The downside is that it can fire lethal projectiles, and so extra care must be taken in its use to prevent the wrong ammunition from being used.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{two-dimensional}} proportional representation most commonly encountered when seats are to be allocated in a region where voters are classified according to the double cleavage of the constituency in which they vote and the party of their choice. A priority is set here on marginal proportionality: seats are dealt out to constituencies and to parties at the global level first. It is proven that, under a very weak condition, a biproportional delegation always exists, i. e. a representation matrix matching imposed margins and which is a <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> of the corresponding solution to the well-known biproportional problem. Two versions of a construction process for such a biproportional delegation are proposed and they are simulated on Belgian electoral data covering the last four general elections. Though no perfect system exists for this type of representation, comparisons with the current system plead in favor of the use of biproportional delegations. © 1991, Sage Publications.

This very general setting covers, among others, k-dimensional tables with marginals as well as hierarchical and linked tables. In particular, we address the NP-hard optimization problem known in the literature as the (zerorestricted) <b>Controlled</b> <b>Rounding</b> Problem. We also propose a modification of this problem, which allows for enlarged rounding windows in case the zero-restricted version is proved to have no feasible solution. We describe integer Linear Programming (LP) models and introduce effective LP-based enumerative algorithms. Computational results on 2 -, 3 - and 4 -dimensional tables are presented. An interesting outcome is that 4 -dimensional tables often admit no zero-restricted rounding, whereas slightly enlarged rounding windows produced feasible instances in all the cases in our test bed...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} contracting-interval {{programs}} {{is applied to}} finding the eigenvalues of a matrix. The development is a three-step process in which (1) a program is developed for the reduction of a matrix to Hessenberg form, (2) a program is developed for the reduction of a Hessenberg matrix to colleague form, and (3) the characteristic polynomial with interval coefficients is readily obtained from the interval of colleague matrices. This interval polynomial is then factored into quadratic factors so that the eigenvalues may be obtained. To develop a contracting-interval program for factoring this polynomial with interval coefficients {{it is necessary to}} have an iteration method which converges even in the presence of <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding</b> errors. A theorem is stated giving sufficient conditions for the convergence of Newton's method when both the function and its Jacobian cannot be evaluated exactly but errors can be made proportional to the square of the norm of the difference between the previous two iterates.

40|$|A special type {{of linear}} {{programming}} problem that arises quite frequently in practical application is the transportation problem. The transportation problem involves determining a shipping schedule that minimizes {{the total cost}} of shipment given that there are known fixed quantities of a commodity available for shipment at each origin, there are given quantities of a commodity required to be shipped at each destination, and the total shipments from all origins equal the total requirements of all destinations. It is assumed that the minimum cost of shipping a unit of commodity from any origin to any destination is known, and total shipping cost is obtained by taking the sum of individual cost;The algorithm used for finding an optimal solution requires that an initial basic feasible solution must first be determined. The algorithm improves this solution at each iteration, resulting in a total shipping cost that is {{less than or equal to}} the total cost in the previous iteration, until an optimal solution is found. There are different procedures for determining an initial feasible basis. Each of these procedures can give a different initial feasible basis that corresponds to varying total costs, and also takes varying amount of computational time in obtaining an initial feasible basis. A comparison of the various start procedures was conducted to determine the procedure that would give the best initial feasible basis, that is, one that is close to the optimum and does not use up a lot of CPU time in finding one. As a result of this study, it was determined that for large rectangular transportation problems the Large Amount Low Cost method would give the best initial feasible basis, and for square and not very rectangular problems, the Modified Minimum Row rule is best;The methods for solving transportation problems can be applied to solve some statistical problems. Two statistical problems that can be expressed in the form of a transportation problem are presented, namely, obtaining least absolute value estimates for the two-way classification model and the problem of <b>controlled</b> <b>rounding.</b> The application of the simple upper bounds procedure to obtain optimal solutions for these two problems is demonstrated through numerical examples...|$|E
