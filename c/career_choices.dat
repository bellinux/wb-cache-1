They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch).

40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between the secondary constructs of Holland’s (1997) theory of vocational interests and <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness [career maturity] attitudes with 358 Swiss secondary students. The hypothesis was tested that the secondary constructs consistency, coherence, differentiation, and congruence are measures for the degree of vocational interest development. Thus, they should belong to the content domain in <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness and should show meaningful relations to <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness attitudes. The hypothesis was confirmed for congruence, coherence, and differentiation. Interest profile consistency showed no relation to <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness attitudes. Vocational identity emerged as a direct measure for <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness attitudes. Realism of career aspirations was related to <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> readiness attitudes and coherence of career aspirations. Profile elevation was positively connected to more career planning and career exploration. Differences between gender, ethnicity, and school-types are presented.

We investigated whether a successful <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> intervention reduced psychological problems, and whether this program was equally effective in participants with low and with high levels of psychological problems. Participants were 45 Dutch students (age 17 - 24) with <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> problems.

5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as <b>career</b> <b>choices.</b> Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) Background: Previous {{research}} including Reed et al (2004), Wang et al (2006), Nauta (2007) and Tang and Newmeyer (2008) {{indicate that}} personality is {{influential in the}} <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> decision-making process of university and high school students. In this research, the Five-Factor Model of Personality and the Theory of Planned Behaviour are {{used to examine the}} role of personality in affecting <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment of university undergraduate students in Hong Kong. Summary of research and model: As the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) suggests, attitude triggers intention and intention shapes behaviour. The current project applies this theory to students’ <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> behaviour and investigates personality as a factor that influences attitude towards career aspiration. Based on the TPB, attitudes to career impact on intention and lead students to perform those behavioural actions necessary to enter the career they have chosen. Personality is identified as an influential factor in influencing attitude towards <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment. In this study, intention is regarded as (and measured by) the <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment. Under the TPB, each personality trait of a person under the Five-Factor Model of Personality (FFM) influences one’s attitude toward career aspiration which triggers intention (<b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment). Adopting a quantitative research design, this study surveyed more than 280 undergraduate students in universities in Hong Kong by anonymous questionnaire and useful data were collected. Using quantitative method and statistical techniques to analyze the data, several hypotheses were tested to investigate relationship between personality traits and <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment, finally some important results and findings were obtained in this study. The most important findings are that the personality trait of a person is very fundamental to determine one’s <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment because four of the five personality traits namely extraversion, neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness influence one’s attitude towards career goal very much, and attitude will cause intention (<b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment) logically. Attitude is also found to mediate the relationship between conscientiousness and <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment. Therefore, understanding on their personality proved to be very important to university students for career planning and development. Value and significance of the research: This study provides university curriculum planners with useful information to inform curriculum design for more compulsory academic courses good for students’ self-understanding. It also provides career counselors with better understanding of characteristics of students (with strength in what personality trait) for a better and more tailor-made career planning, guidance and development services. This study also makes a theoretical contribution by applying the TPB to <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> concept and exploring the link between personality and attitude {{at the same time in}} this context. Very little research has applied the TPB to the specific subject of <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment and also simultaneously investigated the relationship between personality and <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> commitment before...|$|R

25|$|Israeli culture views higher {{education}} {{as the key}} to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. For millennia medieval European antisemitism often forbade the Jews from owning land and farming, which limited their <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> for making a decent living. This forced many Jews to place a much higher premium on education allowing them to seek alternative career options that involved entrepreneurial and white-collar professional pursuits such as merchant trading, science, medicine, law, accountancy, and moneylending as these professions required higher levels of verbal, mathematical, and scientific literacy. The emphasis of education within Israeli society has its modern roots at least since the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement {{all the way to the}} roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation.
