2500|$|Similar {{to one of}} {{the most}} {{enduring}} myths about LSD, and also somewhat related to the [...] "multi-day impairment" [...] legend described further down on this list, this legend claims that residual THC stored in fat cells gets released spontaneously into the bloodstream in enough quantities to get one high again long after the last use of cannabis, be it days, weeks, or even months later.

40|$|Cognitive biases, {{including}} {{implicit memory}} associations {{are thought to}} play an important role in the development of addictive behaviors. The aim of the present study was to investigate implicit affective memory associations in heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users.</b> Implicit positive-arousal, sedation, and negative associations toward cannabis were measured with three Single Category Implicit Association Tests (SC-IAT's) and compared between 59 heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> and 89 controls. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between these implicit affective associations and explicit expectancies, subjective craving, cannabis use, and cannabis related problems. Results show that heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> had stronger implicit positive-arousal associations but weaker implicit negative associations toward cannabis compared to controls. Moreover, heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> had stronger sedation but weaker negative explicit expectancies toward cannabis compared to controls.

50|$|One {{theory is}} that, while disobedience may be helpful, any {{great amount of}} it would {{undermine}} the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit.

Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law {{in order to create}} a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or <b>cannabis</b> <b>user</b> who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabis is {{the most}} popular drug used in the European Union, closely {{followed}} by cocaine. Whereas cannabis has been shown to impair neurocognitive function in occasional <b>cannabis</b> <b>users,</b> such impairments appear less prominent in heavy users, possibly as a result of tolerance. The present study was designed to assess whether the impairing effects of THC in heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> would present {{in a wide range of}} neuropsychological functions or selectively pertain to specific performance domains. A second aim was to assess the acute effects of cocaine on neurocognitive functions of heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users.</b> EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users,</b> who had a history of cocaine use (N= 61), participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, 3 -way crossover study. Subjects received single doses of cocaine HCl 300 mg, cannabis (THC 300 mug/kg) and placebo and completed a number of tests measuring impulse control and psychomotor function. KEY RESULTS: Results showed that single doses of cannabis impaired psychomotor function and increased response errors during impulsivity tasks. Single doses of cocaine improved psychomotor function and decreased response time in impulsivity tasks at a cost of making more errors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> display impairments in a broad range of neuropsychological domains during THC intoxication. Impairments observed in psychomotor tasks, but not in impulsivity tasks, appeared smaller in magnitude as compared to those previously reported in occasional <b>cannabis</b> <b>users.</b> Heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> were sensitive to the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of cocaine on psychomotor function and impulsivity respectively.

40|$|RATIONALE: Excessive use of {{cannabis}} {{may have}} long-term effects on cognitive abilities. Mild impairments {{have been found}} in several cognitive domains, particularly in memory and attention. It is not clear, however, whether these effects also occur with moderate, recreational use of cannabis. Furthermore, little is known about underlying brain correlates. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess brain function in frequent but relatively moderate <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> in the domains of working memory and selective attention. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine verbal working memory and visuo-auditory selective attention in ten frequent <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> (after 1 week of abstinence) and ten non-using healthy controls. Groups were similar in age, gender and estimated IQ. RESULTS: <b>Cannabis</b> <b>users</b> and controls performed equally well during the working memory task and the selective attention task. Furthermore, <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> did not differ from controls in terms of overall patterns of brain activity in the regions involved in these cognitive functions. However, for working memory, a more specific region-of-interest analysis showed that, in comparison to the controls, <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> displayed a significant alteration in brain activity in the left superior parietal cortex. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for long-term deficits in working memory and selective attention in frequent <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> after 1 week of abstinence.

40|$|Summary The use of {{cannabis}} by {{adolescents in}} Switzerland has almost {{doubled in the}} past decade. Empirical observations in private dental practices indicate that <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> have more carious lesions than those who do not use cannabis. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hypothesis that regular cannabis use increases the risk of caries because of hyposalivation or lifestyle. Forty-three regular <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> were enrolled in the test group and 42 tobacco smokers were used as a negative control group. All subjects were 18 – 25 years old. Data were obtained using a standardized questionnaire and a clinical examination. There was no significant difference between groups in decayed and filled surfaces (DFS), saliva flow rate and plaque and gingival indices. The cannabis group had, however, significantly higher DS (decayed surface) values (p = 0. 0001) and significantly lower frequencies of daily tooth brushing and dental control visits (p < 0. 0001) than the control group. Additionally, the cannabis group reported a significantly higher consumption of sugarcontaining beverages than the control group (p = 0. 0078). To obtain more objective data relations, the DS values of male <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> were also compared with those of Swiss military recruits found in another study. The <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> had more caries on smooth surfaces than the military recruits. Although comparison with epidemiological data suggested that the prevalence of caries on smooth surfaces is elevated in <b>cannabis</b> <b>users,</b> DFS data indicated that <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> do not have an increased risk of caries.

40|$|Purpose: Factors {{influencing}} cannabis use {{have been}} previously identified mainly using multivariate approaches. However, {{there is a}} dearth of information collected {{from the perspective of}} the adolescent <b>cannabis</b> <b>user,</b> in particular for voluntary abstinences.

Findings: Voluntary abstinences by cannabis users were influenced by both internal and external factors. These were; the user’s state of mind, an attempt to quit, negative effects of cannabis, prior to important events, prior to family interactions and peers. Research limitations/implications: The results show that adolescent cannabis users are flexible in their approach to using cannabis, being able to briefly stop when the situation warrants it. However, the study is limited by a lack of in-depth and rich data, limiting the scope of the analysis.

Goal of the current {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study was to assess the predictive power of working-memory network function for future cannabis use and cannabis-related problem severity in heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users.</b> Tensor independent component analysis was used to investigate differences in working-memory network function between 32 heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> and 41 nonusing controls during an N-back working-memory task. In addition, associations were examined between working-memory network function and cannabis use and problem severity at baseline and at 6 -month follow-up. Behavioral performance and working-memory network function did not significantly differ between heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users</b> and controls. However, among heavy <b>cannabis</b> <b>users,</b> individual differences in working-memory network response had an independent effect on change in weekly cannabis use 6 months later (Δ...|$|R
