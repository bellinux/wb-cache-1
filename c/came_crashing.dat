A powersharing executive was set up and a Council of Ireland was to be established but it all <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> down in May 1974 {{as a consequence of the}} Ulster Workers' Council Strike. In addition many Republican voters were angered by what they saw as Cosgrave's harsh line on the PIRA and the handling of the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings which resulted in the perpetrators walking scot-free.|$|E

However, Australia <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> back to earth, suffering a 51-20 defeat during the second Bledisloe test, staged at the venue, stretching Australia's Bledisloe Cup drought to a 12th year. Australia managed to bounce back from that defeat, with hard fought 24-23 and 32-25 wins over South Africa and Argentina, with the latter win ensuring that Australia retained the Puma Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, in 1988, it all <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> {{down for}} Switzer. His team {{was placed on}} {{probation}} by the NCAA for violating several rules. In a six-month time frame, there was a shooting and a rape in the athletic dorm on Oklahoma's campus. Switzer's house was robbed {{with the help of}} one of his athletes, and an athlete was caught attempting to sell drugs to an undercover agent. The three-year probation included a two-year ban on TV and bowl appearances and a reduction in scholarships from 25 to 18. Nonetheless, the 1988 team established the NCAA Division I single-game record of 768yards rushing against Kansas State on October 15, 1988, a record that stands to this day. After the season, Switzer resigned as head coach.|$|E

500|$|Rob Zombie's reboot of {{the film}} series ensured that any Halloween comics would not be contradicted by {{upcoming}} films, allowing Hutchinson creative freedom. Malek Akkad was approached by Devil's Due Publishing {{with the possibility of}} producing a line of Halloween comics, and he and Hutchinson worked to make them a reality. Hutchinson was convinced by the strong support of One Good Scare that the comic books would have an audience. In 2008, Stefan Hutchinson released the first issue of his new comic book, Halloween: Nightdance. This is a four issue mini-series, and it does not contain any characters—other than Michael—from the films. The four issues are titled, [...] "A Shape in the Void", [...] "The Silent Clown", [...] "A Rainbow in One Color", and [...] "When the Stars <b>Came</b> <b>Crashing</b> Down". The first issue, [...] "A Shape in the Void", takes place on October 31, 2000, so that it falls between Halloween H20 and Halloween: Resurrection. Issue one follows Michael as he stalks Lisa, an eighteen-year-old girl with insecurities and [...] "a chronic fear of darkness". Hutchinson explains that Nightdance was an attempt to escape the dense continuity {{of the film}} series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film. Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa, just as he did with Laurie in the original Halloween, before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her. The aim was to once again establish Michael Myers as a [...] "credible and dangerous force".|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2000, an altercation during {{filming of}} the video for [...] "Sleep Now in the Fire", {{directed}} by Michael Moore, caused {{the doors of the}} New York Stock Exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange. The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls. When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away. Moore yelled to the band, [...] "Take the New York Stock Exchange!" [...] In an interview with the Socialist Worker, Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange. [...] "About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> down." [...] "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. [...] "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".|$|E

2500|$|... 2012 {{would prove}} to be McFadden's most {{successful}} season for Donegal. In helping Donegal to back-to-back Ulster titles in 2011-2012, McFadden became the first Donegal footballer to twice finish top scorer in the Ulster Championship. He scored an unusual goal in the seventh minute of Donegal's All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat of Kerry at Croke Park, later describing it as [...] "fortunate". He was also involved in the semi-final victory over Cork. Then he scored Donegal's second goal of the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Patrick McBrearty's attempt at scoring a point <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> off the Mayo post after eleven minutes of the game, and Mayo's Kevin Keane fumbled, dropping the ball into the path of Colm McFadden who promptly slotted it {{into the back of the}} net. His goal helped Donegal win the Sam Maguire Cup and McFadden later added an All Star and was named 2012 Ulster GAA Player of the Year. He was shortlisted for All Stars Footballer of the Year, but the award went to team-mate Karl Lacey.|$|E
2500|$|The close {{relation}} between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the [...] "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating {{that they were trying}} to follow the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabouni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the depressed market for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> down. Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabouni to assume the rest of the partnership's equity and debts.|$|E

2500|$|Two more near-disasters on May 17 led to {{the naming}} of {{additional}} features. [...] William Clark was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake while exploring a creek on the northern side of the river. [...] This creek was named Rattlesnake Creek (although today it is called Timber Creek). [...] The party camped near a creek {{on the south side}} of the river that evening. [...] Clark saw a fortified Native American lodge a short distance up the creek, believing it to be an Atsina (Gros Ventre) site. Late that night, a cottonwood tree sheltering the camp caught fire from sparks rising from the expedition campfire. [...] The men were barely able to get out of their tent and pull it out of the way before the tree <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> down on the site. [...] Lewis named this Burnt Lodge Creek (although today it is known as Seven Blackfoot Creek). [...] On May 20, the expedition passed the Musselshell River. On May 22, the party passed another creek, which they decided to name Sacajawea Creek. (Later renamed Crooked Creek, the U.S. government formally changed the name back to Sacagawea Creek in 1979.) The Corps of Discovery left the CMR NWF on May 24 or 25, after spending a week passing through and exploring the area.|$|E
2500|$|The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 regulates clauses that exclude or limit terms {{implied by}} the common law or statute. Its general pattern is that if clauses {{restrict}} liability, particularly negligence, of one party, the clause must pass the [...] "reasonableness test" [...] in section 11 and Schedule 2. This looks at the ability of either party to get insurance, their bargaining power and their alternatives for supply, and a term's transparency. In places the Act goes further. Section 2(1) strikes down any term that would limit liability for a person's death or personal injury. Section 2(2) stipulates that any clause restricting liability for loss to property has to pass the [...] "reasonableness test". One of the first cases, George Mitchell Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd saw a farmer successfully claim that a clause limiting the liability of a cabbage seed seller to damages for replacement seed, rather than the far greater loss of profits after crop failure, was unreasonable. The sellers were {{in a better position}} to get insurance for the loss than the buyers. Under section 3 businesses cannot limit their liability for breach of contract if they are dealing with [...] "consumers", defined in section 12 as someone who is not dealing in the course of business with someone who is, or if they are using a written standard form contract, unless the term passes the reasonableness test. Section 6 states the implied terms of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 cannot be limited unless reasonable. If one party is a [...] "consumer" [...] then the SGA 1979 terms become compulsory under the CRA 2015. In other words, a business can never sell a consumer goods that do not work, even if the consumer signed a document with full knowledge of the exclusion clause. Under section 13, it is added that variations on straightforward exemption clauses will still count as exemption clauses caught by the Act. So for example, in Smith v Eric S Bush the House of Lords held that a surveyor's term limiting liability for negligence was ineffective, after the chimney <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> through Mr Smith's roof. The surveyor could get insurance more easily than Mr Smith. Even though there was no contract between them, because section 1(1)(b) applies to any notice excluding liability for negligence, and even though the surveyor's exclusion clause might prevent a duty of care arising at common law, section 13 [...] "catches" [...] it if liability would exist [...] "but for" [...] the notice excluding liability: then the exclusion is potentially unfair.|$|E
