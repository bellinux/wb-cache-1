50|$|Alligators were scow-shaped, shallow draft boats, {{fitted with}} side mounted paddle wheels, {{powered by a}} 20-horsepower steam engine and {{provided}} with a <b>cable</b> <b>winch</b> and large anchor. By using the winch Alligators could pull themselves over land, around portages and {{up as much as}} a 20 degree incline at the rate of 1 to 2½ miles per day. They could haul a boom of some 60,000 logs across water against all but the strongest winds. They were heavily but simply built, making rebuilding and repair easy. Alligators began with paddle wheel propulsion. Later versions used screw propellers and diesel engines in place of steam.|$|E

It is believed to have been carried by the LZ 90 and was being deployed unmanned when the winch accidentally ran out of control. It was found along with 1500 ft of <b>cable.</b> The <b>winch</b> was jettisoned near Bury St. Edmunds.|$|R
50|$|The procon-ten {{system used}} thick <b>cables,</b> similar to <b>winch</b> <b>cables,</b> {{running around the}} rear of the engine, and linked to it. In the event of a frontal impact, the force and {{momentum}} of the impact would shift the engine rearwards, tensioning and pulling the cables, which were in turn connected to the steering column and seat belt mounts. When the cable was pulled tight by the engine, the cables would pull the steering wheel towards the front of the car, clear of the driver, and also remove any slack in the seat belts, holding the occupants more firmly in their seats until the accident had finished.|$|R
5000|$|Oyster {{dredging}} or harvesting: in Louisiana {{and other}} states with salt water estuaries that can sustain bottom oyster beds. A heavy metal rectangular scoop device is towed astern of a moving boat with a chain bridle attached to a <b>cable</b> and <b>winch</b> which scoops up oysters as it drags along the bottom. The device is periodically hauled aboard and the oysters in it are sorted and bagged for shipment to an oyster processing facility.|$|R
5000|$|ST-26 (ST {{stands for}} saperniy tank or [...] "{{engineer}} tank") — engineer tank; a bridge-laying tank {{based on the}} twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 chassis. According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two forks and two guiding rollers, lower forks with a hoisting mechanism and a roller, a rear frame with mounts and two rollers) and a <b>cable</b> <b>winch</b> (driven by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a maximum load rating of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the <b>cable</b> <b>winch</b> in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{begins with}} riders being pulled {{backwards}} {{out of the}} station up a hill by a <b>cable</b> <b>winch.</b> At the top of the hill, the train is released, and speeds through the station and goes through the ride's three inversions, including a cobra roll and a vertical loop. The train goes up a second lift hill and, when it reaches the top, the lift disengages, and the train falls backwards through the inversions, pressing about 5 G's of force on riders (especially in the loop) before it returns to the station. The restraints on the trains have extra padding so that there is minimal discomfort, this has been used on many modern Vekoma Boomerangs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railways, {{locomotives}} and rolling stock were small enough to be re-railed manually using jacks and tackle, but as they became bigger and heavier this method became inadequate.Enter into this the steam crane and <b>cable</b> <b>winch.</b> Appearing about 1890, the cranes increased in size, commensurate with the rise of steel Pullman cars, so by 1910 steam cranes reached their peak of development. Many of these 1910-era cranes were so useful and powerful, that they remained in service until the 1980s. The combination of a quick-firing steam boiler, heavy steam winch, and cable hook could little be improved upon, and thus remained in service. Also, steam engines did not mind being parked for months, with a little care, and were ready to go to work when needed.|$|E
50|$|The wakeboard {{is usually}} towed behind a motorboat, {{typically}} at speeds of 30-40 km/h (18-25 mph), {{depending on the}} board size, weight, type of tricks, and comfort. This speed could also depend on the year, make, and model of the boat because some boats, which are not designed for wakeboarding, create a different size wake which may not feel comfortable with. But can also be towed by other means, including closed-course <b>cable</b> systems, <b>winches,</b> and personal water craft.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the study was {{determining}} the level of workload connected with timber harvesting in selective early and late pine stand thinning. During the operations a manual-machine technology within short wood system was used. Tree cutting and felling were carried out by a sawman with a few years’ experience. Debarking and cross-cutting were performed by NIAB 5 - 15 and HYPRO 450 processors, equipped with <b>cable</b> <b>winches</b> controlled by an operator by means of a radio and used in the first stage of skidding. Energy expenditure was specified based on lung ventilation. Measurements were carried out by MWE- 1 expenditure-measuring device of Polish production. The average energy expenditure during sawman’s work {{with the use of the}} processor technology was ca. 26. 2 kJ/min, while the average operator’s energy expenditure during work was 13. 8 kJ/min. Energy cost analysis of performed works point out to a relatively small processor operator’s load, as well as considerable decrease of the load in case of a sawman cooperating with the processor. However, due to the existence of some single operations requiring a substantial physical engagement, work in these two positions can be qualified as hard.  ...|$|R
50|$|Both ends were {{topped with}} a crown of planks, the {{cylinder}} could ride on the Nile, with minimal effort, using <b>cables</b> driven by <b>winches.</b> Unfortunately, {{at the time of}} launching, a concealed rock in the mud punctured the cylinder which then blocked the waterway.|$|R
50|$|Tank mine sweeps. Several mine sweeps of {{different}} {{designs for the}} T-26 and ST-26 (minus its bridge) tanks were developed in the USSR, {{but none of them}} were passed into army service. Three models of mine plows (suspended from a front frame, operated with a hand <b>cable</b> <b>winch</b> and with special blades) were tested in 1932-1934. Trials showed very poor performance of such types of mine-sweep on compacted soil or scrubby land. The much more successful KMT-26 mine roller (weight 1.55 t, mine-sweeping speed 6-8 km/h, able to absorb up to 3 anti-tank mine explosions) was developed and tested in July 1934; three such mine-exploding rollers were produced. An experimental mine flail was tested in August-September 1939 also. Mine sweeps could be mounted on T-26 or ST-26 tanks in 1.5 hours and jettisoned without crew exit if necessary.|$|E

50|$|From April 1944, {{a number}} of Vengeance Mk IV series Is were made {{available}} to the 8th Air Force and assigned to target-towing flights and combat crew replacement Centers (CCRC) stations. All armament was removed and a light <b>cable</b> <b>winch</b> fitted in the rear fuselage for sleeve towing. Some of these aircraft continued to be flown with British national markings and serial numbers. By late-June 1944, there were seven A-35Bs at RAF Cluntoe, seven at Greencastle, 10 at RAF Sutton Bridge and six at RAF East Wretham. When the CCRCs were dissolved in the autumn, the A-35Bs were transferred to combat groups, most fighter and several bomber groups having one on hand at some time during 1945. A-35Bs did not show a high state of serviceability and were generally considered troublesome to maintain. They were also designated RA-35B (R for Restricted) by this time.|$|E
