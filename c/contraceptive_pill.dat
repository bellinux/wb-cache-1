5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill.</b> This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38â€“46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
25|$|Three {{types of}} {{emergency}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> are available: combined estrogen and progestin pills, progestin-only (levonorgestrel, LNG) pills, and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills. Progestin-only and antiprogestin pills are available as dedicated (specifically packaged for use as) emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> Combined estrogen and progestin pills {{are no longer}} available as dedicated emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> but certain regular combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> {{may be used as}} emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b>|$|R
25|$|Combined {{estrogen}} (ethinylestradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel or norgestrel) pills used to {{be available}} as dedicated emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> under several brand names: Schering PC4, Tetragynon, Neoprimavlar, and Preven (in the United States) but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (levonorgestrel) emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> (levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> can be taken in split doses 12hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72hours after intercourse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26brands of regular combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> containing levonorgestrel or norgestrel available in the United States {{that can be used}} in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen.|$|R

40|$|PurposeThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify relationships among knowledge and attitudes of unmarried mothers toward emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> MethodsData were collected through structured questionnaires from 135 unmarried mothers enrolled in 7 single mothers' facilities nationwide. Data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 17. 0 program for descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Scheffe-test, and Pearson correlation coefficients. ResultsFor knowledge about emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> there were significant differences among who live with her before pregnancy, experience of past pregnancies, state of present pregnancy and preparation in using contraceptives. For attitude toward emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> there were significant differences according to age, education level and religion. There were significant positive relationships between knowledge and attitudes toward emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> ConclusionThe {{results of this study suggest}} that unmarried women should be better informed about emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> and reassured about their safety.

40|$|Abstract Background Unsafe {{abortion}} {{is a major}} public health problem in low-and-middle income countries. Young and unmarried women constitute a high risk group for unsafe abortions. It {{has been estimated that}} widespread use of emergency contraception may significantly reduce the number of abortion-related morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and experiences on emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> by the university students in Cameroon in order to develop and refine a national health programme for reducing unwanted pregnancies and their associated morbidity and mortality. Methods A convenient sample of 700 students of the University of Buea (Cameroon) was selected for the study. Data was collected by a self-administered, anonymous and pre-tested questionnaire. Results The response rate was 94. 9 % (664 / 700). General level of awareness of emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> was 63. 0 % (418 / 664). However, knowledge of the general features of emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> was low and misinformation was high among these students. Knowledge differed according to the source of information: informal source was associated with misinformation, while medical and informational sources were associated with better knowledge. Although the students generally had positive attitudes regarding emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills,</b> up to 65. 0 % (465 / 664) believed that emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> were unsafe. Those with adequate knowledge generally showed favourable attitudes with regards to emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> (Mann-Whitney U = 2592. 5, p = 0. 000). Forty-nine students (7. 4 %) had used emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> themselves or had a partner who had used them. Conclusion Awareness of emergency contraception pills by Cameroonian students is low and the method is still underused. Strategies to promote use of emergency contraception should be focused on spreading accurate information through medical and informational sources, which have been found to be reliable and associated with good knowledge on emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> </p...|$|R

25|$|If {{fertility}} is not {{the primary}} aim, then menstruation can usually be regulated with a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill.</b> The purpose of regulating menstruation, in essence, is for the woman's convenience, and perhaps her sense of well-being; there is no medical requirement for regular periods, {{as long as they}} occur sufficiently often.|$|E
25|$|Alex Comfort {{and others}} propose three {{potential}} social aspects {{of sexual intercourse}} in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational. The development of the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also {{as a means of}} emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).|$|E
25|$|Historically, Manchester {{has been}} linked with high {{scientific}} achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill).</b> The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, {{more than any other}} in the UK. The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the University's School of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907â€“19), Lawrence Bragg (1919â€“37), Patrick Blackett (1937â€“53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize.

40|$|Background: Unsafe {{abortion}} {{is a major}} Public health problem in developing countries, where women make several unsafe attempts at termination of the unintended pregnancy before turning to health services. Community health workers {{can act as a}} bridge between the community and their health facilities and can use Emergency <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>Pills</b> to significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity related to unsafe abortions. Aims: This study explores the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the Lady Health Supervisor of the National Program for Family Planning, district Rawalpindi, regarding emergency contraception pills. Materials and Methods: The cross sectional survey was conducted during the monthly meeting of Lady Health Supervisors. Self administered, anonymous and voluntary questionnaire consisting of 17 items, regarding demographic profile, awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices, was used. Results: Insufficient knowledge, high misinformation and strongly negative attitudes were revealed. More than half did not know that emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> do not cause abortion. About four fifths believed that emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> will lead to â€˜evilâ€™ practices in society. More than four fifths recognized that the clients of National Program for Family Planning need emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills.</b> The attitudes were significantly associated with knowledge (P= 0. 034, Fisherâ€™s Exact Test). Conclusion: The awareness of emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> is high. Serious gaps in knowledge have been identified. There is a clear recognition of the need of emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> for the clients of National Program for Family Planning. However, any strategy to introduce emergency <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pills</b> must cater for the misplaced beliefs of the work force...|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been a swing from the sexually liberal end of the Industrial Revolution to the chaste values of the early Victorian period. This was then {{followed}} by a new puritanism from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s. This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. World War I began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, but more often than not, the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values of abstinence before marriage was retained. With the conclusion of World War II, the societal importance of abstinence declined. The advent of the first oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> and widely available antibiotics suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior, while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true. Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of moral values.|$|E
25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraceptives}} {{may produce}} {{a slight increase}} in {{the risk of breast cancer}} diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a relative risk (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current combined oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection. The relative risk of breast cancer diagnosis associated with current and recent use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to vary with family history of breast cancer. Some studies have suggested that women who began using hormonal contraceptives before the age of 20 or before their first full-term pregnancy are at increased risk for breast cancer, but it is not clear how much of the risk stems from early age at first use, and how much stems from use before the first full-term pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>pill</b> should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
