5|$|Cassidy {{travels to}} Thailand {{in pursuit of}} Dragovic. Believing that Cassidy has {{experienced}} a nervous breakdown, the US authorities have sent Reed to detain {{him as soon as}} he arrives. Tony and his partner, Nung, are told to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy flees as the police try to arrest him. Reed, who has been bought off by Dragovic, kills Nung and frames Cassidy for the murder. Vitayakul pursues Cassidy through the streets, but Cassidy escapes; he travels to a nightclub in Poipet, where — after torturing one of Dragovic's men — he discovers the location of Dragovic's current operations. Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub and attempt to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, Cassidy escapes injured. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> discover the identity of an informant: Vitayakul's girlfriend, Min. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's illegitimate son, who oversees Dragovic's southeast Asian human trafficking business, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father. Vitayakul arrives and attempts to kill Cassidy, but after learning the truth about his partner's death, he kills Reed instead. Before dying, Janko reveals his father's location.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{technologies}} are increasingly becoming {{an integral part}} of student’s lives in academia. Devices such as smartphones, tablets, and e-book readers connect users to the world instantly, heightening access to information and enabling interactivity with others. Applications that run on these devices let users not only consume but also discover and produce content. As such, they continue to transform how college students learn, as well as influence their learning preferences, both within and outside the classroom. This study survey the adoption of mobile phones among university students and their attitudes on the uses of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> as a venue for learning their class handouts and hunt ground for educational materials. The findings show that 53. 3 % of students own smart-phones while 41. 8 % own basic cell-phone (Featured phone). 42. 4 % of them use their <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> search educational reference materials online, 7. 3 % of them use <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> play games, 24. 3 % use their <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> read online news, 33. 3 % use their <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> connect to social networks.
