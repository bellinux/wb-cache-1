[...] The Uptown Theater {{was the first to}} reopen on November 9, 2014. [...] The congregation of the First Presbyterian Church moved back into the sanctuary in July 2016 following repairs and restoration at a cost of $850,000. The United Methodist Church received $2.2M in repairs and upgrades and reopened the doors to its congregation in November 2015. A $1.75M <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> damage to the Goodman Library was awarded in January 2017 and work on the building is expected to be completed in early 2018. The United States Postal Service determined that repairing the building would be too costly and sold it to a developer for $2M. [...] The developer plans to turn the building into a hotel. An $11.6M contract for restoration of the courthouse was awarded by Napa County in August 2017. The heavily damaged Trefethen Vineyard Eschol building was restored from earthquake damage following over two years of repairs and improvements.|$|E

50|$|In mid-1996, {{media reports}} {{surfaced}} that Chimwenje was planning a major offensive. The guerrillas began laying land mines across Manica Province, damaging some equipment owned by an Italian firm <b>contracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> infrastructure {{destroyed by the}} recent civil war. In response, the Mozambican government agreed to coordinate preemptive border operations with Zimbabwean and Malawian security forces. The topic was discussed at a regional defence summit hosted by Malawi on July 10. Intelligence findings presented at the summit confirmed Armando Mabache as Chimwenje's leader.|$|R

50|$|On 2 January 1930, {{the company}} took {{possession}} {{of an abandoned}} auto showroom garage in Baldwin, New York {{that had once been}} the Cox-Klemin Aircraft Co. factory. Initially, the new company, with only 18 people on salary, had <b>contracts</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> damaged Loening amphibians (surplus parts had been bought from the Loening works) and traded on its expertise in working with aluminum by building aluminum floats and producing aluminum truck bodies. The first project of the new company involved Grumman and Swirbul, as president and vice-president, on hands and knees, sorting out and matching nuts and bolts, prior to assembling Loening floats.|$|R

500|$|A {{study of}} a sample taken of {{affected}} areas suggested that roughly 62% of buildings in the affected areas suffered damage to roofs, around 34% to windows and 53% to vehicles. [...] Construction of infrastructure for 2000 Sydney Olympics in the city's west at the time meant there was a deficiency of tradespeople who could be <b>contracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> roofs and windows. Estimates put between 45,000 and 50,000 tradespeople in Sydney {{at the time of}} the storm, yet owing to high demand [...] "companies were quoting householders $14,000 or more for roof repairs which would normally cost $3,000." [...] The situation led to a warning from Minister for Fair Trade John Watkins on the day following the storm, urging homeowners to ensure that tradespeople working <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> homes were fully qualified and legitimate.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} formed after the {{acquisition}} of Freid, Goldman, Halter in 2002. In 2010 the company acquired Bender Shipbuilding and Repair in Mobile, Alabama. The purchase came after Bender filed for bankruptcy. The cost was $31.2 million. Dick Marler is the President and CEO. In 2005 the company hired over 300 workers for a single project to create a floating hotel to serve offshore workers. In 2014 Signal was awarded a $4.5 million government <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> and refurbish a navy product tanker. The firm employed an additional 150 workers for that contract.|$|E

5000|$|Israel {{was born}} to a Greek Jewish family in Rhodes, then part of the Ottoman Empire, now part of Greece. He immigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a {{shoemaker}} in Seattle, Washington. After World War II, during which he had a military <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> combat boots at Fort Lewis near Tacoma, he began to invest in real estate. His holdings, {{many of them in}} the Pioneer Square historic district, were largely dilapidated and undesirable to the majority of investors.

50|$|Rootes {{was founded}} in Hawkhurst, Kent, in 1913 by William Rootes as a car sales agency {{independent}} from his father's Hawkhurst motor business. Rootes had moved his operations to Maidstone by 1914 and there he <b>contracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> aero engines. In 1917 he formed Rootes Limited to buy the Maidstone branch of his father's motor business, founded by his father in 1897, to expand his aircraft engine repair business and the manufacture of aircraft parts. In 1919 the distribution of cars and commercial vehicles resumed and operations extended to London and {{other part of the}} country. As early as 1924 Rootes had become the largest truck and car distributor in the United Kingdom. They advertised that their showrooms in Devonshire House Piccadilly could supply new cars priced from £145 to £3,000 manufactured by Rolls-Royce, Daimler, Sunbeam, Austin, Hillman, Fiat or Clyno.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1943, the Spanish {{government}} began investing in CASA, first obtaining a 33 per cent {{share of the}} company, by 1992 this had increased to a controlling 99.2 per cent. In 1945 CASA opened a factory in Madrid dedicated to manufacturing the parts and sub-assemblies of their various aircraft and those that they had <b>contracts</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> and overhaul. In 1946 CASA re-established the Projects Office and resumed the design of aircraft based on the firm's proprietary technology. In 1957 CASA won a contract from the United States Air Force {{for the maintenance of}} the F-100 Super Sabres based in Europe and Turkey and a contract from the Spanish Air Force to overhaul T-33s in the Spanish Air Force. They began the manufacture of the Northrop F-5A fighter-bomber under license in 1962. In 1971, CASA merged with Hispano Aviación.|$|R

50|$|Although the CPA awarded {{contracts}} for essential reconstruction to American firms, some critics claim those firms did relatively little work. Bechtel, for instance, {{was awarded the}} <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> the Iraqi sewage and drinking water plants. Yet today many Iraqis remain without safe drinking water or adequate supplies of electricity. Coalition military forces were too heavily tasked to provide requisite security for all contractors in Iraq. Contract funds therefore had to be partially shifted from reconstruction activities to meet security requirements {{that had not been}} envisioned when the contracts were initially let. Moreover, progress in reconstruction frequently faced setbacks due to insurgency activities designed to disrupt rebuilding of the infrastructure. This insurgent activity significantly slowed reconstruction and required adjustment of project goals due to funds consumed by providing necessary security in excess of that originally planned.|$|E
5000|$|Official {{response}} to the reported leak was slow; no emergency measures were deemed necessary, and a formal bidding process began for the <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> the damage. By April 4, the slow oozing of wet clay opened a clear passage from the riverbed, allowing the river to pour directly into the tunnel. In {{what became known as}} the Chicago Flood, the entire system was quickly flooded. The Merchandise Mart was the first victim, declaring a water emergency at 5:57 am. City Hall began to flood by 6:02 am, the Federal Reserve Bank at 8:29 am, finally, the Chicago and Hilton Towers at 12:08 pm. The long delay before some buildings were flooded was the result of closure of some sections of the tunnel system in 1942 when the passenger subways were built. [...] Many businesses had had no idea that they were still connected to the tunnel complex, as the openings were boarded up, bricked up, or otherwise closed off—but not made watertight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Seaview Wharf is {{the main}} fuel {{bunkering}} jetty for the lower North Island of New Zealand. The wharf and its 600 m-long approach jetty has been in operation since 1977 and its cast-insitu reinforced concrete beams were spalling due to rebar corrosion. A design/build operate <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> the concrete and install a remotely monitored cathodic protection (CP) system was let in 1999, and protection of the wharf head concrete was completed in 2000. The contract was extended and cathodic protection of the approach jetty beams was completed in February 2003. This paper discusses what is the largest concrete CP system installed in New Zealand to date, with over 3000 square metres of chloride contaminated concrete now protected from further corrosion damage...|$|E
5000|$|Born near Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1810, to Daniel Steenrod of New York and {{his second}} wife, the former Nancy Ann Gater, who had married in 1806, Lewis Steenrod had seven siblings, {{including}} an older brother Edward Gater Steenrod, and elder sisters Catherine and Emma. His sister Mary married the Wheeling postmaster, General Feeney, and their daughter Ann Elizabeth married Congressman and judge George W. Thompson, with whom this Lewis would later work. His father Daniel Steenrod and Col. Moses Shepherd were responsible for building and repairing bridges on the National Road, which had been authorized in 1806 and was completed through Ohio County in 1817-1818, Daniel Steenrod also operated a tavern {{on the south side}} of the road, and after Virginia took over responsibility for toll collecting and upkeep, he was still <b>contracting</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> and maintain the road and bridges. In the mid-1830s he also laid out the village of Fulton, and also platted an area called [...] "Steenrod's Island" [...] around a paper mill constructed by Alexander Armstrong in 1836.|$|R
25|$|Growing {{instability}} concerns due to {{the previous}} control of the dam by ISIL, and poor security led the Iraq government to award a US$2 billion <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> an Italian company, Trevi, in December 2015.

5000|$|Finally, {{it may be}} {{implied that}} {{performance}} is to occur immediately, {{in which case the}} creditor need not make any demand for it. If a geyser bursts, and one <b>contracts</b> a plumber <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> it, the implication is that the plumber must set about his work immediately, not at some distant date in the future.|$|R
50|$|In April 2017, the TTC {{awarded a}} $6.8-million <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> Bombardier <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> {{corrosion}} damage under the {{floors of the}} SRT cars.

Further, the court said, [...] "the procedure followed and the instruments employed clearly indicate an intention that construction agreement was between the State and the claimant only", naming neither the commission nor Pennsylvania. The latter indeed shared the cost of construction, but that had no bearing on how D'Angelo got compensated.|$|R
