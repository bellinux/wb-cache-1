5000|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of the precious resource water {{and the consequences of}} the climate change, numerous European policies have been developed and adopted for the protection and sustainable utilisation of water, creating a huge demand in vocational training. Economic factors like privatisation and increasing <b>cost</b> <b>pressure</b> in water management are further increasing these educational needs, leading to the demand for VET opportunities and products that are as short and tailor‐made as possible.The situation of vocational training in water management was addressed by the WACOM instrument, which attempted to define the needed competences and qualifications for the different tasks, working places and employees within the water sector. In this way, WACOM strove to lead to a supposed increase in the volume of mobility throughout Europe as well as to a higher transparency and recognition of qualifications and competences. The project aimed at creating general as well as particular modular VET opportunities and products in the water management concerning the addressed competences and qualifications. Through this, the VET opportunities and products were able to be related and mapped to those competences and qualifications for the management of sewage treatment plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{embedded}} {{consumer electronics}} devices, <b>cost</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is one of}} the driving design objectives. Devices that handle multimedia information, like DVD players or digital video cameras require high computing performance and realtime capabilities while adhering to the cost restrictions. The <b>cost</b> <b>pressure</b> often results in system designs that barely exceed the minimum requirements for such a system. Thus, hardware-based fault tolerance methods frequently are ignored due to their cost overhead. However, the amount of transient faults showing up in semiconductor-based systems is expected to increase sharply in the near future. Thus, lowoverhead methods to correct related errors in such systems are required. Considering restrictions in processing speed, the real-time properties of a system with added error handling are of special interest. In this paper, we present our approach to flexible error handling and discuss the challenges as well as the inherent timing dependencies to deploy it in a typical soft realtime multimedia system, a H. 264 video decoder.
