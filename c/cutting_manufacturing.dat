50|$|The State Defense Order for 2009 was {{expected}} to amount to a record of RUB 1.2 trillion, showing an increase of RUB 70 billion from the previous year. The order {{was expected}} to be raised by a further RUB 40 billion for 2010, and by RUB 60 billion for 2011. In total, the state plans to spend $128 billion in military procurement in the 2009-2011 period. Military-Industrial Commission of Russia is responsible for supervising the distribution and implementation of the State Defense Order. In 2005, Putin initiated an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). The aim was optimize production lines and minimise losses. The program was divided in three parts: reorganization and crisis management (2007-2010), evolution of existing projects (2010-2015) and further progress within the newly created structure (2015-2025). The State Duma Defense Committee has announced that the nation's defense spending, including research and development R&D spending, will total $16.3 billion (RUB487 billion) in 2010, $19.2 billion (RUB574 billion) in 2011, $24.3 billion (RUB726 billion) in 2012, and $38.8 billion (RUB1.16 trillion) in 2013. While total defense spending will increase, the amount allocated for R&D will drop from the current 2010 level of 22 percent to 16 percent by 2013. The modernization of weaponry will instead receive a significant portion of total spending, with 13 percent designated for the 2010 fiscal year, 15 percent for 2011 and 2012, and 14 percent for 2013. The top procurement priorities are the following: RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Su-24 fighters, Su-35 long-range fighters, submarines, corvettes, frigates, and battlefield command-and-control systems. The plan for 2010-2013 only represents a small portion (16%) of that amount, just over RUB2.9 trillion ($98.6 billion). The government intends to spend RUB19 trillion ($613 billion) over the next decade to modernize the armed forces.The UAC, one of the so-called national champions and comparable to EADS in Europe, enjoyed considerable financial support from the Russian government, and injected money to the companies it had acquired to improve their financial standing. The deliveries of civilian aircraft increased to 6 in 2005, and in 2009 the industry delivered 15 civilian aircraft, worth 12.5 billion roubles, mostly to domestic customers. Since then Russia has successfully tested the fifth generation jet fighter, Sukhoi Su-57, and started the commercial production of the regional airliner Sukhoi Superjet 100, as well as started developing a number of other major projects. Putin created the United Shipbuilding Corporation in 2007, which led to the recovery of shipbuilding in Russia.

Superposition of the infeed with adapted ultrasonic vibrations enables reductions of machining forces. This results in diminished tool wear and longer tool life.

Successful machining of recalcitrant metal-based materials by ultrasonic assisted systems creates a high potential to gain similar effects in machining of mineral-based materials. This will be studied in this article. The {{state of the art}} for the machining of stone uses geometrically undefined cutting edges. This paper focuses on the geometrically defined cutting of granite with additional ultrasonic assistance. Cutting tests at a test station with linear cutting motion are being performed. The ultrasonic frequency is maintained at 20 kHz. Different oscillation amplitudes are applied to influence process forces and the wear of the used carbide metal and polycrystalline diamond cutting segments (PCD). A method to observe the wear is developed by use of a stereomicroscope and a 3 D measurement system. This will enable conclusions about the applicability of the geometry of the cutting segments and the process parameters. Due to the significant different wear rates of both cutting materials, the cutting force progression by using PCD tools shows completely different characteristics compared to the machining with carbide metal tools...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSimilar to the {{essential}} components of many mechanical systems, the geometrical {{properties of the}} teeth of spiral bevel gears greatly influence the kinematic and dynamic behaviors of mechanical systems. Logarithmic spiral bevel gears show a unique advantage in transmission due to their constant spiral angle property. However, a mathematical model suitable for accurate digital modeling, differential geometrical characteristics, and related contact analysis methods for tooth surfaces have not been deeply investigated, since such gears are not convenient in traditional <b>cutting</b> <b>manufacturing</b> in the gear industry. Accurate mathematical modeling of the tooth surface geometry for logarithmic spiral bevel gears is developed in this study, based on the basic gearing kinematics and spherical involute geometry along with the tangent planes geometry; actually, the tooth surface is a parametric surface defined on a parallelogrammic domain. Equivalence proof of the tooth surface geometry is then given in order to greatly simplify the mathematical model. As major factors affecting the lubrication, surface fatigue, contact stress, wear, and manufacturability of gear teeth, the differential geometrical characteristics of the tooth surface are summarized using classical fundamental forms. By using the geometrical properties mentioned, manufactura-bility (and its limitation in logarithmic spiral bevel gears) is analyzed using precision forging and multi-axis freeform milling, rather than classical cradle-type machine tool based milling or hobbing. Geometry and manufacturability analysis results show that logarithmic spiral gears have many application advantages, but many urgent issues such as contact tooth analysis for precision plastic forming and multi-axis freeform milling {{also need to be}} solved in a further study...|$|E
40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal <b>cutting</b> <b>manufacturing</b> on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central precoat filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the precoat filter with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central precoat filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central precoat filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been propose to improve the {{adhesion}} of diamond films on cemented carbide tool materials, however a systematic study in identifying {{the role of the}} factors that affect the final diamond adhesion and the resulting machining performance of the tool under real manufacturing conditions is still unexplored. CVD diamond film 2 Ì 7 s extraordinary qualities bring little benefit if the film fails to adhere sufficiently to the substrate. Inadequate adhesion undermines tool performance and longevity, causing unpredictable behavior under load and possibly leading to unexpected failure of the tool in the production line. This dissertation investigates the effects of different surface pretreatments on the adhesion and performance of CVD diamond coated WC-Co turning inserts for the dry machining of high silicon aluminum alloys. Different interfacial characteristics between the diamond coatings and the modified WC-Co substrate were obtained by the use of two different chemical etchings and a CrN/Cr interlayer, with the aim to produce an adherent diamond coating by increasing the interlocking effect of the diamond film, and halting the catalytic effect of the cobalt present on the cemented carbide tool. A systematic study is analyzed in terms of the initial cutting tool surface modifications, the deposition and characterization of microcrystalline diamond coatings deposited by HFCVD synthesis, the estimation of the resulting diamond adhesion by Rockwell indentations and Raman spectroscopy, and finally, the evaluation of the dry machining performance of the diamond coated tools on A 390 aluminum alloys. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallographic analysis, and x-ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize the morphology, cobalt content, and nature of the substrate surfaces before and after each pretreatment; optical interferometry was utilized to characterize the surface roughness. After successfully diamond depositions, the films were characterized again using SEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, Electron Probe Microscopy Analysis (EPMA), and optical interferometry. The experiments show that chemical etching methods exceed the effect of the CrN/Cr interlayer in increasing the diamond coating adhesion under dry cutting operations. This dissertation provided new insights about optimizing the surface characteristics of cemented carbides to produce adherent diamond coatings in the dry <b>cutting</b> <b>manufacturing</b> chain of high silicon aluminum alloys. An alternative method to measure the practical adhesion on commercial diamond coatings that can be correlated with the machining performance is proposed to be used when other methods (scratch, nanoindentation, microindentation, pin-on-disk, etc.) are not viable. This research is the first comprehensive and systematic work that links the surface/subsurface integrity of cutting tools with their ability to produce an adherent diamond coating capable to dry machine high silicon aluminum alloys...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} technology electrochemical machining (ECM) finds numerous applications in industrial production. Especially for shaping and surface structuring of metals by controlled anodic dissolution {{the process is}} used. The advantages of ECM are mainly the high removal rates, the slight influence on the work piece material structure and the independence of material strength and hardness. Thus ECM is advantage compared to metal <b>cutting</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes. Precise electrochemical machining (PEM) is an innovative machining technology which results from further development of the electrochemical sinking. PEM works with pulsed low frequency direct current and oscillation of the tool electrode. It enables the manufacturing of tools and machine elements with high precision requirements and reproduction accuracy. [1, 2] With PEM actually the manufacturing of structure sizes < 1 mm and flatness < 5 Âµm by front surface machining is possible. As {{part of the project}} âElectrochemical machining of internal precision and micro-geometries with high aspect ratios by process-state-dependent electrolyte managementâ (ElAs) the aim is to develop a new combination of high pressure flush and a flexible electrode concept. Filigreed electrodes with structure elements smaller than 0. 2 mm are targeted for the aimed manufacturing of big aspect ratios. Moreover inner micro structures are obstacle by them self for the needed electrolyte flush in the working cap. Due to this the manufacturing process has to be qualified to a non-flux of electrolyte at the dissolution process. Interaction between conduction and the geometry of the electrodes should be avoided. Therefore a closed process device has to be developed which is able to admit a defined pressure charge. By concerted modifications the oscillation inducted effect of compression should become accessible as input parameter for the process. Experimental research of model geometries regarding to the electrode shape, the inducted compression, the precision, the surface and the current efficiency are content of the project. Multiphysics simulations are applied to characterise the modified process. For the simulation of the electrolyte flow in the closed device COMSOL MultiphysicsTM is used. To get use of the simulation software a suitable model geometry had to be deducted and initial values were defined. The closed device has a cylindrical shape with connections for the electrolyte supply. Thus the device isnât rotationally symmetric. The electrolyte flow results from interaction of the transverse flow and the tool electrode oscillation. One challenge is to develop a model which fits the geometric requirements of the closed device and even the requirements for simulation. The numerical simulations of high turbulent flows are really sophisticated and a lot of computing power is needed [3]. Therefore the simulation was designed in a 2 -dimensional environment and the geometric specifications were adjusted accordingly to comply with these claims. By solving a transient model of turbulent flow the field of velocity in the closed device could be shown. It can be recognized that the field of velocity in the closed device is highly turbulent with many random vortexes. This is due to the interaction of oscillating velocity at the upper edge of the model and the transverse flux in the closed device...|$|E
