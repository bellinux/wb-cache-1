40|$|International audiencecMUTs {{are a very}} {{promising}} alternative to the piezoelectricity in echographic imaging probes. Many authors have modeled cMUT arrays but only few works have been dedicated to the simulation of devices working in real configuration, i. e. where each element is made of {{a finite number of}} cMUTs. In previous studies, we pointed out that, in such conditions, interactions between cMUTs could cause some strong <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the useful frequency bandwidth, leading to undesirable oscillations {{at the end of the}} impulse response. This phenomenon is comparable with baffle effects in multi-source radiators. Even if origins of these <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> are well known in sonar arrays, this phenomenon have poorly been explored for arrays of cMUTs. This paper is a deep theoretical investigation of these interactions. The linear array of cMUTs is modeled like a linear system. Input electrical quantities (voltage applied to each element of the array) are linked to output acoustic quantities (pressure emitted by each element) with a global transfer matrix.

500|$|From this it {{is clear}} that smaller values of m will produce [...] closer to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> [...] and hence will have a sharper cut-off. Despite this cut-off, it also brings the {{unwanted}} stop band response of the m-type closer to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency,</b> making it more difficult for this to be filtered with subsequent sections. The value of m chosen is usually a compromise between these conflicting requirements. There is also a practical limit to how small m can be made due to the inherent resistance of the inductors. This has the effect of causing the pole of attenuation to be less deep (that is, it is no longer a genuinely infinite pole) and the slope of cut-off to be less steep.

500|$|In principle, any non-zero {{frequency}} {{point on the}} filter response {{could be used as}} a reference for the prototype design.
