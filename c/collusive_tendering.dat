50|$|Exercising First degree (or Perfect/Primary) price {{discrimination}} requires the monopoly seller {{of a good}} or service to know the absolute maximum price (or reservation price) that every consumer is willing to pay. By knowing the reservation price, the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price {{he is willing to}} pay, and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues. So the profit is equal to the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. The marginal consumer is the one whose reservation price equals to the marginal cost of the product. The seller produces more of his product than he would to achieve monopoly profits with no {{price discrimination}}, which means that there is no deadweight loss. Examples of where this might be observed are in markets where consumers bid for tenders, though, in this case, the practice of <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> could reduce the market efficiency.|$|E

This paper describes an empirical investigation of the attitudes and behavioural intent towards <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> of key individuals in the tendering process. It also explores the factors that determine these attitudes. The results of the empirical investigation indicate that there is a minority of decision-makers that admit they would consider participating in some form of <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> agreement under certain circumstances.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a behavioural perspective {{to the problem}} of <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> in the construction market by examining the decision making factors of individuals potentially involved in such agreements using marketing ethics theory and techniques. The findings of a cross disciplinary literature review were synthesised into a model of factors theoretically expected to determine the individual's behavioural intent towards a set of <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> agreements and the means of reaching them. The factors were grouped as internal cognitive (the individuals' value systems) and affective (demographic and psychographic characteristics) as well as external environmental (legal, industrial and organisational codes and norms) and situational (company, market and economic conditions). The model was tested using empirical data collected through a questionnaire survey of estimators employed in the largest Australian construction firms. All forms of explicit <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> agreements were considered as having a prohibitive moral content by the majority of respondents who also clearly differentiated between agreements and discussions of contract terms (which they found to be a moral concern but not prohibitive) or of prices. The comparisons between those of the respondents that would never participate in a collusive agreement and the potential offenders clearly showed two distinctly different groups. The law abiding estimators are less reliant on situational factors, happier and more comfortable in their work environments and they live according to personal value and belief systems. The potential offenders on the other hand are mistrustful of colleagues, feel their values are not respected, put company priorities above principles and none of them is religious or a member of a professional body. The research results indicate that Australian estimators are, overall law abiding and principled and accept the existing codification of collusion as morally defensible and binding. Professional bodies' and organisational codes of conduct as well as personal value and belief systems that guide one's own conduct appear to be deterrents to <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> intent and so are moral comfort and work satisfaction. These observations are potential indicators of areas where intervention and behaviour modification can increase individuals' resistance to collusion...|$|E

Therefore, the author has interest to conduct research entitled “Reviewing KPPU Verdict Concern <b>Collusive</b> Agreement on <b>Tender</b> During 2011 – 2013 Related to Act No. 5 Year 1999 And KPPU Regulation No. 2 Year 2010 ”. And the problem formulation are: a) what kind of <b>collusive</b> agreement on <b>tender</b> often be decided on KPPU verdict during 2011 – 2013 ?; b) Are Act No. 5 Year 1999 and KPPU Regulation No. 2 Year 2010 effective to prevent <b>collusive</b> agreement on <b>tender</b> during 2011 – 2013 ?. The research method used is normative law research. It is one law research that requires secondary data as primary data. And the research result indicates interesting finding which there are 20 cases of collusive agreement on tender; most of them (18 cases) is mix horizontal – vertical cases {{and the rest is}} vertical cases. It is because there are involvements of government official on tender.

40|$|The {{morality}} of marketing {{practices in the}} construction industry is an issue of economic and social significance which attracts public and legislative concern. Criticisms, as well as negative publicity, are mostly concentrated around collusive tendering: illegal agreements between tenderers that result in seemingly, but not really, competitive bids, price fixing or market distribution schemes that circumvent the spirit of free competition and defraud clients. Even though <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> has been identified as an endemic malaise of building, its behavioural and moral dimensions have not been systematically studied before. These are the focus of this paper which presents a literature review that was carried out in order to identify the variables influencing behavioural intent towards <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> agreements and means of reaching them. The paper describes part of an exploratory empirical investigation involving a random sample of estimators in the largest construction organisations in Australia. First, the respondents’ perceived impact of the list of variables on their expressed behavioural intent are presented. Then, their preferred ethical frameworks are presented and discussed. Finally factor analysis is used to classify the decision making variables. The results indicate a strong teleological orientation of the respondents...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the area}} of study of spatial game {{continuously}} has extended, and researchers have especially presented a lot of works of coevolutionary mechanism. We have recognized coevolutionary mechanism {{as one of the}} factors for the promotion of cooperation like five rules by Nowak. However, those studies still deal with the optimal response (best decision). The best decision is persuasive in most cases, but does not apply to all situations in the real world. Contemplating that question, researchers have presented some works discussing not only the best decision but also the second-best decision. Those studies compare the results between the best and the second-best, and also state the applicability of the second-best decision. This study, considering that trend, has extended the match between two groups to spatial game with the second-best decision. This extended model expresses relationships of groups as a spatial network, and every group matches other groups of relationships. Then, we examine how mutual cooperation changes in each case where either we add probabilistic perturbation to relationships or ties form various types of the structure. As a result, unlike most results utilizing the best decision, probabilistic perturbation does not induce any change. On the other hand, when ties are the scale-free structure, mutual cooperation is enhanced like the case of the best decision. When we probe the evolution of strategies in that case, groups with many ties play a role for leading the direction of decision as a whole. This role appears without explicit assignment. In the discussion, we also state that the presented model has an analogy to the real situation, <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering.</b> Cooperation, Second-Best Decision, Multi-Agent Simulation, Spatial Game, <b>Collusive</b> <b>Tendering...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{opinion survey}} of South African architects, {{quantity}} surveyors, engineers and contractors regarding ethical behaviour within {{the construction industry}} reveals that South African contractors seem to possess a reputation for unethical conduct. The range of problems encountered includes collusion, bribery, negligence, fraud, dishonesty and unfair practices. While bribery {{in the form of}} payments and gifts is prevalent, fraud {{does not appear to be}} as serious a problem. Most construction professionals believe that the industry suffers from unfair tendering practices, as well as over-claiming and/or withholding payment for service delivery. Negligence arises mainly from poor documentation and poor workmanship. Incidents of <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> encompass cover pricing and bid cutting by contractors, while the primary form of fraudulent behaviour is deceit and misinformation.

40|$|Many {{parties in}} the {{construction}} industry claim that codes of professional ethics can help mitigate the unethical conduct of civil engineers and improve the ethical level amongst construction players. However, the fact is, even though most organisations have their own codes of ethics, there still are many instances of unethical conduct {{in the construction industry}}. For this reason, this research attempted to study clients' perceptions of the impact on civil engineering works that codes of professional ethics have. Unethical conduct in the construction industry, such as fraud, bribery and <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering,</b> were addressed in 55 structured interviews. The interviews indicated the causes of the unethical conduct, as well as ways for mitigation. Finally, two models of disciplinary procedures to deal with unethical conduct were developed for the construction industry, particularly for civil engineers. One model is for nonserious unethical conduct such as "being late for work", "punching card on behalf of a friend", and "disappointing work performance", while the other model is for serious unethical conduct such as "fraud", "dishonesty", and "collusion with the other party"...|$|E

Most (90 %) subscribed to a professional Code of Ethics and many (45 %) had an Ethical Code of Conduct in their employing organisations, with the majority (84 %) considering good ethical practice to be an important organisational goal. 93 % of the respondents agreed that "Business Ethics" should be driven or governed by "Personal Ethics", with 84 % of respondents stating that a balance of both the requirements of the client and the impact on the public should be maintained. No respondents were aware of any cases of employers attempting to force their employees to initiate, or participate in, unethical conduct. Despite this, all the respondents had witnessed or experienced some degree of unethical conduct, in the form of unfair conduct (81 %), negligence (67 %), conflict of interest (48 %), <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> (44 %), fraud (35 %), confidentiality and propriety breach (32 %), bribery (26 %) and violation of environmental ethics (20 %) ...|$|E

In its current form, s 73 A has several weaknesses which will negatively impact competition enforcement; particularly the leniency policy which is the Commission’s most effective weapon against cartelisation. The emergence of follow-on damages litigation as a legal remedy and class actions as a procedural mechanism in the bread class action, have paved the way for private competition enforcement as a more effective deterrent. The lack of a statutory regulatory framework compelled the courts to develop the common law regarding follow-on damages litigation and class actions. Although the exercise has highlighted the challenges associated with the lack of judicial guidance in developing directives, it has indicated that private competition enforcement is a pragmatic solution for cartelisation...|$|E
40|$|Collusion is of {{critical}} {{concern to the}} construction sector as it undermines free competition in the construction market. Given that previous research on collusive practices concentrates mainly on the bidding phase, this study extended the research focus to the entire construction period and aimed to investigate specific collusive practices in Chinese construction projects. A total of 22 specific collusive practices in Chinese construction projects were first identified based on a comprehensive literature review and a Delphi survey with 15 industry experts. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted to prioritize the identified collusive practices {{in terms of their}} probability and severity. The survey results indicate that the primary collusive practices in Chinese construction projects are misrepresentation of qualification certificates, loose site supervision, misusing prequalification requirements, fake tendering, approval of the unnecessary change orders, collective <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering</b> by helping one another, the nomination of a particular supplier, issuing certified works falsely, and inflating tender price. The findings of the study not only provide a clearer picture of collusive practices in construction projects in China but also provide a better understanding of collusive practices in other emerging economies.

40|$|Using {{an online}} survey, the {{experiences}} and opinions of clients and construction professionals were sought regarding corruption in the South African construction industry. Corruption is considered widespread. Conflicts of interest, tender rigging (collusion), &# 039;fronting&# 039; and &# 039;kickbacks&# 039; are the forms of corruption most encountered. Government officials (as clients), contractors, and sub-contractors {{are perceived to be}} the most involved in corrupt activities, but professional consultants and clients are not exempt. Forms of corruption most associated with government officials are the awarding of contracts for political gain, nepotism and conflicts of interest, and interference in the tender award process. Contractors and sub-contractors employ illegal workers, and engage in <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering.</b> Corruption is most prevalent during the bid evaluation and tendering phases of projects. Facilitating factors include a lack of transparency in the awarding of contracts and the operating environment of the industry. Corruption is seldom reported to the police. Barriers to reporting include a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system, a belief that no action will be taken, and a perception that &# 039;whistle-blowers&# 039; are not adequately protected. The construction industry and public sector agencies should adopt a more proactive stance against corruption and be more cooperative in detecting and reporting it...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of projects is mostly symbolised by the extraordinary levels of unethical practices {{and this has}} ruined {{the image of the}} industry. The delivery of good quality infrastructure projects in some emerging economies is continuously, disrupted because of unethical practices. This paper was, initiated to identify the most dominant unethical practices in the {{construction of}} projects, using most recent and comprehensive literature ranging from 2011 to 2017. Twenty unethical practices in the construction of projects were, identified. From this, the study observed that the most dominant unethical practices are corruption, bribery and <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering.</b> The least unethical practices revealed by this study are the lack of safety, overstatement of capacity and falsification of experience. Findings indicate that in order to redesign the future landscape of the industry, there is need to educate the workforce on the effects of unethical practices as well as the need to implement stronger policies. Based on these findings, further empirical studies are necessary. This article also presents recent challenges and trends of unethical behaviour that needs acknowledgement in order to assist the construction industry. In conclusion, this study proposes twelve possible solutions that could assist the construction community in the reduction of unethical practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Development of {{infrastructure}} {{to meet the}} needs of South Africans is a major concern for the construction industry, however the failure of the industry to keep up with the expectation has drawn some criticism from the citizens. Lack of adherence to ethical practices that help ensure transparency and accountability within the industry is a major impediment towards being a consistent and an effective contributor to the growth of the South African economy. This study therefore examines unethical practices in South African Construction Industry and measures to address the menace for better project performance. Well-structured questionnaires were administered on registered and experienced construction professionals within the industry and Mean Item Score (MIS) was used to analyse the returned data. Non-adherence to ethical practices in the industry are as a result of greed, favouritism, political influence, monopoly of bigger companies over smaller and emerging companies and pressure to meet unrealistic company objective and deadlines. The unethical practices prevalent in the industry include bribery and fraud, falsification of experience, illegal award of tenders and <b>collusive</b> <b>tendering.</b> These unethical practices result to dissatisfied clients, poor workmanship, poor quality of infrastructural development and loss of public trust. Professionals, especially construction and project managers should shoulder the responsibility of stamping out unethical practices in the industry by developing viable measures to achieve the goal. More so, whistle-blower protection mechanisms need to be revised and improved to encourage effective monitoring and sanctioning of individuals involved in unethical practices in the industry...|$|E
