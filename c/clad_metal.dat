It {{is based on the}} concept that two atomically clean solid surfaces can develop a strong adhesive force between them when they are brought into contact at high vacuum condition without high deformation at a 40 ~ 90 %. With this SAB process, the effects of heat treatment on the bonding strength of surface-activated bonding (SAB) -treated copper-nickel fine <b>clad</b> <b>metals</b> were investigated. An increase in the SAB rolling load of the copper-nickel fine <b>clad</b> <b>metals</b> increased the peel strength after heat treatment, indicating that increases in the SAB rolling load decreased the interface voids formed by initial micro-range surface roughness between the clad materials in the SAB cladding process. Unlike conventional cold rolling, outstanding interface diffusion between the clad materials was not observed after heat treatment. In addition, the peel strength increase of the <b>clad</b> <b>metals</b> compare with initial peel strength increased with SAB rolling load (< 1 % reduction ratio at a roll load of 5000 kgf) up to 3. 99 N/mm after heat treatment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Clad</b> <b>metals</b> are {{extensively}} {{used for}} their multi-functionality and their optimal combination {{of quality and}} cost. Roll bonding is an effective and economic processing approach to making <b>clad</b> <b>metals.</b> This dissertation presents an experimental investigation of the roll cladding process as well as thermo-mechanical modeling of mechanism for roll bonding of <b>clad</b> <b>metals.</b> The objectives of this research are to investigate the bonding mechanism of dissimilar metals in a warm rolling process and to advance {{the knowledge of the}} roll cladding process. To accomplish the objectives, aluminum 1100 sheet (Al 1100) and stainless steel 304 sheet (SST 304) are bonded by warm rolling under controlled conditions. The 180 degrees peel test is used to determine the bonding property of those <b>clad</b> <b>metals.</b> The experimental results show that the rolling thickness reduction and the entry temperature are two major factors of bonding strength. Minimum thickness reduction at a particular entry temperature is required to bond Al 1100 and SST 304. Increasing of either thickness reduction or entry temperature significantly improves the bonding strength between the two metals. X-ray microanalysis is also performed to characterize the diffusion state at the bonding interface. The diffusion coefficients of aluminum and iron are estimated through experimental method. A thermo-mechanical model was developed to describe the rolling plastic deformation of component metal sheets and the diffusion evolution during a roll bonding process of dissimilar metals. The effect of various rolling conditions on the contact area ratio was quantitatively discussed. Finite element simulation of 2 -D diffusion under the rolling created boundary conditions was performed. The peel strength during the diffusion evolution was predicted by the integrated roll bonding model. The modeling predictions correspond to the experimental results well. The correspondence validates the effectiveness of the thermo-mechanical roll bonding model. Based on experimental observation, this research presents a bonding mechanism for the roll cladding process of dissimilar metals. The roll bonding model can help optimize rolling parameters for varying bonding strength depending on the demands of the application. It can also provide insights into design and analysis of rolling bonding process of other groups of dissimilar metal sheets...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that long term service of {{installations}} in energy and refinery industry in conditions of simultaneous action of loading and corrosion-hydrogen environments causes degradation of structural steels. This process of degradation is the most intensive on grain boundaries. Therefore structures with <b>clad</b> <b>metal,</b> namely, refinery shell, should be especially sensitive to degradation process. Three types of <b>clad</b> <b>metal</b> “low alloy steel/stainless steel ” were studied: 15 HМ/ 304 L, 516 GR 60 / 410 S and 516 GR 70 /N 201.

It allows to fix at low temperature such amount hydrogen in metal which is in equilibrium at high temperature and this is the reason of the intensive hydrogen degradation.

40|$|Submerged arc strip {{cladding}} {{is often}} used when thickness of clad material is required. The productivity of this process has been improved {{by the use of}} higher welding currents and wider strips. The associated problems were arc blow, increased penetration and poor bead characteristics. Dilution is the parameter that controls almost all qualities of cladding. Magnetic steering reduces penetration, and hence, dilution and arc blow control. Stainless steel cladding on mild steel {{is often used}} to impart corrosion resistance. In such situations, the clad quality is specified by corrosion resistance, ferrite content and good fusion between <b>clad</b> <b>metal</b> and base metal. This paper discusses results of an investigation on the effect of an oscillating magnetic field used to steer the arc in submerged arc strip cladding using 60 X 0. 5 -mm 309 L stainless steel strips, with varying magnetizing flux intensity and dwell time. The resulting test pieces were evaluated for parameters that imparted the best clad quality and the results indicate the following: 1) Magnetic steering of the arc reduces dilution and corrosion rate. 2) Magnetic steering of the arc permits use of higher currents for a given dilution level, thus increasing productivity. 3) <b>Clad</b> <b>metal</b> microstructures of a desirable type are obtained when the arc is magnetically steered. 4) Use of 309 L strips for single layer cladding appears to be satisfactory since ferrite content lies between 5 to 10 % for a variety of welding conditions. 5) The corrosion rate (microns per 24 hours) is linearly related to the dilution percentage of the <b>clad</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|E
