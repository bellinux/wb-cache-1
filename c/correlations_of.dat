Then, by employing the topology of the power grid in eastern Japan, we analyze the robustness of the power grid with spatial <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> renewable energy outputs. The analysis is performed by using a realistic differential-algebraic equations model and the result shows that the spatial <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> the energy resources strongly degrades the robustness of the power grid.

We derive closed analytical expressions for the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> gene histories in established demographic models for genetic evolution and show how to extend the analysis to more realistic (but more complicated) models of demographic structure. We identify two contributions to the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> gene histories in divergent populations: linkage disequilibrium, and differences in the demographic history of individuals in the sample. These two factors contribute to correlations at different length scales: the former at small, and the latter at large scales.

40|$|Background: Anemia among {{pregnant}} women may increase abortion, premature, {{low birth weight}} and even mortality before and after delivery. Factors causing anemia in Indonesia are lack of Fe, inadequate intake, demanding needs, and lack of nutrient facilitating Fe absorption. Besides, infection such as worm and malaria may cause anemia as well. Result of household health survey 2001 stated that prevalence of {{pregnant women}} with anemia was 40 % in Indonesia. In Jambi Province, it was 39 % in 2003 and 42. 3 % for Batang Hari Regency while infection of malaria was 50. 0 % in all age groups and many other districts that its environment were woods, humid, and wasted that may increase infection of hookworm. Objective: The study was proposed to know the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> hookworm, malaria with anemia among pregnant women by analyzing <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> hookworm, malaria, and anemia and <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> hookworm, malaria and Fe status among pregnant women. Method: This was cross sectional study. It held from September until December 2005 in Batang Hari Regency, Jambi Province. Subjects were 132 pregnant women. Examination of blood for Hb, malaria and ferritin were taken together while feces were later. Results: There were no significant <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> Ascaris lumbricoides infection with anemia (p = 0. 36; OR = 2. 43), Trichiuris thrichiura infection with anemia (p = 0. 30), 2 kinds of worm Ascaris lumbricoides + Trichiuris trichiura with anemia (p = 0. 08; OR = 4. 87), and infection of Ascaris lumbricoides + Necator americanus with anemia (p = 0. 30). There was significant <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> 3 kinds of worm Ascaris lumbricoides + Trichiuris trichiura + Necator americanus with anemia (p = 0. 018; OR = 7. 3). There were no significant <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> Ascaris lumbricoides with ferritin (p = 0. 17; OR = 3. 23) and Trichiuris trichiura with ferritin (p = 0. 25). There was significant <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> 2 kinds of worm Ascaris lumbricoides + Trichiuris trichiura with ferritin (p = 0. 04; OR = 6. 4). There was no significant <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> Ascaris lumbricoides + Necator americanus with ferritin p = 0. 25.
