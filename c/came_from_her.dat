5|$|Though Obama {{indicated}} in January 2010 that a consensus {{had not been}} made about whether she would campaign, speculation of her involvement <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> large approval rating as well as reports {{that she had been}} invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.|$|E
5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} the result of several years of research, {{prompted}} by Longman, who had published Acton's Poems. Many of the recipes <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> friends. Modern Cookery quickly became a bestselling work, appearing in several editions and remaining a standard cookery book {{throughout the rest of the}} century. The book was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern cookery book writing, by listing the exact ingredients required for each recipe, the time needed, and potential problems that might arise. This was a major departure from previous cookbooks, which were less precise.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Sulhamstead Abbots, Nagle's {{family home}} in Berkshire, {{was used as a}} {{hospital}} during the First World War. There she met James Nagle, a native of Ireland who had emigrated to Canada but returned to serve with the King's Royal Rifle Corps and then had been sent to Sulhamstead Abbots to recuperate. Against her parents' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916, resulting in them threatening to disinherit her. The early days of Nagle's marriage were hard; she was used to a wealthy lifestyle– her family money <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father's successful business, Maypole Dairies– but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance. Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making cream teas, cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets. The couple had two children, a son, David, and a daughter, Patricia.|$|E

25|$|Reinhart {{has been}} {{recently}} lauded for her scatting techniques reminiscent of Fitzgerald, {{as well as}} for her yodeling. Her frequent call and response sessions during her live performances have also received particular praise. Reinhart's early vocal training <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother, and she has never been trained professionally. Growing up, she learned her scatting and call-and-response techniques from her father, who would scat and then make her repeat the sounds back to him.|$|E
25|$|Inspiration for Killigrew’s poetry <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{knowledge}} of Greek myths and Biblical proverbs {{as well as}} from some very influential female poets who lived during the Restoration period: Katherine Philips and Anne Finch (also a maid to Mary of Modena {{at the same time as}} Killigrew). Mary of Modena encouraged the French tradition of precieuses (patrician women intellectuals) which pressed women’s participation in theatre, literature, and music. In effect, Killigrew was surrounded with a poetic feminist inspiration on a daily basis in Court: she was encompassed by strong intelligent women who encouraged her writing career as much as their own.|$|E

25|$|Mary Heaton {{was born}} October 11, 1874, in New York City to Ellen Marvin Heaton and Hiram Heaton. She {{was raised in}} {{prosperity}} in Amherst, Massachusetts, in a 24-room house with half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage. The money in the family <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother's side. In 1852, Vorse's mother married Captain Charles Bernard Marvin, a wealthy shipping magnate and liquor merchant, more than 20 years her senior, {{when she was a}} young woman of 18. Ellen Marvin was widowed at age 37 with five children. In 1873, she married Mary's father, who, with his family, operated the Stockbridge Inn.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Mapp {{was baptized}} in 1706 near Wiltshire, England. She was the {{daughter}} of John and Jenny Wallin. John Wallin was a bone-setter as well, and when he was unable to conduct bone setting practices, Mapp carried on and dealt with the cases, often even better than her father. She accordingly left him and established her own practice called 'Cracked Sally - the One and Only Bone Setter'. Mapp's nickname 'Crazy Sally' <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> masculine personality and reputation for quarreling with her father and drinking. Mapp could often be found wandering the country in a drunken state and shouting obscenities, which also contributed to her nickname.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the fall}} of 1971, under the {{direction}} of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and Stephen Krashen—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—linguists continued to administer regular dichotic listening tests to Genie until 1973. Their results consistently corroborated the initial findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima. Researchers therefore concluded that Genie was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain, and definitively ruled out the possibility that Genie's language lateralization was only reversed. Due to the lack of physiological problems with Genie's left hemisphere, they believed abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> atrophied language center—blocked all language reception in her right ear but did not obstruct non-language sounds.|$|E

25|$|Naoko Takeuchi {{developed}} the Sailor Moon anime for one season. Due to the season's popularity, Toei Animation asked Takeuchi to keep drawing her manga. At first, she struggled with developing another storyline {{to extend the}} series due to Toei's request. The basic idea of the second season, introducing the daughter of Sailor Moon from the future, <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> editor, Fumio Osano. Sailor Moon is adapted from the 52 chapters of the series {{which was published in}} Nakayoshi from 1991–1997 and was directed by Junichi Satō, Kunihiko Ikuhara and Takuya Igarashi. It premiered in Japan on TV Asahi on March 7, 1992, taking over the timeslot previously held by Goldfish Warning!, and ran for 200 episodes until its conclusion on February 8, 1997.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Navy made {{modifications}} to Agincourt before commissioning her: in particular it removed the flying {{bridge over the}} two centre turrets.

According to the prosecution, the landlord accepted £200,000 {{as part of a}} deal to [...] "effectively throw the [...] case and not turn up," [...] and he testified that the money belonged to Winehouse, but she pulled out of a meeting with the men involved in the plot, to attend an awards ceremony.

500|$|After {{the commune}} of Pichilemu was officially created in 1891, Agustín Ross Edwards, a wealthy Chilean writer, member of parliament, {{government}} minister and politician, {{wanted to turn}} the town into [...] "a touristic place, an elite resort, collecting the most important characteristics of European places, {{which would make it}} unique." [...] For this purpose, he constructed a hotel, a post office, a park, among other structures and buildings, which attracted wealthy families from Chile and Argentina.
