5|$|With {{the rise}} of Fascism in Italy, his {{untouchable}} position declined. He was arrested {{and sentenced to death}} in 1930 and would remain in jail until his death. There is some <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exact year of his death, but according to La Stampa, Cascioferro died on September 20, 1943, in the prison on the island of Procida.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{starling}} (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested {{to belong to the}} bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. What is clear is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
50|$|Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} {{philosophical}} puzzles and philosophical understanding.

40|$|On the surface, {{it would}} seem that guaranteeing privacy {{protection}} for human genetic samples and information, and preventing discriminatory use of such information would be goals shared by most Australians.

5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E

40|$|Black’ writers {{writing in}} Britain, {{within the context}} of British writing, have often engaged in {{justifying}} their identities and orientation on the British stage while seeking to clarify retaining such identities without implying separatism. This has led to <b>confusions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> directions of the theatre and the motivations of the writers, and the questioning of their contributions to the national performance debate. It also shifts intersections between Black British theatre and contemporary movements in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia...|$|R

25|$|Additional <b>confusion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea of dissonance {{is created}} {{by the fact that}} musicians and writers {{sometimes}} use the word dissonance and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in a metaphorical sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are vitally important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.|$|E

All of these beliefs are incorrect as a result of provisions of the DSHEA.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{historian}} Hilal al-Sabi', al-Marzuban had a sister named Sayyida Shirin, {{who was the}} wife of the Buyid ruler Fakhr al-Dawla, and mother of Majd al-Dawla. However, according to the Qabus-nama made by the Ziyarid ruler Keikavus (who was of Bavandid descent), Sayyida Shirin was the niece of al-Marzuban. There have been several <b>confusions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reign of the Bavandid kings after the death of Rustam II.

On 29 June 1942, during the Black Sea campaign, a number of MTMs supported a diversionary German landing near Balaklava.
