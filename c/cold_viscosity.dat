However the amount of soy based products for human consumption is surprisingly low in Brazil, due, in part, to the limited preference for soy based products. During the processing of soybeans, a considerable quantity of soybean hull is discarded, but this could be used as an source of insoluble fibre in food products, for example, in extruded expanded products. The objective of this work was to study the effects of soybean hull, moisture content and temperature on the production of expanded maize extrudates. Mixtures of maize grits and soybean hull were extruded in a single screw extruder to produce directly expanded extrudates, and the effects of three independent variables, screw speed (100 - 200 rpm), temperature (100 - 200 °C) and soybean hull content (0 - 40 %) were investigated using a central composite rotatable design and response surface methodology.

Physical, chemical and rheological properties, and digestibility of the obtained extrudates were investigated in relation to non extruded samples. Addition of chestnut flour to corn meal resulted in increase of fibre, ash and fat content, and decrease of protein content, while buckwheat flour addition resulted in increase of all measured components. Chestnut and buckwheat flour addition increased whiteness and decreased yellowness of non-extruded samples. While extrusion of corn meal resulted in increase of whiteness, extrusion of both types of mixtures resulted in its decrease.

All hydrocolloids (particularly ι-carrageenan) also produced an increase in hydration properties after combination with native flours. With regard to the pasting properties of native flours combinations, all hydrocolloids produced an increase in peak viscosity (particularly gelidium agar), but only agars decreased the onset temperature of gelatinization and increased breakdown, indicating a different mechanism of action. In the presence of extruded flour, the incorporation of hydrocolloids increased the <b>cold</b> <b>viscosity</b> of flours in very different ways depending on the hydrocolloid. Both native and extruded flours exhibited higher G’ and G’’ values and a lower tanafter the incorporation of carrageenans, which, together with the lower dependence on frequency, would produce stiffer and more stable pastes/gels. Based on gel properties, greatest hardness with native and extruded flours was achieved by the incorporation of carrageenans. In general, carrageenans, besides producing stiffer and more stable pastes, gave rise to harder and clearer gels compared to those made with agar, for both their combination with extruded and native wheat flours.

Objetivou-se neste trabalho verificar as alterações estruturais e funcionais provocadas, pelos métodos de modificações físicas citados, nos amidos de {{mandioca}}, mandioquinha-salsa e batata-doce. A modificação por spray drying foi realizada com aquecimento da suspensão à 57 °C e concentração de 8 % de amido, com temperatura de saída e vazão no spray dryer, respectivamente, de 105 °C e 0, 5 L h- 1. A modificação por extrusão foi realizada no amido a 20 % de umidade, temperaturas de 25, 50 e 75 ºC, respectivamente, na 1 a zona, 2 ª zona e 3 ª zona do extrusor e rotação de 245 rpm. Após a finalização deste experimento, os resultados evidenciaram que a modificação por spray drying provocou alterações menos severas nas características dos amidos estudados. Sendo assim, foi realizado um segundo experimento com os amidos de mandioca e batata-doce a fim de determinar as melhores condições de processo da modificação por spray drying, seguindo planejamento experimental central composto rotacional nos dois ensaios experimentais. Os amidos modificados no primeiro experimento foram analisados em relação as características estruturais e propriedades de pasta e térmica. A modificação por spray drying não provocou alterações no teor de amilose, massa molecular e raio médio de giro, assim como na distribuição dos comprimentos das cadeias ramificadas de amilopectina, mostrando que não houve degradação das ligações glicosídicas. Houve redução dos picos do padrão de difração de Raios X dos amidos, refletindo na diminuição na cristalinidade relativa. A morfologia dos grânulos apresentou aglomerados para os amidos de mandioca e mandioquinha-salsa, indicando gelatinização parcial dos grânulos. O amido de mandioquinha-salsa modificado por spray drying apresentou aumento na viscosidade a frio e diminuição da viscosidade de pico e final. Para todos os amidos, houve aumento no setback (tendência a retrogradação). As temperaturas de gelatinização não sofreram alterações significativas, porém a variação da temperatura diminuiu, assim como a variação da entalpia. Os amidos modificados por extrusão não apresentaram alteração no teor de amilose e na distribuição dos comprimentos das cadeias ramificadas da amilopectina, no entanto, houve alteração na massa molecular e no raio médio de giro, indicando provável rompimento das ligações glicosídicas. Os amidos modificados por extrusão apresentaram redução total dos picos do padrão de difração dos amidos, indicando total gelatinização. Nas imagens de microscopia eletrônica de varredura não foram observados grânulos para todos os tratamentos, confirmando a gelatinização total do amido com perda da estrutura granular durante o processo de extrusão, o que também foi observado pela ausência de curva de gelatinização na análise de propriedade térmica. Tais alterações levaram a um aumento na viscosidade a frio. As modificações por spray drying e extrusão resultam em amidos com diferentes propriedades, sendo que o amido modificado por spray drying seria indicado para produtos que necessitem de consistência mais firme, enquanto o amido modificado por extrusão seria indicado para produtos com viscosidade a frio e com consistência mais fluída. Em relação aos amidos estudados, o amido de mandioquinha-salsa apresentou maior sensibilidade ao processo, devido sua temperatura de gelatinização ser próxima às temperaturas utilizadas, e também, pelo defeito na área cristalina. Os resultados obtidos no segundo experimento evidenciaram que as melhores condições de modificação dos amidos de mandioca e de batata-doce por spray drying são: alta temperatura (60 °C) e baixa concentração (5 %). Nas condições citadas, podem ser obtidos amidos modificados por spray drying com boas características de pasta e térmica, como leve viscosidade a frio, consistência no produto final e temperatura de gelatinização uniforme, refletindo em melhor utilização de energia no processo. Pregelatinized starches {{can be used}} in applications of convenience products by the food industry, since they have greater solubility in cold water and low gelatinization temperature. The physical modification by spray drying and extrusion are methods which can result in changes in the crystalline region, with changes in the thermal and pasting properties of starch. The aim of this work was to verify the structural and functional changes caused by physical modification methods mentioned in starches from cassava, Peruvian carrot and sweet potato. The modification by spray drying was performed using temperature of 57 °C and concentration of 8 %, with outlet temperature and feed rate in spray dryer of 105 °c and 0. 5 L h- 1, respectively. The modification by extrusion was carried out with 20 % of starch moisture, with temperatures of 25 °C, 50 °C and 75 °C in the 1 st zone, 2 nd zone and 3 rd zone respectively, and rotation 245 rpm. After completion of this experiment, the results show that the modification by spray drying caused less severe changes in the characteristics of the studied starches. Thus, it was conducted a second experiment with starches from cassava and sweet potato, {{in order to determine the}} best process conditions of modification by spray drying, following experimental design central composite rotational in both experimental tests. The modified starches of the first experiment were analyzed for structural characteristics and thermal and pasting properties. The modification by spray drying caused no changes in the amylose content, molecular weight and the average gyration radius, and distribution branch chains-length of amylopectin showing that there was no degradation of glycosides bonds. There was reduction of the peaks of the diffraction pattern of starches, reflecting in decrease of relative crystallinity. The morphology of the granules showed agglomerates for the starches of cassava and Peruvian carrot, indicating partial gelatinization of the granules. Modified starch of Peruvian carrot by spray drying showed increase in <b>cold</b> <b>viscosity</b> and decrease in peak and final viscosity. For all starches, there was increase in setback. The temperatures of gelatinization no showed significant changes, although the temperature range decrease, as well as the enthalpy change. Modified starches by extrusion no show change in the amylose content and the distribution of branch chains-length of amylopectin, however, changes were observed in the molecular weight and the average gyration radius, indicating likely breaking of glycosidic bonds. Modified starches by extrusion showed total reduction in peaks of the diffraction pattern of the starches, indicating complete gelatinization of starches. In scanning electron microscopy observed no granules, confirming complete gelatinization of the starch, with loss of granular structure during the extrusion process, which also were observed by absence of gelatinization curve in thermal analysis. These changes leaded to increase of <b>cold</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The modifications by spray drying and extrusion resulted in starches with different properties, being the modified starch by spray drying can be indicated to apply in products that need of firmness consistency, and the modified starch by extrusion may be indicated to apply in products with <b>cold</b> <b>viscosity</b> and less consistency. Among of studied starches, Peruvian carrot starch showed be more susceptible for both process, due to its gelatinization temperature to be near the temperatures used in these experiments, and due to its defect in crystalline area. The results obtained in the second experiment show that the best conditions for modification of starches of cassava and sweet potato by spray drying are: high temperature (60 °C) and low concentration (5 %). In these conditions can be obtained modified starches by spray drying with good pasting and thermal properties, as the <b>cold</b> <b>viscosity,</b> consistency in final product and gelatinization temperature uniform between the granules, reflecting in better utilization of energy by process...|$|E

The yams were processed by peeling, cubing, and blanching at 100 ºC for 5 or 10 min, drying at 50 ºC and subsequently milled to flours and fractionated to 40, 60, or 80 mesh sizes. Another batch of the tubers were processed similarly, {{but they were not}} subjected to a blanching treatment. Swelling capacity, water absorption capacities, bulk density, solubility and pasting characteristics were evaluated. The result showed that the lesser known yam Ighu exhibited significantly higher (p< 0. 05) hot and <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosities,</b> solubility, water absorption and swelling capacities than the common yam varieties. Hot and <b>Cold</b> paste <b>viscosities,</b> solubility, water absorption and swelling capacities of flour generally increased as particle size decreased in all the test samples. While the bulk density was not affected by the blanching treatment, it decreased with decrease in particle size. The yam starches generally showed weak stability,but starch of the lesser known variety Ona suffered the least share thinning. Rate of retrogradation was found to be high in all the yam varieties but more pronounced in the lesser known yams Ighu and Ona. Ighu starch which exhibited the highest cold and hot paste viscosity showed the highest setback and index of gelatinization values. Industrial and culinary applications of the test yam varieties were suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to screen starches recovered from the corn accessions used in the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project for unusual thermal properties and paste and gel behaviors, so that they could be exploited in corn breeding programs to enhance traits important to corn utilization. In general, the values for gelatinization temperatures and peak height indices were greater, but heat of gelatinization values were less for the starches recovered from the GEM accessions (particularly BRA 052051 (SE 32)) than for starches from commercial Dent corn hybrids (11. 3 vs. 13. 6 J/g). Generally, retrogradation properties were similar among the GEM accessions, although there were specific accessions (particularly Lima 13) that possessed modestly lower percentage retrogradation (34 vs. 42 %). Generally, peak <b>viscosities,</b> <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosities,</b> and viscosity breakdowns were greater for the starches of the GEM accessions (particularly ARZM 01150, Antiqua 3, and URZM 01089, respectively) than for the starches of commercial hybrids. Pasting temperatures were about the same for all starches. Both 1 -day and 7 -day gel strengths were considerably greater for the starches recovered from the GEM accessions (particularly BRA 052051 (SE 32), 21. 0 g for 1 -day and FS 8 A(T), 66. 2 g for 7 -day). Although the differences in starch properties were statistically different, only the higher gel strengths of the starches recovered from the GEM accessions were of practical significance to the starch industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of amylopectin and its φ{symbol},β-limit dextrins from starch of 13 amaranth cultivars {{was determined by}} HPAEC-PAD after debranching. Chain length profiles of amylopectins showed bimodal distributions. The molar-based ratios of the average chain lengths of amylopectins (CLap) ranged from 17. 41 to 18. 22. The molar-based average chain lengths (CLld) and average B-chain lengths (BCLld) of φ{symbol},β-limit dextrins varied from 7. 68 to 8. 05, and from 14. 10 to 14. 73, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated that most structural parameters were positively correlated with thermal properties with few exceptions, whereas the content of fraction fa′ ("′" stands for molar-based chain length ratio) was negatively correlated with the thermal properties. Pasting properties of <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity</b> (CPV) and setback were also correlated with amylopectin structural parameters. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{effect of}} betacyanin {{pigments}} from Amaranthus tricolor and Amaranthus cruentus on chromatic and physicochemical properties of three wheat flours was studied. Addition of Amaranthus betacyanins increased the gelatinization temperatures (To, Tp, and Tc) of all wheat flours without altering their transition ranges (Tc-To). The melting enthalpies (ΔH) were either increased or decreased {{depending on the}} types of flour and pigment. Amaranthus betacyanins decreased the peak viscosity (PV), hot paste <b>viscosity</b> (HPV), <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity</b> (CPV), setback (SB), and pasting time (PT) of all flours and increased the breakdown (BD). Texture profile analysis (TPA) showed that Amaranthus betacyanins decreased hardness, and gumminess, and increased cohesiveness of all gels, without altering adhesiveness. Chromatic investigation exhibited that A. tricolor and A. cruentus pigments imparted gels with red and orange-yellow hues with favorable color stability. © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{hydrophilic}} (HLB 15) sucrose ester (SE) emulsifier on native starches from maize, potato, tapioca and wheat (normal starches with approximately 20 - 25 % amylose) and mutant waxy (100 % amylopectin) and Hylon VII (high amylose) maize starches were studied. ^ The SE reduced iodine binding capacity (IBC) and glucoamylase digestibility of native, normal starches and high amylose maize starch, presumably due to starch-SE inclusion complex formation. A weak, limited interaction was observed between waxy maize starch (amylopectin) and the SE. ^ The SE reduced the enthalpy of gelatinization of the normal starches, but not waxy maize starch, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicating that complex formation between the SE and amylose occurred during starch gelatinization. Complex formation was further confirmed {{by the presence of}} a complex melting endotherm during rescanning (reheating) of samples by DSC. ^ Starch fractions solubilized by boiling and sonication of normal, waxy and Hylon VII maize starches were evaluated by high performance size exclusion chromatography. Addition of the SE to presolubilized starch samples preferentially removed amylose from solution, presumably due to precipitation of insoluble starch-SE complex. Weak interactions between SE and amylopectin resulting in formation of soluble aggregates was suggested but not confirmed. ^ Unique cooking properties of each of the starches studied were demonstrated in Rapid Visco-Analyzer viscosity profiles. The SE increased time to peak for the normal starches and waxy maize starch, suggesting interaction between the starch and SE due to complex formation at the granule surface during gelatinization. Hot and <b>cold</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the normal starches were also affected by the SE but the direction and magnitude of the effect varied with starch type. ^ X-ray diffraction confirmed V-hydrate (inclusion) complex formation between the SE and normal maize but not waxy maize starch. Preliminary NMR data indicated some interaction between normal and waxy maize starches and the SE during starch gelatinization although the nature of the interaction could not be determined. ...|$|R
40|$|Sweetpotato starch is high-yielding, but {{has limited}} {{development}} and uses. In this study, physicochemical properties of sweetpotato starch from 11 representative genotypes with diverse geographic origins in China were characterized and showed wide variations. Apparent amylose contents measured by iodine binding ranged from 23. 3 to 26. 5 %, by gel permeation chromatography after debranching from 17. 5 to 23. 9 %, and true amylose content by concanavalin A binding from 15. 9 to 22. 5 %. In vitro digestibility varied from 29. 5 to 41. 2 %. Swelling power and water solubility index were highly correlated (r 2 = 0. 88). Gelatinization peak temperature and enthalpy ranged from 75. 4 to 79. 7 °C, and 7. 6 to 13. 6 J/g, respectively. Pasting peak and <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosities</b> varied from 268 to 469 RVU, and 170 to 284 RVU. Amylose contents were highly correlated to digestibility, pasting, and thermal parameters.

40|$|The {{effect of}} amylose-lipid (AM-L) {{complexes}} consisting of amylose populations with different peak degrees of polymerization (DP) and complexed with glyceryl monostearate (GMS) or docosanoic acid (C 22) on the pasting properties of wheat and rice starches was evaluated with a rapid visco analyzer (RVA). AM-L complexes were formed by both (i) addition of lipids to amylose fractions with peak DP 20, 60, 400, or 950 at 60 degrees C or (ii) potato phosphorylase-catalyzed amylose synthesis {{in the presence}} of lipids. All AM-L complexes affected pasting properties in line with their dissociation characteristics. AM-L complexes therefore have potential as "controlled lipid release agents" with effects markedly different from those observable with emulsifier addition in starch pasting. More in particular, short chain AM-L complexes resulted in a starch pasting behavior comparable to that of cross-linked starch, as evidenced by reduced granule swelling, good viscosity stability in conditions of high temperature and shear, and a stable <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Flaxseed powder {{contained}} 21. 8 % protein and 42. 7 % total dietary fiber, which upon roasting reduced to 20. 3 and 40. 50 %, respectively. Addition of flaxseed powder weakened the dough. Peak <b>viscosity</b> and <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity</b> also decreased. The volume of the muffins gradually decreased from 150 to 145 and 120 cc. Muffins prepared from 20 % of raw and roasted flaxseed powder had 10. 2 and 9. 9 % of protein and 12. 8 and 11. 7 % of dietary fiber, respectively. omega- 3 fatty acid contents in raw and roasted flaxseed powder were 55. 41 and 50. 76 %, and the muffins prepared with 20 % raw and roasted flaxseed powder had 12. 85 and 11. 14 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} amylases on the rapid visco analysis rheological properties of starch were studied {{and the accompanying}} changes in the starch molecular properties were analyzed with high performance size exclusion chromatography. Different amylases affect the rheological properties of starch slurries and the molecular weight of the starch molecules to a degree depending on their mode of action and properties such as thermostability. Endo-amylases generally reduced the viscosity and the amylose and amylopectin molecular weight (MW) whereas an exo-amylase had little effect. In contrast, a maltogenic amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus had a markedly different effect on the rheological and molecular properties of starch. Remarkably, the <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity</b> (CPV) exceeded that of the control slurry even at high enzyme dosages. Furthermore, this enzyme specifically affected the amylose population, which gained in monodispersity while largely maintaining its MW. In addition, an interesting relationship between CPV and amylose peak degree of polymerisation was found. These results may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of amylase functionality in bread making. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Single screw {{extrusion}} of cassava starch was evaluated as a pre-treatment for the enzymatic hydrolysis of the extrudate and fermentation to yield alcohol. The acid concentration, barrel temperature and moisture content showed {{that all the}} variables were significant. Increasing acid concentration or barrel temperature induced starch depolymerisation with a higher water solubility index and lower water absorption index. At 20 and 24 % moisture contents the <b>cold</b> paste <b>viscosity</b> decreased. As {{a result of the}} addition of acid during extrusion cooking the degree of starch hydrolysis resulted in low hot paste viscosity. Acid concentration was significant in the production of reducing sugars. At concentrations above 0. 024 N, as the temperature increased, the reducing sugar content also increased. Nevertheless, at concentrations below 0. 024 N, the reducing sugar content showed the opposite result. The best yield of alcohol obtained from the extruded starch was 98. 7 % (0. 56 g of ethanol/g starch), which, on average, was 5. 7 % and 6. 8 % higher than that obtained from starch extruded without acid and from starch gelatinized by the conventional method, respectively...|$|R
