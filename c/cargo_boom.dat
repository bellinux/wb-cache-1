50|$|On 16 August 2013, Yurchikhin {{performed}} {{his seventh}} spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. They first {{set up a}} Strela <b>cargo</b> <b>boom</b> on the Poisk module. Misurkin used the Strela boom to maneuver Yurchikhin with cables and Yurchikhin rerouted a cable connector and installed cables on the Zarya module. The cable work outside the station was to prepare the ISS for the planned arrival of the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) - Nauka. The spacewalk ended at seven hours, 29 minutes when the cosmonauts closed the Pirs docking compartment hatch and re-entered the space station. The spacewalk set a new Russian spacewalk record, eclipsing the old mark of seven hours and 16 minutes set by two cosmonauts outside the Mir space station in July 1990. However, the record held by Yurchikhin and Misurkin was soon eclipsed by cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky when they performed an eight hours, seven minutes spacewalk on 27 December 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge {{clearance}} is 135 ft, {{which some}} officials have deemed {{too low for}} ships to navigate. [...] By the time the V-struts supporting the mainspan were put in place, the Port of Houston claimed the struts were an even more dangerous hazard to ships that must veer {{from the middle of}} the waterway. By some accounts, port officials protested, but TxDOT did not listen to their pleas. The bridge cost TxDOT $19 million in its current configuration; a higher clearance would have cost more, and the agency went on to investigate that ships did not need a 120 foot (37 m) clearance. This decision proved to be a mistake. Several ships have collided with the bridge over a period of 27 years, but despite this the bridge only suffered minor damage and was still intact. That all changed in December 2000 when a cargo crane struck the bridge, knocking a hole in the concrete deck and damaging a steel beam. The damage took six weeks to repair, forcing several lanes to be closed in the process. [...] However, the worst accident happened in May 2001 when a freighter's <b>cargo</b> <b>boom</b> caused severe damage to a girder and put another gaping hole in the span. Several lanes of the bridge were closed for two months while repairs were completed.|$|E

There is also another version with an aluminum hull. This version was carried aboard all of the Charlston class LKA ships, as the steel version was too heavy to be lifted by the ship's 40 ton fore and aft booms, preventing more than two from being lowered (via the two 70 ton fore and aft <b>cargo</b> <b>booms)</b> at one time. They are now mostly carried by pre-positioned ships.|$|R
5000|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training in}} the Virginia Capes area, the attack cargo ship departed Hampton Roads on 5 January 1945 and steamed through the Panama Canal to Hawaii. After spending {{the last week of}} the month in Pearl Harbor, the ship embarked 33 Navy passengers and proceeded, via Eniwetok, to the Carolines and discharged her passengers at Ulithi on 13 February. Two days later, she proceeded via the Palaus to the Philippines. After her arrival in Leyte Gulf on 21 February, the ship commenced preparations for the assault on the Ryukyus. At dawn on 1 April 1945, the Southern Attack Force, to which Tyrrell was attached, arrived off Hagushi, Okinawa. At 0550, as battleships, cruisers, and destroyers commenced bombardment of Japanese defenses — Tyrrell began lowering her boats. By 0644, the last of her landing craft was in the water and headed for the beach. For the next nine days, Tyrrell remained off Okinawa, supporting the conquest of that island stronghold. On 2 April, a twin-engined Japanese bomber attempted to crash the ship, diving through a storm of anti-aircraft fire. In an attempt to ram the bridge, the aircraft sheared off the ship's main radio antenna, hit the lower yardarm support on the starboard side of the mainmast, and continued on to sideswipe the starboard 5-ton <b>cargo</b> <b>boom</b> at the number 5 hatch. As the aircraft crashed alongside, it blew up and showered the cargo ship's decks with pieces of wreckage. On 4 April, heavy cruiser [...] came alongside to receive 600 rounds of eight-inch projectiles and 1,200 cans of powder. In turn, Tyrrell received all of the cruiser's empty shell casings. The following day, while at anchor in the transport area, Tyrrells gunners joined in damaging an attacking Japanese bomber. Upon completion of unloading on 9 April, Tyrrell retired, via Guam and Pearl Harbor, to the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco on 11 May. She then made two runs to Pearl Harbor carrying cargo. On 27 July, the cargo ship got underway for the Marshall Islands. While en route to Majuro, she received orders on 4 August diverting her to Roi, where she arrived on 9 August. Four days later, while she unloaded cargo at Majuro, word was received that Japan had surrendered.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the capture}} of Ie Shima and until mid-June 1945 Amphibious Group 4 {{retained}} responsibility for naval support of troop operations in northern Okinawa. For Panamint this was a two-and-a-half month period of nightly aerial attacks. [...] Kamikaze planes were in evidence from before D-Day, but the first mass enemy air attack occurred on 6 April. No ships of the Northern Attack Force were hit. Other large scale attacks came on the 12th, 16th, 22nd, and 28th. On the 30th a plane crashed into Liberty ship S. Hall Young, 800 yards from Panamint, and carrying ammunition. A bomb from the plane pierced the shell plating {{on both sides of}} the ship in the vicinity of the No. 5 hold. The plane itself struck the after boom and fell into the hold, starting a fire. Panamint’s fire and rescue party boarded the S. Hall Young and extinguished the fire. On 6 May when a plane approached Panamint from the starboard beam, Panamint, her sister ships, and shore batteries on Ie Shima commenced firing. The plane circled to port for a suicide dive, but the anti-aircraft fire proved effective. He overshot Panamint, splashing 1500 yards off her port bow. On the 11th two enemy planes were sighted low over the water approaching the Ie Shima transport area on the starboard beam. The planes were following an evasive course to get through the screening vessels which had commenced firing. [...] Panamint opened fire on one of the planes, which dropped a torpedo. Panamint put her rudder hard right at full speed and swung on the anchor to a position paralleling the course of the approaching plane and torpedo. The plane erupted into flames, passed 150 yards astern of Panamint, glanced off the <b>cargo</b> <b>boom</b> of Dutch ship , and splashed into the sea. The torpedo passed the stern of the ship. The second plane closed on the starboard bow, dropped a torpedo which passed to starboard and cleared Panamint’s stern by 30 feet. [...] In the first 45 days, the ships of Amphibious Group 4 were exposed to many [...] "Red Alerts." [...] Only nine days were free of enemy air raids. Throughout this ordeal Panamint directed the Combat Air Patrol attacks in repelling the enemy. On 15 June Panamint steamed to Saipan and then on to Pearl Harbor, arriving 8 July. [...] On 12 August 1945 the ship sailed for Adak, Aleutian Islands, where she reported for duty to Commander North Pacific Force and Area. On 29 August Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander North Pacific Force and Area, hoisted his flag on Panamint. Two days later she left Adak with the 9th Fleet and headed west for the occupation of northern Japan. [...] On 7 September the flagship pulled away from the anchored task force and proceeded to a rendezvous point to await the Japanese surrender ship from nearby Ōminato Naval Base. On schedule a Japanese destroyer escort bore down the Tsugaru Strait carrying emissaries to hand over northern Japan, and pilots to guide the American ships through Japanese waters. The commissioners were quickly transferred to Panamint. Commodore R. E. Robinson, Jr., represented Vice Admiral Fletcher, and Rear Admiral Zensuke Kanome was the head of the Japanese delegation. On the morning of the 8th the massive naval force got underway led by a Japanese frigate through the mineswept channel and Tsugaru Strait leading to Ōminato Anchorage. Panamint moored off the shattered naval base that afternoon, and the following morning the formal occupation ceremony was held on her decks. Surrender had come so quickly that two weeks passed before American troops arrived to occupy the countryside. On 20 September Panamint returned to Adak, and proceeded to Kodiak on 2 October. Panamint next served as flagship for Rear Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble, Commander Minecraft Pacific Fleet. Admiral Struble transferred his flag to Panamint on 20 November 1945 from the minelayer Terror (CM-5). [...] Upon leaving this command she departed from Sasebo, Japan, arriving at San Francisco on 28 March 1946.|$|E

Chinese economic impact is studied under the two major headings: the effective use of non-living and living resources. Next, an overview of the current maritime profile of India is presented followed by a comparative discussion to understand the reasons for India to lag behind China in the maritime field. The outlook for global shipping, taking into account the possibility of strong economic growth in India, is presented. This is performed by comparing the expected impact on global shipping due to India, to the one observed in 2004 due to China. This comparative analysis foresees a plausible shipping <b>boom</b> in select <b>cargo</b> types namely liquid and dry bulk <b>cargo.</b> No <b>boom</b> in containers shipping is expected.
