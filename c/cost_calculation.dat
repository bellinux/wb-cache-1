[...] Prior to this system, designers had estimated new car costs using prior comparison models. [...] The development of the Toyota <b>Cost</b> <b>Calculation</b> System earned Dr. Hori the nickname [...] "Dr. Cost-Magician" [...] within the company, and he was given further vehicle development positions. [...] In the early 2000s, Dr. Hori was named executive chief engineer of the second generation Toyota Prius. He also {{took charge of the}} Celica and MR2 projects, destined for worldwide markets, the Avensis for Europe, the Caldina and Opa for Japan, and the Scion tC for the US. An avid test track driver, Dr. Hori alternated between his design duties and high-speed vehicle drives. [...] At the culmination of the Toyota Prius development project, Dr. Hori and his team had amassed 530 patents for the Hybrid Synergy Drive system and other elements of the Prius design.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper deals {{about the}} {{problematic}} of target costing implementation into the managerial decisions. These decisions make value analysis principles for increasing in competitiveness by the setting off limits for maximum allowable costs which should not exceeded by company manufacturing. By {{this approach is}} possible to improve product quality, service, shortening {{the research and development}} period and continual effort to lower costs. Target costing as a modern method of calculation uses the principles of value analysis, by using instruments of functional cost analysis and quantitative-function deployment can provide a functional differentiation of the product. This approach has a high importance for quality assurance in pre-production phase and it's increasing. Application of target costing is growing in praxis still. Target <b>costing</b> <b>calculation</b> introduce system approach to quantify costs of product in the phase of constructive and development activities of production. Comparison target <b>costing</b> <b>calculation</b> and traditional calculation show target gap. Target <b>costing</b> <b>calculation</b> is new modern instrument that it facilitates to manage price of product by the customers’ requirements. The price is determined by market and customer's needs. In this phase is possible to fix costs of product. In praxis we often meet with situation where the price of product is very high and customer is not ready to pay so much.

50|$|Testing is also fairly {{important}} from an economical {{point of}} view. As {{it is said}} that the failure cost increase by a factor of ten for each stage before it gets discovered.Most MEMS producers check their products at two distinct stages(at the wafer level, and the packaging), as well as random sampling on every stage.If one includes this into <b>cost</b> <b>calculation</b> for a MEMS device the costs for testing amounts to 20-50% of the overall unit costs.Even when looking at producers that manufacture MEMS, and CMOS devices it is not really possible to reduce the costs by including the economy of scopes effect for testing, as both types of device. This is because even though about 80% of the processing is shared, only 20% of the tests are.To decrease these costs for U.S manufactures the National Institute of Standards and Technologies(NIST) conducted several workshops and questionnaires to tackle this issue and increase competitiveness of US companies.|$|E
50|$|Freight cost reports can be {{generated}} to compare the freight costs for forwarders and the customers may use such reports to flag out service failures, negotiate for better freight deals or the opportunity to consolidate the shipments to a forwarder for a better rate. Customers can simulate the freight <b>cost</b> <b>calculation</b> for new freight rates or packages proposed by the forwarder and determine if this is suitable for their business model.With large fluctuations in the surcharges, the accounts department will have lower visibility in accruing freight cost. By choosing a freight invoice verification model, a customer can forecast the freight cost to be accrued for accounting purposes. This translates to lesser risk and more predictability in cash flow for the company. Akzo Nobel’s automated freight audit process has also instilled tighter controls over their freight accounting by eliminating human communication and intervention {{from the point of}} the freight quote to the payment process. By controlling the human communication and minimizing human intervention, the audit process will be unbiased and less likely to deviate from the proper process.|$|E
