40|$|M. A. This {{study is}} based on the {{principles}} of the subjectivist approach of Cognitive Linguistics, as opposed to the more traditional objectivist view, specifically those principles applicable to the acquisition of mental contact between <b>conceptualizers</b> in a given communication situation. One of the most fundamental points of departure of Cognitive Linguistics is the opinion that abstractions (even linguistic abstractions) are modelled on man's bodily experience of his surrounding reality. These embodied experiences constitute a network of preconceptual and non-propositional image schemas, categorized as space schemas, force dynamic schemas, schemas based on sensation and basic-level objects. Several mapping processes, including metaphor and metonymy, transpose these image schemas from a preconceptual, prelinguistic level to a conceptual and linguistic niveau. A prerequisite for conceptualization through linguistic communication is to constitute mental contact between the speaker and hearer as the <b>conceptualizers.</b> Linguistic communication presupposes the transfer of meaning, which {{is based on}} certain cognitive variables determining mental spaces and conceptual blends. Against the preceding background, the newspaper headline, as cognitive entity, constitutes the research domain by means of which the nature of the potential mental contact between the headline writer (as speaker) and the headline reader (as hearer) in a specific communication situation is analysed and evaluated. A seemingly useful and potent cognitive measuring instrument regarding presupposed and actualised mental contact, by means of which any written or spoken communication can be analysed and evaluated, is the outcome of this study. A set of examples of headlines was collected from the Afrikaans daily newspaper, Beeld, and the Afrikaans Sunday paper, Rapport, from February 1996 until September 1998, serving as research material...|$|R

40|$|In {{search of}} a deeper {{understanding}} of perspective-taking, the paper aims at isolating the basic components of complex perspectivization tasks. Based on the assumption that perspective is a relational concept constituted by the dynamic relation between a <b>conceptualizer’s</b> point of view and a conceptualized object and, as such, a concept which is shared by both language and cognition, the paper draws a comparison between the developmental stages of cognitive perspectival capabilities, grammatical perspectivization, and viewpoint comprehension in narrative discourse. This comparison leads to a multi-stage model of degrees of perspectival complexity, whereby the most complex tasks in both language and cognition are characterized by a three-point constellation that integrates contrasting internal vs. external perspectives under a superordinated monitoring viewpoint. As a result, the paper argues that a concept of perspective ‘taking’ is not sufficient to capture the specific aspects of L(anguage) -perspectivization, but has to be complemented by a concept of ‘confronting’ perspectives.

Responses to questions about language and tool use illustrate the dominant position of OWL and provide information about the OWL profiles and particular Description Logic features used. The survey revealed a considerable range of ontology sizes and analysis suggests a classification into two broad groups; one where ontologies have very few individuals, the other in which {{the number of individuals}} is more commensurate with the number of classes. The survey also reports on the use of ontology visualization software, finding that the importance of visualization to ontology users varies considerably. Pattern use is also examined in detail, drawing on further input from a follow-up study devoted exclusively to this topic. Evidence suggests that pattern creation and use are frequently informal processes and {{there is a need for}} improved tools. An analysis of the purposes for which ontologies are used suggests a classification into four categories of users: <b>conceptualizers,</b> integrators, searchers and multipurpose users. It is proposed that the categorisation of users and user behaviour should be taken into account when designing ontology tools and methodologies. This should enable rigorous, user-specific use cases...|$|R

40|$|In the {{standard}} version of conceptual metaphor theory, metaphors are stable connected {{structures in the}} conceptual sys-tem that emerge either because there is some similarity between two domains of experience (resemblance-based metaphors) or because the two domains are correlated in bodily experience (correlation-based metaphors). I propose {{that in addition to}} these two types of metaphor there is a third one, I call them “context-induced ” metaphors. These metaphors emerge from the (immediate and less immediate) context in which conceptu-alizers conceive of ideas in metaphorical ways. I suggest that the context can have a priming effect on (metaphorical) conceptualization. The effect of various kinds of context on metaphorical conceptualization can take a variety of forms, and several of them produce imagistic metaphors. The kinds of contexts that can produce context-induced metaphors include the following: (1) the immediate physical setting, (2) {{what we know about the}} major entities participating in the dis-course, (3) the immediate cultural context, (4) the immediate social setting, and (5) the immediate linguistic context itself. Of these, the context that most clearly produces visual metaphors is the immediate physical setting. Various aspects of the physical setting can prompt <b>conceptualizers</b> to select var-ious (visual, auditory, etc.) images from the context as source domains for their metaphorical targets. This process can be ei-ther conscious or unconscious. In the paper, I discuss several examples of imagistic metaphors of the visual kind...|$|R
40|$|Futurity: {{integrating}} {{form and}} intersubjective meaning Context – In {{contrast to the}} vast literature on modality, only few cognitive linguistic studies have been devoted exclusively to the expression of futurity. This paper shows how cognitive linguistics (CL) may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the linguistic form and meaning of futurity in Italian and German. Three theoretical cognitive frameworks – We combine the following theoretical constructs inspired by CL. (1) Langacker’s (1991 : 244) extended epistemic offers a temporal and modal template for situating future predications, which overlaps with a second, discursive time-line: a <b>conceptualizer’s</b> current discourse space (CDS, Langacker 2001) which represents time as discourse unfolds (Chilton 2005). (2) We pursue Verhagen’s (2005) idea that linguistic structures do not only profile the object of conceptualization but also potential (inter) subjective viewpoints of multiple, embedded <b>conceptualizers,</b> who refer to specific temporal positions on Langacker’s time-line. (3) We discuss the constructional patterns and conceptual representations used in blended (Fauconnier & Turner 2002) co-occurrence of futurity and actuality. Research questions – We describe the blending of intersubjective positions which implies 4 aspects: (1) the relation between conceptualizations of present and future time positions, like a precursive (present) perspective and prospective (future) counterpart; (2) the shifts between perspectives on the axis of represented time which occur along temporal, and eventually, through modal and spatial discourse vectors, (3) the fact that these vectors are set up by heterogeneous enunciative subjects; (4) the German and Italian constructional patterns exploited for blending temporal positions, perspectives and subjects. Methodology and sample data – Our corpus-based approach combines cognitive approaches with authentic language data in popularizing discourse: a publication ordered by Cordis (European Commission) to the German Science and Training department (BMBF), and its Italian translation by Veneto Nanotech (approximately 100 pp.). Science popularization typically deals with representing possible future everyday applications of complex concepts in scientific theory. One of these popularized concepts is nanotechnology, which deals with the miniaturization of technological artefacts. There is a growing social and political concern about popularization of nanosciences: how can a multilingual audience be convinced of their assets. Results – We provide a typology and evidence for the CL representation of futurity, based on Italian and German. Generally speaking, the case shows the nexus between conceptualization in CL and its strategic implications for the political-institutional and societal aspects of nanotechnology. More specifically, this grammatical description shows the creative and dynamic nature of meaning construction, which blends multiple temporal representations. It shows how creating new concepts strongly relies on futurity. References Chilton, P. 2005. Vectors, Viewpoint and viewpoint shift. Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, Volume 3. 78 – 116.

40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of pupils' levels of {{conceptualization}} of words on reading achievement was {{the purpose of this}} study. Levels of conceptualization was measured ona multiple-choice test using three categories of word definitions: abstract, functional and verbalism. The abstract category was interpreted to be abstract conceptualization and consisted of word definitions that involved either synonyms, antonyms or classifications. The functional category was interpreted to be concrete conceptualization and included responses that indicated action or use of a word. Verbalism category included responses that were non-distinguishing or repeated the stimulus word and was considered to be at the concrete conceptualization level. Using stimulus words taken from basal readers, the multiple-choice vocabulary test, named the Levels of Meaning Test, was designed to measure the three levels of conceptualization. Each multiple-choice item included an abstract, functional, and verbalism definition. Students were asked to choose one of the three definitions provided for a stimulus word that they preferred, Satisfactory reliability and validity for the Levels of Meaning Test were found with pilot studies. Vocabulary difficulty in the Levels of Meaning Test was controlled to be no more difficult than fifth grade level, and the test was read aloud to the students to minimize differences in reading ability. Two-hundred-ninety-eight fifth graders from a middle size Mid-western city were tested with the Levels of Meaning Test,. Results on the Levels of Meaning Test were correlated with reading achievement, intelligence, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Reading achievement was determined by comprehension and vocabulary subtests of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Level D. Intelligence was measured with-cthe California Test of Mental Maturity, Short Form, which yielded a verbal, non-verbal, and total I. Q [...] Socioeconomic status was rated middle or lower classification according to occupation of head of household. Ethnicity was classed as either white or non-white on the basis of appearance; the non-white population being exclusively Negro. Results of the reading achievement and intelligence test indicated that the sample population approximated national norms in reading ability and intelligence. Correlating responses according to the three levels of meaning with reading achievement resulted in significant correlations, Students who scored high on abstract responses did significantly better on the subtests of the reading achievement test than students who scored high on functional and verbalism responses. Similarly, responses on the Levels of Meaning Test, were positively, significantly correlated with verbal I. Q. Non-verbal and total I. Q. also correlated significantly with levels of meaning though not to the high degree of verbal I. Q [...] Socioeconomic status was significantly correlated. Middle classification status was positively correlated with responses on the abstract category. Ethnicity was also significantly correlated with the Levels of Meaning Test; white students chose abstract responses more frequently than the non-white students. No significant correlation was found between sex and levels of conceptualization on the Levels of, Meaning Test. Using the multiple regression technique, variables in combination that predicted abstractual levels of conceptualization were high reading achievement, high verbal I. Q., and white ethnicity. Low reading achievement, low verbal I. Q., and non-white ethnicity predicted high scores in the functional and verbalism categories. Results of this study indicated that the ways fifth graders in this sample population conceptualized words were important to reading achievement. Predictive models of students apt to be abstract or concrete <b>conceptualizers</b> were found. Implications for instruction were that concrete <b>conceptualizers</b> should be given special consideration in developing word meaning to facilitate comprehension and subsequent achievement.

(Re) building some of El Lissitzky's output as virtual artifacts constituted my contribution to a collaborative Second Life venture which was part of a large exhibition that was held in the Spring of 2014 in the Manege Museum in Moscow. The <b>conceptualizers</b> of the project, filmmaker Peter Greenaway and artist Saskia Boddeke, were supported by the British Council to create a mega-exhibit by combining film, animation and 3 D virtual world technology that were brought together to create a unified atmospheric setting which drew the viewer into the period of the Russian avant-garde. More than 1, 000 artworks, borrowed from galleries and private collections around the world, were displayed across 5000 square metres, woven together with a gigantic polyscreen installation which combined real and virtual film footage that also featured our Second Life collaboration. Having long been a great admirer of El Lissitzky's oeuvre, when I was invited by Saskia Boddecke to contribute to their project, I immediately asked her whether it would be possible for me to concentrate exclusively on his output - a proposal to which she had no objection to.

40|$|Context – This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the conceptualization and grammatical realization of futurity. Expressing future newness through grammar is a locus for creativity, {{in the sense that}} it allows for the reflection on what is likely (projected future reality) or possibly (potentiality) going to be a future state of affairs. In addition, when studied in the broader context of ongoing discourse, grammatical constructions of futurity can be tied to various epistemic viewpoints with distinct perspectives on (future) reality. Cognitive linguistics (CL) may help us in grasping the complex interplay of grammar and discourse in the expression of future events through multiple time lenses. Three cognitive frameworks – In order to arrive at a model for the analysis of futurity in discourse, the present paper functionally integrates three notions from CL: (1) Langacker’s (1991) extended epistemic model offers a temporal and modal setting for represented time with a possible array of positions for future-oriented predications. This model contains two axes: the vertical axis of modality, reaching from (projected) reality, over potentialis to irrealis, and the horizontal axis of immediate, near and distant future mental spaces (Fauconnier 1997). (2) Langacker’s current discourse space (CDS, Langacker 2001, 2008) represents time as discourse unfolds. It allows for the conception of a grammatical structure as a constructional assembly of time positions (indicated in (1)), referring to anticipated or past usage events in the ongoing discourse. (3) We further pursue Verhagen’s (2005) notion of intersubjectivity: linguistic structures do not only profile the object of conceptualization but do so by aligning the (inter) subjective viewpoints of multiple <b>conceptualizers</b> involved in a current conceptualization. In our case, different viewpoints set up different time lenses, which refer to specific temporal positions. Specific research questions – The combination of the three frameworks is targeted at addressing the question how grammar manages the representation of multiple temporal and epistemic viewpoints in ongoing discourse. More specifically, we focus on the constructional realization of three connected dimensions: (1) modal shifts on the vertical axis (realis-potentialis-irrealis); (2) temporal shifts on the horizontal axis of future events; (3) intersubjective shifts between positions set up by heterogeneous enunciative stances. Methodology and sample data – Our empirical analysis explores the grammatical realization of futurity in the specific genre of science popularization. Science popularization translates technological innovation and science into a format that is accessible to the general audience. Our analysis presents a close reading of a EU Cordis documentary film on nanotech, displaying an interaction between a journalist taking the enunciative stance of the lay public and interviewees in life sciences and industry. Results – We provide a unified CL framework for the representation of futurity in discourse. More specifically, this conceptual analysis shows the creative and dynamic nature of meaning construction, which integrates multiple temporal representations. This complex setting entails two aspects: a polyphonic network of enunciative stances and futuric expressions that dynamically set up intricate relations with other temporal positions.

40|$|The human {{conceptual}} system contains categorical {{knowledge about the}} world that supports online processing (perception, categorization, inference, action) and offline processing (memory, language, thought). Semantic memory, the classic view of the {{conceptual system}}, typically portrays it as modular, amodal, abstractive, and static. Alternatively, the conceptual system {{can be viewed as}} non-modular, modal, situated, and dynamic. According to this perspective, the conceptual system is non-modular and modal because it shares representational mechanisms with modality-specific systems in the brain. On a given occasion, modality-specific information about a category's members is reenacted in relevant modality-specific systems to represent it. Furthermore these simulations are situated, preparing the <b>conceptualizer</b> for situated action wit...|$|E
40|$|INC (incremental <b>conceptualizer)</b> is a cognitively moti-vated {{model of}} the first {{component}} of the language pro-duction process, conceptualization. It produces preverbal output for the domain of giving on-line descriptions of events that has the same structure as verbalizations of humans given the same task. The architecture and proc-essing mechanisms of INC are based on simple, cogni-tively motivated principles. Its behavior is controlled by parameters that are set according to the available re-sources. Thus, INC requires no explicit and complex in-structions about how to perform a given verbalization task, e. g. {{with respect to the}} level of detail, because the level of detail is an effect that depends on resources. Towards an Incremental Architecture fo...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} {{becomes more}} credible if it gains support from independent resear � on cognition. �e study juxtaposes a cognitive linguistic model, Ronald W. Langa�er’s Cognitive Grammar (CG), {{with a model}} of categorization, primarily in the color domain, called Vantage �eory (VT), proposed by Robert E. MacLaury. �e study shows {{that in spite of}} different goals and scopes of application, as well as terminological differences, the two models are congruous. Moreover, they yield parallel results when applied in analyses of language data, although VT must be adapted for the purpose. �e congruence results from the cognitive basis of both CG and VT, with common ground {{to be found in the}} broadly explored notions of figure vs. ground, point of view, subject-oriented nature of meaning, and active role of the <b>conceptualizer...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{outcomes}} of self-management interventions are commonly assessed using quantitative measurement tools, and few studies ask people with long-term conditions to explain, {{in their own}} words, what aspects of the intervention they valued. In this Grounded Theory study, a Health Trainers service {{in the north of}} England was evaluated based on interviews with eight service-users. Open, focused, and theoretical coding {{led to the development of}} a preliminary model explaining participants’ experiences and perceived impact of the service. The model reflects the findings that living well with a long-term condition encompassed social connectedness, changed identities, acceptance, and self-care. Health trainers performed four related roles that were perceived to contribute to these outcomes: <b>conceptualizer,</b> connector, coach, and champion. The evaluation contributes a grounded theoretical understanding of a personalized self-management intervention that emphasizes the benefits of a holistic approach to enable cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social adjustments...|$|E
40|$|Internal state predicates or ISPs {{refer to}} {{internal}} states of sentient beings, such as emotions, sensations and thought processes. Japanese ISPs with zero pronouns exhibit the “person restriction ” {{in that the}} zero form of their subjects must be first person at the utterance time. This paper examines the person restriction of ISPs in Japanese in contrast with those in Thai, which is a zero pronominal language like Japanese. It is found that the person restriction is applicable to Japanese ISPs but not to Thai ones. This paper argues that the person restriction is not adequate to account for Japanese and Thai ISPs. We propose a new constraint to account for this phenomenon, i. e., the Experiencer-Conceptualizer Identity (ECI) Constraint, which states that “The experiencer of the situation/event must be identical with the <b>conceptualizer</b> of that situation/event. ” It is argued that both languages conventionalize the ECI constraint in ISP expressions but differ in how the ECI constraint is conventionalized. ...|$|E
