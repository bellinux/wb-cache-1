40|$|Reaction and {{momentum}} wheels have become standard equipment for three-axis attitude stabilisation of conventional satellite classes as used e. g. for telecommunication and remote sensing missions. Owing to very compact mechanical designs and highly integrated electronics, wheels are now also {{more and more}} interesting for small satellites up to 100 … 200 kg with increasingly demanding requirements on attitude control. Wheels suitable for small satellites have a typical momentum capacity up to approximately 0. 4 Nms, and masses up to about 2 kg. All existing miniature wheels known to the authors are relying on ball bearings for rotor suspension, which may limit the lifetime of a particular mission or introduce undesired levels of micro-vibrations. Magnetic bearings {{have the potential to}} overcome those disadvantages. However, the design of a sufficiently small magnetic bearing with all the necessary components and sub-assemblies involves a number of technical challenges, which are discussed in detail. The paper focuses on the magnetic bearing design process, using magnetic field CAE tools, and the overall wheel design. A prototype of a <b>compact</b> magnetic <b>bearing</b> wheel currently under construction is presented.

40|$|Research {{performed}} at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the equilibrium and stability of {{a new class of}} ambient-temperature passive bearing systems is described. The basic concepts involved are: (1) Stability of the rotating system is only achieved in the rotating state. That is, disengaging mechanical systems are used to insure stable levitation at rest (when Earnshaw`s theorem applies). (2) Stable levitation by passive magnetic elements can be achieved if the vector sum of the force derivatives of the several elements of the system is net negative (i. e. restoring) for axial, transverse, and tilt-type perturbations from equilibrium. To satisfy the requirements of (2) using only permanent magnet elements we have employed periodic ``Halbach arrays. `` These interact with passive inductive loaded circuits and act as stabilizers, with the primary forces arising from axially symmetric permanent-magnet elements. Stabilizers and other elements needed to create <b>compact</b> passive magnetic <b>bearing</b> systems have been constructed.

PAHs smaller than 50 carbon atoms are not expected to survive in the NGC 7023 NW PDR. A similar conclusion is obtained for the diffuse ISM. Carbon clusters turn out to be end products of PAH photodissociation, and the evolution of these clusters needs to be investigated further to evaluate their impact on the chemical and physical evolution of PDRs.

40|$|The woody shrub Hakea sericea (Proteaceae) is {{native of}} {{south-eastern}} Australia {{and has been}} considered as an invader of natural habitats. In northern Portugal, dense stands of this plant are rapidly spreading usually after intense forest fires (Fig. 1 a). In May 2003, unusual leaf spots were observed on these naturally growing plants. Infected plants exhibit reddish leaves bearing black circular lesions with 1 - 3 mm in diameter (Fig. 1 b,c).

50|$|The {{morphological}} {{forms of}} F. compacta {{are referred to}} as RhinocIadiella-like, Cladosporium-Iike, and Phialophora-like. The Rhinocladiella-like and Phialophora-like types of development are best referred to as additional anamorphs of Fonsecaea. Some isolates of Fonsecaea may form phialides with collarettes that are typical of the genus Phialophora. When fungi produce more than one morphologic form in culture, such as the case with F. compacta and F. pedrosoi, the most stable, distinct, and unique form that is produced under standard conditions are used for identifying the fungus. Colonies on potato dextrose agar are slow growing, velvety to woolly, and olive to olivaceous black in color. Isolates of F. compacta may produce up to four different types of conidiophores. The diagnostic form consists of densley clustered, one-celled, pale brown, primary conidia, up to 4 × 8 μm that develop irregularly upon pegs at the terminus of erect, dark, irregularly swollen, club shaped, conidiophores. The primary conidia give rise to one-celled, 3 × 3.5 μm, secondary conidia in a like manner. The secondary conidia may in turn give rise to tertiary conidia. The conidia are rounded and form <b>compact</b> heads. Conidiophores <b>bearing</b> one-celled conidia like those produced by Rhinocladiella, branched chains of one-celled conidia arising from erect conidiophores like those produced by Cladosporium, and flask-shaped phialides having flared collarettes and balls of one-celled conidia like those produced by Phialophora may also be present.

It {{is one of the}} most widely cultivated legume species and has multiple uses. During a September 2010 survey, we recorded a new leaf spot disease on L. purpureus in and around Mysore district (Karnataka state) with 40 to 80 % disease incidence in 130 ha of field crop studied, which accounted for 20 to 35 % estimated yield loss. The symptoms appeared as small necrotic spots on the upper leaf surface. The leaf spots were persistent under mild infection throughout the season with production of conidia in clusters on abaxial leaf surface. A Dueteromyceteous fungus was isolated from affected leaf tissues that were surface sterilized with 2 % NaOCl 2 solution then washed thrice, dried, inoculated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and incubated at 28 ± 2 °C at 12 h alternate light and dark period for 7 days.

Fungal isolate was identified as Epicoccum sp. based on micro-morphological and cultural features (1). Further authenticity of the fungus was confirmed by PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using ITS 1 /ITS 4 universal primer. The amplified PCR product was purified, sequenced directly, and BLASTn search revealed 100 % homology to Epicoccum nigrum Link. (DQ 093668. 1 and JX 914480. 1). A representative sequence of E. nigrum was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KC 568289. 1). The isolated fungus was further tested for its pathogenicity on 30 -day-old healthy L. purpureus plants under greenhouse conditions.

The plants were kept under high humidity (80 %) for 5 days and at ambient temperature (28 ± 2 °C). The appearance of leaf spot symptoms were observed after 25 days post inoculation. Further, the pathogen was re-isolated and confirmed by micro-morphological characteristics. E. nigrum has been reported to cause post-harvest decay of cantaloupe in Oklahoma (2).
