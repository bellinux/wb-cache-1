5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

25|$|The psychotropic {{effects of}} DMT were first studied scientifically by the Hungarian chemist and {{psychologist}} Dr. Stephen Szára, who performed research with volunteers in the mid-1950s.

25|$|Nymphs {{tended to}} {{frequent}} areas distant from humans {{but could be}} encountered by lone travelers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or {{in the middle of}} the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous,</b> bringing dumbness, besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate human.

25|$|A broken {{army was}} usually hard to rally, and often did not reform on the {{battlefield}} but melted back to their home villages, to be perhaps reconstituted days later. Once regrouped and rearmed however they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous,</b> as a defeated Portuguese column found in 1670 at Kitombo. Siege warfare was not highly developed, and most fortified places were only designed to hold out a short period before defenders retreated. Logistical problems plagued both attacker and defender, as the region's war cycle was not set for long campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyenne {{believe that}} there were many {{different}} kinds of water monsters that lived not only in lakes, rivers, and springs but also high bluffs and hills. The locations given as water monster habitat are similar to the locations where local marine fossils can be found as fossils often erode out of hillsides or stream banks. The Cheyennes feared the water monsters, because they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> predators or capsize their canoes. Even in modern times, tradition-minded Cheyenne sometimes take pains to avoid sleeping too close to springs due to fears of water monsters.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the Austrian {{physician}} and writer Ernst Weiss, {{who lived in}} France in exile, wrote a novel, Ich, der Augenzeuge (“I, the eye witness”), a fictional autobiography of a doctor who cured a “hysterical” soldier A.H. from Braunau who had lost his eyesight in the trenches. The plot {{is set in a}} Reichswehr hospital at the end of 1918. Since his knowledge <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to the Nazis, the (fictional) physician is placed in a concentration camp in 1933 and released only after he surrenders the medical records.|$|E

25|$|The kit {{is made up}} of a jersey or {{shirt with}} sleeves, shorts, socks, {{shinguards}} made out of rubber or plastic, and shoes with rubber soles. The goalkeeper is allowed to wear long trousers and a different coloured kit to distinguish themself from the other players on the team and the referee. Goalkeeper is also allowed to wear elbow pads because the surface is about as hard as a tennis court or basketball court. Jewellery is not allowed, nor are other items that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to the player wearing the item or to other active participants.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} on August 3, 2007 that Chidester's parents intended to sue 'Ethnosupply'—a Canadian-based Internet company that sold Salvia divinorum to Brett some {{four months before}} his death. The parents allege that the distributors knew salvia <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> and failed to warn their son. The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for their pain and suffering, lost future earnings, funeral expenses, etc. There has not been anywhere else, either before or since this controversial incident, any other reported cases involving or alleging Salvia divinorum as a serious factor in suicide, overdose, accidental, or {{any other kind of}} death.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} {{recording}} hits {{is to place}} a necklace (with a water-soluble pill or medicine on it) around the players necks.

25|$|All of the cars, as {{originally}} built, featured high voltage propulsion control equipment, which sent 600 volts through the motorman's control stand {{as well as}} through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers, because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. Motors, manufactured either by Westinghouse or General Electric, were 200 horsepower each. Each motor car was equipped with two motors.|$|E
25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.|$|E
