5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic pumice deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam {{gathered}} {{delegates from}} 14 different countries, among which important {{figures of the}} anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E

25|$|The British {{strategy}} of forcing the German army {{to defend the}} Ypres salient, to protect the Belgian coast and submarine bases at Bruges, had succeeded. The French and Russian armies could make local attacks at Verdun but still needed time to recuperate and were vulnerable to large German attacks. The British offensive at Ypres drew German divisions away from the French and Russian armies and forced the Germans into a costly defence of Flanders. In Belgium, the Fifth Army (General Hubert Gough) had managed to advance little further towards Passchendaele since 31 July, due to the tenacity of the German defence and the unusually wet weather. Gough wanted to avoid delay in resuming the offensive, to prevent the Germans from recovering and to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for Operation Hush on the coast, which needed the high tides due {{at the end of}} August.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1917, {{plans for}} {{infantry}} attacks {{were determined by}} the artillery support that could be provided. Commanders planned attacks to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> {{for success in the}} absence of voice communication and attacks were limited to the range of artillery covering fire. Infantry units were to follow a creeping barrage, pausing at intermediate objectives to reorganise behind standing barrages and then dig in on the final objective, behind a protective barrage. In February 1917, infantry units were organised and equipped on a standard pattern and trained to achieve their objectives so that each man knew what to do and the drills to follow in certain circumstances. SS 143 Instructions for the training of Platoons for Offensive Action) prescribed a platoon organisation of four sections, the Lewis gun and rifle-grenade sections for firepower and the rifle and bombing sections for manoeuvre. The platoon was to seek opportunities for flank attacks and to use initiative rather than refer back for orders. The new infantry platoon organisation and training gave infantry the capacity to succeed despite casualties to officers and NCOs and sometimes after losing the creeping barrage.|$|E

25|$|The Fifth Army {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a brisk tempo of attack, to prevent the Germans from recovering and also to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for Operation Hush on the coast. Hush had to begin during the high tide period {{at the end of}} August, if not {{it would have to be}} postponed until the end of September. The Fifth Army had captured ground on the Gheluvelt Plateau on 31 July but the unusually wet and murky weather, the tenacious German defence and determined counter-attacks left the 4th Army in control of the most vital objectives around Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood. The II Corps attacked the Gheluvelt Plateau on 10, 16, 22 and 27 August. The Germans conducted local counter-attacks with reserve units of the ground-holding divisions (Gegenstoße) and made a bigger methodical counter-attack (Gegenangriff) on 24 August. Haig cancelled a general attack intended for 25 August and altered the Fifth Army–Second Army boundary for the third time. The Second Army took over the II Corps front on the Gheluvelt Plateau in early September and Plumer was allowed three weeks to prepare the next attack.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher interstage coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the scatterer the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E

Physics may conclude that time did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.

He {{also served as}} the South Wales representative on the executive committee of the MFGB from 1924 to 1934. During the May 1926 general strike, the South Wales miners {{were among the most}} fervent in support of the action. When the national strike collapsed after nine days, Davies led the continued resistance from the Welsh coalfields through months of lockout, before capitulation on harsh terms in December. Dowlais was the last district to return to work. The period following 1926 was marked by much in-fighting between communist and non-communist factions in the coalfields. Davies and other non-communists found themselves accused of collaboration with [...] "social fascism"; a leaflet issued by the communist-led National Minority Movement termed him [...] "the sham militant". Nevertheless, he continued to work for cooperation between all factions on the left. After Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Davies argued for unity around the Labour Party, believing that the ILP's increasingly left-wing stance, and the Communist Party's commitment to violent revolution, might <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for fascism. In 1931 Davies was elected to Merthyr Tydfil Borough Council.|$|E
500|$|Mystery writer Andrew Klavan, {{writing in}} The Wall Street Journal, {{compared}} the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W.

[...] Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman—like Bush, Klavan argues—"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past." [...] Klavan's article has received criticism on the Internet and in mainstream media outlets, such as in The New Republics [...] "The Plank." [...] Reviewing the film in The Sunday Times, Cosmo Landesman reached the opposite conclusion to Klavan, arguing that The Dark Knight [...] "offers up a lot of moralistic waffle about how we must hug a terrorist– okay, I exaggerate. At its heart, however, is a long and tedious discussion about how individuals and society must never abandon the rule of law in struggling against the forces of lawlessness. In fighting monsters, we must be careful not to become monsters– that sort of thing. The film champions the anti-war coalition's claim that, in having a war on terror, you <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for more terror. We are shown that innocent people died because of Batman– and he falls for it." [...] Benjamin Kerstein, writing in Azure, says that both Klavan and Landesman [...] "have a point," [...] because [...] "The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, {{for the first time in}} decades, an American mainstream no longer exists." ...|$|E
