5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or <b>cabergoline.</b> This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make supplementary treatment unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, <b>cabergoline,</b> apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cabergoline</b> in a {{moderate}} and well-tolerated dose {{has been shown in}} two studies to shrink fibroids effectively. The mechanism of action responsible for how <b>cabergoline</b> shrinks fibroids is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Two {{independent}} studies {{published in}} the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2007, implicated pergolide, along with <b>cabergoline,</b> in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007. (Since <b>cabergoline</b> is not approved in the United States for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson's Disease, diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease).|$|E
25|$|A {{woman with}} a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to {{conceive}} with her physician, so she can be carefully evaluated prior to becoming pregnant. This evaluation will include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess {{the size of the}} tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. As soon as a patient is pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she stop taking bromocriptine or <b>cabergoline,</b> the common treatments for prolactinoma. Most endocrinologists see patients every two months throughout the pregnancy. The patient should consult her endocrinologist promptly if she develops symptoms — in particular, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or <b>cabergoline</b> treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if the patient develops symptoms from growth of the tumor during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|At one time, oral {{contraceptives}} {{were thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} prolactinomas. However, this is no longer thought to be true. Patients with prolactinoma treated with bromocriptine or <b>cabergoline</b> may also take {{oral contraceptives}}. Likewise, post-menopausal estrogen replacement is safe in patients with prolactinoma treated with medical therapy or surgery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cabergoline,</b> an agonist of {{dopamine}} D₂ receptors which inhibits prolactin production, {{was found}} in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug amantadine may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, buspirone, stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), nefazodone and yohimbine have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, <b>cabergoline,</b> apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Prolactin is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and <b>cabergoline</b> decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cabergoline</b> is also {{associated}} with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness, but these may be less common and less severe than with bromocriptine. However, people with low blood pressure should use caution when starting <b>cabergoline</b> treatment, as the long half-life of the drug (4–7 days) may inadvertently affect their ability to keep their blood pressure within normal limits, creating intense discomfort, dizziness, and even fainting upon standing and walking until the single first dose clears from their system. [...] As with bromocriptine therapy, side-effects may be avoided or minimized if treatment is started slowly. [...] If a patient's prolactin level remains normal for 6 months, a doctor may consider stopping treatment. [...] <b>Cabergoline</b> should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} {{infusion of}} the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation {{is believed to}} be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin, [...] which represses dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal. Because of this, there is currently an experimental interest in drugs which inhibit prolactin, such as <b>cabergoline</b> (also known as Cabeser or Dostinex). Anecdotal reports on <b>cabergoline</b> suggest it may be able to eliminate the refractory period altogether, allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession. At least one scientific study supports these claims, although <b>cabergoline</b> is a hormone-altering drug and has many potential side effects. It has not been approved for treating sexual dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{three groups}} of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive {{antimigraine}} drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and <b>cabergoline,</b> but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride. Receptors|author1=Jähnichen S |author2=Horowski R |author3=Pertz H |accessdate = 3 February 2010}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Dopamine is the {{chemical}} that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, so doctors may treat prolactinoma with bromocriptine, <b>cabergoline</b> or Quinagolide drugs that act like dopamine. This type of drug {{is called a}} dopamine agonist. [...] These drugs shrink the tumor and return prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80% of patients. [...] Both have {{been approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is associated with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness and hypotension in patients with already low blood pressure readings. [...] To avoid these side-effects, it is important for bromocriptine treatment to start slowly.|$|E
5000|$|Co-medication {{with drugs}} metabolized mainly by CYP P450 such as {{erythromycin}} and ketoconazole, because increased plasma levels of <b>cabergoline</b> may result (although <b>cabergoline</b> undergoes minimal CYP450 metabolism).|$|E

5000|$|Lactation: In rats <b>cabergoline</b> {{was found}} in the {{maternal}} milk. Since it is not known if this effect also occurs in humans, breastfeeding is usually not recommended if/when treatment with <b>cabergoline</b> is necessary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabergoline</b> is a long-acting {{dopamine}} D2 {{receptor agonist}} and in vitro rat studies show a direct inhibitory {{effect on the}} prolactin secretion in the pituitary's lactotroph cells. <b>Cabergoline</b> decreased serum prolactin levels in reserpinized rats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabergoline</b> confers a {{significant}} reduction in the risk of OHSS in high risk women according to a Cochrane review of randomized studies, but the included trials did not report the live birth rates or multiple pregnancy rates. <b>Cabergoline,</b> as well as other dopamine agonists, might reduce the severity of OHSS by interfering with the VEGF system. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic treatment with <b>cabergoline</b> reduces the incidence, but not the severity of OHSS, without compromising pregnancy outcomes.|$|E
50|$|These drugs include {{pergolide}} and <b>cabergoline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pregnancy: {{available}} {{preliminary data}} indicates a somewhat increased rate of congenital abnormalities {{in patients who}} became pregnant while treated with <b>cabergoline..</b> However, one study concluded that [...] "foetal exposure to <b>cabergoline</b> through early pregnancy does not induce any increase {{in the risk of}} miscarriage or foetal malformation." ...|$|E

50|$|Like pergolide, <b>cabergoline</b> {{has been}} linked to cardiac damage. Among similar {{antiparkinsonian}} drugs, <b>cabergoline</b> exhibits the same type of serotonin receptor binding as pergolide. It should be noted that while lisuride, a related drug, also binds to the 5-HT2B receptor, it acts as an antagonist rather than as an agonist.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>cabergoline</b> is {{commonly}} described principally as a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, it also possesses significant {{affinity for the}} D3, D4, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, α2B- receptors, and moderate/low affinity for the D1 and 5-HT7 receptors. <b>Cabergoline</b> functions as an agonist at all of these receptors except for 5-HT7 and α2B-, where it acts as an antagonist.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cabergoline</b> (brand names Dostinex and others), an ergot derivative, is {{a potent}} {{dopamine}} receptor agonist on D2 receptors. Rat studies show <b>cabergoline</b> has a direct inhibitory effect on pituitary lactotroph (prolactin) cells. It is frequently used as a first-line agent {{in the management of}} prolactinomas due to its higher affinity for D2 receptor sites, less severe side effects, and more convenient dosing schedule than the older bromocriptine.|$|E
