5|$|Largely due to {{immigration}} from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish population of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, {{and then to}} 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate {{the needs of the}} ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken {{to increase the number of}} available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> system was installed in 1933.|$|E

5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, <b>central</b> <b>heating,</b> or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron had a {{population}} of 1,019 in 2001, of which 20.6 per cent were below the age of 16, and 18.7 per cent were over 64years of age.

5|$|In 1912, Willamette {{renamed the}} {{building}} {{in honor of the}} Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built. Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall while school was on break for Christmas. This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact. The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire. The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square tower topping the structure. Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall. A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of Waller, plus completing the new Lausanne Hall and adding a <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> plant.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s the fabric of the building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. <b>Central</b> <b>heating</b> {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the study on the {{possibilities}} of geothermal power in West Lithuania are presented. Three approaches to supplying thermal power to a settlement were studied a) no heat pump, extended heating surfaces in individual houses, b) a heat pump in each individual house, c) a <b>central</b> <b>heat</b> pump power plant for the settlement. It was concluded that heat carriers of low potential heat can be applied in standard houses of the Construction Plant in Alytus (panel walls and floors) only after improving the thermal insulation of the houses. The project of a <b>central</b> <b>heat</b> pump power plant requires minor reconstruction of the houses. It is more expensive than approuch a), but cheaper than approach b). The settlement Venckai can consume just 1 / 10 of the power of such thermal plant. Consequently, a project for the township Priekulé should be considered...|$|R

5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the agricultural depression and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> and labour-saving devices such as the vacuum cleaner, also led to changes in the scale of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64). It was pursed by William Lethaby at Melsetter House, Hoy (1898) for a Birmingham industrialist.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, {{then the}} {{governing}} {{institution of the}} District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, {{the first in the}} capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, <b>central</b> <b>heating,</b> and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s.|$|E
