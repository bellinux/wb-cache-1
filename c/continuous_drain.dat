The results show that the demand for oil imports is price inelastic in the long run. The consumption of oil is responsive to past consumption, prices, income, electricity consumption and the number of appliances imported in the short-run. A policy framework to reduce the use of oil for electricity consumption via alternative energy sources should be considered and the taxation of oil imports given its elasticity is a good source of revenue.

40|$|Infrastructure {{services}} in India {{and elsewhere in}} the world were predominantly provided through most of the 20 th century by Government or their instrumentalities. There was the implicit belief that monopolies enjoy economies of scale, and that it was in the larger public interest that they remained Government monopolies. There was also the implicit belief that accountability of public utilities to Government, and through Government to the legislature was adequate to ensure transparency and efficiency. The continued provision of infrastructure services by Government monopolies however led to mounting losses and poor operational performance, resulting in a <b>continuous</b> <b>drain</b> on scarce budgetary resources. With growing fiscal deficits and increasing emphasis on fiscal discipline, Governments could no longer subsidise the inefficient operation of these services. There were large infrastructure investment requirements were large, resources were limited and there were conflicting claims from other sectors. These various factors compelled Governments to look for private investment to augment infrastructure capacities. Technological advances also made it possible to unbundle infrastructure services, both horizontally and vertically, so that services that could be performed by several operators on a competitive basis could be separated from those that are best performed by a monopolistic service provider. However, commercialization and privatisation of infrastructure services was not possible given the existing structure of the markets and of the service providers. Infrastructure service providers were mostly monolithic state owned entities enjoying a dominant position in a monopolistic market. Owned as they were by the Government, they were only accountable to the ministry concerned and through the minister to the parliament. They had no incentives or compulsions to act on commercial principles as their financing needs were met by Governments and not by the financial markets, and as their continuing losses were funded out of the budget.

From a total of 540 patients who underwent posterior-only fusion for AIS from 1993 through 2005 at our institution, 15 cases (2. 77 %) were revised due to a late-developing post-operative infection: there were six males and nine females, {{with an average age}} at initial surgery of 15. 8  years (range 12 – 18). Late infections occurred at a mean of 70  months (15 – 95) after the index procedure. The implant alloy used was a stainless-steel instrumentation in 11 patients (4. 56 % of 241) and a titanium one in 4 patients (1. 33 % of 299) : there was an higher incidence of late infections in stainless-steel alloy group of patients (P <  0. 0001). Complete removal of instrumentation was performed in nine patients, obtaining in all cases wound healing and no symptoms of infection, at a minimum 3  years follow-up. In the other six patients, presenting less severe clinical signs of infections, an attempt to save/replace the previous instrumentation was performed, but a complete instrumentation removal had to be performed 11. 6  months later (range 3 – 24) for the persistence or recurrence of infection: all patients healed uneventfully at a minimum 3  years follow-up. Intraoperative cultures were obtained in all 15 cases, being positive in 13 cases (S. epidermidis in 5 patients, S. aureus in 3, Propionibacterium acnes in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1, Propionibacterium acnes + S. epidermidis in 1, S. aureus + S. epidermidis in 1 and coagulase-negative Staphylococci in 1).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Royalist War Effort in the north midlands was an organised system run, for the most part, by commissions of array composed generally of men with {{a vested interest in}} the communities over which they ruled. A financial system created by these men was based very much on the regular collection of a property tax. The funds which this tax raised was used to create an army based in the area, under the command of Henry Hastings, Lord Loughborough. This army was created from the units raised in the north midland shires during the summer and autumn of 1642 and used initially in the Edgehill campaign. The army eventually grew to be around five thousand strong and was commanded by men drawn from a broad social spectrum stretching from the titled gentry to below yeoman status. The birth of this regional war effort {{was the result of the}} King's attempt in late 1642 to regain ground in the area lost to local parliamentarians. The culmination of the work came a year later when, following the successful intervention of the Northern Army, the north midlands royalists were able to control the vast majority of the region. Thus at the end of 1643, the royalists had a power base from which to launch initiatives into any part of the country. The intervention of the Scots in January 1644 forced the Northern Army to return north and put the royalists on the defensive as far south as the north midlands. Successive internecine struggles between north midlands royalist officers and administrators and the <b>continuous</b> <b>drain</b> on the army's manpower, caused by other royalist regional commanders using various units, led to a severe weakening of the royalist war effort in the area. The culmination of this was the economically draining presence of the armies of Prince Rupert and George Goring alsö further reduced the North Midlands Army's manpower. The-defeat of thise armies, and the Northern Army at Marston Moor, plunged the north midlands ink' chaos and, weakened as it was, it almost collapsed entirely under parliamentarian pressure. For the rest of the war the area witnessed a battle of attrition as the parliamentarians steadily encroached upon former royalist territory. Three interventions by the King showed that the area's war effort could have been resurrected but nothing ever came of this and the war ended here, as elsewhere, with the succession of garrisons surrendering to parliament's forces...|$|E

40|$|Taking tea is an {{integral}} part of social life in Pakistan. The tea consumed in the country is imported making Pakistan the second largest importer after United Kingdom. The consumption is increasing day by day mainly due to the rapid increase in population. Keeping in view the alarming situation, it seems imperative to develop tea industry at indigenous level to avert the <b>continuous</b> <b>drain</b> on meager foreign exchange resources of the country. Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is a unique crop, as its cultivation and harvesting do not fit in to any typical cropping pattern. It is a perennial, evergreen shrub and its tender leaves and a bud are plucked for processing the black or green tea. It is a crop of wide adaptability and grows in a range of climates and soils in various parts of the world. Fortunately Pakistan has a sizeable potential tea growing area that exists in different agro ecological zones of northern highlands of NWFP. Climate of these areas appears appropriate for certain tea varieties of shrub-type which can tolerate cold and drought conditions. Successful cultivation of Chinese tea varieties at NTRI has demonstrated the potential of large scale tea production in the region. Konsh valley at 1500 masl and Pakkhal valley of district Mansehra at 1000 masl have the potential for tea cultivation. Pakkhal Valley, one of the largest valleys of district Mansehra near NTRI was selected for the comprehensive study to evaluate its soil status for tea cultivation with the objective to study the suitability of area for tea cultivation, to maintain desirable soil pH by the use of amendments and to study the effect of N on the yield and quality of the tea leaves. Thirty four (34) sites were surveyed and the soil samples up to the depth of 45 cm with an interval of 15 cm were collected from the smaller homogeneous units for physical and chemical studies. These studies consisted. of soil pH, texture, lime, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium. Most of the area was found suitable for tea plantation. In the nursery the high pH soil was supplemented with different doses of farm yard manure (FYM), aluminum sulphate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3) and crude sulphur (S). Significant reduction in soil pH was observed with Al 2 (SO 4) 3 @ 600 gm- 3 resulting in the production of healthy clones. The main emphasis was laid upon the qualitative components of the fresh tea leaves as affected by different levels of nitrogen during different plucking seasons at lower (1000 masl) and higher altitudes (1500 masl). Levels of nitrogen applied were 0, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 kg ha-l to seven years old tea bushes at both the altitudes. In addition, doses of other major nutrients phosphorus (30 kg ha- 1) and potassium (90 kg ha- 1) were kept constant. The tea leaves were plucked during various months and used for the determination of water extract substances (WE), total polyphenols (TP), amino acid (AA), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin (EC), and caffeine. In the WE, TP, AA of the tea leaves were determined by using 751 G DV -spectrophotometer and EGC, EC and caffeine contents were determined using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The highest yield of the fresh tea leaves at both the altitudes was obtained by the application of 420 kg N ha- 1. The nitrogen level did not affect the quality of WE compounds significantly. However TP increased significantly at P< 0. 001 level during the month of July by the application of 180 kg Nha-l at 1000 masl. The same dose of nitrogen gave the maximum TP during May, July, August and September at 1500 masl. The EGC, EC contents increased up to certain level with the increase of nitrogen and then declined after the application of 180 kg ha- 1. The nitrogen level did not affect the caffeine contents at both the altitudes. From the study, it can be concluded that the area of Pakkhal valley has the potential for raising good crop of tea. However, the soils have average pH, higher than that is considered optimum for tea, which can be brought down with the application of aluminum sulphate or sulphur. Ammonium sulphate fertilizer can also be used for reduction of soil pH in addition to its effect on crop yield. Significant improvement in tea yield can be achieved through the application of N @ 420 kg ha- 1 to the soils of the area. During the present study it was observed that the valuable foreign exchange component (FEC) being spent on the import of tea could be saved to some extent by planting tea on commercial scale in the northern parts of NWFP. The areas having soil pH 6. 5 - 7. 0 should be amended with aluminum sulphate or sulphur to bring the soil pH to a desirable level. For maximum yield and quality tea, the desired level of nitrogen could be used to enhance the vegetative growth and characteristic components of the tea flus...|$|E

Methods: An analytical, comparative, randomized study was performed {{with a sample of}} 60 patients submitted to 1 -level 360 o lumbar arthrodesis with TLIF technique, 30 of whom used the suction drain for three days after surgery and another 30 did not use the suction drain in the postoperative period. The complications that occurred on the 3 rd, 14 th, and 28 th postoperative days of patients of both groups and the Visual Analog Scale for pain were evaluated and compared. The complications assessed were seroma, superficial infection and suture dehiscence. Results: A total of 23. 3 % surgical wound complications were found, the most frequent being seroma (16 %). In total, each group presented seven complications. There were no statistical differences observed in the evaluation of seroma, infection, wound dehiscence on the 3 rd, 14 th, and 28 th postoperative days in both groups. Conclusion: The use or not of suction drain in 1 -level lumbar surgeries does not interfere with complications such as seroma, infection, and suture dehiscence...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of a {{modified}} two-dimensional Poisson equation, an analytical model for the threshold voltage V th of deep-submicrometre MOSFETs is developed, which can show V th 's nonlinear dependence on drain voltage V ds. Meanwhile, by introducing a normalized effective gate voltage V gtx to obtain continuous channel charge characteristics from the subthreshold to the strong inversion region and properly including major small-geometry and high-field effects such as carrier velocity saturation, DIBL, field dependent mobility, inversion layer capacitance and channel-length modulation etc, an accurate, <b>continuous</b> and scaled-down <b>drain</b> current physical model I ds is obtained. The model's output for channel length L 0. 26 [...] 0. 8 m fits both the experimental data and MINIMOS simulation well in all operation regions, and is available for VLSI simulation and reliability applications...|$|R
30|$|Acute {{hydrocephalus}} {{can cause}} early neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Incidence is about 20 to 30 %, within 48  h after SAH (Demirgil et al. 2003). Other causes of neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage include rebleeding, vasospasm, intraventricular hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, {{increased intracranial pressure}} and edema, seizures, hypoxia, and metabolic disturbances, e.g., hyponatremia. The pathogenesis of hydrocephalus is multifactorial and {{is related to the}} obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation either within the ventricular system or in the subarachnoid space (Spears et al. 2011). Although pathophysiology of this condition is not fully understood, hydrocephalus after SAH can be treated effectively using current treatment methods. Ventricular drainage may be required either on an emergency basis or can be inserted intraoperatively during aneurysm surgery to achieve adequate brain relaxation. The catheter is converted it to a permanent shunt if it cannot be removed within 5 to 7  days, unless persistent intraventricular blood is present (Klopfenstein et al. 2004). Another alternative often employed is the placement of a <b>continuous</b> lumbar <b>drain</b> in cases of communicating hydrocephalus (Hoekema et al. 2007). Microsurgical fenestration of the lamina terminalis during aneurysm clipping may decrease the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (Komotar et al. 2002). This study aims to evaluate the possible predictors for the development of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in aSAH.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{experimental}} study present some micro-structural and thermo-hydrous properties of terra cotta. A tube, built from this porous material, bathes {{in a tank}} filled with water. The internal surface of the wall carries a water film which evaporates by forced convection of hot and dry air, allowing the storage of negative kilocalories. The form of the lube used is a factor that allows neglecting the variations of the thermo-physical properties of the air between the entry and the exit of the tube. A computer code (based on the equation of Darcy for fluid crossing saturated porous material, the equation of Laplace on pressures and the equation of heat in polar co-ordinates) was established to describe the thermo-hydrous behavior of the material. The code {{makes it possible to}} determine the zones of intrinsic permeability favorable to a <b>continuous</b> evaporation without <b>draining</b> off the water film and it also allows the calculation of the average temperature of bath...|$|R
