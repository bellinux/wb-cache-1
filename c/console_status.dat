With the complexity of modern televisions, Miyamoto believed that a monitor separate from the console would provide an easier way {{to check on the}} <b>console's</b> <b>status</b> without needing to use the television. Its operation as a supplemental display was also inspired by the common use of a similar display at karaoke establishments in Japan, which displays song information and also allows its users to select their next song.|$|R

5000|$|In particular, the <b>consoles</b> <b>status</b> as an add-on {{and poor}} timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Segas video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. Allgame notes that [...] "every add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Segas add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldnt split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Segas decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we havent seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And thats a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to determine current conditions pertaining to church organ acquisitions and renovations in selected Roman Catholic parishes in the United States. A need exists to ascertain what problems are occurring {{with the process of}} organ acquisition, what solutions are possible, and how trends in organ acquisition are measuring up with the principles outlined by Vatican II. Addresses of organ companies were obtained from the current National Association of Pastoral Musician's Organ Builders Directory_ (1988). The 105 organ companies queried sent the researcher the addresses of 711 past and current Roman Catholic customers; each customer was sent a questionnaire. Fifty-eight percent of the contacts responded, supplying significant information from 362 parishes in the forty-eight contiguous United States. Information was obtained regarding: organ installation/renovation, selection, organ companies considered, console placement, parish size, age of church building, fund-raising, greatest difficulties experienced, points of advice based on experience, diocesan organ acquisition policies, acoustical concerns, and reasons for choosing a pipe or an electronic instrument. Reviews of related research and discussions of current publications, Roman Catholic church music legislation, new technologies used for accompanying church music, and differing opinions of church leaders supplement the survey research. Parishes reported their most difficult problems encountered during organ acquistion and offered their best points of advice for avoiding problems. The data include opinions regarding pipe and electronic instruments; organ companies frequently utilized; examples of sucessful organ <b>console</b> placement; the <b>status</b> and examples of diocesan written policies concerning keyboard accompaniment instruments; the benefits of combining fund-raising with parish education and communication; and the need for greater concern and education regarding acoustics. Case studies describe Roman parishes that achieved quality worship services after thorough preparations for their organ acquisition. Beginning parishes need the greatest amount of help for organ planning. Conclusions call for national-level attention and education about the organ acquisition process, and encourage dioceses to facilitate this goal with well-written policies. School of MusicThesis (D.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Multi-Vehicle Metric & Telemetry System (MMTS) is a {{complete}} range system which performs real-time tracking, command destruct, and telemetry processing functions for support of range safety and the test and evaluation of airborne vehicles. As currently configured, the MMTS consists of five hardware and software subsystems with the capability to receive, process, and display tracking data from up to ten range sensors and telemetry data from two instrumented vehicles. During a range operation, the MMTS is employed to collect, process, and display tracking and telemetry data. The instrumentation sites designated for operational support acquire tracking and telemetered data and transmit these data to the MMTS. The raw data is then identified, formatted, time tagged, recorded, processed, and routed for display to mission control and telemetry display areas. Additionally, processed tracking data is transmitted back to instrumentation sites {{as an aid to}} acquire or maintain vehicle track. The mission control area consists of a control and <b>status</b> <b>console,</b> high resolution color graphics stations, and large screen displays. As the mission controller observes mission progress on the graphics stations operational decisions can be made and invoked by activation of the appropriate console controls. Visual alarms provided my MMTS will alert mission control personnel of hazardous conditions posed by any tracked vehicle. Manual action can then be taken to activate transmission of the MMTS vehicle destruct signal. The telemetry display area consists of ten fully-functional, PC compatible computers which are switchable to either of two telemetry front end processors. Each PC can be independently set up by telemetry analysts to display data of interest. A total of thirty data pages per PC can be defined and any defined data page can be activated during a mission. A unique feature of the MMTS is that telemetry data can be combined with tracking data for use by the range safety functions...|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, Simplex {{introduced}} the LifeAlarm 2100, the industry's first networked multiplex building control {{system that was}} capable of handling fire alarm, security, HVAC, synchronized time, and watchman's tour. It centered on a large CPU console with built-in CRT display and keyboard that controlled the system's remote transponders (smaller self-sufficient panels connected to the DC Communications loop that distributed the system's I/O). In 1981, the 2100 was replaced with the popular and less-expensive 2120-series. Unlike the 2100, the 2120's main CPU {{came in the form}} of a traditional wall-mount panel that was field-programmable, but several more options for remotely controlling the system through external CRT <b>consoles</b> and <b>status</b> command centers were now made available. The main panel featured a vacuum fluorescent display screen, DOS-based EEPROM programming, built-in printer, and a voice evacuation option. The 2120 was finally discontinued in 1992. These systems were possibly the first fire alarm systems with a screen display. Though flexible and robust, these systems were often criticized for being difficult to operate and troubleshoot. These two computer-based systems were accompanied by the conventional 2001-series. First released in 1978, the 2001 was a highly customizable system that used plug-in modules. Some were common to every system (basic controls), while many other options were available, including signal coding cards, waterflow monitor cards, and many others. These cards were also compatible with Simplex's multiplex systems. In 1988, the 2001 was discontinued in favor of the 4001 and 4002 series (which came out in 1985 and 1986, respectively), and the 1000-point 4100 addressable system which was introduced that year, along with the 4903 series light/strobe plates, which replaced the 2903/2904 series. Around 1992, the 2120 was replaced with the 4120-series networked panel, and the 508-point 4020 addressable system was introduced at the same time, with the new 2099/4099 series T-Bar pull stations. In 1993, Simplex began manufacturing their 4903 mechanical horn strobe series, along with the 4904 and 4901 horns. In 1994, Simplex {{introduced the}} 4004, 4005, and 4009 NAC extenders. In 1998, the 4903 electronic horn strobe was released, and in 2001, Simplex introduced the TrueAlert-series, cited as being the industry's first addressable notification appliances which can be tested individually with a magnet without activating the entire system. The 4100U, a consolidated upgrade of Simplex's three largest addressable systems, followed in 2002, and was again updated in 2010 with the current 4100ES. [...] From time to time, SimplexGrinnell has used Cooper Wheelock, Gentex and Federal Signal notification appliances, mostly for outdoor/weatherproof applications. However, this is becoming less frequent with the introduction of weatherproof TrueAlert signals. When the weatherproof TrueAlerts came out in 2010, so did the TrueAlert chime/strobes and multi-tone horn/strobes. In 2014, Simplex released a new line of addressable notification appliances known as the TrueAlert ES. These signals are capable of reducing wiring, undergoing [...] "self testing", strobe candela choice from the FACP, and make it easy to add new signals. This line includes the regular horn/strobes, multi tone horn/strobes capable of outputting a 520Hz Low Frequency tone for sleeping areas, outdoor signals, speaker/strobes, and Simplex's first ever line of LED devices.|$|R
