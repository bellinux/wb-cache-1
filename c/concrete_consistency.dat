40|$|AbstractIn [13] Parikh {{proved the}} first {{mathematical}} result about <b>concrete</b> <b>consistency</b> of contradictory theories. In [6] it is {{shown that the}} bounds of <b>concrete</b> <b>consistency</b> given by Parikh are optimal. This was proved by noting that very large numbers can be actually constructed through very short proofs. A more refined analysis of these short proofs reveals the presence of cyclic paths in their logical graphs. Indeed, in [6] it is shown that cycles need to exist for the proofs to be short. Here, we present a new sequent calculus for classical logic which is close to linear logic in spirit, enjoys cut-elimination, is acyclic and its proofs are just elementary larger than proofs in LK. The proofs in the new calculus {{can be obtained by}} a small perturbation of proofs in LK and they represent a geometrical alternative for studying structural properties of LK-proofs. They satisfy the constructive disjunction property and most important, simpler geometrical properties of their logical graphs. The geometrical counterpart to a cycle in LK is represented in the new setting by a spiral which is passing through sets of formulas logically grouped together by the nesting of their quantifiers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a common}} {{perception}} by which small numbers are considered more concrete and large numbers more abstract. A mathematical formalization of this idea was introduced by Parikh (1971) through an inconsistent theory of feasible numbers in which addition and multiplication are as usual but for which some very large number is defined to be not feasible. Parikh shows that sufficiently short proofs in this theory can only prove true statements of arithmetic. We pursue these topics in light of logical flow graphs of proofs (Buss, 1991) and show that Parikh’s lower bound for <b>concrete</b> <b>consistency</b> reflects the presence of cycles in the logical graphs of short proofs of feasibility of large numbers. We discuss two concrete constructions which show the bound to be optimal and bring out the dynamical aspect of formal proofs. For this paper the concept of feasible numbers has two roles, as an idea with its own life and {{as a vehicle for}} exploring general principles on the dynamics and geometry of proofs.

40|$|Purpose. Scientific work aims at the {{development}} and testing of information system {{to meet the challenges}} of concrete composition design and control (for railway structures and buildings) based on the physico-analytical method algorithm for hydraulic concrete composition calculation. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of hydraulic concrete composition calculation is based on the physicochemical mechanics and in particular on the rheology of elastic–viscous–plastic bodies. The system of canonical equations consists of the equations for concrete strength, absolute volume, <b>concrete</b> mix <b>consistency</b> as well as the equation for optimal concrete saturation with aggregates while minimizing cement content. The joint solution of these four equations related to composition allows determining for the materials the concrete composition of required strength, concrete workability with minimum cement content. The procedure for calculation of hydraulic concrete composition according to the physico-analytical method consists of two parts: 1) physical, which is laboratory testing of concrete mix components in different concrete compositions; 2) analytical, which represents the calculation algorithm for concrete compositions equivalent in concrete strength and workability that comply with the specific conditions of concrete placing. Findings. To solve the problem of designing the concrete composition with the desired properties for railway structures and buildings it was proposed to use the information technology in the form of a developed computer program whose algorithm includes the physico-analytical method for hydraulic concrete composition determination. Originality. The developed concrete composition design method takes into account the basic properties of raw materials, concrete mix and concrete, which are pre-determined. The distinctive feature of physico-analytical method is obtaining of a set of equivalent compositions with a certain <b>concrete</b> mix <b>consistency</b> and required <b>concrete</b> strength, which allows to optimize the concrete composition by any optimality criterion, depending on the operation conditions. Practical value. Using the developed method will expand its functionality when applied in the form of the composition calculation computer program for the construction and repair of surface and underwater structures. The use of physico-analytical method at production site will simultaneously solve the economic problems of construction and maintenance cost reduction, component saving and ensure obtaining the concrete with the set properties for specific operation conditions of transport engineering structures...|$|R

Syftet med denna labboration var att visa hur Kalciumnitrart fungerar som bindetidsaccelerator i betong, och om Kalciumnitrart påverkar betongens fysikaliska egenskaper.  Följande faktorer har studerats för att se hur dessa faktorer påverkar betongens bindetid i kombination med användning av Kalciumnitrat. Betongens utgångstemperartur Typ av flyttillsatsmedel i betongen Betongens utgångskonsistens Betongens lagringsklimat Även hitta rätt dosering för att denna produkt ska vara lönsamt att användas i praktiken. Alla underökningar har utförts hos Sika AB laboratorium. All data har noggrant undersökts och använts i Excel program för framtagning av tabeller och diagram. Resultaten/slutsats i underökningarna visade följande. Bindetiden kan förkortas med Kalciumnitrat utan att behöva riskera betongens fysikaliska egenskaper. Enligt bindetidsdiagram noterades att 2, 0 % och 2, 5 % doseringarna gav bästa resultat gällande bindetid dvs. de gav kortast bindetid. Observera att + 5 graders lagringsklimat gav ologiska resultat dvs. referensbetongen utan acceleratorn gav kortast bindetid. Tryckhållfastheten påverkas inte av acceleratorn dvs. man kan använda denna produkt utan att riskera betongens bärförmåga. Resultaten visade att betongens utgångskonsistens har stor betydelse för bindetiden, ju högre konsistens värde desto längre bindetid.

40|$|AbstractMany applications, for {{instance}} the MS . NET Global Assembly Cache (GAC), are naturally expressed as 3 -valued models where an additional third truth value models uncertainty or under-specification. An example of under-specification {{is that a}} component in a GAC {{may or may not}} have a main method. Models described in this manner can then be analyzed to refute or verify properties about the concrete systems they intend to model. This approach to system validation traditionally considers only one model at a time, even though this model may evolve if subjected to analysis. Many applications, however, benefit from or require the simultaneous consideration of multiple models of systems. We mention here requirements from different stake holders, and data drawn from federated databases. This paper therefore builds the mathematical foundations for property verification and refutation as applied to finitely many 3 -valued models, where each model is endowed with states — possibly named by nominals, also known as hybrid constraints — labelled transitions, and atomic propositions. Specifically, we show that deciding whether a finite set of models has a common <b>concrete</b> system (<b>consistency)</b> is typically in PTIME, and that deciding whether a common concrete system satisfies a formula of the hybrid mu-calculus (satisfiability), and its dual (validity), are EXPTIME-complete.

Thus, from a commercial concrete of fck equal to 30 MPa, more two other concretes were produced by replacing 10 % of cement by metakaolin, by weight. In one of them, it was kept the same water/binder of the initial reference mix design (w/b = 0. 60), and in the other concrete the compressive strength remained fixed. In all three mixes, the same range of <b>concrete</b> <b>consistency</b> was maintained, with a slump equal to (100 + 10) mm. The front of chlorides in the cement matrix was evaluated by spraying a solution of silver nitrate, after an attack of 8 weekly cycles of wetting and drying using a solution containing chlorides.

These studies aimed to verify the potential of metakaolin in fixing chlorides in the form of Friedel’s salt, besides providing microstructural analysis of the concretes. It was concluded with this work that the incorporation of metakaolin decreases the diffusivity of chlorides to the extent that this mineral addition produces refinement of the concrete pore structure and also because it induces the formation of Friedel’s salt, which becomes it an effective agent in preventing the corrosion of reinforcement in chloride-rich environments...|$|E

The use of {{recycled}} aggregate to produce new concretes {{has become increasingly}} widespread, and numerous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the final product performs similarly to traditional concrete. However, construction and demolition waste (CDW) presents certain characteristics which could limit its acceptance in the construction sector due to worse performance than natural aggregates. One example of this is water absorption, which in recycled aggregates reaches such high values that the amount of free water calculated for mixing the concrete is affected, consequently impacting on the <b>concrete's</b> properties, especially <b>consistency.</b> This paper reports the possibility of solving this problem with a simple and inexpensive method; pre-saturation {{of recycled}} aggregates prior to adding them to the mix. The results of two different pre-treatments are compared; one consisted of immersing the aggregates in water for 10 minutes and the other, in addition to the above procedure, included a brief period of air drying and subsequent elimination of surface water from the aggregate.

The reutilization of rock filler, a by-product of the sand manufacturing process, as a soil liming material is explored. A set of tests and techniques were identified to characterise fine aggregates manufactured from quarry dusts via a dry processing system. Granite, limestone, sandstone and basalt manufactured sands and their unprocessed counterparts “feed quarry dusts” were characterised with respect to their shape and texture, grading and quality of fines (presence of clays). The results showed that the reprocessing of quarry dusts improves the particle shape and grading irrespective of rock mineralogy. Plasticised and non-plasticised concrete mixes were developed and the fresh and hardened properties tested. <b>Concrete</b> <b>consistency,</b> compressive and flexural strength is correlated with the fine aggregate characterisation test results. The manufactured fine aggregates showed a higher water demand when compared with natural sand whereas compressive and flexural strengths were enhanced. Artificial neural network models were developed to enable the prediction of the consistency and compressive strength of concrete. These models used the fine aggregate properties and mix composition parameters as input variables and were validated using a separate testing dataset, additional concrete mixes and numerical evaluation. Artificial neural network models were shown to be able to predict fresh and hardened concrete properties based on the fine aggregate characteristics. The excess fillers created in the sand manufacturing process were evaluated for soil liming potential through standard tests and a soil incubation study. The main finding was that materials with high silicate content exhibit a potential for liming, however, a higher dosage is required when compared to the dosage of high purity limestone to achieve the same liming potential...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{are all around}} us. The influence of an increasing awareness {{and care for the}} environment is present also in construction sector, in the areas of material selection, construction technology and construction waste management. When using concrete we strive to avoid negative impacts on the environment. Legislation in the area of construction, environment and waste follows the decisions of authorities relatively fast. This year the government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Programme of waste management and waste prevention in the Republic of Slovenia in accordance with the legislation. The main aim of this diploma thesis is the assessment of the influence of content and grain size distribution of recycled aggregate on concrete properties. We tried to find out whether it is possible to exchange natural aggregate with a recycled one while maintaining the basic properties of fresh and hardened concrete. When preparing the concrete mixtures two types of aggregate were used. Natural aggregate was delivered from France within project "COST Action TU 1404 ", while recycled aggregate from crushed waste concrete was acquired from a separation plant near Ljubljana. The preparation of samples and testing of recycled aggregate was carried out at the laboratory of UL FGG. With tests we first determined the physical properties of the recycled aggregate (grain size distribution, fines content, particle shape, density, water absorption, moisture content, presence of humus particles). On the basis of obtained results the suitability of the aggregate for use in concrete mixtures was assessed. Three mixtures of fresh concrete were prepared with the same amount of cement and the same water-to-cement ratio. The first mixture was prepared with fine natural aggregate and coarse recycled aggregate, the second one with recycled fine aggregate and natural coarse aggregate, while in the third mixture only recicled aggregate was used. The properties of fresh <b>concrete</b> (<b>consistency,</b> density, air content) and hardened concrete (compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, depth of water penetration under pressure) were determined according to SIST EN standard methods. On the basis of obtained results the tested concretes were classified into compressive strength classes, and analysis of the results was carried out. At the end, recommendations were given for the use of such concretes in the construction sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} early {{cracking}} in newly poured concrete slabs {{is often the}} plastic shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage occurs during the first hours after casting when the concrete is exposed to premature drying. During this time the concrete still is plastic, and could be vibrated and surface finished. Thus, the actual hardening has not started. In cases when the shrinkage is subjected to resisting forces tensile stresses can arise in the material and cracks may occur. The plastic shrinkage {{is assumed to be}} due to two simultaneous water transport in the concrete mass, namely dewatering (water transport from the concrete slab’s interior to the surface) and evaporation (water leaving the surface). When the evaporation exceeds the dewatering, the surface will dry out and the risk of cracking increases. Factors affecting evaporation and dewatering also affect the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Previous research highlights, among other things, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, <b>concrete</b> <b>consistency,</b> cement, additives and variations of specimen thickness as risk parameters. To counter the plastic shrinkage cracking formation, some finishing work can to be done. The literature suggests, for example, water curing, membrane curing, application of plastic wrap and, if necessary, the establishment of windbreaks and sunshades. The master thesis includes eight laboratory tests in which the occurrence of plastic shrinkage cracks in concrete with vct 0, 38 has been studied at different cement types and under varying wind speed. The cement types that have been compared are ordinary Portland cement (byggcement) and base-cement (bascement). The Portland cement is now commonplace in the workplaces while the base-cement is going to be introduced on the market in 2013 and 2014. In order to study the phenomenon of plastic shrinkage cracks an experimental setup was built in which a concrete slab with dimensions 1200 x 400 x 80 mm was cast. The model is based on a previously used equipment but with some modifications and a more sophisticated measuring equipment. By making use of a wind machine a wind over the plate surface could be simulated. In the experimental tests the evaporation of the specimen, the concrete temperature, the air temperature, the relative humidity and the wind speed was measured. The evaporation measurement was performed by continuously weighing the concrete slab. The results from the experiments indicate that the base-cement gives rise to fewer cracks than the Portland cement. Also the time until the first crack was observed was longer for the base-cement which would mean that the possibility of curing the surface would increase. In the study no significant temperature variation between the cement types was observed. Further, a higher wind speed gave rise to a higher evaporation and a shorter time until cracking was noticed. The master thesis also includes studies of the phenomenon itself and theoretical analysis of different models of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Various formulas have been studied and the measured evaporation agreed well with the theoretically calculated evaporation during the time the concrete was in its plastic state.

40|$|The use of fly ash (FA) as an {{admixture}} to concrete is broadly extended for {{two main}} reasons: {{the reduction of}} costs that supposes the substitution of cement and the micro structural changes motivated by the mineral admixture. Regarding this second point, there is a consensus that considers that the ash generates a more compact concrete {{and a reduction in}} the size of the pore. However, the measure in which this contributes to the pozzolanic activity or as filler is not well defined. There is also no justification to the influence of the physical parameters, fineness of the grain and free water, in its behavior. This work studies the use of FA as a partial substitute of the cement in concretes of different workability (dry and wet) and the influence in the reactivity of the ash. The <b>concrete</b> of dry <b>consistency</b> which serves as reference uses a cement dose of 250 Kg/m 3 and the <b>concrete</b> of fluid <b>consistency</b> utilized a dose of cement of 350 Kg/m 3. Two trademark of Portland Cement Type 1 were used. The first reached the resistant class for its fineness of grain and the second one for its composition. Moreover, three doses of FA have been used, and the water/binder ratio was constant in all the mixtures. We have studied the mechanical properties and the micro-structure of the concretes by means of compressive strength tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and thermal analysis (TA). The results of compressive strength tests allow us to observe that concrete mixtures with cements of the same classification and similar dosage of binder do not present the same mechanical behavior. These results show that the effective water/binder ratio has a major role in the development of the mechanical properties of concrete. The study of different dosages using TA, thermo-gravimetry and differential thermal analysis, revealed that the portlandite content is not restrictive in any of the dosages studied. Again, this proves that the rheology of the material influences the reaction rate and content of hydrated cement products. We conclude that the available free water is determinant in the efficiency of pozzolanic reaction. It is so that in accordance to the availability of free water, the ashes can react as an active admixture or simply change the porous distribution. The MIP shows concretes that do not exhibit significant changes in their mechanical behavior, but have suffered significant variation in their porous structur...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{concrete}} {{is used in}} {{many applications}} that require permeability, noise absorption or thermal insulation. However, its response under dynamic loading is generally not considered. Porous concrete has a characteristic of forming multiple cracks and subsequently fracturing into small fragments when exposed to impact loading. Therefore, {{with the aim of}} designing a special type of cementitious material for building protective structures, porous concrete was investigated. To be able to analyze the dynamic properties of the different types of porous concretes produced, an experimental configuration that reveals the dynamic response of porous concretes in a drop weight impact test was designed. Through the measurement of particle velocity at the interface between the impactor and the concrete target, the dynamic response was obtained. Laser Doppler velocimetry was used in monitoring the time history of the particle velocity at the interface which was subsequently analyzed using a special reverberation application of the impedance mismatch method. Measurements were conducted to demonstrate how the proposed experimental technique can be used on porous and normal <b>concretes.</b> The <b>consistency</b> of the results from the experiments that were performed while testing the same porous concrete materials with different impactors are presented for the verification of the experimental configuration and the analysis method. The analyses of the particle velocity time histories of different porous concretes and a normal concrete are also demonstrated which showed that the measurement technique was sufficient to determine the impact strengths of different types of porous concretes as well as a normal concrete with a moderate strength. As the results are compared, it was observed that the aggregate properties and compaction, coupled to porosity, are the main factors that affect the impact strength of porous concrete.

30|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) is {{a stable}} and cohesive high <b>consistency</b> <b>concrete</b> mix with enhanced filling ability properties that {{reduce the need for}} mechanical compaction. Limited standards and specifications {{have been reported in the}} literature on the structural behavior of reinforced self-compacting concrete elements. The significance of the research presented in this paper stems from the need to investigate the effect of enhanced fluidity of SCC on the structural behavior of high strength self-consolidating reinforced concrete beams. To meet the objectives of this research, twelve reinforced concrete beams were prepared with two different generations of superplasticizers and designed to exhibit flexure, shear, or bond splitting failure. The compared beams were identical except for the type of superplasticizer being used (second generation sulphonated-based superplasticizer or third generation polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer). The outcomes of the experimental work revealed comparable resistance of beam specimens made with self-compacting (SCC) and conventional vibrated concrete (VC). The dissimilarities in the experimental values between the SCC and the control VC beams were not major, leading to the conclusion that the high flowability of SCC has little effect on the flexural, shear and bond strengths of concrete members.|$|R
