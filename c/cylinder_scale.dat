40|$|International audienceThe present work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} {{combustion}} processes of a homogeneous methane-air mixture subject to thermal stratifications within a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). Temperature fields obtained in non-reactive conditions have been documented in a previous study and the present work aims at correlating these data with the combustion process. The analysis of chemiluminescence images enables the delineation of two propagation regimes, namely spontaneous ignition fronts and deflagrations. The first one is observed for short ignition delays as the fluid features a fairly large and homogeneous hot core zone. The second one dominates the combustion process for longer ignition delays. Indeed, despite a global homogenization of the temperature fields, the hottest zones are fairly narrow and surrounded by non negligible thermal gradients, which favors the formation of deflagrations. The results thus clearly show a strong correlation between the pre-ignition temperature field and the subsequent combustion process. They are commented in the light of recent literature. In a second part, quantitative predictions of the occurrence of autoignition fronts and deflagrations are performed by employing a criterion issued from the analysis of direct numerical simulation data (Sankaran et al., 2005). The results are in good agreement with others previously obtained through chemiluminescence imaging for early and intermediate stages of combustion. It is more difficult to conclude for later instants. The present work highlights the relevance but also suggests some limitations of the corresponding criterion for the analysis of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion processes at the <b>cylinder</b> <b>scale.</b> Furthermore, the quantitative data gathered within the RCM demonstrates the relevance of this device for further investigations of these fundamental issues...|$|E

Several qualitatively distinct wake regimes were observed experimentally. These were classified in terms of the vortex patterns, e. g., two singlets, two pairs, pair and singlet, and so on. We have performed a number of numerical experiments for Re= 140 and established several points of correspondence with the experiments. Our simulation results also shed light on the classification scheme of Williamson and Roshko and suggest how this classification may change with Reynolds number.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of the quasi-linear {{diffusion}} (QLD) in producing X-ray emission by means of ultra-relativistic electrons in AGN magnetospheric flows. We examined two regions: (a) an area close to the black hole and (b) the outer magnetosphere. The synchrotron emission has been studied for ultra-relativistic electrons and was shown that the QLD generates the soft and hard X-rays, close to the black hole and on the light <b>cylinder</b> <b>scales</b> respectively. By considering the cyclotron instability, we show that despite the short synchrotron cooling timescales, the cyclotron modes excite transverse and longitudinal-transversal waves. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the synchrotron reaction force and a force responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic invariant tend to decrease the pitch angles, whereas the diffusion, that pushes back on electrons by means of the aforementioned waves, tends to increase the pitch angles. By examining the quasi-stationary state, we investigate a regime in which these two processes are balanced and a non-vanishing value of pitch angles is created. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that an object {{translating}} parallel to a soft wall in a viscous fluid produces hydro- dynamic stresses that deform the wall, which, in turn, results in a lift force on the object. Recent experiments with cylinders sliding under gravity near a soft incline, which confirmed theoretical arguments for the lift force, also reported an unexplained steady-state rotation of the cylinders [Saintyves et al. PNAS 113 (21), 2016]. Motivated by these observations, we show, in the lubrication limit, that an infinite cylinder that translates in a viscous fluid parallel to a soft wall at constant speed and separation distance must also rotate {{in order to remain}} free of torque. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we show analytically that for small deformations of the elastic layer, the angular velocity of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>scales</b> with the cube of the sliding speed. These predictions are confirmed numerically. We then apply the theory to the gravity-driven motion of a cylinder near a soft incline and find qualitative agreement with the experimental observations, namely that a softer elastic layer results in a greater angular speed of the cylinder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} an elastoplastic analysis for cavity expansion in a soil cylinder. Emphasis here is {{laid on the}} influence of microstructures in the soil on the macroscopic behaviour of the cavity expansion. In doing so, a strain gradient plasticity model is employed to model the soil behaviour in the cylinder. A numerical shooting method is developed to solve the resulting fourth-order ordinary differential equation with two-point boundary conditions for the gradient-dependent problem. Fully elastic-plastic solutions to the cavity expansion are obtained and they are compared with the corresponding conventional results. It is demonstrated that, in consideration of microstructural effects, the deformation and stress distributions in the cylinder are highly inhomogeneous during both the initial loading and the subsequent elastic and plastic expansion stages. The overall elastic-plastic behaviour of the gradient-dependent cylinder depends on the material parameters as well as the <b>cylinder</b> thickness.

The long baseline PdBI observations detect no emission, {{and limit the}} contamination from a compact component F_c < 2. 7 mJy. This limit corresponds to a very small disk mass, M_disk < 5 e- 4 M_sun x (60 K / T_disk), and bolsters the "starless" interpretation of the core. The shorter baseline BIMA data are compared to density models using a physically motivated temperature distribution with a central minimum. This analysis provides clear evidence for a turn-over from the steep outer density profile observed in dust extinction to much more shallow behavior in the inner regions (< 7500 AU). The best fit Bonnor-Ebert, Plummer-like, broken power law, and end-on cylinder models produce very similar flattened profiles and cannot be distinguished. We quantify {{the sensitivity of the}} inferred structure to various uncertainties, including the temperature distribution, the central position, and the presence of a weak unresolved central component. The largest uncertainty comes from the temperature assumption; an isothermal model modifies the best fit parameters by 2 ̃ sigma, with the inferred profiles more shallow.

We present an unprecedentedly {{detailed analysis of}} the column density structure of a high-mass, filamentary molecular cloud, namely IRDC G 11. 11 - 0. 12 (G 11). We use two novel column density mapping techniques: high-resolution (FWHM = 2 ″, or ~ 0. 035 pc) dust extinction mapping in near- and mid-infrared, and dust emission mapping with the Herschel satellite. These two completely independent techniques yield a strikingly good agreement, highlighting their complementarity and robustness. We first analyze the dense gas mass fraction and linear mass density of G 11. We show that G 11 has a top heavy mass distribution and has a linear mass density (Ml ~ 600 M⊙ pc- 1) that greatly exceeds the critical value of a self-gravitating, non-turbulent cylinder. These properties make G 11 analogous to the Orion A cloud, despite its low star-forming activity. This suggests that the amount of dense gas in molecular clouds is more closely connected to environmental parameters or global processes than to the star-forming efficiency of the cloud. We then examine hierarchical fragmentation in G 11 over a wide range of size-scales and densities. We show that at scales 0. 5 pc ≳ l ≳ 8 pc, the fragmentation of G 11 is in agreement with that of a self-gravitating <b>cylinder.</b> At <b>scales</b> smaller than l ≲ 0. 5 pc, the results agree better with spherical Jeans' fragmentation.
