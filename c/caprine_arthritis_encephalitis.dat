Of 447 samples, 63 (14. 09 %) and 60 (13. 42 %) were positive to micro-AGID and macro-AGID, respectively, corresponding to a significant agreement between the tests (k = 0. 90). Furthermore, the micro-AGID presented clearer lines than the macro-AGID and the results may be recorded 24 earlier in micro-AGID.

40|$|Neutrophils have {{traditionally}} been thought to play only a peripheral role in the genesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, recent studies {{in a variety of}} animal models suggest that these cells are central to the initiation and propagation of autoimmunity. The use of mouse models, which allow either deletion of neutrophils or the targeting of specific neutrophil functions, has revealed the many complex ways these cells contribute to autoimmune/inflammatory processes. This includes generation of self antigens through the process of NETosis, regulation of T-cell and dendritic cell activation, production of cytokines such as BAFF that stimulate self-reactive B-cells, as well as indirect effects on epithelial cell stability. In comparing the many different autoimmune models in which neutrophils have been examined, a number of common underlying themes emerge - such as a role for neutrophils in stimulating vascular permeability in <b>arthritis,</b> <b>encephalitis</b> and colitis.

Recently it has become clear, that Th 17 cells are of central importance for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The differentiation of naive Th cells into Th 17 is triggered by antigen recognition in the presence of both IL- 6 and TGF-�. IL- 23, a heterodimeric cytokine which shares the p 40 chain with IL- 12 is an important survival factor for Th 17 whereas IL- 27, another member of the IL- 12 family strongly inhibits Th 17 production.

40|$|AbstractCaprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus {{transcription}} {{is under the}} control of the viral promoter within the long terminal repeat. Previous studies with the closely related maedi visna lentivirus have indicated that viral transcription is dependent upon the AP- 1 transcription factor. Other studies have indicated a potential role for the cytokines TNFα and GM-CSF in CAEV pathogenesis by increasing viral loads in infected tissues. The hypotheses that AP- 1 transcription factors are necessary for transcriptional activation of the CAEV promoter and that CAEV transcriptional activation results from treatment with the cytokines GM-CSF and TNFα were tested with a stably transduced U 937 cell line. Here, we found that TNFα and GM-CSF activated CAEV transcription in U 937 cells. However, this activation effect was not blocked by SP 600125, an inhibitor of Jun N-terminal kinase. SP 600125 effectively prevented Jun phosphorylation in cells subsequently treated with cytokines. The cytokines TNFα and GM-CSF therefore activate CAEV transcription, and this effect occurs independently of AP- 1.

40|$|AbstractCaprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) is a {{lentivirus}} {{which is}} closely related by nucleotide sequence and biological properties to visna virus and is more distantly related to the human AIDS virus, HIV- 1. Previous studies indicated that the CAEV Rev protein (Rev-C) functions as atrans-activator of mRNA cytoplasmic transport and expression. The function of Rev-C is mediated through an RNA element (RRE-C) present between nucleotides (nt) 7906 and 8110 in the CAEVenvgene. In this study, RNA/protein immunoprecipitation experiments were used to demonstrate that Rev-C binds directly to the 204 -nt RRE-Cin vitro. Competition assays illustrate that this interaction is specific for the positive sense RRE-C RNA. Glutaraldehyde crosslinking studies demonstrate that the wildtype Rev-C protein can also form multimeric complexesin vitro. Deletions or amino acid alterations within the basic domain of Rev-C reduce affinity for the RRE and disrupt assembly of Rev-C multimersin vitro,indicating that this domain is involved in RRE binding and Rev multimer formation. Mutations within the leucine-rich domain of Rev-C do not greatly effect RRE-C binding or self-assembly.

40|$|AbstractCaprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) is {{the natural}} {{lentivirus}} of goats, well known for its tropism for macrophages and its inability to cause infection in lymphocytes. The viral genome lacks nef, tat, vpu and vpx coding sequences. To test the hypothesis that when nef is expressed by the viral genome, the virus became toxic for lymphocytes during replication in macrophages, we inserted the SIVsmm PBj 14 nef coding sequences into the genome of CAEV thereby generating CAEV-nef. This recombinant virus is not infectious for lymphocytes but is fully replication competent in goat macrophages in which it constitutively expresses the SIV Nef. We found that goat lymphocytes cocultured with CAEV-nef-infected macrophages became activated, showing increased expression of the interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R). Activation correlated with increased proliferation of the cells. Interestingly, a dual effect in terms of apoptosis regulation was observed in exposed goat lymphocytes. Nef was found first to induce a protection of lymphocytes from apoptosis {{during the first few}} days following exposure to infected macrophages, but later it induced increased apoptosis in the activated lymphocytes. This new recombinant virus provides a model to study the functions of Nef in the context of infection of macrophages, but in absence of infection of T lymphocytes and brings new insights into the biological effects of Nef on lymphocytes...|$|R

40|$|The {{membrane}} glycoprotein CD 200 {{is expressed}} on several cell types including neurons whereas expression of its receptor, CD 200 R, is restricted principally to {{cells of the}} myeloid lineage, including microglia.

Here, we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam 3 CysSerLys 4 (Pam 3 Csk 4) exerted more profound effects on release of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 1 ?, IL- 6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -? in glia prepared from CD 200 -/-, compared with wildtype, mice. This effect is explained {{by the loss of}} CD 200 on astrocytes which modulates microglial activation. Expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) - 4 and - 2 was increased in glia prepared from CD 200 -/- mice and the evidence indicates that microglial activation, assessed by the increased numbers of CD 11 b+ cells which stained positively for both MHCII and CD 40, was enhanced in CD 200 -/-, compared with wildtype, mice. These neuroinflammatory changes were associated with impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA 1 of hippocampal slices prepared from CD 200 -/- mice. One possible explanation for this is the increase in TNF? in hippocampal tissue prepared from CD 200 -/- mice, since TNF? application inhibited LTP in CA 1. Significantly, LPS and Pam 3 Csk 4, at concentrations which did not affect LTP in wildtype mice, inhibited LTP in slices prepared from CD 200 -/- mice, likely due to the accompanying increase in TLR 2 and TLR 4.

Nas raÃ§as sanen, alpina e anglo-nubiana foram encontradas um maior nÃºmero de animais positivos, respectivamente 77 (18, 92 %), 80 (16, 06 %) e 49 (15, 76 %). Entre as amostras positivas a maior frequÃªncia foi de fÃªmeas 194 (90, 23 %) e adultos 193 (89, 77 %). Os resultados obtidos comprovam a existÃªncia da CAE na regiÃ£o e a necessidade de novas pesquisas que avaliem o Ã­ndice de infecÃ§Ã£o dos animais e as formas de prevenÃ§Ã£o e controle da doenÃ§a, PALAVRAS CHAVE: Artrite â encefalite caprina, teste da imunidade, fusÃ£o em agar gel, doenÃ§as em caprinos SUMMARY: To {{verify the}} soroprevalency of the caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) 1605 samples of goats hemo-serums {{belonging}} to flocks located in nine geographical microrregiÃµes were analyzed and distributed in 24 municipal districts of the State of Bahia. This samples {{were sent to}} Laboratory of Viruses of the Veterinary Medicine School to analysis. The studied population understood animals of herd of milk and court, of intensive, semi-intensive and extensive handling, of the races: alpine, anglo-nubiana, boer, mambrina, saanen, toggenburg and without race defined(SRD). They were positive to the agar gel imunodifusion test (IDAG) 215 (13, 4 %) goats hemo-serums. In the races sanen, alpine and anglo-nubiana was found {{a larger number of}} positive animals, respectively 77 (18, 92 %), 80 (16, 06 %) and 49 (15, 76 %). Among the positive samples the largest frequency was of females 194 (90, 23 %) and adults 193 (89, 77 %). The results obtained check the existence of CAE in the area and the need of new researches that evaluate the index of infection of the animals and the forms of prevention and control of the disease, KEYWORDS: <b>Caprine</b> <b>arthritis</b> â encefalites, <b>caprine</b> disease, agar gel imunodifusion test (IDAG...|$|R
