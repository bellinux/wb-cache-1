25|$|The 16-page first issue, {{published}} on April Fools' Day 1963, caused a sensation, selling 6,000 copies by lunchtime of publication day. It parodied The Sydney Morning Herald (and was even printed on The Heralds own presses, adding to its credibility) and led with a front-page hoax about {{the collapse of}} the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It also featured a <b>centre</b> <b>spread</b> {{on the history of the}} chastity belt and a story on abortion — based on Neville's own experience of arranging a termination of pregnancy for a girlfriend; abortion was then still illegal in New South Wales. These stories though, would soon lead to the magazine's first round of obscenity charges, but there were also more immediate consequences. As a result of the controversy generated by the abortion story, the Sydney Daily Mirror cancelled its advertising contract, it also threatened to sack Peter Grose from his cadetship unless he resigned from Oz and the Maritime Services Board evicted Oz from its office in The Rocks.|$|E

60|$|Every step farther {{would have}} been as {{dangerous}} as a descent within the crater of an active volcano. These spinning, boiling bomb centres would shift or break unexpectedly into new regions, great fragments of earth or drain or masonry suddenly caught by a jet of disruptive force might come flying by the explorer's head, or the ground yawn a fiery grave beneath his feet. Few who adventured into these areas of destruction and survived attempted any repetition of their experiences. There are stories of puffs of luminous, radio-active vapour drifting sometimes scores of miles from the bomb centre and killing and scorching all they overtook. And the first conflagrations from the Paris <b>centre</b> <b>spread</b> westward half-way to the sea.|$|E

Here it was turned right-about-face and again despatched on its long journey. In this way it oscillated backward and forward not fewer than six times before traces of it were lost. We say [...] "traces," [...] because these remarkable facts were ascertained, tracked, and corroborated by independent barometric observation {{in all parts of}} the earth.|$|E
