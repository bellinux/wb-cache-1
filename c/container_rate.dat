40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDouble-stack container train service was successfully introduced in 1984 and has expanded rapidly since. The newly designed five-platform articulated well railroad car {{serves as the}} vehicle. Space-age computer-assisted design has helped to engineer a radical departure fi-om conventional railcar configuration and produce significant weight and rolling resistance reductions. Commensurate with introduction of this new generation of equipment, the ocean carriers and railroads have developed new cooperative train scheduling procedures and container railcar handling methods. Additionally, the higher volume of containers per stack train has forced a redesign of railyards and marine terminals. Opportunities for unique military application of stack train technology and possible <b>container</b> <b>rate</b> reductions await the military transporter. The expedient maturation of stack train technology has provided an early opportunity for a thorough review of its development, the impact upon the containerized freight industry, and the stack trains' potential value to the military.

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the separate}} collection systems used in Spanish towns with between 5000 and 50, 000 inhabitants. The study {{looks at the}} systems and their efficiency {{by means of the}} indicators fractioning rate, quality in <b>container</b> <b>rate</b> and separation rate. The results obtained are compared with those from a similar study conducted earlier that was applied to towns and cities with populations over 50, 000. It can be concluded that the most widely implemented system in Spain involves the collection of mixed waste from kerbside bins and picking up paper/cardboard, glass and lightweight packaging from drop-off points. Findings show that the best system is the one that collects mixed waste, organic material and multiproduct waste door-to-door, and glass from drop-off points. The indicator separation rate made it possible to establish beta regression models to analyse the influence of the following logistic variables: inhabitants per point (people/pt), time (years) and frequency of collection (freq). From these models {{it can be seen that}} people/pt has a negative effect on all the fractions, while freq and years have a positive effect in the case of paper...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCCION: los tanques bajos son un importante reservorio doméstico de agua potable, que Aedes aegypti está colonizando con notable frecuencia en el ambiente urbano en un área de salud de la provincia de Camagüey, Cuba. OBJETIVO: determinar el aporte entomológico que brindan los tanques bajos, un depósito {{artificial}} de amplia distribución al nivel comunitario, a la infestación por Aedes aegypti que se reporta en un área de salud urbana de la provincia de Camagüey. MÉTODOS: del total general de depósitos positivos se cuantificaron los tanques bajos, para determinar el índice recipiente específico (IRe) junto al promedio de pupas/tanque bajo positivo; estos tanques fueron caracterizados durante la investigación de la vivienda mediante una planilla implementada al efecto. Se determinó igualmente el total de horas promedio que durante el día permanecen destapados. RESULTADOS: los tanques bajos aportaron 36, 03 % de positividad en relación con el total general, recibían mayormente agua del acueducto público en el exterior de las viviendas, con un IRe= 2, 69. Más de 97 % está sin la debida hermeticidad de su tapa; 92, 5 % se mantenían destapados cerca de 6 a 7 h durante el día. En 17 tanques positivos se colectaron 41 pupas para promediar 2, 41 pupas/tanques bajos. CONCLUSIONES: el aporte de los tanques bajos a la positividad del área, obliga a priorizar su inspección y cuidado por parte de la población y el personal especializado, puesto que la distribución de tapas no será una solución definitiva si no se modifica la conducta del morador. Ello requiere mejorar la información que se le brinda a la población, para contribuir a modificar la percepción de riesgo y elevar el nivel de conocimientos sobre el tema. De esta forma se logrará contribuir a propiciar una incorporación más activa y consciente de la comunidad al proceso, como elemento fundamental para hacerlo realmente sostenible. INTRODUCTION: {{water tanks}} {{placed on the}} ground are an important drinking water container at home; however, Aedes aegypti is very frequently colonizing this kind of reservoirs in an urban health area of Camaguey province, Cuba. OBJECTIVES: to determine the entomological contribution of these water tanks widely distributed containers at community setting- to infestation by Aedes aegypti in an urban health area of Camaguey province. METHODS: out {{of the total number}} of containers positive to Aedes aegypty, the amount of water tanks involved was estimated, in order to determine the specific <b>container</b> <b>rate</b> (sCR) together with the average of pupas per positive water tank on the ground. These tanks were characterized during the study of the house using an application form prepared to this end. Similarly, the average total number of hours that the tanks remained uncovered was estimated. RESULTS: it was found that 36. 03 % of all positive containers were water tanks on the ground, which were mostly filled with water from the aqueduct outdoors; being the sCR= 2. 69. Over 97 % of them had faulty covers whereas 92. 5 % remained uncovered for 6 or 7 hours a day. Seventeen positive tanks sheltered 41 pupas for an average of 2, 41 pupas per tank. CONCLUSIONS: the contribution of water tanks on the ground to the presence of Aedes aegypti pupas in the area makes it necessary to give priority to the inspection and surveillance of such containers on the part of the population and the expert staff. The supply of new covers will not represent the final solution to this problem if the behaviour of the dwellers in a house does not change. It is required to improve the information to be provided to the population so that the risk perception is changed and the level of knowledge on this topic is raised. In this way, it will be possible to involve the community more actively in this process as a key element to make it really sustainable...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an econometric {{analysis for the}} fluctuation of the <b>container</b> freight <b>rate</b> due to the interactions between the demand for container transportation services and the container fleet capacity. The demand is derived from international trade and {{is assumed to be}} exogenous, while the fleet capacity increases with new orders made two years before, proportional to the industrial profit. Assuming the market clears each year, the shipping freight rate will change with the relative magnitude of shifts in the demand and fleet capacity. This model is estimated using the world container shipping market statistics from 1980 to 2008, applying the three-stage least square method. The estimated parameters of the model have high statistical significance, and the overall explanatory power of the model is above 90 %. The short-term in-sample prediction of the model can largely replicate the container shipping market fluctuation in terms of the fleet size dynamics and the freight rate fluctuation in the past 20 years. The prediction of the future market trend reveals that the <b>container</b> freight <b>rate</b> should continue to decrease in the coming three years if the demand for container transportation services grows at less than 8 %...|$|R

The proposed measures could increase the level of usability of the transporting ships capacities and enable a more accurate and correct account of sea freight rates. The results of the research have shown that by increasing the control of accuracy of the cargo weight in containers and by improving the model of accounting, the freight rates can increase the incomes of shipping companies maintaining the same level of container traffic, which can have a direct influence on the efficiency of their successful operation...|$|R
