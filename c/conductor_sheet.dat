The conductors are made by forming a thin sheet of a metallizing paste of metal alloy powder, drying the paste layer, bisque firing the dried sheet at a first temperature, and then punching the conductors from the fired sheet. During the bisque firing, the <b>conductor</b> <b>sheet</b> shrinks to 58 percent of its pre-fired volume and the alloy particles sinter together.

40|$|In recent years, {{multilevel}} converters {{are becoming}} more popular and attractive than traditional converters in high voltage and high power applications. Multilevel converters are particularly suitable for harmonic reduction in high power applications where semiconductor devices {{are not able to}} operate at high switching frequencies or in high voltage applications where multilevel converters reduce the need to connect devices in series to achieve high switch voltage ratings. This thesis investigated two aspects of multilevel converters: structure and control. The first part of this thesis focuses on inductance between a DC supply and inverter components in order to minimise loop inductance, which causes overvoltages and stored energy losses during switching. Three dimensional finite element simulations and experimental tests have been carried out for all sections to verify theoretical developments. The major contributions of this section of the thesis are as follows: The use of a large area thin <b>conductor</b> <b>sheet</b> with a rectangular cross section separated by dielectric sheets (planar busbar) instead of circular cross section wires, contributes to a reduction of the stray inductance. A number of approximate equations exist for calculating the inductance of a rectangular conductor but an assumption was made that the current density was uniform throughout the conductors. This assumption is not valid for an inverter with a point injection of current. A mathematical analysis of a planar bus bar has been performed at low and high frequencies and the inductance and the resistance values between the two points of the planar busbar have been determined. A new physical structure for a voltage source inverter with symmetrical planar bus bar structure called Reduced Layer Planar Bus bar, is proposed in this thesis based on the current point injection theory. This new type of planar busbar minimises the variation in stray inductance for different switching states. The reduced layer planar busbar is a new innovation in planar busbars for high power inverters with minimum separation between busbars, optimum stray inductance and improved thermal performances. This type of the planar busbar is suitable for high power inverters, where the voltage source is supported by several capacitors in parallel in order to provide a low ripple DC voltage during operation. A two layer planar busbar with different materials has been analysed theoretically {{in order to determine the}} resistance of bus bars during switching. Increasing the resistance of the planar busbar can gain a damping ratio between stray inductance and capacitance and affects the performance of current loop during switching. The aim of this section is to increase the resistance of the planar bus bar at high frequencies (during switching) and without significantly increasing the planar busbar resistance at low frequency (50 Hz) using the skin effect. This contribution shows a novel structure of busbar suitable for high power applications where high resistance is required at switching times. In multilevel converters there are different loop inductances between busbars and power switches associated with different switching states. The aim of this research is to consider all combinations of the switching states for each multilevel converter topology and identify the loop inductance for each switching state. Results show that the physical layout of the busbars is very important for minimisation of the loop inductance at each switch state. Novel symmetrical busbar structures are proposed for multilevel converters with diode-clamp and flying-capacitor topologies which minimise the worst case in stray inductance for different switching states. Overshoot voltages and thermal problems are considered for each topology to optimise the planar busbar structure. In the second part of the thesis, closed loop current techniques have been investigated for single and three phase multilevel converters. The aims of this section are to investigate and propose suitable current controllers such as hysteresis and predictive techniques for multilevel converters with low harmonic distortion and switching losses. This section of the thesis can be classified into three parts as follows: An optimum space vector modulation technique for a three-phase voltage source inverter based on a minimum-loss strategy is proposed. One of the degrees of freedom for optimisation of the space vector modulation is the selection of the zero vectors in the switching sequence. This new method improves switching transitions per cycle for a given level of distortion as the zero vector does not alternate between each sector. The harmonic spectrum and weighted total harmonic distortion for these strategies are compared and results show up to 7...|$|E

As such, high power converters built with planar transformers can be designed to operate at relatively high switching frequencies, often 100kHz or above.

We describe a class of devices enabled by ionic conductors that are highly stretchable, fully transparent to light of all colors, and capable of operation at frequencies beyond 10 kilohertz and voltages above 10 kilovolts. We demonstrate a transparent actuator that can generate large strains and a transparent loudspeaker that produces sound over the entire audible range.

40|$|This paper derives the Airborne Induced Polarization (AIP) {{response}} of an airborne electromagnetic (AEM) {{system to a}} horizontal, thin <b>sheet</b> <b>conductor.</b> A vertical component double-dipole approximates helicopter systems with towed concentric horizontal transmitter and receiver loops in frequency- or time-domain. In time domain, the AIP effect typically shows up as late-time negative data with amplitude 4 to 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the early-time peak of the positive AEM responses. Because of limited bandwidth from the short sample time after the decay of inductive responses, accurate extraction of intrinsic AIP parameters other than a minimum chargeability is almost impossible. Modelling further suggests that AIP effects in double-dipole AEM systems can only be reliably detected from polarizable material in the top few tens of metres. A titanium mineral exploration case history from the Lac Brûlé area, Quebec, Canada illustrates strong spatial coherence of AIP minimum chargeability estimates and their independence from other effects such as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this paper, we present {{the design of}} {{miniaturized}} narrowband-microwave absorbers based on different kinds of magnetic inclusions. The operation of the proposed components originates from the resonance of a planar array of inclusions excited by an incoming wave with a given polarization. As in common absorber layouts, a 377 Omega resistive sheet {{is also used to}} absorb the electromagnetic energy of the impinging field. Since the planar array of magnetic inclusions behaves at its resonance as a perfect magnetic <b>conductor,</b> the resistive <b>sheet</b> is placed in close proximity of the resonating inclusions, without perturbing their resonance condition. In contrast to other typical absorber configurations presented in the literature, the absorber proposed in this paper is not backed by a metallic plate. This feature may be useful for stealth applications, as discussed thoroughly in the paper. The other interesting characteristic of the proposed absorbers is the subwavelength thickness, which has shown to depend only on the geometry of the basic resonant inclusions employed. At first, regular split-ring resonators (SSRs) disposed in an array configuration are considered and some application examples are presented. Absorbers based on SRRs are shown to reach thickness of the order of lambda(0) / 20. In order to further squeeze the electrical thickness of the absorbers, multiple SRRs and spiral resonators are also used. The employment of such inclusions leads to the design of extremely thin microwave absorbers, whose thickness may even be close to lambda(0) / 100. Finally, some examples of miniaturized absorbers suitable for a practical realization are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Many new {{applications}} of energy system devices {{have been developed}} to save energy, improve the controllability and stability of industrial processes, and reduce the weight, volume and cost of consumer devices. Due to the novelty of these devices, traditional empirical methods and lumped-parameter circuit theory methods are not sufficient for product development and optimization. Electromagnetic analysis approaches can provide accurate parameter calculation and performance prediction for these new products / prototypes of energy system devices. They are powerful and efficient tools for new product development and existing product optimization. The research analysis work of this thesis applied the LTA (Layer Theory Approach) and FEM (Finite Element Method) to analyze two types of new energy system devices, a permanent magnet coupling and its derivatives and the prototype of a linear reluctance machine, respectively. LTA is a suitable and efficient tool for devices like linear induction machines and permanent magnet couplings, which include <b>sheet</b> <b>conductors</b> as secondaries.
