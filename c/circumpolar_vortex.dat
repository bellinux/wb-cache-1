In addition to the seasonal cycle, a remarkable intra-seasonal fluctuation with the period of about 30 days is noticed in the intensity of polar anticyclone and in the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex.</b> It is also noticed that in the seasonal time scale the intensity of polar anticyclone and <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> shows a positive correlation while in the intra-seasonal time scale these two are negatively correlated...|$|E
40|$|The annual {{march of}} the {{strength}} of the southern <b>circumpolar.</b> <b>vortex</b> is shown to be composed of a simple annual variation (with the maximum occurring in late winter) which dominates in the stratosphere, and a semiannual variation with the maximum at the equinoxes, which is the dominating part in the troposphere. This behavior of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> is considered to be the consequence of the seasonal variation of radiation conditions and of the different efficiency of meridional turbulent exchange in the troposphere and stratosphere. It is suggested that the semiannual variation of the tropospheric vortex is an essential feature of a planetary circulation. The annual march of pressure with opposite phase values at polar and middle latitudes, can be understood {{as a consequence of the}} formation and decay of the great <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a sudden stratospheric warming which developed spontaneously during a winter simulation with a three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic model is described. Changes in the circulation and thermal structure of the winter polar stratosphere {{that occurred during the}} warming are shown to be in close agreement with observed behavior: enhanced vertical flux of eddy energy into the stratosphere, rapid temperature increase in high latitudes with a reversal of the zonal mean temperature gradient between midlatitude and pole, destruction of the <b>circumpolar</b> cyclonic <b>vortex,</b> and a marked deceleration of the westerly jet and the appearance of zonal mean easterlies. Energies of the warming are also consistent with observed characteristics.

These results were obtained during the LAUTLOS-WAVVAP international experiment on the comparison of balloon hygrometers, which was carried out in January - February 2004 in northern Finland. Humidity values are determined inside, outside and at the boundary of the <b>circumpolar</b> stratospheric <b>vortex.</b> It is shown that at a height of 20 km, the difference between the mixing ratios of water vapor outside and inside the vortex can attain 1 ppmv and increase with height. It is inferred that the laminae of the vertical humidity profile at the stratospheric vortex boundary is in good agreement with the layering of the potential vorticity profile, which points to a dynamic nature of these layers. It is shown that decreased values of the water vapor content observed in the polar stratosphere are not always controlled by dehydration processes associated with the formation and sedimentation of particles of polar stratospheric clouds...|$|R
40|$|The main aims of {{this project}} were to {{contribute}} to the knowledge about tropical climate variations, and to investigate the possibilities of obtaining cosmic ray influx data from stalagmites. Stalagmites from Tanzania and northern South Africa were palaeoclimatologically analysed. U-series dating, combined with previously published 14 C-data (Goslar et al. 2000), shows that one of the Tanzanian stalagmites was precipitated during {{the latter half of the}} latest glacial, between approximately 39 and 27 ka. Results from stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) were interpreted as indicating millennial-scale fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 -level during that time. These fluctuations show a pattern which is similar to that of the δ 18 O records from the GRIP and Byrd ice-cores – suggesting that the stalagmite record captures a global climate signal. U-series dating shows that the largest of the South African stalagmites covers most of the last 25 ka. The δ 13 C- and δ 18 O-data indicate millennial-scale variation in the South African climate throughout the time of the formation of this stalagmite. Because of similarities to Antarctic records (Steig et al. 2000), the driving force for these variations was suggested to be atmospheric circulation changes associated with change in the Southern Hemisphere <b>circumpolar</b> westerly wind <b>vortex.</b> Like the Tanzanian results, these South African data lend further support to the theory about global persistent millennial-scale climate-fluctuations. A beryllium isotope study was then performed on the two stalagmites described above. This study assesses, for the first time, the potential of the cosmogenic isotope 10 Be as a tool in stalagmite studies. As a control, 9 Be-analysis was also made on each 10 Be-sample. The aim of the study was to test the idea that stalagmites could be a new source of well-dated and directly climate-proxy synchronized information about past variations in cosmic ray influx intensity – i. e., a source that would serve as a new tool for general improvement of the knowledge about past variations in cosmic ray influx, and that could possibly also provide further clues to whether such variations can affect Earth’s climate. The main excursions/fluctuations in the 10 Be-and 9 Be-data from these stalagmites do not coincide. Hence, the excursions in 10 Be-content may be interpreted as indicating excursions in cosmic ray influx. The 10 Be-data show three pronounced peaks at around 38, 35 and 21 ka respectively; plausibly corresponding to the peaks previously observed at approximately 39, 32 and 23 ka in cosmogenic isotope data from sediments and ice. In glacial parts of the stalagmite material, the 9 Be-concentration fluctuates on a millennial-scale; inversely synchronized with fluctuations in δ 13 C-data from the same material. This indicates that 9 Be could, apart from being a necessary control for 10 Be-results, also function as a palaeoclimatological proxy in stalagmite studies. In order to improve dating facilities for stalagmites, a procedure for high-precision measurements of U and Th isotope ratios was also developed, using an IsoProbe® Multi Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS). The 230 Th/ 232 Th ratio for the thorium concentration-standard Alfa Th was determined to 7. 96 (± 0. 012) × 10 - 7 (2 σ), and the δ 234 U obtained for the uranium standard SRM 950 a was 18. 4 ± 0. 6 (2 σ). The thorium results show, that even extremely biased isotope ratios, in low-concentration samples, can be measured with remarkably good precision. The quality of each sample measurement can also easily be evaluated. However, due to repeated technical problems with the instrument, it has not yet been possible to use the developed procedure for routine analysis and dating of samples...|$|R
40|$|Using {{brightness}} temperatures from channels 3 and 4 of the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) as approxi-mations to mean-layer temperatures, the geostrophic winds at 50 mb can be computed {{through a}} ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach. When {{this method is}} applied at high latitudes during austral winter and spring, {{it is found that}} accurate descriptions of the seasonal evolution and interannual variability of the lower-stratospheric <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> are obtained. Variations in early-spring vortex strength from year to year appear to relate well to variations in the timing of the first large late-winter wavenumber one event in the lower stratosphere. Since wave forcing of the mean flow in the lower stratosphere is known to be weak, the variability in vortex strength may result from variations in wave-induced subsidence through the downward control principle. Previous studies have demonstrated a biennial harmonic in both extratropical wave forcing and the mean flow, suggesting a link with the equatorially confined quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). This study attempts to find a similar signal in the strength of the lower-stratospheric austral <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex.</b> It is first found that during the easterly (westerly) phase of the QBO large-amplitude wavenumber one in MSU channel 4, brightness temperature generally occurs earlier (later) in the season than normal.

They generally increase with altitude and become cyclostrophic near 35 km above the surface. An exception to this is a sharp minimum centered near 75 km, where the wind velocity decreases to nearly zero. Zonal winds derived from temperatures retrieved from Cassini orbiter measurements, using the thermal wind equation, indicate a strong winter <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex,</b> with maximum winds of 190 m s − 1 at mid northern latitudes near 300 km.

It is shown that, during the disturbed periods in winter, low values of aerosol optical depth (less than 0. 0002) are found within the low-pressure system(s) (at the 30 -mbar pressure surface), while high values are found outside. Similar characteristics are found to exist for the simultaneously observed SAGE O 3 and NO 2 columnar density distributions.

40|$|Typical flows contain {{internal}} flow barriers: specialised time-moving Lagrangian entities which demarcate distinct motions. Examples include {{the boundary between}} an oceanic eddy and a nearby jet, {{the edge of the}} Antarctic <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> or the interface between two fluids which are to be mixed together in an microfluidic assay. The ability to control the locations of these barriers in a user-specified time-varying (unsteady) way can profoundly impact fluid transport between the coherent structures which are separated by the barriers. A condition on the unsteady Eulerian velocity required to achieve this objective is explicitly derived, thereby solving an ‘inverse Lagrangian coherent structure’ problem. This is an important first step in developing flow-barrier control in realistic flows, and in providing a postprocessing tool for observational/experimental velocity data. The excellent accuracy of the method is demonstrated using the Kelvin–Stuart cats-eyes flow and the unsteady double gyre, utilising finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Sanjeeva Balasuriy...|$|E

In estimating the ozone transport, chemical effects, including those thought to be responsible for the Antarctic ozone hole, are neglected. This approximation appears to be valid for time scales of a few days to a week. On this time scale, local ozone changes are primarily due to transport.

Data analysis and propagation modeling show that the noise level at the stations and the stratospheric <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> were different in 2016 compared to 2013. As the seismic magnitude of the 2013 and 2016 nuclear test explosions was comparable, we hypothesize that the 2016 test occurred at least 1. 5 times deeper. In such a case, less seismic energy would couple through the lithosphere-atmosphere interface, leading to less observable infrasound.

40|$|Temperature {{structure}} of the Venus atmosphere was derived from radio occultation data collected by the Pioneer Venus spacecraft during seven occultation seasons in the 1978 - 1983 period. The measurements, which cover latitudes from both poles to the equator from 40 km to 85 km altitudes, show a latitudinal dependence. At latitudes below 45 deg, there is a smooth temperature transition from the troposphere to the mesosphere. Between 60 and 80 deg, in the 'collar cloud' region, a strong temperature inversion (up to 30 K) appears, which disappears again in the polar areas (80 - 90 deg), where the mesosphere becomes isothermal without inversion. This temperature behavior {{is related to the}} persistent circulation pattern, in which a zonal retrograde motion below 45 deg changes gradually to a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> at the 'collar cloud'.

The analysis of the obtained data has shown, in particular, that during the stratospheric warmings the western wind in winter time becomes weaker and even reverses.

40|$|Large-scale {{signature}} years, {{in which}} oak growth {{across much of}} northern Europe varies consistently, are identified. Postulating that the likely cause of such widespread departures in growth is climatic, it is shown that these years were characterized by pan-European anomalies in soil-moisture availability, rainfall and temperature, with enhanced growth associated with {{an extended period of}} increased soil-moisture availability and reduced growth associated with lower temperatures and reduced soil moisture. These climatic anomalies are, in turn, associated with a large-scale and persistent perturbation in the atmospheric circulation that involves the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> and appears related to the Arctic Oscillation. The 2000 -year record of signature-year occurrence shows variations in frequency at the decadal and century levels. It is necessary to interpret this record with caution.

For the trajectory starting at 58 deg S, which may be regarded as outside the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex,</b> only a small change in O 3 occurs in the model.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Output of a 14 year {{integration}} with a high-resolution (55 km 55 km) regional atmos-pheric climate model {{is used to}} study the response of Antarctic near-surface climate to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), the periodical strengthening and weakening of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. In spite of the relatively short record, wind, temperature and precipitation show widespread and significant AAO-related signals. When the vortex is strong (high AAO index), northwesterly flow anomalies cause warming over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and adjacent regions in West Antarctica and the Weddell Sea. In contrast, cooling occurs in East Antarctica, the eastern Ross Ice Shelf and parts of Marie Byrd Land. Most of the annual temperature signal stems from the months March–August. The spatial distribution of the precipitation response {{to changes in the}} AAO does not mirror temperature changes but is in first order determined by the direction of flow anomalies with respect to the Antarctic topography.

40|$|During the northerm {{summer monsoon}} period, the {{cloudiness}} fluctuation {{over and around}} India shows a predominant periodicity of 30 to 40 days as a major active-break cycle of monsoon activity, and this fluctuation appears as a northward phase shift of maximum (or minimum) cloudiness from the equatorial Indian Ocean toward the Himalayas (T. YASUNARI : J. Meteorol. Soc. Jpn, 57, 227, 1979; ibid., 58, 225, 1980). It has also been revealed that the northward movement of the cloudiness with this periodicity is triggered by the cold air outbreak toward the equator, associated with the large-scale westerly wave motions such as an index cycle in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (T.

In addition, {{the analysis of the}} temperature fluctuation at 500 mb over Syowa Station, East Antarctica, showed the dominant periodicity of the same period range (30 - 40 days) especially in the winter season.

40|$|Summary. The 1 I-yr {{solar cycle}} term in sea-level is further elucidated by single-and two-channel high {{resolution}} signal processing techniques applied to 37 European height H of sea-level records. In agreement with earlier analysis the period and amplitude are 10. 6 k 0. 3 yr and 10. 3 k 4. 8 mm. New results are as follows: {{in view of}} the recently detected 11 -yr term in Earth rotation A T = ET- UT, cross-spectra of the H records with AT were computed. At the solar cycle period H lags A T by 0. 7 t 0. 5 yr; since A T lags the change in length of day A(1 od) by 2. 7 yr the result is that H lags A(1 od) by 3. 4 k 0. 5 yr. The con-tinuum spectrum of H and A T has a high coherency and zero phase from the solar cycle down to a period of 40 yr, although this relation cannot be causal. We propose that the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> of westerly winds is the common forcing function for the H and A T discrete solar cycle signal and {{a significant portion of the}} long-period continuum in European waters...|$|E
40|$|Annual cycles in {{long time}} series of {{precipitation}} from sixteen southwest European observatories have been analysed using complex demodulation. The stations have been clustered into two distinct regions and a hybrid one. They {{are referred to}} as the southwestern Europe precipitation Atlantic regime (SEPAR) and the southwestern Europe precipitation Mediterranean regime (SEPMER), with the hybrid regime referred to in terms of the mean amplitude ratios between semiannual and annual rainfall components. Some evidence of linking between seasonal cycle harmonic amplitudes and the zonal circulation has been found for SEPAR stations and a more obscured relationship for the SEPMER region. Within the SEPAR region the strength of the relationship is diminished towards the north. A trend analysis of the amplitudes against time since 1920 has also been carried out and the results reveal a divergent pattern in trends between annual and semiannual component amplitudes for the SEPAR region. In fact, both an increasing annual-amplitude trend and a decreasing semiannual-amplitude trend are observed, in each case statistically significant. The fact that the seasonal cycle variability of rainfall in southwestern Europe becomes more sensitive southwards to changes in atmospheric zonal circulation over the North Atlantic might, in our opinion, be related to the swing of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Strong-wind events occur 10 – 20 {{times per}} year at Kohnen Station, East Antarctica (75800 ’S, 0804 ’E, 2892 m above sea level), {{and are often}} caused by warm-core {{cyclones}} in the north-eastern Weddell Sea. An uncommon event occurred in January 2002, when blocking both in the south Atlantic Ocean and in the south Tasman Sea caused a split-up of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex,</b> and large amounts of heat and moisture were transported onto the Antarctic Plateau. During strong-wind events over the plateau the near-surface temperature can increase by tens of degrees, which is partly caused by the advection of heat, but for an important part by {{the destruction of the}} stable temperature-deficit layer by enhanced vertical mixing. The temperature rise is larger during the winter/night than during the summer/day, due to a better-developed temperature deficit. Snowdrift during the January 2002 event linearly increased surface roughness for momentum with friction velocity, for values over about 0. 18 m s- 1. The cloud cover during the event reduced down-welling solar radiation by 32 %, and increased the albedo from about 0. 86 to 0. 92.

On {{the basis of the}} superposed epoch method, there is little evidence of a relation between vortex size and phase of the QBO, but significant at the 90 % level or better is the tendency for the vortex to be less displaced into the eastern hemisphere in the east-wind phase of the QBO, for the vortex to be expanded near the time of Nino 3 sea surface temperature maximum (El Nino) but contracted 3 – 4 seasons after, and for the vortex to be displaced farther into the date line hemisphere when there is an El Nino. There is also an impressive tendency for the winter vortex to be less displaced into the eastern hemisphere at the time of El Nino. The tendency for the vortex to be contracted near sunspot maximum, and expanded near sunspot minimum, is significant at only about the 80 % level because of the small sample size. 1...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{isolation}} of the winter Arctic <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> is studied using analyzed winds derived from geopotential height fields. Isentropic trajectories are calculated for assemblages of particles initialized on uniform latitude-longitude grids. Transport across isolines of Ertel potential vorticity (PV) is used to characterize the mixing processes of ejection of vortex air and entrainment of midlatitude air into the vortex. During January and February a barrier to mixing, where exchange of air is inhibited, typically forms near the vortex boundary. At 450 K, transport across the barrier is predominantly {{in the form of}} thin filaments of particles ejected from the vortex. These filaments tend to wrap around the vortex, creating a layered structure of vortex and midlatitude air at the vortex edge. Near or total splits of the vortex into two or more distinct vortex fragments are quite common based on these trajectory calculations. Significant entrainment deep into the vortex is rare and results from {{only a limited number of}} the splitting events. During December and March the mixing barrier is less evident due to nonconservative factors during the spin-up and breakdown of the vortex, respectively. In December both ejection and entrainment are only weakly inhibited by the mixing barrier. Exchange in March is dominated by ejection of air from the vortex...|$|E
40|$|Long-range {{infrasound}} propagation strongly {{depends on}} the state of the stratosphere. Infrasound can be efficiently ducted between the Earth's surface and the stratopause under a favorable wind and temperature structure between 40 and 50 km altitude. Understanding infrasound propagation under variable stratospheric conditions is of importance for a successful verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty, in which infrasound is used as a verification technique. Inversely, infrasound observations can be used in acoustic remote sensing of the upper atmosphere. In previous studies, attention has been paid to the strength and direction of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> wind. In this study, an analysis is made of the temperature effect in the stratosphere on infrasound propagation. A case study is presented from an explosion during a sudden stratospheric warming. During such conditions, the size of the classical stratospheric shadow zone (? 200 km) appeared to be reduced by a factor of 2. The occurrence of such conditions is quantified by evaluating 10 years of atmospheric specifications. It unexpectedly appeared that the size of the shadow zone can become smaller than 100 km, which is confirmed by evaluating infrasound detections from mining blasts in southwestern Siberia, Russia. These results are valid over a latitudinal range of 20 °N to 60 °N, which is determined by the stratospheric surf zone. Control & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{location}} of Northern Hemisphere storm tracks may cause significant societal and economic impacts under future climate change, but projections of future changes are highly uncertain and drivers of long-term changes are poorly understood. Here we develop a late Holocene storminess reconstruction from northwest Spain and combine this with an equivalent record from the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, to measure changes in the dominant latitudinal position of the storm track. The north-south index shows that storm tracks moved from a southern position to higher latitudes over the past 4000 yr, likely driven by a change from meridional to zonal atmospheric circulation, associated with a negative to positive North Atlantic Oscillation shift. We suggest that gradual polar cooling (caused by decreasing solar insolation in summer and amplified by sea-ice feedbacks) and mid-latitude warming (caused by increasing winter insolation) drove a steepening of the winter latitudinal temperature gradient through the late Holocene, resulting in the observed change to a more northern winter storm track. Our findings provide paleoclimate support for observational and modeling studies that link changes in the latitudinal temperature gradient and sea-ice extent to the strength {{and shape of the}} <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex.</b> Together this evidence now suggests that North Atlantic winter storm tracks may shift southward under future warming as sea-ice extent decreases and the mid- to high-latitude temperature gradient decreases, with storms increasingly affecting southern Europe...|$|E
40|$|A more {{thorough}} understanding of regional to hemispheric hydroclimate variability and associated climate patterns is {{needed in order to}} validate climate models and project future conditions. In this study, two annually laminated (varved) sediment records spanning the last millennium were analyzed from Rhode Island and New York. Lamination thickness time series from the two locations are significantly correlated to hydroclimate indicators over the period of instrument overlap, demonstrating their usefulness in reconstructing past conditions. Both records are correlated to climate teleconnection indices, most strongly the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern, suggesting regional to hemispheric influences on hydroclimate. Such a linkage is interpreted to be due to tropospheric circulation patterns in which positive PNA periods are associated with meridional circulation, leading to the dominance of southern moist air masses in the Northeast United States. Alternatively, the zonal flow over North America associated with negative PNA periods produces dominant dry continental air masses over the region. A composite record from the two locations reveals variability of hydroclimate and atmospheric circulation over the late Holocene and shows similarities to previously published reconstructions of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> and of the Aleutian Low-pressure system, supporting the hypothesized PNA linkage. The record is correlated to continental-scale droughts, many of which have been reconstructed in the American Southwest. These results demonstrate the PNA’s influence on hydroclimate over North America, and suggest that this teleconnected pattern may have a significant role in continental drought dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Long term air and {{snowfall}} chemistry measurements {{have been}} performed at the three coastal Antarctic stations Dumont d'Urville (66 ° 40 ′S, 140 ° 1 ′E), Neumayer (70 ° 39 ′S, 8 ° 15 ′W), and Halley (75 ° 35 ′S, 26 ° 19 ′W). The results have to be interpreted and compared {{with respect to the}} regional meteorological conditions. In this study the 3 -hourly synoptic surface observations taken at the three stations between 1991 and 1995, as well as the daily upper air soundings from 1993, are analyzed to describe the aspects of station climatologies relevant for the air and snowfall chemistry measurements discussed in the papers of this special section. Although the three stations are comparable, being situated close to the coastline of Antarctica, the meteorological conditions differ. While at Dumont d'Urville katabatic winds cause predominant strong and relatively dry surface winds from the interior of Antarctica, Neumayer and Halley are frequently influenced by easterly winds associated mostly with eastward moving cyclones. From April through October the wind field above 5 km is governed by a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> with westerly winds increasing in intensity with height. Dumont d'Urville represents a station at the edge of this vortex with extreme stratospheric wind velocities up to above 50 m s− 1. Neumayer and Halley are mostly situated within the vortex and isolated from air masses advecting from lower latitudes into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere during the Austral winter...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{observations}} from a hydrometeorological network {{on the eastern}} slopes of the Annapurna Range, nearly all the annual precipitation at low elevations ( 3000 m MSL) can receive up to 40 % of their annual precipitation as snowfall during the winter, with the highest altitude stations (@ 4000 m MSL and above) having the most total winter precipitation (which can exceed 100 cm). Significant snowstorms are asso-ciated with terrain-locked low-pressure systems that form when an upper-level disturbance passes over the notch formed by the Himalayas and Hindu Kush mountains (the so-called Western Disturbances), causing upper-level SW flow over central Nepal and orographically forced precipitation. Based on these results, a 30 -year (1973 – 2002) climatology of these notch depressions is developed and reveals that sig-nificant interannual variability in central Himalayan winter storms exists. Weak but statistically sig-nificant correlation between notch depressions and the Polar/Eurasia teleconnection pattern was found, suggesting that {{the strength of the}} <b>circumpolar</b> <b>vortex</b> may affect the number of depressions passing through the Himalayan region. A typical snow event (11 February 2000) was the subject of an obser-vational and modeling case study. Local precipitation (snow and rain) and other meteorological ob-servations, as well as satellite (Meteosat- 5 and TRMM) and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data were used, along with a cloud-resolving model with realistic topography. This study shows that significant winter-time precipitation only occurs in the central Himalayas when the large-scale flow evolves to a favorable geometry with respect to the mountains. 1...|$|E
