40|$|What is {{the true}} {{nature and extent of}} the {{interest}} of the joint tenant, as distinct from their joint interest in the property itself? Can the joint tenancy itself constitute property? And, will the extent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenant’s interest always be an undivided moiety? This paper reviews two recent decisions: Peldan v Anderson (2006) 80 ALJR 1588 and Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 7. At first instance, the court in Peldan v Anderson conceptualised the severance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy as <b>a</b> transfer <b>of</b> property. This was discussed also in the Federal Court decision and in the High Court on appeal. The Federal Court analysed the severance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy in terms of the alienation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bundle <b>of</b> rights, indicating <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy as itself a property interest. This paper uses Penner’s challenge to the ‘bundle of rights’ theory <b>of</b> property as <b>a</b> framework to reject this. Having determined the nature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy as other than property, the paper refers to Cummins to examine the extent of the joint tenant’s property interest. This case shows <b>a</b> contemporary application <b>of</b> equitable rules that result in the deconstruction of the joint tenant’s undivided moiety. Together, these cases highlight the challenges associated with finding the true extent of ‘ownership’ and ‘property’ where <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy is involved...|$|R
