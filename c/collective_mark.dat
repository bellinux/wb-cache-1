The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst <b>collective</b> <b>mark</b> by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
500|$|The Thirteen Soundtrack was {{composed}} by several {{artists from the}} San Francisco-based music label Future Primitive Sound. 13 tracks were produced, {{all of which were}} initially unnamed. According to the booklet, the DJs are connected with the characters, such as DJ Faust and Shortee with XIII, DJ Zeph with Carrington or J-Boogie's Dubtronic Science with Mongoose. The album opens with an introduction and then includes songs in the likes of typical 70s-era music such as soul, funk, jazz, but also hip-hop. According to founder and [...] "Creative Director" [...] of the <b>collective,</b> <b>Mark</b> Herlihy, the soundtrack project began with Herlihy's friend, Pete Jacobs, whom he met at a gig, five or six years previously. After studying the characters and the story, the group decided on a noir and futuristic style that would reflect the espionage theme. Its rhythm ranges from 105 to 120 bpm.|$|E

Intellectual property rights, particularly if owned collectively, accelerate cluster creation, an organizational form particularly beneficial for tourism.

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>marks</b> {{guarantee}} ownership over a community’s intangible {{wealth and}} in this sense not only reinforce its branding activities, but {{set up a new}} structure in which community business can function. Systems of local innovation may thus be developed through the design of an adequate legal infrastructure, paving the way for the solution of policy concerns, such as rural exodus or unemployment. Cluster theory argues that, if small and medium sized enterprises intensify their degree of interaction to build up networks, this reduces costs, dependence on large firms, provides access to new markets and helps improve the position of the cluster in the market. All these functions can be reinforced through <b>collective</b> <b>marks,</b> which offer a legal context for the cluster’s governance structure, its standards and quality controls and system of collaboration. These features are particularly of relevance in a sector like tourism, where cooperation is a prerequisite for success. Empirical evidence suggests a certain sense of confusion on the role of trade mark protection in clusters: Individual marks are used as if they were <b>collective</b> <b>marks,</b> <b>collective</b> <b>marks</b> are used without further consideration of the economic aspects or intellectual property protection is altogether ignored. In practice the wide range of opportunities provided by collective trademarks remains unexploited. Interdisciplinary approaches to IP may help to bridge a gap, observed both within academia and in practice, and thus join the IP law perspective to the evolving management literature on cluster theory. ...|$|R

40|$|On April 6, 2006, Japan {{adopted a}} new, hybrid system to protect {{regional}} <b>collective</b> <b>marks.</b> In some ways, these act similar <b>collective</b> <b>marks</b> in the United States and, {{in some other}} ways, these marks act like geographic indications that the European Union favors. Although the JPO promises great economic gains by any association that takes advantage of these marks, {{it is not clear}} how or why that would happen. Rather, it appears that the Japanese central government (GOJ) is using the regional collective trademark system to gain political favor from an influential lobby: those that favor a decentralized political system focused on regionalism within Japan. This rather new type of trademark is referred to as the “regionally based collective trademark system 2 ̆ 2 地域団体商標制度 “chiikidantaishohyoseido”. In Japan, this has been abbreviated to “Chiiki Brand System. ” In Japanese, the initial two characters of this rather long name and the word for “region” is “chiiki. ” Thus, the Chiiki Brand System was born. In the end, this article demonstrates that the Chiiki Brand System is unlikely to produce the positive economic results that the JPO claims it will. Rather, the value of the Chiiki Brand System will mollify the political movement towards Japanese decentralization and internal regionalism. By creating the Chiiki Brand System, the GOJ appears to be responsive to movements that encourage the diffusion of government services (and the related industries that tend to follow) away from Tokyo to other parts of Japan. This is politically an astute direction. The Chiiki Brand System can play into the decentralization movement that pushes some politicians. However, upon closer analysis, it is apparent that the Chiiki Brand System will fail to encourage economic development and it is, in application, not a regional system of trademark generation, protection and enforcement. Therefore, this article will show that what appears to be a simple statue to codify the protection of regional <b>collective</b> <b>marks</b> in a hybrid fashion akin to both <b>collective</b> <b>marks</b> from the United States and geographic indications from Europe is actually an attempt to be responsive to political movements focused on decentralization. As the promised economic benefits have not been recognized by any of the 10 most likely associations, and the “regional” part of the Chiiki Brand System is actually “national” and therefore not responsive to the political voices urging decentralization in the form of regionalism, the Chiiki Brand System may be a very expensive failure...|$|R

Certification organizations charge for the use of their labels and are thus always aware of exact production numbers. In this way, certification organisations can be seen to earn a commission from sales of products under their follow-up regimes. In return, the use of the certification marks enables the product sales in the first place.|$|R
