500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are going to build".|$|E

[...] Its leader, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, decreed three days of mourning for Christians working for state institutions. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party's Speaker of Parliament Saad Katatni said of Shenouda's death that Egypt had lost [...] "one of its national icons, a man who left a void in the political arena at a critical time." [...] The party also issued a statement signed by the party's chairman Mohamed Morsi that stated Shenouda's life was [...] "a long journey of big contribution in various fields domestically and abroad." [...] Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri's statement read: [...] "I give my sincere condolences to the Coptic brothers home and abroad.

These policies significantly differ from those typically implemented in developed countries in their fundamental objectives, the technological strategies deployed and the market and institutional environments they rest on.

We examine the robustness of these models over different data sets, time periods, sampling frequencies, and estimation techniques.

40|$|Preliminary and incomplete) This study {{evaluates the}} impact of {{information}} on international portfolio investments. We decompose information into two categories: information that is observable by investors from all <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call homogeneous, and information <b>that</b> differs between <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call heterogeneous. In the homogeneous information set we include general characteristics relating {{to the size of}} the economy and its financial market, information resulting from the prevailing legal environment and the corporate governance structure of firms in the country. We also include information on how intensively information intermediaries tend to screen firms in <b>that</b> <b>country.</b> Finding proxies for the flow of heterogeneous information is more complicated. Following previous studies we use the geographic distance that should be inversely related to the flow of pieces of information that may turn out to be significant, and also a variable that proxies the commitment of informational resources resulting from the intensity of trade in goods between the countries. Using comprehensive data on the aggregate level of portfolio investments, <b>we</b> find <b>that</b> the information resulting from the size of the financial market by far dominates all other variables in the homogeneous information set. <b>We</b> also show <b>that</b> our proxy for the heterogeneous information seems to explain a substantial part of how investors allocate their portfolio investment across foreign markets.

Currently Chile, Colombia and Mexico all have inflation targets of 3  % (within a target band) and Peru has a central target of 2  %. This generates steady-state predictions for policy rates, as credible inflation targets should be associated with an appropriate long-run nominal interest rate. In particular we expect longer dated expected nominal interest rate in Peru to be lower than the other three to give a similar equilibrium real interest rate. We should also note that in the mid- 2000 s Mexican and Colombian policy rates were markedly higher than the other two.|$|R
