40|$|Human {{acute and}} {{inflammatory}} pain requires {{the expression of}} voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7 but its significance for neuropathic pain is unknown. Here we show that Nav 1. 7 expression in different sets of mouse sensory and sympathetic neurons underlies distinct types of pain sensation. Ablating Nav 1. 7 gene (SCN 9 A) expression in all sensory neurons using Advillin-Cre abolishes mechanical pain, inflammatory pain and reflex withdrawal responses to heat. In contrast, heat-evoked pain is retained when SCN 9 <b>A</b> <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> only in Nav 1. 8 -positive nociceptors. Surprisingly, responses to the hotplate test, as well as neuropathic pain, are unaffected when SCN 9 <b>A</b> <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> in all sensory neurons. However, deleting SCN 9 A in both sensory and sympathetic neurons abolishes these pain sensations and recapitulates the pain-free phenotype seen in humans with SCN 9 A loss-of-function mutations. These observations demonstrate an important role for Nav 1. 7 in sympathetic neurons in neuropathic pain, and provide possible insights into the mechanisms that underlie gain-of-function Nav 1. 7 -dependent pain conditions...|$|R

40|$|Previously, we {{constructed}} {{a set of}} mutants from which eight penicillin binding protein (PBP) genes <b>were</b> <b>deleted</b> in 192 combinations from Escherichia coli (S. A. Denome, P.

Although these mutants were constructed correctly as determined by restriction mapping {{and the absence of}} relevant protein products, we recently discovered by PCR mapping that strains from which mrcA (PBP 1 <b>a)</b> <b>was</b> <b>deleted</b> <b>were</b> also missing two neighboring genes of unknown function (yrfE and yrfF). We created a new deletion mutation in mrcA and reconstructed 63 strains lacking PBP 1 a and other PBP mutant combinations. The new mrcA mutants do not exhibit mucoidy, phage resistance, temperature sensitivity, growth rate defects, or antibiotic resistance, suggesting that these phenotypes require the loss of either yrfE or yrfF alone or in combination with the absence of multiple PBPs...|$|R
