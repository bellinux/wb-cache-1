After the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989, the stations passed into the ownership of National Power. After almost 37 years of use they were decommissioned in May 1991 as outdated and uneconomical to operate.

The <b>combined</b> cooling, <b>heating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> system can avoid dependency on utilities if the peak-load-sizing is adopted.

As a result, distributed generation may lead to increased pollutant emissions within an urban air basin, which could adverselyaffect air quality. However, the use of <b>combined</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> with distributed generation may reduce the energy consumptionfor space <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> air conditioning, resulting in a net decrease of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. This work used a systematic approach based on land-use geographical information system data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution ofdistributed generation emissions in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin of California and simulated the potential air quality impacts using state-of-the-art three-dimensional computer models. Theevaluation of the potential market penetration of distributed generation focuses on the year 2023.

40|$|As {{the living}} {{standards}} of Chinese {{people have been}} improving, the energy demand for cooling <b>and</b> <b>heating,</b> mainly {{in the form of}} electricity, has also expanded. Since an integrated cooling, <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> supply system (CCHP) will serve this demand better, the government is now attaching more importance to the application of CCHP energy systems. Based on the characteristics of the <b>combined</b> cooling <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> supply system, <b>and</b> the method of levelized cost of energy, two calculation methods for the evaluation of the economical efficiency of the system are employed when the energy production in the system is dealt with from the perspective of exergy. According to the first method, fuel costs account for about 75 % of the total cost. In the second method, the profits from <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling are converted to fuel costs, resulting in a significant reduction of fuel costs, accounting for 60 % of the total cost. Then the <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling parameters of gas turbine exhaust, heat recovery boiler, lithium-bromide heat-cooler and commercial tariff of provincial capitals were set as benchmark based on geographic differences among provinces, and the economical efficiency of <b>combined</b> cooling <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> systems in each province were evaluated. The results shows that the <b>combined</b> cooling <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> system is economical in the developed areas of central and eastern China, especially in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces, while in other regions it is not.
