25|$|These {{surfaces}} are never algebraic or Kähler. The minimal ones with b2=0 have been classified by Bogomolov, and are either Hopf surfaces or Inoue surfaces. Examples with positive second Betti number include Inoue-Hirzebruch surfaces, Enoki surfaces, and more generally Kato surfaces. The global spherical shell conjecture implies that all minimal <b>class</b> <b>VII</b> surfaces with positive second Betti number are Kato surfaces, which would {{more or less}} complete the classification of the type VII surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{asserted}} that the Germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with Greek, Latin, or Sanskrit. Although this is true to some extent, it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of Germanic than to any inherent [...] "simplicity" [...] of the Germanic languages. As an example, there are less than 500 years between the Gothic Gospels of 360 and the Old High Germanic Tatian of 830, yet Old High Germanic, despite being the most archaic of the West Germanic languages, is missing {{a large number of}} archaic features present in Gothic, including dual and passive markings on verbs, reduplication in <b>Class</b> <b>VII</b> strong verb past tenses, the vocative case, and second-position (Wackernagel's Law) clitics. Many more archaic features may have been lost between the Proto-Germanic of 200nbsp&BC or so and the attested Gothic language. Furthermore, Proto-Romance and Middle Indic of the fourth century AD—contemporaneous with Gothic—were significantly simpler than Latin and Sanskrit, respectively, and overall probably no more archaic than Gothic. In addition, some parts of the inflectional systems of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit were innovations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European.|$|E
