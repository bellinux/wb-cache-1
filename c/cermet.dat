2500|$|Challenges {{exist in}} SOFC systems {{due to their}} high {{operating}} temperatures. One such challenge {{is the potential for}} carbon dust to build up on the anode, which slows down the internal reforming process. Research to address this [...] "carbon coking" [...] issue at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based <b>cermet</b> (heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal) can reduce coking and the loss of performance. Another disadvantage of SOFC systems is slow start-up time, making SOFCs less useful for mobile applications. Despite these disadvantages, a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum, thereby reducing cost. Additionally, waste heat from SOFC systems may be captured and reused, increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80%–85%.|$|E

Because nickel {{is known as}} a toxin and allergen and allergy to nickel is a phenomenon which has assumed growing importance in recent years there has been a flurry of activity to find alternatives to the nickel binder in <b>cermets.</b> It is also the global research and technical development trend in the powder metallurgy <b>cermets</b> industry.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{correlate}} the carbon content in NbC-Ni starting powders with the resulting microstructure, hardness and fracture toughness of Ni-bonded NbC <b>cermets.</b> A series of NbC-Ni, NbC-Ni-VC and NbC-Ni-Mo <b>cermets</b> with different carbon content were prepared by conventional liquid phase sintering for 1 h at 1420 °C in vacuum.
