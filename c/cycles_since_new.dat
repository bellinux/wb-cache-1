2500|$|Starting {{from some}} element x of S, one writes the {{sequence}} (x σ(x) σ(σ(x)) ...) of successive images under σ, until the image returns to x, {{at which point}} one closes the parenthesis rather than repeat x. The set of values written down forms the orbit (under σ) of x, and the parenthesized expression gives the corresponding cycle of σ. One then continues by choosing a new element y of S outside the previous orbits and writing down the cycle starting at y; and so on until all elements of S are written in <b>cycles.</b> <b>Since</b> for every <b>new</b> <b>cycle</b> the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has: ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{high speed}} Internet routers are built using custom {{designed}} microprocessors, dubbed network processors, to efficiently handle {{the task of}} packet routing. While capable of meeting the performance demanded of them, these custom network processors generally lack the flexibility to incorporate new features and do not scale well beyond that {{for which they were}} designed. Furthermore, they tend to suffer from long and costly development <b>cycles,</b> <b>since</b> each <b>new</b> generation must be redesigned to support new features and fabricated anew in hardware. This thesis presents a new design for a network processor, one implemented entirely in software, on a tiled, general purpose microprocessor. The network processor is implemented on the Raw microprocessor, a general purpose microchip developed by the Computer Architecture Group at MIT. The Raw chip consists of sixteen identical processing tiles arranged in a four by four matrix and connected by four inter-tile communication networks; the Raw chip is designed to be able to scale up merely by adding more tiles to the matrix. By taking advantage of the parallelism inherent in the task of packet forwarding on this inherently parallel microprocessor, the Raw network processor is able to achieve performance that matches or exceeds that of commercially available custom designed network processors. At the same time, it maintains the flexibility to incorporate <b>new</b> features <b>since</b> it is implemented entirely in software, as well as the scalability to handle more ports by simply adding more tiles to the microprocessor. by Anthony M.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of several proteins, apparent ly viral gene products, f irmly bound to the ribosomes of E. coli infected with bacter iophage T 4. In view of the heterogeneity of E. coli r ibosomal proteins described by Kur land et al. and by Traut et al. in this volume, it seems possible that {{one or more of}} these viral proteins has some functional significance. Our experiments began with an a t tempt to prepare, from T 4. infected E. coli, 50 S r ibosomal subunits bearing pept idy l tRNA. (Such prepara-tions were to be used for studies on the ribosome <b>cycle</b> in vitro.) <b>Since</b> <b>new</b> ribosomes are not made after T 4 infection (Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson, 1961), we expected a short pulse of ~ 5 S 0 ~ to be incorporated exclusively into nascent pept ides and soluble proteins in T 4 infected cells. We found a high proport ion of the protein labeled in a 20 sec pulse 10 min after T 4 infection associated with ribosomes; however, only a small fraction of this protein was released by puromycin (Fig. 1).
