40|$|SummaryVisual {{analysis}} of faces and nonfacial body stimuli brings about neural activity in different cortical areas. Moreover, processing body form and body action relies on distinct neural substrates. Although brain lesion studies show specific face processing deficits, neuropsychological evidence for defective recognition of nonfacial body parts is lacking. By combining psychophysics studies with lesion-mapping techniques, {{we found that}} lesions of ventromedial, occipitotemporal areas induce face and body recognition deficits while lesions involving extrastriate body area seem <b>causatively</b> associated with impaired recognition of body but not of face and object stimuli. We also found that body form and body action recognition deficits can be double dissociated and are <b>causatively</b> associated with lesions to extrastriate body area and ventral premotor cortex, respectively. Our study reports two category-specific visual deficits, called body form and body action agnosia, and highlights their neural underpinnings...|$|E

Moreover, we cannot {{rule out the possibility}} that the interchromosomal rearrangement might also be associated with a cryptic microdeletion at 7 q 36, the site of the insertion. Although we did not detect any loss of chromosome 7 material by CGH, this does not unequivocally exclude the presence of a small deletion in this region.|$|E

40|$|Limb apraxia (LA), is a neuropsychological {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} difficulty in performing gestures and may therefore {{be an ideal}} model for investigating whether action execution deficits are <b>causatively</b> linked to deficits in action understanding. We tested 33 left brain-damaged patients and 8 right brain-damaged patients {{for the presence of}} the LA. Importantly, we also tested all the patients in an ad hoc developed gesture recognition task wherein an actor performs, either correctly or incorrectly, transitive (using objects) or intransitive (without objects) meaningful conventional limb gestures. Patients were instructed to judge whether the observed gesture was correct or incorrect. Lesion analysis enabled us to evaluate the relationship between specific brain regions and behavioral performance in gesture execution and gesture comprehension. We found that LA was present in 21 left brain-damaged patients and it was linked to frontal and parietal lesions. Moreover, we found that recognition of correct execution of familiar gestures performed by others was more impaired in patients with LA than in nonapraxic patients. Crucially, the gesture comprehension deficit correlated with damage to the opercular and triangularis portions of the inferior frontal gyrus, two regions that are involved in complex aspects of action-related processing. In contrast, no such relationship was observed with lesions centered on the inferior parietal cortex. The present findings suggest that lesions to left frontal regions that are involved in planning and performing actions are <b>causatively</b> associated with deficits in the recognition of the correct execution of meaningful gestures...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} the second most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, with only partial symptomatic therapy and no mechanism-based therapies. The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein is <b>causatively</b> linked to the sporadic form of the disease, which accounts for 95 % of cases. The pathology is a result of a gain of toxic function of misfolded α-synuclein conformers, which can template the aggregation of soluble monomers and lead to cellular dysfunction, at least partly by interfering with membrane fusion events at synaptic terminals. Here, we discuss the transcellular propagation and intracellular trafficking of α-synuclein and posit that endosomal processing could be a point of convergence between these two routes. Understanding these events will clarify the therapeutic potential of enzymes that regulate protein trafficking and degradation in synucleinopathies...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intimately, if not <b>causatively,</b> associated with the deposition of approximately 4 kDa beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of affected individuals. A beta peptides are liberated from transmembrane proteins, termed beta-amyloid precursor proteins (APP), by the concerted action of beta- and gamma-secretase(s). Whereas the identity of beta-secretase {{is no longer in}} question, the identity of gamma-secretase, which is responsible for the intramembranous processing of APP, has never been more enigmatic. Considerable evidence has accrued to impugn the presenilins (PS) as the executioners of intramembranous processing of APP. Here, we summarize these observations and review recent evidence that argues against the prevailing hypothesis that PS function as gamma-secretases. status: publishe...|$|E

To this end, New Zealand White rabbits were fed a cholesterol-enriched diet and subjected to balloon denudation of the infrarenal aorta to induce atherosclerotic plaque formation. After 13 weeks, the proximal or distal half of the infrarenal aorta was exposed to transluminal RFA. The untreated half served as an intra-individual control. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed directly after RFA. We found that RFA on the rabbit atherosclerotic plaque is safe and leads to decreased intraplaque vessel density and smooth muscle cell content but does not affect other components of plaque composition or size...|$|E

Here, we examined the direct effects of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the progression of high fat/calorie diet-induced steatohepatitis using Tet-mev- 1 mice, in which a mutated succinate dehydroge-nase transgene impairs the mitochondrial electron transport and generates an excess amount of ROS in response to doxycycline administration.

40|$|The {{vitreous}} body, {{the largest}} {{structure of the}} eye, is surrounded by the retina and the lens. With aging, the vitreous body is subject to structural changes, such as the formation of liquid-filled spaces (synchysis) and dense condensations (syneresis) [1 - 3]. In itself, this can give rise to the percep-tion of floaters, which can seriously interfere with visual functioning. Vitreous liquefaction can be followed by the occurrence of a posterior vitreous detachment [4], which is associated with sight-threatening pathologies such as periph-eral retinal tears [5 - 8], retinal detachment [5 - 7], macular holes and puckers, and intravitreal hemorrhage [5 - 7].
