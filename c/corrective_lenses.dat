5|$|Discarding one's <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses,</b> as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's {{prescribed}} correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{who need}} <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> to see clearly outside {{the water would}} {{normally}} need the same prescription while wearing a mask. Generic and custom <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are available for some two-window masks. Custom lenses can be bonded onto masks that have a single front window or two windows.|$|E

5000|$|In contrast, the eye {{moves to}} look through various parts of a <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> as it shifts its gaze, some {{of which can be}} as much as several centimeters off of the optical center. Thus, despite the eye's {{dispersive}} properties, the <b>corrective</b> <b>lens's</b> dispersion cannot be dismissed. People who are sensitive to the effects of chromatic aberrations, or who have stronger prescriptions, or who often look off the lens’s optical center, or who prefer larger <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> sizes may be impacted by chromatic aberration.

25|$|Anti-reflective {{coatings}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications where light passes through an optical surface, and low loss or low reflection is desired.

25|$|Diving masks can {{be fitted}} with lenses for divers needing optical {{correction}} to improve vision. <b>Corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are ground flat {{on one side}} and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and {{below the surface of the}} water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are available which can be fitted. Plastic self-adhesive lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask floods.|$|E
25|$|Various {{refractive}} eye surgery techniques {{change the}} shape of the cornea {{in order to reduce the}} need for <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> or otherwise improve the refractive state of the eye.

25|$|Diving masks can {{be fitted}} with {{prescription}} lenses for divers needing optical correction to improve vision. <b>Corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are ground flat {{on one side}} and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and {{below the surface of the}} water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are available which can be fitted.

25|$|The optical {{power of}} <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> is {{measured}} in diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative focal length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, {{and one for the}} angle of orientation of the astigmatism.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses.</b> For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
50|$|The reduced eye {{model is}} used by medical {{students}} when studying refractive errors such as myopia and hyperopia (near- and far-sightedness) and by ophthalmologists to simplify <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> computations.|$|R

25|$|Single lenses have {{a variety}} of {{applications}} including photographic lenses, <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses,</b> and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used in parabolic reflectors and rear-view mirrors. Combining a number of mirrors, prisms, and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply two plane mirrors aligned to allow for viewing around obstructions. The most famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by the Dutch in the late 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Bifocals are {{eyeglasses}} whose <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> contain {{regions with}} two distinct optical powers. Benjamin Franklin {{is credited with}} {{the invention of the}} first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s, though according to the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first indication of Dr. Franklin wearing his double spectacles comes from a political cartoon printed in 1764. Many publications from that period onward refer to Dr. Franklin's double spectacles, including his first reference to them in a letter written in Paris, France on August 21, 1784, that was addressed to his personal friend, English philanthropist George Whatley.|$|E
25|$|People {{with early}} {{keratoconus}} typically notice a minor blurring of their vision {{and come to}} their clinician seeking <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may be no {{different from those of}} any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.|$|E
5000|$|Optical {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} error in the eye's <b>lens</b> and the <b>corrective</b> <b>lens.</b> This can cause confusion, since [...] "astigmatism" [...] or [...] "ABBE" [...] has drastically different impact on vision depending on which lens has the error.|$|R
50|$|As the eye shifts its {{gaze from}} {{looking through the}} optical center of the <b>corrective</b> <b>lens,</b> the lens-induced {{astigmatism}} value increases. In a spherical lens, especially one with a strong correction whose base curve {{is not in the}} best spherical form, such increases can significantly impact the clarity of vision in the periphery.|$|R
2500|$|Pliny {{also has}} the {{earliest}} known reference {{to the use of}} a <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> when he mentions that Nero was said to watch the gladiatorial games using an emerald (presumably [...] to correct for nearsightedness, though the reference is vague). Both Pliny and Seneca the Younger (3 BC–65) described the magnifying effect of a glass globe filled with water.|$|R
25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses.</b> Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E
25|$|Other pilots at {{the charter}} company told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry and first officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both {{displayed}} below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots {{to take over}} all aircraft functions {{as if they were}} the sole pilot during flights. After the crash, three copilots told of occasions on which they had had to take control of the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, only three days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry's longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the accident. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain's flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9–10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He had had Lasik surgery but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30 and he was required by FAA regulations to wear <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses,</b> but the pilot's wife and Cooney said Conry did not wear lenses after the surgery. The coroner who examined his badly burned body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.|$|E
