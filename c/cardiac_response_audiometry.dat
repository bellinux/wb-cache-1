40|$|Alcohol {{abuse is}} the second most {{prevalent}} lifetime psychiatric disorder. However, individuals do not face an equal risk of developing problematic alcoholrelated behaviors. Alcohol use disorders are heterogeneous conditions whose development may be caused by a variety of factors and vulnerabilities. The identification of markers of risk is necessary in order to identify individuals at higher risk for addiction early on as well as to help develop treatment interventions which target an individual's specific risk factors. The goal of the present dissertation is to increase our understanding of the role that one putative risk factor, an exaggerated <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> to alcohol, may play in the development of addictive behaviors. Five studies are reported. The first study revealed that an exaggerated heart rate response to alcohol is associated with subjective reports of increased alcohol-induced stimulation. In a second study, the relationship between the <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> to alcohol and personality characteristics was examined. Individuals who demonstrated the elevated <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> to alcohol displayed a distinct personality profile characterized by high sensation-seeking and sensitivity to reward. Two separate studies followed investigating the relationship between this physiological response to alcohol and other addictive behaviours. One study found that individuals with an exaggerated <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> to alcohol were more likely to obtain superior scores on a measure of pathological gambling, while the next study found that users of psychostimulants (e. g., cocaine) also displayed heightened alcohol-induced <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses.</b> A final study examined the impact of conditioned cues of reward and non-reward on alcohol-induced <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses.</b> Individuals who had previously displayed elevated <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to ethanol showed reduced cardiac reactivity when alcohol ingestion occurred in a non-rewarding environment. Overall, these findings suggest that the <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> to alcohol is a marker of a pathway that may lead to addictive behaviors through increased sensitivity to incentive reward...|$|R

MÉTODO: foi realizado estudo clínico duplo-cego com 139 crianças de um a 180 dias de vida, atendidas no serviço de Triagem Auditiva Neonatal do Hospital Universitário de Santa Maria. Diferentes examinadores verificaram a presença do reflexo cócleo-palpebral e de emissões otoacústicas evocadas transientes. RESULTADOS: das 139 crianças avaliadas, 123 apresentaram reflexo cócleo-palpebral e emissões otoacústicas; 10 apresentaram somente reflexo cócleo-palpebral; três apresentaram somente emissões otoacústicas; três não apresentaram respostas em ambos os testes. Dezesseis crianças deveriam ser retestadas. Nove não compareceram. Das sete crianças retestadas, duas passaram em ambos os testes e cinco mantiveram falha e foram encaminhadas para avaliação de Potencial Evocado Auditivo de Tronco Encefálico. Uma delas não compareceu. Duas crianças tiveram emissões otoacústicas presentes e reflexo cócleo-palpebral ausente. Na avaliação de Potencial Evocado Auditivo de Tronco Encefálico uma delas manifestou audição normal e outra perda auditiva profunda. Uma criança que não evidenciou emissões otoacústicas, mas manifestou reflexo cócleo-palpebral, teve Potencial Evocado Auditivo de Tronco Encefálico compatível com perda auditiva moderada {{bilateral}}. A criança que falhou em ambos os testes apresentou perda auditiva severa bilateral na avaliação de Potencial Evocado Auditivo de Tronco Encefálico. CONCLUSÃO: a presença de emissões otoacústicas concomitante com ausência de reflexo cócleo-palpebral pode ser sinal de neuropatia auditiva. A análise de emissões otoacústicas e a avaliação do reflexo cócleo-palpebral são procedimentos complementares. A aparente discordância entre alguns resultados pode apontar diferentes tipos de comprometimento auditivo. PURPOSE: {{to check}} the agreement among the obtained results in hearing screening through the observation of behavioral responses and the transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. METHOD: a double-blind study was carried out with 139 infants attended in Neonatal Hearing Screening service of Santa Maria University Hospital. Different examiners evaluated the presence of eye blink reflex and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. RESULTS: among the 139 evaluated infants, 123 showed eye blink reflex and otoacoustic emissions; 10 showed only otoacoustic emissions; and 3 failed in both tests. Sixteen infants should be re-evaluated. Nine did not come back to repeat the tests. Seven children were re-evaluated, two passed in both tests; five maintained the failed status and they were referred to evaluation on Auditory <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry.</b> Two children showed otoacoustic emissions, but did not have eye blink reflex. In the evaluation of Auditory <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry,</b> one manifested normal hearing and the other showed acute hearing loss. One child who did not evidence otoacoustic emissions, but manifested eye blink reflex, had compatible Auditory <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry</b> with moderate hearing loss in both ears. The infant who failed in both test showed severe bilateral hearing loss {{in the evaluation of}} Auditory <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry.</b> CONCLUSION: even though the otoacoustic emissions are present, the absence of eye blink reflex should be considered a reason to evaluate the Auditory <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry,</b> and this can be sign of auditory neuropathy. Considering that the analysis of otoacoustic emissions and the evaluation of eye blink reflex are complement procedures.

After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to behavioural observation audiometry (BOA) and brainstem evoked <b>response</b> <b>audiometry</b> test (BERA). Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59. 05 %) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings of both tests were not similar.

The study was conducted to compare the result of neonatal hearing screening in high risk and non high risk neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS A study was conducted over a time period of three months at a tertiary care institute to screen all live neonates for congenital hearing impairment using OAE and BERA. RESULT 1182 neonates were screened for hearing impairment. 336 were in High risk group and rest in Non high risk group. Nine neonates turned out to have abnormal BERA result (absence of wave V). Six of them were high risk babies and rest 3 were non high risk. DISCUSSION 33. 33 % of congenital deaf population detected by UNHS belong to the Non High Risk group. Studies across the world suggest at least 50 % chance of missing out a congenital deaf child if Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening is not practiced.   CONCLUSION In order to ensure that early detection and effective intervention are made on all newborns with hearing impairment, UNHS should be performed.

Innocuous stimuli presented in an irrelevant condition elicit a simple cardiac deceleration termed ECR 1. The same stimuli presented in a relevant condition (such as results from requesting subjects to silently count the stimuli) elicit a complex biphasic response with a large secondary acceleration in heart rate. This difference is attributed to the additional effect of cognitive task performance, resulting in an addition response component, ECR 2. This may be realised by subtraction of the two responses. We {{investigated the}} mechanisms involved by comparing <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> profiles from a neurologically-impaired group with those from a control group. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) {{has been associated with}} a loss of synaptic connections in the frontal lobe.

It necessitates investigation of possible neurological impairment, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, and hearing loss. Early diagnosis is facilitiated by the battery of auditory tests comprising behavioural, impedance audiometry and auditory brain-stem <b>response</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Interpretation of test findings must be carefully assessed {{in the light of}} other pertinent information...|$|R

Consequently. determining the hearing at the youngest age possible is important to promote the development of language and communication. Brainstern <b>response</b> <b>audiometry</b> has the special advantage of being an objective method. Cooperation of the patient is not required {{so it can be}} applied even in the young children. It is the aim of the present study to assess the reliability of this method by comparing with data obtained with pure tone audiometry. For the latter cooperation of the patient is essential.

40|$|Rationale: Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{serotonin}} might be involved in performance monitoring, although the results have been inconclusive. Inconsistent results might be related to the type of pharmacological manipulation and the used behavioral and physiological measures. Objectives: The present study aimed at further specifying the role of serotonin in performance monitoring. Materials and methods The effect of serotonin on performance monitoring was studied by using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), a well-known method to transiently lower central serotonin levels. Twenty healthy male volunteers performed a time-estimation task and their event-related brain potential (ERP), behavioral, and <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to feedback stimuli were measured. Furthermore, subjective mood and amino-acid levels were determined. Results: As expected, ATD did not affect mood and lowered tryptophan levels. ATD attenuated cardiac slowing to negative feedback but did not affect responses to positive feedback, ERPs, and performance measures. Conclusions: The data point {{in the direction of a}} dissociation between <b>cardiac</b> and electro-cortical <b>responses.</b> <b>Cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> appear to be more sensitive to changes in serotonin metabolism and appear to reflect different aspects of the feedback stimulus. The phasic <b>cardiac</b> <b>response</b> appears to be an important measure that provides additional information about the impact of feedback stimuli and serotonergic functioning...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the existence of}} a circadian rhythm in <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to vagal stimulation tests, 10 children without neurologic or cardiopulmonary disease, were studied using a standardized procedure. A trigeminal airstream stimulation test (TAS) and an ocular compression test (OCT) were subsequently performed at 4 nonequidistant hours. These 2 vagal stimulation tests were performed according to well-established, previously published techniques. Prolongation of the RR-interval during TAS and OCT was calculated and compared to the mean control RR-interval preceding the stimulation period. Prolongation of the RR-interval during the stimulation period was obtained in all instances during TAS and OCT. Chronobiologic analysis was determined by the cosinor method and bootstrap analysis. A significant circadian rhythm was found in <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to vagal stimulation for both TAS and OCT. The maximal response hour for TAS was between 9 : 06 p. m. and 5 : 18 a. m. and for OCT between 10 : 18 p. m. and 4 : 24 a. m. The mean value and 95 % intervals for the <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to both vagal stimulation tests revealed, when using the bootstrap analysis, an important overlap in the hour of appearance of the maximal responses to these procedures; the bootstrap analysis of the peak of the acrophase was at 2 : 50 a. m. for TAS and 1 : 15 a. m. for OCT. Our results indicate that there is a circadian rhythm in <b>cardiac</b> <b>responses</b> to vagal stimulation tests and demonstrate a preponderance of these responses during the early morning hours. © 1992.
