25|$|From 1969 to 1980, Mannesmann Demag and MBB cooperated {{to build}} the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> urban {{transportation}} system in Germany. Together the firms formed the Cabintaxi Joint Venture. They created an extensive PRT technology that was considered fully developed by the German government and its safety authorities. The system {{was to have been}} installed in Hamburg, but budget cuts stopped the proposed project before the start of construction. With no other potential projects on the horizon, the joint venture disbanded, and the fully developed PRT technology was never installed. Cabintaxi Corporation, a US-based company, obtained the technology in 1985, and remains active in the private-sector market for transportation systems.|$|E
2500|$|Detroit {{had been}} one of six cities {{selected}} for rapid development under the UMTA program, when, after ten years, little actual development had taken place and the UMTA was mandated to install systems with all possible speed. None of the high-tech developments funded by the UMTA had been installed, nor developed {{to the point where they}} were ready for service. Instead, the Detroit system was favouring the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> system from Germany, but that company decided to pull out of the contest in order to focus on a larger development in Hamburg. The UTDC responded to a [...] "buy American" [...] clause in the UMTA by opening a branch office in Detroit, and that immediately swung the decision in their favour. However, with the Ronald Reagan administration taking office in 1981, UMTA was rapidly de-funded. Four of the five cities ended their development plans, but Detroit and Miami (using a different design) decided to press ahead with their deployments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi's</b> {{control system}} was decentralized, with three {{different}} control systems, each in command of one portion of the system's overall operation.|$|R

50|$|While work on {{the basic}} <b>Cabinentaxi</b> continued, a {{modified}} version known as Cabinlift was also developed. Originally designed for installations in healthcare facilities, Cabinlift was based on substantially similar technology as the basic <b>Cabinentaxi.</b> The Cabinlift cars were larger and taller, allowing easy walk-on access for passengers and bulky loads, notably wheeled hospital beds and gurneys. The cars could be built with the doors on the side, or on the ends. Unlike <b>Cabinentaxi,</b> passengers in Cabinlift could stand with some fold-down seats available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi,</b> {{sometimes}} Cabintaxi in English, was a German {{people mover}} development project undertaken by Demag and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm with funding {{and support from}} the Bundesministerium für Forschung und Technologie (BMFT, the German Ministry of Research and Development). <b>Cabinentaxi</b> was designed to offer low-cost mass transit services where conventional systems, like a metro, would be too expensive to deploy due to low ridership or high capital costs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi</b> was {{designed}} to allow top or bottom running of the vehicles, or both on one track.|$|E
50|$|J. Edward Anderson, the {{well-known}} U.S. proponent of PRT systems, also selected <b>Cabinentaxi</b> for a proposed deployment in Indianapolis. After the initial $300,000 {{for the study}} ran out, no further money was forthcoming and the plans fell through.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cabinentaxi</b> {{systems could}} be {{operated}} {{in a variety}} of fashions depending on the need. It is most widely known as the first true personal rapid transit (PRT) system, where customers call up a small [...] "car" [...] on demand which then takes them directly to their destination without any stops along the way. The system could also be used in a group rapid transit (GRT) fashion, using larger cars with up to 18 passengers. In this case the vehicles would travel along a fixed route, stopping at any station that a passenger requested. <b>Cabinentaxi</b> could also mix the two modes on a single line, which allowed direct routing to high-density areas when traffic loads were low, saving the larger van-like vehicles for the high-demand periods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cabinentaxi</b> offered {{very high}} {{capacity}} utilization of its lines, up to 80% full before congestion would occur. <b>Cabinentaxi</b> {{also had a}} number of different car sizes, seating 6, 12 and 18 passengers. The larger cars could be formed into two-unit trains which could increase system capacity in small loop or shuttle operations, but the two-unit train had limited advantage in large network applications where short headways are effectively an electronic coupling. The [...] "KK" [...] series of vehicles, [...] "KK 3, 6,12,18(all designed, but only the KK 3 and KK 12 were developed), were all of the same cross sectional area with only the length of the vehicle changed. With the same construction style in the body and undercarriages, these vehicle could share the same small vehicle guideway.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{was chosen}} as lead {{consultant}} to plan an automated transit system for Indianapolis, and selected the German-built Cabinentaxi—a three-person vehicle that travels below its elevated rail {{in one direction and}} on top of it in the other.Anderson was later hired by the German builder of <b>Cabinentaxi</b> to act as U.S. representative, until the company abandoned work on the idea.|$|E
5000|$|This {{number is}} similar to the ones {{proposed}} by the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> system, although they predicted that actual use would be much lower. Although PRTs have less passenger seating and speeds, their shorter headways dramatically improve passenger capacity. However, these systems are often constrained by brick-wall considerations for legal reasons, which limits their performance to a car-like 2 seconds. In this case: ...|$|E
50|$|Various {{personal}} {{rapid transit}} systems in the 1970s reduced the headways considerably. Under computer control, reaction times {{can be reduced to}} fractions of a second. Whether traditional headway regulations should apply to PRT and car train technology is debatable. In the case of the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> system developed in Germany, headways were set to 1.9 seconds because the developers were forced to adhere to the brick-wall criterion. In experiments they demonstrated headways on the order of half of a second.|$|E
50|$|In {{operation}} the ACT systems {{had more}} in common with a metro system or the people movers used at airports, using relatively large cars with up to 20 passengers and making stops at all requested stations. As deployed, it was not a true personal rapid transit system, like the contemporary <b>Cabinentaxi</b> or the modern ULTra, which offer true point-to-point service for every car. ACT's unique feature was the embedded bypasses, which allowed bi-directional service on a line consisting primarily of a single track.|$|E
5000|$|The final primary vehicle {{designs for}} the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> system were the [...] "KK 3"(Klein Kabine 3), a three-passenger vehicle, and the [...] "KK 12" [...] (Klein Kabine 12), a twelve-passenger vehicle, both with a {{semi-automatic}} doors. They were designed with enough room between the seats for wheelchairs, prams or bicycles. The doors were semi-automatic, locking and unlocking under vehicle control, but slid open by the passengers. The vehicle bodies were made of aluminum over a steel chassis, riding on solid rubber wheels that engaged the guidance rails in the track.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi,</b> as Cabintaxi, {{was also}} one of the systems {{approved}} to contend for the UMTA's Downtown People Mover Program. It was recognized as the favorite system to win the Detroit People Mover project. For the Detroit project, the system's over-and-under beam was a major advantage as the city specified a single-beam system, and the over-and-under beam would provide bi-directional operation which the city wanted but could not otherwise get with its single beam restriction. The schedules for the Detroit People Mover Program and the Hamburg application appeared to conflict, so the consortium chose to withdraw from the US competition and concentrate on Hamburg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi</b> {{technology}} logged over 400,000 vehicle-miles between 1975 and 1978 on the Hagen test track. In 1977 {{the system}} completed fleet operation endurance testing of 7500 continuous vehicle hours, extending that in 1978 to 10,000 continuous vehicle hours. These {{are the only}} PRT fleet endurance test of these magnitudes ever carried out. Headways were reduced throughout the period, vehicle separations started at under 3 seconds, reaching 1.9 seconds in later tests, {{about the same as}} cars on a highway. The basic operating speed was also increased during testing, from the original 30 km/h to 36 in the later tests, with options for even higher speeds in production versions.|$|E
50|$|From 1969 to 1980, Mannesmann Demag and MBB cooperated {{to build}} the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> urban {{transportation}} system in Germany. Together the firms formed the Cabintaxi Joint Venture. They created an extensive PRT technology that was considered fully developed by the German government and its safety authorities. The system {{was to have been}} installed in Hamburg, but budget cuts stopped the proposed project before the start of construction. With no other potential projects on the horizon, the joint venture disbanded, and the fully developed PRT technology was never installed. Cabintaxi Corporation, a US-based company, obtained the technology in 1985, and remains active in the private-sector market for transportation systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{publication}} of the HUD reports in the US in 1968 led to a wave of developments in the mass transit world. Dozens of companies around the world started development of AGT systems from large to small, hoping {{to cash in on}} what was predicted to be an enormous buildout of AGT systems. The majority of these systems were essentially smaller versions of rubber-wheeled metros, sometimes operating as a single car, but often in small trains. On the simpler end were systems like the Vought Airtrans and Bendix Dashaveyor, while more complex systems include the Alden staRRcar and <b>Cabinentaxi</b> which were true personal rapid transit systems (PRTs).|$|E
50|$|There was a {{centralized}} control system used in <b>Cabinentaxi,</b> {{but it did not}} have direct control over the vehicles. This system was used to plan the most efficient route when a customer selected a destination and paid for it. The calculated route was then uploaded onto a magnetic stripe on the customer's fare card. The card was then inserted into a reader to call a car from the storage area or one passing by on the line, at which point the reader uploaded the route to the car's onboard computer. Once calculated the route was static, although the customer did have the option to stop at the very next station if they pressed a button in the car.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} all {{elevated}} transportation system structures in general, {{is that the}} guideways (highways or transit) are widely {{considered to be an}} eyesore. In order {{to reduce the size of}} the guideways, <b>Cabinentaxi</b> took the uncommon approach of optionally allowing its cars to run on the top or bottom of a single track. The cars could not be switched from top to bottom, however. If this option was used, the guideways were supported on pillars that attached to the track from the side, rather than directly below. Cabinentaxi's guideway is noticeably smaller and thinner than conventional elevated systems, like the Vancouver SkyTrain. The track is approximately six feet wide, slightly smaller than a row of parking spots on the side of a city street.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinentaxi</b> was {{in serious}} {{consideration}} for two deployments {{in the late}} 1970s; BMFT {{was in the process}} of funding a deployment in Hamburg while their U.S. counterpart, the Urban Mass Transit Authority (UMTA), selected it as a front-runner for a deployment in Detroit. Cabinentaxi's corporate partners decided to pull out of the Detroit competition to focus on the Hamburg development. When unrelated budget cuts drained the BMFT's coffers, the Hamburg project was also canceled, and the Cabintaxi Joint Venture gave up on the public transit field and withdrew the Cabintaxi technology from the market. The rights were purchased in 1985 by a small U.S. consortium, Cabintaxi Corporation, but no developments have followed. The only commercial use was a modified system, the Cabinlift, which operated as a horizontal elevator between buildings at the Schwalmstadt-Ziegenhain hospital in Germany until 2002.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide fine control over vehicle spacing and reduce {{maintenance}} costs, the companies selected a linear motor (LIM) for the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> project. Linear motors were a major area of research since the 1960s {{when they were first}} introduced in the U.K. by Eric Laithwaite. As they have no moving parts, a LIM-powered vehicle would be more reliable than one using a conventional motor. Another advantage {{is that there is no}} contact between the motor and the track, so snow or rain will not affect its performance, which means a LIM vehicle does not require additional headspace in bad weather. Also, because the traction does not rely on friction, LIMs can climb much steeper grades. On the downside, LIMs require a [...] "reaction rail" [...] for the motor to push against, which increases capital costs slightly.|$|E
5000|$|Two major {{government}} funded APM {{projects are}} notable. In Germany, Mannesmann Demag and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm developed a system known as <b>Cabinentaxi</b> during the 1970s. Cabinetaxi featured small cars with {{from four to}} eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were [...] "offline", allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted {{from one to the}} other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Detroit {{had been}} one of six cities {{selected}} for rapid development under the UMTA program, when, after ten years, little actual development had taken place and the UMTA was mandated to install systems with all possible speed. None of the high-tech developments funded by the UMTA had been installed, nor developed {{to the point where they}} were ready for service. Instead, the Detroit system was favouring the <b>Cabinentaxi</b> system from Germany, but that company decided to pull out of the contest in order to focus on a larger development in Hamburg. The UTDC responded to a [...] "buy American" [...] clause in the UMTA by opening a branch office in Detroit, and that immediately swung the decision in their favour. However, with the Ronald Reagan administration taking office in 1981, UMTA was rapidly de-funded. Four of the five cities ended their development plans, but Detroit and Miami (using a different design) decided to press ahead with their deployments.|$|E
5000|$|When the BMFT {{learned of}} the {{separate}} efforts at Demag and MBB, they urged both companies to combine their efforts under a new joint operating company, which became <b>Cabinentaxi.</b> BMFT provided 80% of the total funding, considerably less {{than their counterparts in}} the U.S., which completely funded by the UMTA. By this time the system had been well-defined, and was committed to true PRT point-to-point service. In order to avoid stops along the way, stations were [...] "off-line", on separate guideways placed beside the main routes, allowing en-route cars to pass them by. The cars themselves would handle switching along a pre-defined route, which allowed them to be directed to an optimal path in a network of any complexity. Studies suggested a three-passenger car for the basic system, although in order to increase capacity they also had cars with seating for 6, 12 and 18 passengers. These larger cars would normally be planned to operate in GRT fashion in order to increase the overall capacity of the network in the early development stages, where small networks in dense areas would not be meaningful in a small vehicle PRT mode. The larger cars could also be connected front-to-back to form two-car trains, further increasing capacity for some simple applications.|$|E
