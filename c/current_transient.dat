This ion movement was essentially {{confined to the}} membrane in terior during the <b>current</b> <b>transients.</b> Charge movement through {{the interior of the}} membrane during the <b>current</b> <b>transients</b> was studied {{as a function of the}} applied potential. The transferred charge approached an upper limit with increasing potential, which is interpreted to be the amount of charge due to tetraphenylborate ions absorbed into the boundary regions of the bilayer. A further analysis of the charge transfer as a function of potential indicates that the movement of tetraphenylborate ions is only influenced by a certain farction of the applied potential. For bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers the effective potential is 77 +/- 4 % of the applied potential. The initial conductance and the time constant of the <b>current</b> <b>transients</b> were studied as a function of the applied potential using a Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion regime.

These specimens had different combinations of boron and nitrogen (60 ppm boron and 110 ppm nitrogen, 60 B + 110 N), (90 ppm boron and 100 ppm nitrogen, 90 B + 100 N) and (100 ppm boron and 47 ppm nitrogen, 100 B + 47 N) respectively, while base metal composition was same. Current signal analysis was carried out to know {{the total number of}} <b>current</b> <b>transients</b> as a function of current amplitude. The statistical parameter like σI was studied to indicate the extent of localized corrosion activity. It was observed that the total number of <b>current</b> <b>transients</b> was highest for the specimen with comparable concentrations of boron and nitrogen, 90 B + 100 N; also it showed highest number of high <b>current</b> <b>transients,</b> suggesting its tendency towards pitting corrosion. This is mainly due to the formation of boronitrides which reduces dissolved boron and nitrogen causing increased pitting corrosion activity. Low boron (60 ppm) and high nitrogen specimen showed lowest number of high <b>current</b> <b>transients,</b> indicating improved passivation. The plots of σI as a function of time as well as cumulative probability (CP) vs. σI showed inferior pitting corrosion resistance for the former while the latter showed the least corrosion activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An oxide trap {{characterization}} technique by measur-ing a subthreshold <b>current</b> <b>transient</b> is developed. This technique {{consists of}} two alternating phases, an oxide charge detrapping phase and a subthreshold current measurement phase. An ana-lytical model relating a subthreshold <b>current</b> <b>transient</b> to oxide charge tunnel detrapping is derived. By {{taking advantage of a}} large difference between interface trap and oxide trap time-constants, this transient technique allows the characterization of oxide traps separately in the presence of interface traps. Oxide traps created by three different stress methods, channel Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) stress, hot electron stress and hot hole stress, are characterized. By varying the gate bias in the detrap-ping phase and the drain bias in the measurement phase, the field dependence of oxide charge detrapping and the spatial distribu-tion of oxide traps in the channel direction can be obtained. Our results show that 1) the subthreshold <b>current</b> <b>transient</b> follows a power-law time-dependence at a small charge detrapping field, 2) while the hot hole stress generated oxide traps have a largest density, their spatial distribution in the channel is narrowest as compared to the other two stresses, and 3) the hot hole stress created oxide charges exhibit a shortest effective detrapping time-constant.
