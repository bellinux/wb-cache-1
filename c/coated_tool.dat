5000|$|Coatings: The right tool {{coatings}} {{can have}} a great influence on the cutting process by increasing cutting speed and tool life, and improving the surface finish. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is an exceptionally hard coating used on cutters which must withstand high abrasive wear. A PCD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> may last up to 100 times longer than an uncoated tool. However the coating cannot be used at temperatures above 600 degrees C, or on ferrous metals. Tools for machining aluminium are sometimes given a coating of TiAlN. Aluminium is a relatively sticky metal, and can weld itself to the teeth of tools, causing them to appear blunt. However it tends not to stick to TiAlN, allowing the tool {{to be used for}} much longer in aluminium.|$|E

40|$|With vast {{application}} of nickel-based super alloys in strategic fields, {{it has become}} increasingly necessary to evaluate the performance of advanced cutting tools for machining such alloys. In order to have elementary knowledge on machinability characteris tics of Incoloy 825 which was so far unknown, in the initial stage of experiment, tool wear and its mechanism, chip characteristics and surface integrity during dry machining were first studied using uncoated and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) multilayer TiN/TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /ZrCN <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> with different cutting speeds. The <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> could not improve surface finish, but outperformed its uncoated counterpart in terms of other aspects. In the second stage of the study, the primary objective was to recommend suitable cutting tool for machining Incoloy 825. Detailed study was undertaken using commercially available uncoated, CVD and physical vapour deposition (PVD) coated carbide tools, the performance of which was comparatively evaluated in terms of surface roughness, cutting temperature, cutting force, coefficient of friction, tool wear and its mechanism during dry machining. Effect of cutting speed (VC) and feed (f) was also studied. Although, CVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> was not useful in decreasing surface roughness and temperature compared to uncoated one, significant decrease in cutting force and tool wear could be achieved with the same <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> even under high cutting parameters (Vc= 124 m/min and f= 0. 2 mm/rev). On the other hand, PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> consisting of alternate layers of TiAlN/TiN outperformed the other tools in terms of all machinability characteristics that have been studied. This might be attributed to excellent anti-friction and anti-sticking property of TiN and good toughness which is a salient feature of PVD technique as well as multilayer configuration, in combination with thermally resistant TiAlN phase. In the final stage of the research work, the feasibility of best performing PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> was evaluated under environment-friendly dry machining condition in comparison with uncoated tool under conventional flood cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). Although temperature obtained with PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> under dry machining has always been significantly more than wet environment, the same <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> remarkably brought down cutting force, surface roughness and tool wear under dry environment. The results achieved under both rough and finish modes of machining clearly established the use of PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> under dry environment as a sustainable strategy for achieving green machining of nickel-based super alloys...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The heat {{generation}} during metal cutting processes affects {{accuracy of the}} machined surface and strongly influences cutting forces and tool wear. Material property of <b>coated</b> <b>tools</b> {{is one of the}} most important factors effecting heat conduction and temperature on the rake face of <b>coated</b> <b>tools.</b> To find the action of thermal properties of <b>coated</b> cutting <b>tools</b> on cutting temperature, the temperature distributions were obtained with temperature-dependent properties and temperature-independent properties of <b>coated</b> <b>tools</b> using numerical method.

Although <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> has good potential to overcome some of these challenges, selection of <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> with appropriate deposition technique is of immense significance. The current study attempts to comparatively evaluate various performance measures during machining of Nimonic C- 263 such as surface roughness, chip characteristics, cutting temperature and tool wear with particular emphasis on different modes of tool failure for commercially available multi component coated inserts deposited using chemical vapour deposition (CVD), physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques. Furthermore, performance of uncoated tool was analyzed with respect to PVD and CVD coated tools. Results were also discussed for different cutting speeds (51, 84, 124 m/min) and feed rates (0. 1, 0. 14, 0. 2 mm/rev), and constant depth of cut (1 mm) along with the progression of machining durations (t). Severe plastic deformation and chipping of cutting edge and nose, abrasive nose and flank wear along with formation of built-up-layer (BUL) were identified as possible mechanism behind tool failure. The best machining performance was noted under a low and medium cutting speed of 51 m/min and 84 m/min respectively with PVD multilayer <b>coated</b> <b>tool.</b> In addition, influence of coolant that is under food and MQL environment was studied in comparison with dry machining using best performing PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool.</b> It was {{interesting to note that the}} performance of PVD <b>coated</b> <b>tool</b> was comparable and sometimes even superior that of uncoated tool given under flood and MQL environment.
