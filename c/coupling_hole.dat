40|$|We {{characterize}} a Fabry-Perot {{microwave cavity}} designed for trapping atoms and molecules at the antinode of a microwave field. The cavity {{is fed from}} a waveguide through a small <b>coupling</b> <b>hole.</b> Focussing on the compact resonant modes of the cavity, we measure how the electric field profile, the cavity quality factor, and the coupling efficiency, depend on the radius of the <b>coupling</b> <b>hole.</b> We measure how the quality factor depends on {{the temperature of the}} mirrors in the range from 77 to 293 K. The presence of the <b>coupling</b> <b>hole</b> slightly changes the profile of the mode, leading to increased diffraction losses {{around the edges of the}} mirrors and a small reduction in quality factor. We find the hole size that maximizes the intra-cavity electric field. We develop an analytical theory of the aperture-coupled cavity that agrees well with our measurements, with small deviations due to enhanced diffraction losses. We find excellent agreement between our measurements and finite-difference time-domain simulations of the cavity. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

The filter developed with ten sets of three quarters-wavelength coupled by TE_ 111 mode of tunable resonant cavity has rejection of 50 dB and 3 dB bandwidth of 500 MHz. The modified model of Tschebysheff type for the prediction of rejection is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—A {{problem of}} {{electromagnetic}} fields excitation {{by a system}} of finite-dimensional material bodies in two arbitrary electrodynamic volumes coupled by holes, cut in a common boundary of the volumes, is defined in a rigorous formulation. For the system containing two material bodies and one <b>coupling</b> <b>hole,</b> the problem is reduced {{to a system of}} two-dimensional integral equations relative to surface electric currents on the material bodies and equivalent magnetic current in the <b>coupling</b> <b>hole.</b> The resulting integral equations are correctly transformed to a system of one-dimensional equations for currents in a narrow slot and on thin impedance vibrators, which may have irregular electrophysical and geometrical parameters.

A BNL Gun IV type photocathode RF gun has been fabricated and tested at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The gun test stand for the photoinjector consists of the BNL 1. 6 cell photocathode RF gun, a single emittance compensation magnet, and the beam diagnostics. The beam energy has maximum at the laser injection phase around 50 °. The relative energy spreads at the laser injection phase around 50 ° is about 0. 5 % rms. Best normalized transverse rms emittance attained 1. 5 mm mrad at the 0. 1 nC beam charge. A <b>coupling</b> <b>hole</b> between the waveguide and the cavity of a photo-cathode RF gun causes asymmetries in the RF fields at the coupler cell. The dipole and quadruple fields are the dominant sources of the transverse RF emittance growth.

The mode profiles {{inside and outside the}} cavity, the diffraction losses at the mirror edges and intracavity apertures, the amount of useful power <b>coupled</b> through the <b>holes,</b> and the FEL gain are calculated for several dominant azimuthal and radial modes. The FEL interaction is taken into account by constructing a propagator similar to the Fresnel integral for free space propagation. It is found that non-confocal resonators can provide efficient <b>hole</b> <b>coupling</b> over a broad wavelength range, as long as the mode beating caused by a degeneracy in the round trip loss can be avoided. The degeneracy between the azimuthally symmetric class of modes is removed by FEL interaction, and the azimuthally asymmetric modes can be suppressed by means of intracavity apertures. Therefore, in a nonconfocal configuration, a hole-coupled resonator can be designed that is tunable over a broad range of wavelength by employing an adjustable intracavity aperture. On the other hand, confocal resonators are not suitable for hole coupling; Although mode beating does not occur in a confocal resonator, the <b>hole</b> <b>coupling</b> is difficult because the modes tend to avoid the hole.
