5000|$|Hopkin {{describes}} a single whirled corrugaphone {{as capable of}} producing three or four different pitches. Crawford describes harmonics two through seven as reachable while whirling, though seven takes, [...] "great effort." [...] Hopkin describes that with a corrugahorn, [...] "with tubes of suitable length and diameters, the range extends well up the harmonic series, where the available tones are close together and you can, with practice, play quite melodically." [...] In fact, since each harmonic plays throughout a range of speeds (rather than at one specific speed), {{it is difficult to}} skip over harmonics, as this requires a jump in speed (rather than gradual change), though this is easily done using one's tongue and throat to interrupt the air flow with a corrugahorn. Many sales offers describe the tubes as producing up to five distinct notes (presumably the bugle scale: harmonics 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 [...] ), and while higher harmonics may be possible, if hard work, dissonant adjacent harmonics may sound simultaneously, such as 15 and 16. The fundamental and harmonics of a <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> are lower than those of an uncorrugated tube of the same length and diameter, and, [...] "audible vibration in the whirly tube appears only when air flow velocity exceeds a certain minimum, which may preclude the sounding of the fundamental or lower harmonics." [...] The timbre of the notes produced by the whirly tube are, [...] "almost all fundamental," [...] according to Fourier analysis (similar to sine waves). Tubes longer than many feet may have one end whirled while held near its middle or may be held out a car window.|$|E

The six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> is a novel heat transfer tube, and its flow resistance characteristics have not been studied. In this paper, the flow resistance characteristics of the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> are studied. Specifically, the effect of influencing factors such as geometric parameters (pitch and corrugation depth), fluid properties and Reynolds number on flow resistance of the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> are studied. The results show that, firstly, the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> has a better heat transfer performance than both the circular tube and four-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube,</b> and its flow resistance is situated between circular tube and four-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube.</b> Secondly, with the increasing of the pitch p of the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube,</b> both the pressure drop ΔP and resistance coefficient f are decreasing gradually. Thirdly, the increase of corrugation depth e {{can lead to a}} large flow resistance, so it is not recommended to adopt an excessive increase in the corrugation depth e. The effect of fluid properties on flow resistance in tube is not obvious, and the changing rate of ratio fe/fs of all working media are almost the same. Moreover, with the increasing of Reynolds number Re, resistance coefficient f both in the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> and circular tube are decreasing gradually. Finally, based on the above research data, the criterion correlation for flow resistance calculation in the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> is obtained. It can be concluded that the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> studied in this paper has a smaller flow resistance than the commonly used four-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube.</b> This work can provide some advices for the future research of reducing flow resistance in spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> or other related devices...|$|E

Here, a novel spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> with six-start is proposed. However, up to now, there is little literature about the heat transfer performance and flow field of this novel six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube.</b> In this paper, the effects of geometric parameters (pitch p, corrugation depth e), Reynolds number Re and fluid properties on the heat transfer performances are investigated based on the validated numerical model. The results show that with the increasing of pitch p, both the heat transfer coefficient h and Nusselt number Nu decrease gradually. Meanwhile, with the increasing of corrugation depth e, both the secondary flow velocity vxy and the vorticity of longitudinal vortex increase gradually. Moreover, under the same working condition, the heat transfer performances of the six-start spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> are affected by both the working medium and Reynolds number.

Diesel generators waste about 1 / 3 of their fuel {{energy in the form}} of heat through exhaust gas. The primary goal of this work is to capture part of the heat from the exhaust and improve the efficiency of the system. A gas to liquid heat transfer performance of a concentric tube heat exchanger with corrugated tubes and twisted tape inserts is investigated by considering its effects on engine performance and economics. This type of heat exchanger is expected to be inexpensive to install and effective in heat transfer, with minimal effect on exhaust emissions of diesel engines. Most previous research has investigated liquid to liquid heat transfer in corrugated tubes at low Reynolds, not gas to liquid heat transfer. The SolidWorks Flow Simulation computer program was used to perform these studies. The program is first validated by comparing simulation results with renowned correlations and field measurements. Simulations are then conducted for a concentric tube heat exchanger with corrugated tubes and twisted tapes of different configurations to determine the optimal design. The maximum enhancement in the rate of heat transfer was found in an annularly <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger with twisted tape inserts. This exchanger transfers about 235. 3 % and 67. 26 % more heat compared to plain tube and annularly <b>corrugated</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchangers without twisted tapes, respectively.
