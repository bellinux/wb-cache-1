500|$|The episode {{received}} primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly {{going to}} Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that [...] "bviously {{the most notable}} aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup. Again, it seemed really sudden, but {{in the sense that}} they are both mercurial teenagers it seemed right, particularly when they didn't know how to handle themselves afterward." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] " [...] kisses Logan! You heard me! How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>not,</b> with all the exclamation points!" ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{divergent}} {{views were}} expressed about Puck and Beiste's performance of [...] "Mean". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post asked, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> {{be moved by}} their duet in the auditorium?" [...] E! Online's Jenna Mullins called it [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} the season", and Slezak gave it a grade of [...] "A". Chaney's [...] "B+" [...] followed her statement that [...] "it was more effective than Swift's version because I can believe that both Puck and Beiste have had it rough", and Strecker described it as [...] "lovely and thematically perfect" [...] and gave it a [...] "B". VanDerWerff said he [...] "could have done without" [...] their duet, and Futterman was even harsher: [...] "it was quite unfortunate". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson wrote that he [...] "sort of liked" [...] how the pair were [...] "simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song", and Saskin characterized it as [...] "heartfelt and passionate".|$|E
500|$|Romano {{described}} Kim as a [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart" [...] character, {{and attempted}} to make her {{as much of a}} role model as possible. The actress also described the character as [...] "a really confident, sweet girl who everybody loves. And she is a heroine who little girls look up to. ... She is a typical role model, perfect in every way. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> like Kim?" [...] Romano initially doubted that the show would be successful, but eventually admitted that [...] "the animation was great and the writing was amazing. It's done so that kids and adults can enjoy it; families can share an amazing experience together." [...] Additionally, Romano's character greatly influenced her own career, and considers Kim to be a positive role model for young girls. Romano identified the season one episode [...] "Mind Games" [...] in which Kim and Ron switch bodies as her favorite. By the end of the series, Romano was 21 years old and attending Columbia University for political science. Kim's final line in the series is [...] "uuhhh...huh?", which Romano recorded tearfully due to the series ending. Writing for 7M Pictures, Kevin Carr considered the fact that Kim is only a voice-acted role beneficial to the series because [...] "they could always get someone else to mimic her original voice" [...] should Romano depart, unlike Lizzie McGuires Hilary Duff.|$|E

500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big one for me is Deep Purple. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm {{not going to get into}} the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E
