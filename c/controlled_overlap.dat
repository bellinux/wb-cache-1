Although the methods are in wide use, their properties, when a population is changing due to births and deaths, have not been studied extensively.

We study particular PRN and CRN schemes that produce ®xed size samples, involve complete, rather than partial, rotation of units within strata, and are effective at meeting the goal of coordinating two or more surveys by minimizing the overlap among them.

A group of Norwegian-English bilingual children and an age-matched group of Norwegian monolingual children were tested in a priming task that included both a within-language and a between-language priming condition.

Determination {{of the size of the}} deletion mutant is accomplished by hybridization to a complementary single-stranded probe derived from M 13 containing that total insert followed by nuclease S 1 treatment. Single-stranded M 13 -insert DNAs of progressively smaller sizes are isolated and analyzed by using a site-specific M 13 DNA primer and the dideoxy chain-termination method.

The fhy 3 and far 1 mutants display similar yet distinctive defects in phyA signaling; however, overexpression of either FHY 3 or FAR 1 suppresses the mutant phenotype of both genes. Moreover, overexpression of partial fragments of FHY 3 can cause a dominant-negative interference phenotype on phyA signaling that is stronger {{than those of the}} fhy 3 or far 1 null mutants.

40|$|SummaryDuring cell division, microtubules are {{arranged}} in a large bipolar structure, the mitotic spindle, to segregate the duplicated chromosomes.

The molecular mechanism of midzone formation and the control of its size are not understood.

The processive motor Xklp 1 <b>controls</b> <b>overlap</b> size by overlap length-dependent microtubule growth inhibition.

Previous studies have identified multiple phyA signaling mutants, including {{both positive and negative}} regulators of the phyA-mediated responses.

Clustering analysis of the genome expression profiles supports the notion that phyA signaling may entail a network with multiple paths, <b>controlling</b> <b>overlapping</b> yet distinct sets of gene expression. FHY 1, FAR 1 and FHY 3 most likely act upstream in the phyA signaling network, close to the phyA photoreceptor itself.

Further, this study also provides genomics evidence for the partial functional redundancy between FAR 1 and FHY 3.

Many {{of the channel}} routers of the past {{are for the most}} part based on greedy algorithms in which special heuristics are applied to generate monotonic improvement.
