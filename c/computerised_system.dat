40|$|Canterbury dairy farmers' {{opinions}} about <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> used for managing farm information were collected through 39 stratified, randomly selected interviews. Farmers {{who are using}} software note they can save time, the software supports their farm management work, and it also enables them to use management approaches requiring more detailed information. Farmers who are not using <b>computerised</b> <b>systems,</b> but are considering this possibility, explain they are facing other priorities relative to improving their information systems. They {{are aware of the}} computer and software advantages, and they have a positive feeling towards computing technology. Some of them, however, feel insecure about their ability to use computers. Farmers not considering <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> believe computer technology is useless for their particular situations. Some farmers think <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> are unable to solve their actual farm problems, others feel themselves too old to learn the new technology. The interviews have confirmed ""earlier"" findings from a former mail survey. Key factors associated with the adoption of computer technology are farmer age, directly and through its relationship with farmer education; farmer education itself; the size of the herd; and consultant use intensity and involvement in farm management decision making...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{relationship}} between <b>computerised</b> internal control <b>systems</b> and its relationship to fraud in small businesses. In recent years with the advancement of information technology, the cost of acquiring and implementing a <b>computerised</b> information <b>system</b> is such that many small businesses are able to implement such systems. An implication of this is that internal controls related to the <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> will have to be implemented as well. Hence, in this paper {{we look at the}} relationship between computerised internal controls and detected fraud. Results indicate that the incidence of fraud in a computerised internal control environment is higher than in a non computerised environment...|$|R

40|$|For {{providing}} {{systems to}} support decision making {{it is important}} to understand how farmers collect and manage decision information. Using data from a mail survey a ""three-information-area"" and ""four-system-type"" model was tested to describe Canterbury dairy farmer's information management structure. Those using <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> in every area were the largest group, but representing only 12 % of farmers. Farmers using <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> in different information areas show similar characteristics in contrast to non-users, such as having farmed less years, being younger, having larger herds and bigger farms, being more educated, spending more time doing office work, involving more both farm adviser and accountant time, and being more profit oriented. Those who own computers, but do not use <b>computerised</b> information <b>systems,</b> are not statistically different from those not owning computers. The use of computers for managing feed and pasture information seems to be more restricted than for finance and livestock. The relationships among farm management computer use and the farmer's characteristics were checked using single statistical tests, regression and cluster analyses. The research findings are relevant for those aiming to improve farmer information management and also for farm software developers...|$|R

The tendency, in this regard, is towards the proliferation of <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> of information exchange and processing, with little regard to the question of proportionality...|$|R
