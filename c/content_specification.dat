This specification served as a reference for examiners to compile test questions, {{rather than as a}} study guide for candidates. It consisted of kanji lists, expression lists, vocabulary lists, and grammar lists for all four JLPT levels. However, about 20% of the kanji, vocabulary, and grammar in any one exam may have been drawn from outside the prescribed lists at the discretion of exam compilers.Numbers in parentheses indicate the exact number in the Test <b>Content</b> <b>Specification.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{existing}} computerized adaptive testing (CAT) programs, {{each successive}} {{item in the}} test is chosen to optimize an objective function. Examples of well-known objectives in CAT are maximizing {{the information in the}} test at the ability estimate for the examinee and minimizing the deviation of the information in the test from a target value at this estimate. In addition, item selection is required to realize a set of <b>content</b> <b>specifications</b> for the test. For example, item content may be required to follow a certain taxonomy, or, if the items have a multiple-choice format, their answer key distribution should deviate not too much from uniformity. <b>Content</b> <b>specifications</b> are generally defined in terms of combinations of attributes the items in the test should have. They are typically realized by imposing a set of constraints on the item-selection process. The presence of an objective function and constraints in CAT leads to the notion of CAT as constrained (sequential) optimization.

40|$|Learning objects – {{self-contained}} electronic {{learning software}} – can improve student success by supplementing traditional classroom instruction, enabling students to experience learning content {{at their own}} pace, and easing the workload on their instructors. However, creating interactive, graded, visually appealing learning objects is time-consuming and often requires extensive programming. The iLOG Flash Editor (IFE) is a tool designed to increase the accessibility of learning objects to educators {{by allowing them to}} create graded, interactive learning objects without programming. By exploiting the Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) standard for reusable assessment question specification, the IFE system separates the content of graded assessments from its presentation, allowing the same content easily to be reused in different visual forms. Although many software tools allow users to create graded learning activities, the iLOG Flash Editor is unique in integrating the reusability of a widely-recognized <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> standard with the flexibility to realize the <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> in different visual formats.

40|$|Business process {{modeling}} {{is an essential}} prerequisite to business process reengineering (BPR), and workflow management (WFM). Process models have been traditionally used to model software processes, and many business process models are adaptations of these process models. Using these process models to represent business processes results in two problems. First, since these process models usually represent different perspectives of systems (or in this case, businesses) the user needs to integrate multiple existing models to completely represent the business processes. This reduces the ease of use, and leads to a lower acceptance by users. Second, business processes contain concepts not found in software processes (e. g., physical objects, roles, etc.). Traditional process models cannot represent these new concepts, and hence traditional process models model business processes inadequately. These two problems can be easily solved if a comprehensive business process model exists, that models all perspectives of a business process, and that allows representation of these new concepts. As a first step towards this goal, we propose a <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> that {{would need to be}} satisfied by such a business process model. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> for a business process model that will solve the two problems listed above. This <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> also serves as a framework to analyze process models in detail, and to compare them based on their content (i. e., what concepts they model) {{and the degree to which}} they model each aspect of a business process (i. e., how much of a business process they model) ...|$|E
40|$|Awareness of {{the need}} for more {{effective}} instructionfor heterogeneous groups of students has resulted {{in the development of the}} "mastery learning " model through which students are provided with the additional time necessary to achieve mastery of the content to be learned. The mastery learning model does not, however, provide a conceptual framework through which teachers can make decisions about the alternative instructional methodologies to offer each student. A second type of learning theory is known as "learning styles. " A variety of models have been developed, all of which arebased on theories of cognitive style. The combination of a learning styles model and the mastery learning concept holds great promise for improved programs that can provide for the learning styles of the learners. A need exists, however, for <b>content</b> <b>specification.</b> In vocational education, the competency-based vocational education(CBVE) model provides the <b>content</b> <b>specification</b> required for theimplementation of an effective, success-oriented program.
