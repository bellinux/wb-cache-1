5|$|Andretti {{competed in}} {{fourteen}} NASCAR Grand National/Winston Cup (now Sprint Cup) events in his career. He competed in Holman Moody <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> his final ten events. Holman Moody {{was one of}} NASCAR's most successful teams at that time, as the team won NASCAR championships in 1968 and 1969 with driver David Pearson. Andretti won the 1967 Daytona 500 for Holman Moody.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{cars were}} {{designed}} and built by Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), which was jointly owned by Tauranac and Jack Brabham and built <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> customers in several racing series. The Formula One racing team, BRO, was a separate company wholly owned by Jack Brabham. It bought its cars from MRD but Tauranac had little connection with the race team between 1962 and 1965.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, the B had {{combined}} through <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> the Capitol Limited, the Columbian (#25), and the Ambassador (#19) into one train between New York and Washington. Beyond Washington, the three trains then operated separately, with several additional Washington-to-Chicago Pullman sleeping cars {{added to the}} Capitol Limited, along with a twin-unit dining car, two Strata-Dome dome cars, club car, and a flat-end observation car.|$|E
50|$|Trulli did {{not start}} the Beijing ePrix because of a failure to submit their <b>car</b> <b>for</b> scrutineering. The team claimed that key {{components}} had been held up in customs. They {{will be able to}} resubmit their <b>car</b> <b>for</b> scrutineering for the second race.|$|R

50|$|The Class 331000 trains sport a white-colored, {{fire-retardant}} interior. LCD monitor displays {{are installed}} {{on the side of}} each <b>car</b> <b>for</b> trains 331-01~331-13, and on the top of each <b>car</b> <b>for</b> trains 331-14~331-27. The end cars have a space for wheelchairs.|$|R
5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{originally}} operated {{with three}} trains designed by Premier Rides. Each one consisted of six <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> a total capacity of thirty-six. The trains were shortened to five cars before the 2006 season. After the ride's first major incident, the trains were replaced altogether with lighter models before the ride reopened the following season. The loop was also removed during this time.|$|E
5000|$|In July, Joe Gibbs Racing {{announced}} Matt Kenseth {{would not}} be returning to the team and that Erik Jones, running the #77 <b>car</b> <b>for</b> Furniture Row Racing as previously mentioned, would be taking over in the #20 <b>car</b> <b>for</b> JGR beginning with the 2018 season.|$|R

5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the route}} east of New Haven is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives. Once the full order of M8 railcars are in service, and Amtrak tests and approves the M8s for usage east of New Haven, ConnDOT {{plans to use}} 24 to 32 <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> electric SLE service to reduce diesel emissions. The diesel trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield.|$|E
50|$|Three {{cars were}} entered in Corsica, a Q8 liveried <b>car</b> <b>for</b> Gianfranco Cunico, a yellow Sound 2000 {{sponsored}} <b>car</b> <b>for</b> Mark Lovell {{and a third}} <b>car</b> <b>for</b> French driver Pierre-César Baroni. Lovell would retire after suffering from a misfire, Baroni would retire after an accident, and Cunico {{would go on to}} finish 7th overall. The Italian driver would suffer the mis-fortune of retiring after an accident on his second Ford outing in Great Britain. Ford would finish 13th in the Manufacturers standings after scoring just six points for the season.|$|R

5|$|Amtrak {{rebuilt the}} cafes into {{numerous}} configurations during the 1980s and 1990s. These included all-table dinettes, club <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> use in Metroliner service, and club-dinettes {{with a mix}} of tables and club seats. By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club-dinettes; some had been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were rebuilt for use on the Inter-American, a long-distance train operating between Texas and St. Louis, Missouri; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were rebuilt with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches.|$|E
5|$|Another gift {{in demand}} was the streamlined, oval-shaped Princess {{telephone}} {{introduced in the}} early 1960s. The phone came {{in a variety of}} colors, including pink, turquoise, and cream. When one of Mattel's Barbie doll outfits included a Princess phone as an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many Baby Boomers had reached driver's license age and, for the first time, middle-class families splurged on <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a tumultuous}} {{pre-season}} {{in which they}} went {{through a period of}} administration and were saved by late investment, Manor Marussia arrived in Melbourne with a car that had passed its mandatory crash tests, but had completed no testing. Formula Renault 3.5 Series drivers Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi were announced as their drivers, with Merhi signed on a one-race deal. However, the team did not participate in any practice sessions and subsequently failed to set a qualifying time, leaving the field at eighteen <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> the race.|$|E

50|$|A Dodge Stealth was {{initially}} {{to be used}} as a pace <b>car</b> <b>for</b> the 1991 Indianapolis 500 race. The United Auto Workers (UAW), however, rejected the Japanese-manufactured car, as they deferred the concept of a Mitsubishi being a pace <b>car</b> <b>for</b> the race, and a prototype Dodge Viper was substituted.|$|R
5|$|In early 1972, Amtrak {{considered}} {{converting the}} Metroliners to locomotive-hauled operation; however, with the cars {{the only new}} rolling stock in Amtrak's possession, {{it was decided to}} continue efforts to increase their operating reliability instead. In February, one GE-powered car was shipped to Erie, Pennsylvania for the DOT-funded rebuild program, with hopes to modify all cars by 1976. It was followed by a Westinghouse-powered car in March. In late April, Amtrak accepted six of the leased <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> revenue service, which permitted an increase to 14 round trips on May 1. An additional pair of cars were sent for rebuild later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|Several teams {{made major}} {{technical}} updates to their <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> the Grand Prix. McLaren and Ferrari altered the brake ducts on their cars, improving the cooling {{to manage the}} high brake temperatures encountered in Montreal. Ferrari and Mercedes revised their rear suspension layouts, while Red Bull brought a new front wing optimised for a lower downforce level. Renault and Williams brought new rear wings, which were designed specifically for low-downforce circuits such as Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.|$|E
50|$|In the ARCA Racing Series Daytona opener, Turner Scott fielded the 4 <b>car</b> <b>for</b> Kyle Larson in {{preparation}} for his full-time Nationwide Series schedule, with sponsorship from Chip Ganassi Racing partner Cessna.

5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E
5|$|The first flexifuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Spain by late 2007, with the acquisition of 80 <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> use in the Spaniard official government fleet. At that time the country had only three gas stations selling E85, making necessary to deploy an official E85 fueling station in Madrid to attend these vehicles. Despite the introduction in the Spaniard market of several flexifuel models, {{by the end of}} 2008 still persists the problems of adequate E85 fueling infrastructure, as only 10 gas stations were selling E85 fuel to the public in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|Troop cars saw service through 1947, {{after which}} many were {{sold by the}} U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and {{subsequently}} converted into mail cars, express service boxcars, or refrigerator cars, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use in maintenance of way (MOW) service as bunk <b>cars</b> <b>for</b> the maintenance workers. Subsequent conflicts have not created {{the need for such}} an arrangement, partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long-distance transportation of troops.|$|E
