In {{the construction of}} this aircraft this doubler sheet was not used {{in addition to other}} details of the bonding of the parts. In the case of production line 292 and after, this doubler sheet gave an additional thickness of 0.91 mm at the lap joint. In airplane line number 291 and before, <b>cold</b> <b>bonding</b> had been utilized, with fasteners used to maintain surface contact in the joint, allowing bonding adhesive to transfer load within the joint. This cold bonded joint used an epoxy-impregnated woven scrim cloth to join the edges of 0.9 mm thick skin panels. These epoxy cloths were reactive at room temperature, so they were stored at dry ice temperatures until used in manufacture. The bond cured at room temperature after assembly. The <b>cold</b> <b>bonding</b> process reduced the overall weight and manufacturing cost. Fuselage hoop loads (circumferential loads within the skins due to pressurization of the cabin) were intended to be transferred through the bonded joint, rather than through the rivets, allowing the use of lighter, thinner fuselage skin panels with no degradation in fatigue life.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental and finite element studies of cold pressure welding of commercial purity aluminium by divergent extrusion. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I gives a general introduction to welding of aluminium alloys focusing on the heat affected zone (HAZ) strength loss following traditional fusion welding, the mechanisms of solid state bonding and {{the most commonly used}} solid state joining techniques for such materials. In Part II the divergent extrusion method, originally designed for simulation of cold pressure welding, has been further developed and explored. As a starting point the combination of advanced process instrumentation and finite element (FE) modelling is used to unravel the underlying material flow and deformation pattern during cold extrusion of commercial purity aluminium. It is shown that the plastic work within the shear deformation zone of the workpiece constitutes about 60 % of the total forming load, the remaining being the result of friction, upsetting and plane strain compression. Because of this shear deformation the divergent extrusion process bears a close resemblance to equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). In Part III the aptness of the divergent extrusion process in simulating cold pressure welding (CPW) is further documented and explored. As a starting point, the situation existing both prior to and after <b>cold</b> <b>bonding</b> is adequately reproduced using finite element (FE) modelling. Combined extrusion and joining experiments are then carried out to unravel the conditions under which <b>cold</b> <b>bonding</b> takes place in commercial purity aluminium. Based on three-point bend testing and fracture surface investigations in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), it is observed that bond initiation occurs gradually {{during the course of the}} extrusion process. Full metallic bonding is achieved when the surface exposure, as determined by the x-component of the strain acting in the extrusion direction, reaches a value of 0. 97. This surface exposure is comparable to that reported for bond formation using conventional CPW and cold roll bonding (CRB) in the presence of oxide and lubricant films at the mating interfaces under similar contact pressure conditions. Finally, Part IV is concerned with cold pressure welding (CPW) of severely plastically deformed (SPD) aluminium. As a starting point, commercially purity aluminium is subjected to single pass equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and subsequently joined by divergent extrusion (DIE). The mechanical integrity of the spliced components is then documented using notch tensile testing, showing that both the strength and the flow properties of the SPD processed base material are fully maintained across the joint after cold welding. This is because the DIE process implies a mixed deformation mode, i. e. homogenous shear deformation in the bulk and plain strain compression at the joint line where bonding occurs. Moreover, finite element (FE) modelling reveals that the combination of contact pressure to yield strength ratio and surface exposure needed to achieve full metallic bonding is comparable with that reported for bond formation in soft annealed aluminium. This means that SPD processing by ECAP does not alter the conditions under which bonding takes place during CPW, which makes the DIE method particularly useful for joining such materials.

40|$|Honeycomb {{sandwich}} structures (commonly {{referred to as}} honeycomb sandwich panels) have found wide spread application in the aerospace industry thanks to their excellent properties, in particular their high strength-to-weight and high stiffness-to-weight ratios. Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), like many other space companies, often use honeycomb sandwich panels {{as part of the}} primary and secondary structures of the small satellites they develop. Although honeycomb panels have been used for the past 50 years gaining a better understanding of these {{sandwich structures}}, and the methods and solutions used to produce structural assemblies from them is still a major concern in the aerospace industry. Whether directly or indirectly, there are still significant research efforts ongoing that affect these areas. This work focuses on some of these issues and covers several research fields including material science, tribology and adhesive bonding technology. The first area of focus of this work deals with the structural performance of honeycomb panels alone and mainly concentrates on hexagonal honeycomb cores. An experimental investigation using the rail shear test was conducted to study the shear behaviour of hexagonal honeycomb cores. This involved both static and fatigue tests using numerous honeycomb panel test samples with the loading direction at various angles to the core ribbon. From these tests it was found that core shear strength did not have a linear relationship with loading orientation and that contrary to what is commonly assumed the transverse direction (to the ribbon) is not always necessarily the weakest orientation. The optimal design and performance of the load introduction points was the second area of focus for this work which covers equipment inserts and bolted joints. Two types of inserts where investigated in this work: hot <b>bonded</b> inserts and <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> inserts. A study on hot <b>bonded</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> inserts was conducted to assess their performance and effectively compare the two insert systems. A large portion of the study was experimental and involved carrying out numerous insert pull-out tests to measure static pull strength capability. From the study it was found that contrary to what was expected <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> potted inserts outperformed the hot bonded inserts in terms of static strength capability. Using finite element it was found that this was due to the different filler materials used for the two insert systems. The last area covered in this work concerns friction grip bolted joint between honeycomb panels. Here a simple method to analyze the efficiency of shear joint units is proposed. An extensive test campaign was also carried out to determine the influence of various parameters on the friction coefficient. Surface abrasion was found to be a reliable way of achieving high values of friction coefficient. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

As the deformation proceeds, yielding also starts in the hard metal layer and the entire strip becomes plastic. This is a typical deformation pattern adopted in describing the process of joining by rolling. However, at a certain range of input parameters plastic deformation of the entire strip begins at the initial instant. Moreover, it is possible that only the hard metal layer yields while the soft metal layer does not. This deformation pattern takes place when the thickness of the soft metal layer is much smaller than that of the hard metal layer...|$|R
40|$|The work {{carried out}} in this thesis was {{conducted}} to investigate thermomechanical aspects of a steel-aluminum <b>cold</b> roll <b>bonded</b> material. The objective was to study different production parameters related to ageing of an AA 6082 aluminum alloy, combined with IF steel, through a <b>cold</b> roll <b>bonding</b> process. Three different sequences of solutionizing, ageing, and <b>cold</b> roll <b>bonding</b> of the materials were tested. Sheets of steel and aluminum, measuring 30 x 120 mm, were used to produce the samples. Each sheet measured roughly 1 mm in thickness, and were stacked {{together to form a}} three layered composite, with aluminum in the middle and steel on either side. The sheets were prepared by scratch brushing, and were roll bonded at pre-heat temperatures of 150, 200, & 300 ^oC. Three different sequences were used for heat treating the aluminum; The BSA samples were roll bonded, followed by solutionizing and ageing to T 6. The SBA samples were solutionized, roll bonded, and then aged to T 6. The SAB samples were solutionized and aged to T 6, followed by roll bonding. The three sequences were meant to determine the optimal way of producing a precipitation hardened structure in the aluminum, while still achieving a good bond to the steel. The <b>cold</b> roll <b>bonded</b> samples were cut into sections and studied through several microstructural and mechanical characterization methods. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to study the aluminum grain structure, and the roll bonded interface. A peel testing rig was designed and built to allow for peel testing of the composites with at 90 degree peeling direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to study the resulting fracture surfaces, to determine the amount of residual material left on each surface. In summary, the SAB samples were found to produce the greatest bond strengths, followed by the SBA samples, and the BSA samples. The achieved bond strength values were overall fairly low compared to what others have achieved. The solutionizing step caused the aluminum in all samples to recrystallize, and the BSA samples, which were solutionized after roll bonding, developed an intermetallic layer roughly 1 μm thick. This layer was found to severely impact the bond strength of the composite. No intermetallic layers were found for the two other sample sequences. Roll bonding after solutionizing was not found to have any negative effects on the ageing potential. The bonding mechanism was found to be consistent with the film theory...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, the {{landfill}} tax in Sweden has increased over 70 % with comparable {{rates in the}} UK and elsewhere in EU. This development, among others, highlights the incentive for increased recycling efforts of fine particulate solid by-products in the {{iron and steel making}} industry in order to avoid depositing costs and to recover valuable metal fractions. As pre-treatment is necessary for recycling fine particulate material, <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> agglomeration {{is considered to be a}} well-suited alternative for recycling of steel industry by-product dust and sludge. The major objective of this work has been to provide insight to help further the development of <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> agglomeration technology in order to increase the recycling of iron and steelmaking by-products. Laboratory pelletizing tests were conducted based on a factorial design test plan to help identify those variables that most influence the cold strength and capacity of product <b>cold</b> <b>bonded</b> pellets (CBPs). The design variables were the individual components of the by-product pellet mix; i. e blast furnace (BF) flue dust, oily mill scale sludge, both fine and coarse basic oxygen furnace (BOF) dust and Portland cement as binder. A related statistical procedure was used to plan reduction experiments in inert gas over a temperature range of 20 - 1200 ¢XC. The results from cold strength and reduction tests have been evaluated using multivariate statistical analysis to model the experimental variables with chosen responses in order to help identify those variables that have most significance. For agglomerate dimensions used in this study, pellet blends with large fractions of particles in the size range of 10 - 40 ƒÝm promote good self-reduction while maintaining good cold strength. The fundamental reactions occurring during the heat treatment of CBPs have also been studied. BF flue dust, which contains fractions of coal and coke particles, has been included in the CBP blend as a source of solid reductant. Thermal analysis was performed on samples in inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 ¢XC/min in order to observe their high temperature properties, specifically, the mechanism(s) of self-reduction. The gases generated during thermal analysis were analyzed with a mass spectrometer. Furthermore, raw and heat treated pellet samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Results demonstrate that the decomposition of hydrates and carbonates in CBP samples contribute, as gaseous intermediates, to the prereduction of contained iron oxides. The gaseous intermediates are responsible for an initial gasification of carbon contained in BF flue dust leading to low temperature iron oxide reduction. The step-wise reduction of iron oxides in the pellets at the given conditions begins at roughly 500 ¢XC and is nearly completed at 1200 ¢XC. Detailed studies of the system Ca(OH) 2 -C-Fe 2 O 3 have also been conducted because of the inherent importance of this system in the self-reduction of by-product agglomerates. Experiments have confirmed that carbon gasification does occur during the dehydration of lime and kinetic results highly correlate to behavior in CBPs. Hematite reduction in the simplified chemical system is controlled by either carbon gasification or availability of direct contact with graphite depending on hematite grain size. These results have less correlation with CBP behavior. After dehydration of Ca(OH) 2, calcium ferrite formation begins at temperatures below 600 ¢XC. Furthermore, the varying composition of this system has been studied in order to optimize self-reduction and low temperature bonding characteristics. The metallurgical characteristics of CBPs have been tested in additional laboratory tests; i. e. isothermal reduction tests, BF simulation and softening and melting tests. These test results indicate that CBPs; can disintegrate during reduction at high temperature, are self-reducing to a high extent and, as a supplement to the normal ferrous burden, show good softening and melting properties. Large-scale trials with CBPs have been conducted in a commercial BOF and a pilot scale BF. Results from BOF testing show that charging of CBPs is feasible at levels up to 2. 2 wt% of the total charge. At these levels, CBP addition resulted in no adverse disturbances to steel and slag chemistry and to the process in general. Results from pilot scale BF tests show that operation was very stable during testing with 150 kg CBPs/tHM but that the burden descent rate and burden gas distribution were disturbed during periods with more CBP burden. The rate of reducing agents was significantly decreased and slag amount was increased when CBPs were charged. Godkänd; 2008; 20081121 (ysko...|$|R

The so called FracThermR structure (developed by Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems) aims at reducing the pressure drop and at a uniform flow distribution. To manufacture these new absorbers, a fast, nearly continuous production process was developed which consists of partial <b>cold</b> roll <b>bonding</b> and subsequent hydroforming, similar to symmetric hydroforming of sheet metal pairs. With the help of a small demonstrator the feasibility of the hydroforming process is shown and the process chain is validated...|$|R

By this method, the average temperature of the materials remained <b>cold</b> at <b>bonding.</b> This bonding method seems to able metal grains that adhere to the glass anchoring the metal.
