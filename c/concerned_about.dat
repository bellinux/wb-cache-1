40|$|A {{new measure}} of <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> dying was {{investigated}} in this psychometric study. The <b>Concerns</b> <b>About</b> Dying instrument (CAD) was administered to medical students, nursing students, hospice nurses, and life sciences graduate students (N = 207) on two occasions; on one occasion they also completed three related measures. Analyses included descriptive statistics, factor analysis, Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha, test-retest correlations, t tests, and correlations with other measures. Results suggest the CAD measures three distinct but related areas: general <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> death, spirituality, and patient-related <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> death. Reliability estimates were good, and correlations with related measures were strong. Between-group differences suggest scores are related to actual differences in level of <b>concern</b> and beliefs <b>about</b> death and dying. The CAD {{has the advantage of}} being very brief and of explicitly assessing <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> working with patients who are dying...|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that gait patterns in older people may be affected by <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling and physiological falls risk on gait performance using a paradigm in which <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling was experimentally induced. Methods. Forty-four community-living older adults (17 men, 27 women) with a mean age of 76. 8 (standard deviation = 5. 2) years walked at self-selected speeds on the floor and on a 60 -cm elevated walkway in normal and dim lighting conditions. Temporal and spatial gait parameters, muscle activity, measures of physiological arousal, physiological falls risk, and <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falls were assessed. Results. Physiological falls risk was associated with slower walking speeds in all conditions including the optimal (floor) condition (p =. 029). In the elevated walkway conditions, <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falls (both self-report and as indicated by physiological arousal) was increased and participants walked more slowly, took shorter steps, decreased their cadence, and spent more time in double support (p <. 005). Disproportionately large reductions in walking speed were evident in participants with greater <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling (p =. 018). Conclusions. These findings suggest that walking performance is influenced by both physiological and psychological factors. Physiological falls risk appears to determine walking speed under optimal conditions, whereas <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> falling elicits greater (possibly excessive) gait adjustments under conditions of postural threat...|$|R
