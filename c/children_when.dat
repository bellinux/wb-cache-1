5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for <b>children.</b> <b>When</b> Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry.

Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday Night Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season.

5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS on rural households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable to support themselves and their <b>children</b> <b>when</b> their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International {{highlights the importance of}} increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of <b>children</b> <b>when</b> diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their <b>children.</b> <b>When</b> he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child.

There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion.

5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa.

Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's <b>children.</b> <b>When</b> Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E

5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his <b>children</b> <b>when</b> they watch him play.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leonardo's early life.

His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without <b>children.</b> <b>When</b> Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).|$|E
5|$|Once {{considered}} {{for the role of}} James Bond in the cinematic adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin.

A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children.
