25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a <b>control</b> <b>source,</b> typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a <b>control</b> <b>source,</b> and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{sound from}} a Category I whistle is {{primarily}} a byproduct of source motion. In every case, there is a back reaction of the medium on the source (resistive and reactive impedance). One example of a weak back reaction is a vibrating iron body in air. The densities are so different the back reaction is often ignored. Back reactions of air on an air source or water on a water source can be different. In many cases, say turbulent jets, the sound created is random and it is convenient to consider the sound to be merely a byproduct of the flow. In this category the back reaction is insufficient to strongly <b>control</b> <b>source</b> motion, so whistles are not in this category.|$|E

40|$|The unique access {{possible}} {{within a}} mine was utilized to detonate controlled explosions {{throughout the area}} monitored with a 3 D underground seismic network. Measured P-wave travel times were inverted to compute a <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> velocity image. The arrival times from these <b>controlled</b> <b>sources</b> were also used as simulated passive sources and inverted for a velocity image, which was compared to the <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> image. Two passive source imaging techniques were used, a simultaneous velocity inversion-hypocenter relocation method and an independent hypocenter relocation and velocity inversion method. The simultaneous inversion method provided the best cor-relation between the <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> and simulated passive source images. Only slight improvement was found from multiple iterations of the simultane-ous inversion, suggesting that the initial hypocenter estimate is sufficiently close to the "true " location for the problem to be essentially linear. The independent hypocenter relocation and velocity inversion method also pro-vided an image that correlated well with the <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> image. Good correlation was also found in {{a comparison of the}} <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> image with a passive source image calculated with mining-induced microearth-quakes. The correlation was improved with a combined inversion of the explosion and microearthquake data, suggesting that the discrepancies may be due to nonuniqueness of inversions of the individual data sets...|$|R

40|$|In {{the text}} books, while solving the {{circuits}} with <b>controlled</b> <b>sources</b> using Principle of superposition (POS), <b>controlled</b> <b>sources</b> are not deactivated. Thus POS {{has not been}} applied in the ‘true sense’ to circuits with dependent sources. It is shown here that POS can be applied in the ‘true sense’ to such circuits also, but with caution. POS is applicable to all those circuits with dependent sources as well, if it is applicable to these circuits when all the dependent sources are treated as independent sources. We have included two such examples: one which cannot be solved only employing series-parallel reduction, current voltage division, and Ohm’s law, second which {{has more than one}} <b>controlled</b> <b>sources.</b> The method based on POS is compared with that based on Miller equivalents and generalized matrix method. It is shown that the latter one is the most efficient.

40|$|The marine <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> {{electromagnetic}} (CSEM) {{technique has}} been adopted by the hydrocarbon industry to characterize the resistivity of targets identified from seismic data prior to drilling. Over the years, marine <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> electromagnetic has matured {{to the point that}} four-dimensional or time lapse surveys and monitoring could be applied to hydrocarbon reservoirs in production, or to monitor the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Marine <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> electromagnetic surveys have also been used to target shallow resistors such as gas hydrates. These novel uses of the technique require very well constrained transmitter and receiver geometry in order to make meaningful and accurate geologic interpretations of the data. Current navigation in marine <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> electromagnetic surveys utilize a long base line, or a short base line, acoustic navigation system to locate the transmitter and seafloor receivers. If these systems fail, then rudimentary navigation is possible by assuming the transmitter follows in the ship's track. However, these navigational assumptions are insufficient to capture the detailed orientation and position of the transmitter required for both shallow targets and repeat surveys. In circumstances when acoustic navigation systems fail we propose the use of an inversion algorithm that solves for transmitter geometry. This algorithm utilizes the transmitter's electromagnetic dipole radiation pattern as recorded by stationary, close range (< 1000 m), receivers in order to model the geometry of the transmitter. We test the code with a synthetic model and validate it with data from a well navigated <b>controlled</b> <b>source</b> electromagnetic survey over the Scarborough gas field in Australia...|$|R

5000|$|At {{each point}} in the {{pipeline}} there are parameters that can be modulated by control sources. These parameters vary depending on which [...] "block" [...] is being modulated. For instance, for the SAW DSP block the user can assign various modulations sources to modulate the pitch of the sawtooth wave. There are, generally speaking, three sources that can be assigned to modulate a parameter. In {{the case of the}} SAW DSP block, the user can specify a starting pitch and determine how the pitch will track across the keyboard by specifying the amount of modulation supplied by each key in cents (via [...] "Keytrk", or key track). The user can also assign modulation sources to [...] "Src1" [...] and [...] "Src2" [...] and specify the depth of the modulation amount (for [...] "Src1", the user can specify [...] "Depth". for [...] "Src2", [...] "MinDpt" [...] and [...] "MaxDpt"). Additionally, [...] "Src2" [...] has a [...] "Dptctl" [...] (depth control) parameter—a <b>control</b> <b>source</b> that will determine how much the <b>control</b> <b>source</b> assigned to [...] "Src2" [...] will modulate the parameter. For example, a user may assign a key tracking value of 100 cents (causing a keyboard controller to play a 12-tone Western scale), assign [...] "Src1" [...] to a knob on a MIDI controller with a [...] "Depth" [...] value of 1200 cents (to tune the whole keyboard up or down by an octave), and assign [...] "Src2" [...] to be modulated by [...] "LFO1". Further, the [...] "MinDpt" [...] and [...] "MaxDpt" [...] can be set to -100 cents and 100 cents respectively, and the [...] "Dptctrl" [...] can be assigned to another knob on a MIDI controller. This would provide a [...] "vibrato" [...] effect whose speed is controlled by [...] "LFO1" [...] (or low-frequency oscillator) and whose depth is controlled by the assigned MIDI control.|$|E

40|$|Deterministic {{seismic hazard}} {{analysis}} (DSHA) is an approach for evaluating site-specific seismic hazard that {{is influenced by}} the maximum hazard from the <b>controlling</b> <b>sources</b> affecting the specific study site. In its conventional form, DSHA does not consider sources other than the largest "controlling" source and it does not account for the time factors owing to the uncertainty of earthquakes occurrences in time.

[...] "ENV1" [...] and [...] "ENV2" [...] are bipolar envelopes, and [...] "ASR1" [...] and [...] "ASR2" [...] are two more unipolar envelopes.

5000|$|A {{discussion}} of V.A.S.T. {{would not be}} complete without mentioning [...] "FUNs". [...] "FUN" [...] stands for [...] "function", and these are mathematical equations that take two values (a and b) as inputs and perform an operation on them. FUN equations include [...] "a+b", [...] "a*b", [...] "b/(1-a)", and many others of varying complexity. They also allow for self-modulation; some FUNs introduce a variable [...] "y" [...] which represents the most recent output of the FUN. The Kurzweil evaluates each FUN every 20 milliseconds, hence it can take that value and plug {{it back into the}} equation if the equation has [...] "y" [...] as an input variable. Any modulation source can be assigned to a or b (or both at the same time) in a FUN. This can be used to mix two modulation sources, cause one to multiply the effects of another, and so forth. Internally, the K2000 rescales whatever value is currently being sent by the <b>control</b> <b>source</b> to a number between -1 and 1 (for bipolar control sources. Unipolar sources are scaled between 0 and 1), then applies the function and returns an output value. Using FUNS, therefore, more than three control sources can be assigned to modulate a parameter in a block since you can assign a FUN as a modulation source for [...] "Src1", [...] "Src2", or [...] "Dptctl". Four FUNs are available per layer and FUNs can be assigned as inputs to other FUNs. The Kurzweil evaluates the FUNs sequentially, hence for this to work you would want to assign FUN1 as an input to FUN2, but not vice versa.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} program is to develop technology to reduce helicopter interior noise resulting from multiple gear meshing frequencies. A novel active vibration control approach called Minimum Actuation Power (MAP) is developed. MAP is an optimal control strategy that minimizes the total input power into a structure by monitoring and varying the input power of <b>controlling</b> <b>sources.</b> MAP <b>control</b> was implemented without explicit knowledge of the phasing and magnitude of the excitation sources by driving the real part of the input power from the <b>controlling</b> <b>sources</b> to zero. It is shown that this occurs when the total mechanical input power from the excitation and <b>controlling</b> <b>sources</b> is a minimum. MAP theory is developed for multiple excitation sources with arbitrary relative phasing for single or multiple discrete frequencies and controlled by a single or multiple <b>controlling</b> <b>sources.</b> Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of MAP for structural vibration reduction of a realistic rotorcraft interior structure. MAP control resulted in significant average global vibration reduction of a single frequency and multiple frequency excitations with one controlling actuator.
