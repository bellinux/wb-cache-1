5|$|Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British {{satellite}} <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b> Developed {{during the}} 1960s, {{it was used}} for four launches between 1969 and 1971. Its final flight {{was the first and}} only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom, and placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 is {{operated}} {{as part of}} the CryoSat programme to study the Earth's polar ice caps, which is itself part of the Living Planet programme. The CryoSat-2 spacecraft was constructed by EADS Astrium, and was launched by ISC Kosmotras, using a Dnepr <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket,</b> on 8 April 2010. On 22 October 2010, CryoSat-2 was declared operational following six months of on-orbit testing.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E

50|$|The UR-100 and its {{variants}} {{were the}} standard small ICBM of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Strela and Rokot <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets</b> {{are based on}} it.|$|R
50|$|In December 2013, specialists chose {{sites for}} Angara {{facilities}} at the cosmodrome and transported the <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket's</b> mockup from Moscow-based Khrunichev Space Center {{that made it}} to the spaceport.|$|R
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b> Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the launch pad on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the launch pad, Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{proposal}} for the CryoSat programme was submitted {{as part of a}} call for proposals in July 1998 for Earth Explorer missions as part of the European Space Agency's Living Planet programme. It was selected for further studies in 1999, and following completion of a feasibility study the mission was authorised. The construction phase began in 2001, and in 2002 EADS Astrium was awarded a contract to build the spacecraft. A contract was also signed with Eurockot, to conduct the launch of the satellite using a Rokot/Briz-KM <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1st Aero was {{responsible}} for tracking all artificial earth satellites, space probes, <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> and debris, US and foreign. The mission included detecting additional objects previously unknown and maintaining a complete catalogue.|$|R
50|$|The US-K satellites, were {{launched}} by Molniya-M <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets</b> with Blok 2BL upper stages from Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The US-KS and US-KMO operate in geosynchronous orbits and {{were launched}} by Proton rockets with DM-2 upper stages from Baikonur.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the first}} stages of orbital <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets</b> have been {{discarded}} {{in the ocean}} once the ascent was complete. Achieving routine recovery and reuse of the launch vehicles could dramatically {{reduce the cost of}} access to space.|$|R
5|$|The {{telescope}} became operational in {{the summer}} of 1957, {{just in time for the}} launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2's <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E
5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket,</b> from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5000|$|Tselina-2 {{satellites}} {{were designed}} for launch on Zenit-2 <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> however the first two launches used the larger Proton-K / DM-2 as the Zenit was still undergoing development. The most recent launch used the modernised Zenit-2M rocket.|$|R
50|$|Orlets {{satellites}} conducted optical imaging, returning images {{by means}} of film capsules. Orlets-1 spacecraft carried eight film capsules, whilst Orlets-2 carried twenty-two. Orlets-1 were launched by Soyuz-U and Soyuz-U2 <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> with the larger Zenit-2 being used to launch Orlets-2.|$|R
50|$|Spacebus {{satellites}} {{were developed}} to be compatible {{with a large number}} of available <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> particularly the Ariane family of rockets. As the performance of the Ariane has increased, the satellites have become larger {{to take advantage of this}} increased capacity.|$|R
5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles (12.9 million km) away. It also received data from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of 36.2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b> The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
25|$|HTV-1 was {{launched}} on the maiden {{flight of the}} H-IIB <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b> The H-IIB 304 configuration was used, with a type 5S-H payload fairing.|$|E
50|$|Site 131, {{also known}} as Voskhod (Восход meaning Sunrise), was a launch complex at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia, used by Kosmos <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets</b> and R-14 missiles. It {{consisted}} of a single launch pad, which was used between 1967 and 1969.|$|R
50|$|Site 133, {{also known}} as Raduga (Радуга meaning Rainbow), is a launch complex at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. It is used by Rockot, and {{previously}} Kosmos <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets.</b> It consists of a single pad, originally designated 133/1, and later 133/3.|$|R
50|$|Site 32 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome is {{a launch}} complex {{formerly}} used by Tsyklon-3 <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets.</b> It {{consists of a}} two launch pads, Site 32/1 and Site 32/2, which were used between 1977 and 2009. It has the GRAU index 11P868.|$|R
25|$|Jules Verne was {{launched}} into low Earth orbit atop the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5ES <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket.</b> Lift-off from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, occurred at 04:03:04 UTC on 9 March 2008. The spacecraft separated from its <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> one hour, six minutes and 41 seconds after lift-off, and navigation systems were subsequently activated. Two days later, on 11 March, the four main engines of the ATV were fired for the first time, marking the beginning of several orbital insertion boosts. The Overberg Test Range {{played a part in}} relaying ATV telemetry data from a mobile station deployed in New Zealand during the launch phase.|$|E
25|$|In {{connection}} with this new design, Kliper will feature a launch escape system that will enable it to detach from the <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> if an abort of the mission during orbital ascent is required. An abort will be possible during every phase of the launch with the limitation of the first seconds after launch.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Kliper's {{design was}} changed again (as {{outlined}} above) and the most likely solution for a <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> became the Soyuz 2-3, an upgraded Soyuz 2 rocket. This enhanced Soyuz {{should have been able}} to launch Kliper into space because of weight reduction resulting in the use of the Parom as a space tug.|$|E
5000|$|Site 132, {{also known}} as Chusovaya (Чусова́я), is a launch complex at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia, used by Kosmos <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets.</b> It {{consists}} of a two launch pads, Site 133/1, which is active, and Site 133/2 which is not.|$|R
5|$|Black Arrow {{originated}} from {{studies by the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment for <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets</b> based on the Black Knight rocket, with the project being authorised in 1964. It was initially developed by Saunders-Roe, and later Westland Aircraft {{as the result of}} a merger.|$|R
50|$|Kosmos-2I (GRAU Index: 11K63, {{also known}} as Cosmos-2I) is the {{designation}} applied to two Soviet <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> members of the R-12 family, which were used to orbit satellites between 1961 and 1977. They were superseded by the R-14 derived Kosmos-3 and Kosmos-3M.|$|R
25|$|By mid-2011, the {{construction}} of Tiangong-1 was complete, and its systems and thermal properties were undergoing testing. Testing was also conducted on the Long March 2F <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> on which Tiangong-1 would be launched; technicians undertook particularly extensive safety tests on the rocket in August and September 2011, following the launch failure of a Long March 2C rocket on 18 August.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, it was {{reported}} that China had finished the initial crew selection for the Shenzhou 9 mission. Niu Hongguang, the deputy chief commander of the China Manned Space Engineering Project, stated that Shenzhou 9 would dock with Tiangong-1 before August 2012. The Shenzhou 9 spacecraft was delivered to Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center for launch preparations on 9 April 2012, while its Long March 2F <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> arrived a month later on 9 May.|$|E
25|$|Rosetta {{was set to}} be {{launched}} on 12 January 2003 to rendezvous with the comet 46P/Wirtanen in 2011. This plan was abandoned after the failure of an Ariane 5 <b>carrier</b> <b>rocket</b> during Hot Bird 7's launch on 11 December 2002, grounding it until {{the cause of the}} failure could be determined. In May 2003, a new plan was formed to target the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, with a revised launch date of 26 February 2004 and comet rendezvous in 2014. The larger mass and the resulting increased impact velocity made modification of the landing gear necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Prognoz, {{also known}} as SO-M was a Soviet {{scientific}} research satellite programme. Twelve Prognoz satellites were launched between 14 April 1972 and 29 August 1996, by Molniya-M <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets.</b> The satellites were placed in High Earth orbits. All launches occurred from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome ...|$|R
50|$|The Mu, {{also known}} as M, {{was a series of}} Japanese solid-fuelled <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets,</b> which were {{launched}} from Uchinoura between 1966 and 2006. Originally developed by Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Mu rockets were later operated by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency following its merger with ISAS.|$|R
50|$|Mars 1 was {{launched}} in 1962 but failed en route to Mars. Two other Soviet launches at around the same time, Mars 2MV-4 No.1 and Mars 2MV-3 No.1 were 900 kg spacecraft, however both failed to leave Earth orbit due to problems with the upper stages of their <b>carrier</b> <b>rockets.</b>|$|R
