Sensor node has limited power energy constraints act as the critical issue in the deployment. Hence, we must developed energy efficient methods to facilitate efficient data transmission between the nodes. In this paper we compare currently available energy efficient clustering methods. Also we propose a dynamic <b>clustering</b> <b>node</b> method using neural network. In Neural Network (NN) each node has to send data to all the nodes in the next layer, which in turns requires lots of energy. Instead of that we form a clusters, in each <b>cluster</b> elect <b>cluster</b> <b>node.</b> <b>Cluster</b> <b>node</b> processes the data and send directly to the base station or through other <b>cluster</b> <b>node.</b> We periodically change the <b>cluster</b> and <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> in order to balance the energy constraints...|$|R

30|$|Generally, a {{clustered}} ad hoc network {{consists of}} three kinds of nodes: <b>cluster</b> head <b>nodes,</b> gateway nodes, and ordinary <b>nodes.</b> <b>Cluster</b> head <b>nodes</b> are vested with the responsibility of managing the cluster. For example, {{in the case of}} a cluster-based control channel design for a CRAHN, the <b>cluster</b> head <b>node</b> is responsible for allocating a set of control channels out of the set of channels available to every member of that cluster. The coordination between two adjacent clusters is conducted through the gateway nodes. A <b>node</b> of a <b>cluster</b> can act as a gateway only if it has a neighboring node as well as a channel in common with the designated control channel of its neighboring <b>cluster.</b> All <b>nodes</b> other than the <b>cluster</b> head <b>node</b> and gateway node are ordinary nodes.
