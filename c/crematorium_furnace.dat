25|$|It {{was common}} {{to burn the}} corpse and the grave offerings on a pyre, in which the {{temperature}} reached 1,400 degrees Celsius; much higher than modern <b>crematorium</b> <b>furnaces</b> attain. All that would remain was some incinerated fragments of metal and some animal and human bones. The pyre was constructed so that the pillar of smoke would be as massive as possible in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife.|$|R

Only some incinerated fragments of metal and of animal and human bones would remain. The pyre was constructed to make the pillar of smoke as massive as possible, in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife. The symbolism is described in the Ynglinga saga: [...] "Thus he (Odin) established by law that all dead men should be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth. Thus, said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin's time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Blobel {{began his}} work experimenting at Chełmno (Kulmhof). Attempts to use {{incendiary}} bombs to destroy exhumed bodies were unsuccessful as the weapons {{set fire to}} nearby forests. The most effective way was eventually found to be giant pyres on iron grills. The method involved building alternating layers of corpses and firewood on railway tracks. Afterwards remaining bone fragments could be crushed by pounding with heavy dowels or in a grinding machine and then re-buried in pits. The operation officially began at Sobibór extermination camp. The Leichenkommando exhumed the bodies from mass graves around the camp and then burned them, after which task the workers were executed. The process then moved to Bełżec in November 1942. The Auschwitz and Belsen camps had <b>crematoria</b> with <b>furnace</b> rooms on site {{to dispose of the}} bodies, therefore the Aktion 1005 commandos were not needed there. Surplus corpses were burned by their own prisoners (pictured).|$|R

He was deported from Athens on 2 April and arrived at Auschwitz on 11 April, at which point he was one of the 320 Greek (assigned serial numbers from 182,440 to 182,759) selected for labor. His number was 182,552. He was assigned the job of a Heizer, a member of the Sonderkommando assigned to the <b>crematorium</b> <b>furnace)</b> in Birkenau Krematorium V.

After taking the photographs, Errera buried the camera in the soil at the camp, for retrieval/discovery later.|$|E
