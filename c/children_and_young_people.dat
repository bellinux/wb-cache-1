5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with epilepsy, {{as well as}} six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and {{only one of the}} trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|Both Wilson {{and critics}} responded {{positively}} to the film, with Wilson saying {{she thought it}} was the best film adaptation of any of her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. Dustbin Baby was awarded the International Emmy in the <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> <b>People</b> category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a Children's BAFTA for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.|$|E
5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, {{in which he}} helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the contributions that the sociological study of sibship and twinship in the Minority World can make to childhood studies. It argues that, in providing one forum {{within which to}} explore <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> social relationships, we can {{add to our understanding}} of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> interdependence <b>and</b> develop a more nuanced understanding of agency. As emergent subjects, <b>children,</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> adults are in a process of ‘becoming’. However, {{this does not mean that}} they can ‘become’ anything they choose to. The notion of negotiated interdependence (Punch 2002) is useful in helping us to grasp the contingent nature of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> agency...|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors– cookery {{writer and}} TV {{presenter}} Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling– to submit booklets {{related to their}} most famous works for publication. Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7million for the fund. The £10.8million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> <b>People</b> in Crisis. In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping {{to raise money for}} the National Council for One Parent Families.|$|E
5|$|The Curriculum for Excellence, Scotland's {{national}} school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> from age 3 to 18. All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland {{are entitled to}} a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study Standard Grades, or Intermediate qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the Curriculum for Excellence. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. A small number of students at certain private, independent schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.|$|E
5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
