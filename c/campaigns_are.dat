5|$|Peterborough was redefined as a borough {{constituency}} with {{effect from}} the February 1974 general election. Successors of the historic parliamentary boroughs, the spending limits for election <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> slightly lower than in county constituencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> having a {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience {{in which they}} literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E
5|$|Feminist <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E

50|$|The Star Wraith <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{normally}} randomly {{generated by}} default. However, by editing game text files, {{it was possible}} to create a linear <b>campaign.</b> Star Wraith <b>was</b> limited, however, and creation of one's own <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> virtually pointless.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} post mortems of the <b>campaign</b> <b>were</b> written, all highly {{critical}} of the way the <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> run and of its major backers failure to deal with these issues.|$|R
5|$|The atrium, apartments, offices, {{and stores}} opened on a {{staggered}} schedule from February to November 1983. At first, {{there were few}} tenants willing to move in to the commercial and retail spaces; the residential units were sold out within months of opening. Since 2016, the tower has seen a large surge in visitation because of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and subsequent election—both his 2016 and 2020 <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> headquartered in the tower.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Roman troops {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times, with at least four major campaigns. The Antonine Wall was occupied again {{for a brief period}} after 197 CE. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus led a major campaign. A string of forts was constructed in the north-east (some of which may have been begun in the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely known to have been permanently occupied during this incursion. There is evidence that these <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal. After the death of Severus in 210 the Romans withdrew back to Hadrian's Wall, which would be the frontier until Roman authority in Britain collapsed in the fifth century.|$|E

5000|$|Popularly {{referred}} to as the Border <b>Campaign,</b> it <b>was</b> also {{referred to}} as the [...] "Resistance Campaign" [...] by some Irish republican activists. The <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> a military failure, but for some of its members, the <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> justified as it had kept the IRA engaged for another generation.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, after Daniel Ortega {{began his}} second term as President of Nicaragua, under the Carlos Fonseca Amador Popular Education Association, a new {{literacy}} <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> announced and later launched in March 2007. The new literacy <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> based on the [...] "Yo, sí puedo" [...] (Yes, I can) Cuban method. Estimates say over 350,000-500,000 Nicaraguans would be taught to read and write. The literacy <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> coordinated by Orlando Pineda and received finance and support from Cuba, Spain and Venezuela. The goal of the literacy <b>campaigns</b> <b>is</b> to declare Nicaragua free of illiteracy by 2009.|$|R

25|$|Comprehensive <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> not {{commonly}} used in the United States due to their cost and the organizational expertise their require. However, they are gaining popularity in the U.S. labor movement, and many unions claim to be building comprehensive campaign capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} to be synergistic with new technology and with the FAA Safety Management System approach. The <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> initially funded with a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.|$|R

25|$|Comprehensive <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> {{notoriously}} expensive, {{and require}} significant lead-time to initiate. Many labor union activists advocate a six-month research effort before the comprehensive campaign begins, {{making it difficult}} to properly undertake a comprehensive campaign once a strike or negotiations have begun.|$|E
25|$|Media <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> {{a viable}} means of {{spreading}} {{knowledge to the}} public of {{the health effects of}} smoking. This is especially important in relation to narghile smoking, as its positive cultural perception is a large factor in its increasing popularity.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive {{marketing}} <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> currently {{promoting the}} use of laser vitreolysis {{for the treatment of}} floaters. No strong evidence currently exists for the treatment of floaters with laser vitreolysis. Currently, the strongest available evidence comparing these two treatment modalities are retrospective case series.|$|E

50|$|The <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> very successful, but {{was also}} criticised. In fact no {{rainforest}} was acquired by WWF or Krombacher. Rather, existing nature reserve were supported. Accordingly, a German court decided the <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> partly anticompetitive.|$|R
50|$|The 2007-08 Antarctic <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> named Operation Migaloo, {{after the}} only known albino {{humpback}} in the world. This <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{the focus of the}} first season of Whale Wars, which premiered on November 7, 2008.|$|R
25|$|Other {{research}} is less sanguine, arguing that comprehensive <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> most effective {{only in the}} context of collective bargaining context. Some preliminary research suggests that comprehensive campaigns tend to fail more often in organizing drives, and appear to have little effect as a non-strike weapon.|$|E

25|$|Certain toxins, such as lead, mercury, toluene, and PCB are {{well-known}} {{causes of}} neuro-developmental disorders. Recognition of these risks {{has led to}} evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol.

25|$|Comprehensive campaigns vary in length. Many {{elements}} of a comprehensive campaign take one or more years to be effective. Subsequently, comprehensive <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> often expected to last over many years. But they may last only months or only one or two, if the union's goals are achieved quickly.|$|E
25|$|Retrospective reviews by IGN and GameSpot {{emphasized}} {{the ability to}} join multiplayer games on local networks or using Kali, and the simple but effective map editor, with which some users published maps on the Web. Another GameSpot review in 1996 commented that the <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> rather short, but the scenario builder and multiplayer options were ample compensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} against trafficking of women focus on harsher criminal legislation and punishments, and improving international police cooperation. There are vast media campaigns which {{are designed to}} be informative to the public, as well as policy makers and potential victims.
