2500|$|The boards {{surrounding}} the ice {{help keep the}} puck in play and {{they can also be}} used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [...] "bodycheck" [...] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are [...] "in play" [...] and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [...] "faceoff". Two players [...] "face" [...] each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the puck. <b>Markings</b> (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} modern {{telecommunication}} systems {{is a complex}} task since many parameters, mostly of stochastic nature, {{have to be taken}} into account in order to achieve desired performance values. Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are a well-known modeling and analysis tool for such systems. In addition, the ability to adapt system operations to quickly changing environment or system conditions is of great importance. Therefore, a new framework for the extension SPNs is presented in this paper which introduces elements providing means for a dynamic optimization of performability measures. A new type of transition is defined offering a feature for specification <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> switching, called reconfiguration, from one set <b>of</b> <b>markings</b> <b>of</b> a SPN to another set <b>of</b> <b>markings.</b> In a numerical analysis, these optional reconfiguration transitions are evaluated in order to optimize a specified reward or cost function.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> a safe place/transition net so as to avoid a set <b>of</b> {{forbidden}} <b>markings</b> "F". We say that a given set <b>of</b> <b>markings</b> has property REACH if it is closed under the reachability operator. We assume that all transitions of the net are controllable and that the set <b>of</b> forbidden <b>markings</b> "F" has the property REACH. The technique of unfolding is used to design a maximally permissive supervisor to solve this control problem. The supervisor {{takes the form of a}} set <b>of</b> <b>control</b> places to be added to the unfolding of the original net. The approach is also extended to the problem of preventing a larger set "F" of impending forbidden marking. This is a superset <b>of</b> the forbidden <b>markings</b> that also includes all those markings from which—unless the supervisor blocks the plant—a marking in "F" is inevitably reached in a finite number of steps. Finally, we consider the particular case in which the control objective is that of designing a maximally permissive supervisor for deadlock avoidance and we show that in this particular case our procedure can be efficiently implemented by means of linear algebraic techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{deal with}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> a safe place/transition nets so as to avoid a set <b>of</b> {{forbidden}} <b>markings</b> F. If a given set <b>of</b> <b>markings</b> has property REACH, i. e., if it is closed under the reachability operator, using the technique of unfolding it is possible to efficiently design a maximally permissive supervisor to solve this control problem. We consider the additional problem of forbidding a larger set FI that also contains those markings from which a marking in F is inevitably reached unless the controller introduces a deadlock and show how this problem can be solved still using the unfolding.
