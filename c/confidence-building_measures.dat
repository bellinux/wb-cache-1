5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E

This claim is occasionally reflected in maps drawn by Guatemala's government, showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty-third department. , the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious. Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on Clause VII of the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859, which obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, Caribbean Community heads of government, the Organization of American States (OAS), Mexico, and the United States. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize participate in <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> approved by the OAS such as the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{high-level}} visits {{between the two}} nations have helped improve relations. In December 1996, PRC President Jiang Zemin visited India during a tour of South Asia. While in New Delhi, he signed with the Indian Prime Minister a series of <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> for the disputed borders. Sino-Indian relations suffered a brief setback in May 1998 when the Indian Defence minister justified the country's nuclear tests by citing potential threats from the PRC. However, in June 1999, during the Kargil crisis, then-External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh visited Beijing and stated that India did not consider China a threat. By 2001, relations between India and the PRC were on the mend, and the two sides handled the move from Tibet to India of the 17th Karmapa in January 2000 with delicacy and tact. In 2003, India formally recognised Tibet as a part of China, and China recognised Sikkim as a formal part of India in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the ceasefire, {{both sides}} made small {{gestures}} of peace, with Santos ordering that the bodies of guerrillas killed in combat be identified and returned to their families while the FARC reiterated their will to remain in the negotiations.

The FARC's negotiators in Havana and their leader, Timochenko, adopted a conciliatory tone. Analysts opined that the talks had reached a point of maturity where both sides appreciated their common objective and jointly protect what has been accomplished. On June 4, the negotiating sides created a commission for the clarification of truth, coexistence and non-repetition - the basis for an extrajudicial truth commission on the victims of the conflict.|$|E

Since both countries had ordered their nuclear tests, both prime ministers proceeded towards maintaining peace and security. In 1998, both governments signed an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts, which became {{the basis of the}} Lahore Declaration. On 1 February 1999, Prime Minister Sharif made a breakthrough with India when he invited his counterpart to Pakistan. On 19 February, Indian premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a historic state visit to Pakistan travelling on the inaugural bus service connecting the Indian capital of New Delhi with the major Pakistan's cultural city of Lahore, establishing a major transport link for the peoples of both nations. On 21 February, both Prime ministers signed the bilateral agreement with a memorandum of understanding to ensure the nuclear-free safety in South Asia. This bilateral agreement was widely popular in Pakistan and India onwards, the people of Pakistan supported the Prime minister's move and the Prime minister received wide appreciation from the opposition as well as the civil society. This agreement known as Lahore Declaration, it was widely assumed to development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility to both nations towards avoiding conflict and promoted the importance of <b>Confidence-building</b> <b>measures,</b> especially to avoid accidental and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.

A senior-level Chinese military delegation made a goodwill visit to India in December 1993 aimed at [...] "fostering <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> between the defence forces of the two countries."

2500|$|Nayef Al-Rodhan {{argues that}} humans' strong {{tendency}} towards [...] "fear(survival)-induced pre-emptive aggression" [...] means that situations of anarchy or near anarchy should be prevented at all costs.

Even in non-anarchic situations, survival instincts and fear can be very powerful forces, {{and they may be}} incited instantaneously. [...] "Fear(survival)-induced pre-emptive aggression" [...] {{is one of the key}} factors that may push naturally amoral humans to behave in immoral ways. [...] Knowing this, Al-Rodhan maintains that we must prepare for the circumstances that may arise from humans' aggressive behavior.

50|$|If the {{feedback}} model assumed by the <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measure</b> mechanism is correct, then the rapidly developing improvement in communication between ordinary {{people by the}} internet should provide extremely robust, fast methods of information exchange and verification, as well as improved people-to-people contacts and general building of trust networks, reducing the intensity and frequency of wars.

2500|$|While India and China remain {{strategic}} rivals, India's [...] "Look East" [...] {{policy has}} included significant rapprochement with China. In 1993, India began holding high-level talks with Chinese leaders and established <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures.</b> In 2006, China and India opened the Nathu La pass for cross-border trade {{for the first}} time since the 1962 war. On 21 November 2006 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chinese President Hu Jintao issued a 10-point joint declaration to improve ties and resolve long-standing conflicts. Trade between China and India increases by 50% each year, and is set to reach the $60 billion target set for 2010 by both Indian and Chinese governments and industrial leaders. However, China's close relations with Pakistan, skepticism about India's annexation of Sikkim, and Chinese claim over Arunachal Pradesh have threatened the improvement in bilateral relations. India's providing asylum to the political-cum-spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama also causes some friction in bilateral ties.|$|E
