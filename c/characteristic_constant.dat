40|$|Divergence {{of atomic}} flux due to {{electromigration}} has been formulated for Al polycrystalline line {{covered with a}} passivation layer. The formula {{has been identified as}} a governing parameter for electromigration damage in the line through experimental verification. It is known that local depletion of atoms, i. e. void appears in metal line used in electronic devices as a result of electromigration. So far, the velocity of depletion of atoms was expressed using the parameter to construct a derivation method for <b>characteristic</b> <b>constants</b> of electromigration damage in Al line. In this study, the electromigration <b>characteristic</b> <b>constants</b> of typical Cu line used in electronic devices are derived based on the derivation method for Al line.

40|$|Reactor {{design for}} the ferrous-catalyzed {{oxidation}} (FCO) of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) was developed through {{an examination of the}} reaction kinetics under various conditions. The TCP decay kinetics was found to consist of reaction and stagnant stages, and two <b>characteristic</b> <b>constants,</b> the initial decay rate and the oxidative capacity of the FCO, were successfully derived and used to describe the respective stages. The proposed model and the method of solving the two <b>characteristic</b> <b>constants</b> is capable of describing the TCP degradation precisely in FCO at different Fe(II) concentrations and Fe(II) /H 2 O 2 concentration ratios, where an Fe(II) /TCP concentration ratio of over 1 was found to be the critical point to achieve 100 % removal of TCP by FCO.

40|$|A design {{method for}} the removal of {{atrazine}} (ATZ) by catalytic oxidation process (COP) was developed though examination of the reaction kinetics in various conditions.
