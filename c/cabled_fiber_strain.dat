40|$|The <b>strain</b> {{of muscle}} <b>fibers</b> {{in the heart}} {{is likely to be}} {{distributed}} uniformly over the cardiac walls during the ejection period of the cardiac cycle. Mathematical models of left ventricular (LV) wall mechanics have shown that the distribution of <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> during ejection is sensitive to the orientation of muscle fibers in the wall. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that fiber orientation in the LV wall is such that <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> during ejection is as homogeneous as possible. A finite-element model of LV wall mechanics was set up to compute the distribution of <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> at the beginning (BE) and end (EE) of the ejection period of the cardiac cycle, with respect to a middiastolic reference state. The distribution of fiber orientation over the LV wall, quantified by three parameters, was systematically varied to minimize regional differences in fiber shortening during ejection and in the average of <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> at BE and EE. A well-defined optimum in the distribution of fiber orientation was found which was not significantly different from anatomical measurements. After optimization, the average of <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> at BE and EE was 0. 025 ± 0. 011 (mean ± standard deviation) and the difference in <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> during ejection was 0. 214 ± 0. 018.

40|$|The force, {{mechanical}} work and power produced by muscle fibers are profoundly {{affected by the}} length changes they undergo during a contraction. These length changes are in turn affected by the spatial orientation of muscle fibers within a muscle (fiber architecture). Therefore any heterogeneity in fiber architecture within a single muscle {{has the potential to}} cause spatial variation in <b>fiber</b> <b>strain.</b> Here we examine how the architectural variation within a pennate muscle and within a fusiform muscle can result in regional <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> heterogeneity. We combine simple geometric models with empirical measures of <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> to better understand the effect of architecture on <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> heterogeneity. We show that variation in pennation angle throughout a muscle can result in differences in <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> with higher strains being observed at lower angles of pennation. We also show that in fusiform muscles, the outer/superficial fibers of the muscle experience lower <b>strains</b> than central <b>fibers.</b> These results show that regional variation in mechanical output of muscle fibers can arise solely from architectural features of the muscle without the presence of any spatial variation in motor recruitment. © 2014 Azizi and Deslauriers...|$|R

40|$|In a {{mathematical}} model of {{the mechanics of the}} left ventricle (LV) by Arts et al. (1), assuming uniformity of fiber stress ([sigma](f)) and <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> ([Delta][epsilon](f)) in the wall during the ejection phase, fiber stress and <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> were related to LV cavity pressure (P(lv)), LV cavity volume (V(lv)) and wall volume (V(w)) by the following pair of equations: [sigma](f) = P(lv) (1 + 3 V(lv) /V(w)) and [Delta][epsilon](f) = 1 / 3 [Delta]ln(1 + 3 V(lv) /V(w)). The ratio of V(lv) to V(w) appeared {{to be the most important}} geometric parameter, whereas the actual LV shape was of minor importance. The relationships on <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> and stress were evaluated experimentally in six anesthetized open-chest dogs during normal and elevated (volume loading) end-diastolic LV pressure. Subepicardial <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> was measured simultaneously in 16 adjacent regions of the LV anterior wall, using optical markers that were attached to the epicardial surface and recorded on video. Changes in V(lv) were measured by use of four inductive coils sutured to the LV in a tetrahedric configuration. V(w) was measured postmortem. During control as well as hypervolemia the following results were found. At the anterior free wall of the LV, the slope of the estimated linear relationship between measured and calculated <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> was 1. 017 +/- 0. 168 (means +/- SD), which is not significantly different from unity. Calculated fiber stress corresponded qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental results reported on isolated cardiac muscle. Calculated subepicardial contractile work per unit of tissue volume was not significantly different from global pump work as normalized to V(w). These findings support the assumption of homogeneity of muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> and stress in the left ventricular wall during the ejection phase.

40|$|Surgical advancements in the {{management}} of Tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, have allowed individuals to survive into adulthood. However, most individuals develop pulmonary regurgitation, causing right ventricular volume overload, dilatation, and possible dysfunction. These patients require pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), but the timing and indications for the operation are still under investigation. One proposed clinical indicator for PVR is a right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) greater than 150 mL/m 2, though this threshold value is somewhat controversial. Because diastolic <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> have been found to correlate well with ventricular remodeling in response to volume overload, a correlation may also exist between diastolic <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> and reverse remodeling after alleviation of volume overload. In this thesis, biventricular image-based computational models were developed to test the hypothesis that RVEDVI correlates with post-PVR regional diastolic <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> in the right ventricle. Two computational models with RVEDVIs of 170 mL/m 2 and 115 mL/m 2 were developed, and each model underwent full-beat simulation before and after virtual PVR. Preliminary findings suggest that RVEDVI may in fact correlate negatively with post-PVR regional diastolic <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> of repaired ToF patients, particularly in regions of the right ventricular free wall adjacent to the septum...|$|R

30|$|Damage {{to white}} matter {{pathways}} {{is particularly important}} in determining clinical symptoms of TBI due to diffuse axonal injury. Standard isotropic response analyses (maximum principal strain) do not account for white matter structural anisotropy and {{are not able to}} characterize shearing and elongation. Recent studies have begun to incorporate axonal strain directly, improving injury prediction [12, 22 – 27]. However, greater resolution is needed to estimate <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> at subvoxel resolution and to assess <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> along their entire length [28]. This is important, as assessing <b>fiber</b> <b>strains</b> along the entire length of fibers enables assessing the injury risks to white matter neural pathways or tracts, which is not possible with element/voxel-based studies. Incorporating whole-brain tractography into multiscale models permits graph theoretic prediction {{at the level of the}} structural connectome [29]. By incorporating axonal cell death models [30], damage to functional brain networks can be computed. This potentially offers a physics-based insight into the biomechanical and neurophysiological mechanisms of TBI symptomatology.|$|R

50|$|Most fishes bend as a simple, {{homogenous}} beam during swimming via contractions of longitudinal red {{muscle fibers}} and obliquely oriented white muscle fibers within the segmented axial musculature. The <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> (εf) {{experienced by the}} longitudinal red muscle fibers {{is equivalent to the}} longitudinal strain (εx). The deeper white muscle fibers fishes show diversity in arrangement. These fibers are organized into cone-shaped structures and attach to connective tissue sheets known as myosepta; each fiber shows a characteristic dorsoventral (α) and mediolateral (φ) trajectory. The segmented architecture theory predicts that, εx > εf. This phenomenon results in an architectural gear ratio, determined as longitudinal <b>strain</b> divided by <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> (εx / εf), greater than one and longitudinal velocity amplification; furthermore, this emergent velocity amplification may be augmented by variable architectural gearing via mesolateral and dorsoventral shape changes, a pattern seen in pennate muscle contractions.

40|$|At {{the first}} step, the {{stress-strain}} relation of concrete in direct tension and in flexural tension were examined. The strain {{at the beginning}} of fracture in the former was about 10. 6 to 12. 2 ×(10) ^ and that in the latter was about 18. 2 to 21. 5 ×(10) ^. These results show that the fracture of concrete beam does not start even if the extreme tensile <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> represents the strain at which the fracture in direct tension starts. It is assumed that the resistance of concrete beam to external force does not decrease since tensile stresses in inner fibers increase when the extreme fiber fails. Experimental results which prove this hypothesis are presented. The notable change of stress distribution occurred when the extreme tensile <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> of concrete beam was over the strain at which the fracture of concrete in direct tension began, but the neutral axis did not move at this time.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} regional electrical activation time and <b>fiber</b> <b>strain,</b> epicardial electrical activation and deformation were measured in six open-chest dogs at the left ventricular anterior free wall after 15 min of right atrial, left ventricular free wall, left ventricular apex, or right ventricular outflow tract pacing, when end-diastolic pressure was normal or elevated (volume-loading). Regional electrical activation was measured using a 192 -electrode brush. Regional subepicardial <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> (e(f)) was measured simultaneously in 16 regions, using optical markers which were attached to the epicardial surface and recorded on video. When relating regional e(f) during the ejection phase to regional activation time, the best correlation was found when a hemodynamic time reference rather than an electrophysiological one is used. Using {{the moment of the}} maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure as the time reference for electrical activation, regional electrical activation time (t(ea)) and the degree of e(f) during the ejection phase could be fitted by a linear regression equation e(f) = a t(ea) + b, in which a = - 3. 46 +/- 0. 73 s- 1 and b = - 0. 28 +/- 0. 05. For electrical activation times ranging from - 40 to - 80 ms, <b>fiber</b> <b>strain</b> was estimated with an accuracy of +/- 0. 026 (+/-SE) with this relation. During right atrial pacing, t(ea), and e(f) were on the average - 48 ms and - 0. 10 respectively. On further investigation, the relation between e(f) and t(ea) appeared to be influenced by end-diastolic pressure. For normal (1. 1 kPa) and elevated end-diastolic pressure (1. 8 kPa), the slope of the linear regression line was - 3. 96 and - 2. 86 s- 1, respectively. Three conclusions may be drawn. Firstly, the time interval between the moment of regional electrical activation and the moment of the maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure is an index of regional <b>fiber</b> <b>strain.</b> Secondly, it can be concluded from the above equations that electrical asynchrony of more than 30 ms causes non-uniformities in the degree of e(f) of the order of mean e(f) during pacing from the right atrium.
