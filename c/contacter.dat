40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> lens wear on straylight in rigid and soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal in 30 rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers and 30 soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and <b>contact</b> lens characteristics were performed.

Results: Soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> lens wear of log(s) = 1. 167. After <b>contact</b> lens removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01).
