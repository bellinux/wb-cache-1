It was found that the water soluble salts of acetyl-salicvlic acid were better tolerated than acetvlsalievlic acid as such since systemic disturbances were reported to occur less frequently following their administration (1 to 8). This is especially true for gastric irritation. Of the various salts investigated, calcium acetylsalicylate was found to he the most satisfactory.

N-Ethylmaleimide, chloromethyl ketone derivatives of lysine and phenylalanine, and tosylarginine methyl ester decrease the maximum number of [3 H]glutamate binding sites without changing their affinity for glutamate. Preincubation of the membranes with glutamate does not protect the glutamate "receptors" from the suppressive effects of these agents. The proteases trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin increase the maximum number of [3 H]glutamate binding sites. The effects of <b>calcium</b> on <b>glutamate</b> binding are different across brain regions.

Recent studies have shown that astrocytic calcium waves, initially believed to depend on the integrity of functional gap junction channels for the passage of intercellular signals, are actually mediated by release of ATP and subsequent activation of purinergic receptors on neighboring cells.

40|$|Neuroglia have {{multiple}} roles in nervous system {{which include the}} regulation of external potassium, the uptake of excitatory amino acids and releasing neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate. There are three different mechanisms proposed {{for the release of}} glutamate. One of them is the <b>calcium</b> dependency of <b>glutamate</b> release; The second one is reversal of uptake of glutamate; Furosemide-sensitive release of glutamate from swelling cells is the third proposed mechanism;The objectives of this research are to determine whether neuroligand bradykinin (BK) and adenosine 52 ̆ 7 -triphosphate (ATP) can stimulate release of excitatory amino acid (EAA) glutamate and aspartate from cultured glial cells and to identify the possible signal transduction pathways for the neuroligand-induced release of EAAs;BK caused a receptor-mediated increase in release of EAAs from cultured Schwann cells together with an increase in the cytoplasmic level of free calcium. Perturbations which inhibited bradykinin-induced calcium mobilization prevented the release of EAAs from the glia. BK did not cause cell swelling and the inhibitor of glutamate transporter did not reduce BK-induced EAA release. Therefore, BK-induced release of EAAs from Schwann cells is through the calcium-dependent mechanism;ATP can evoke release of EAAs from cultured Schwann cells. Adenosine was without effect on release of EAAs suggesting involvement of P 2 receptors. ATP-evoked release of EAAs was not affected in calcium-depleted saline. However, this release was blocked by pretreatment of the cultures with both BAPTA-AM, an membrane permeant calcium chelator, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of calcium ATPase of intracellular stores. These data confirm that ATP evokes the release of EAAs from Schwann cells by activating intracellular calcium stores;Application of the neuroligand bradykinin to cultured astrocytes elevated internal <b>calcium</b> and stimulated <b>glutamate</b> release. BK also significantly elevated calcium levels in neurons co-cultured with astrocytes, but not in solitary neurons. The glutamate receptor antagonists prevented bradykinin-induced neuronal calcium elevations. When single astrocytes were directly stimulated to increase internal <b>calcium</b> and release <b>glutamate,</b> <b>calcium</b> levels of adjacent neurons were increased. Thus, astrocytes regulate neuronal calcium levels through the calcium-dependent release of glutamate...|$|R

Nine patients (30 %) had mild, 14 (46. 7 %) moderate and 7 (23. 3 %) severe form of the disease; 24 (80 %) recovered, 6 (20 %) died in the acute phase of the illness, and 19 patients (63. 3 %) required hemodialysis. Results. The average titer of antiviral antibodies in patients infected with Belgrade serotype virus were significantly higher in those with severe clinical presentation. Hypotension, anuria, macrohaematuria, pulmonary infiltration, pleural effusion, hepatomegalia and positive meningeal signs were more frequent in the patients with severe form of the disease.

However, only a few modulators of FtsZ polymerization are known. We identified monosodium glutamate as a potent inducer of FtsZ polymerization. In the presence of GTP, glutamate enhanced the rate and extent of polymerization of FtsZ in a concentration-dependent manner; similar to 90 % of the protein was sedimented as polymer in the presence of 1 m glutamate. Electron micrographs of glutamate-induced polymers showed large filamentous structures with extensive bundling. Furthermore, glutamate strongly stabilized the polymers against dilution-induced disassembly, and it decreased the GTPase activity of FtsZ.

In ECFP and Cerulean, the N-terminal half of the seventh strand exhibits two conformations. These conformations both have {{a complex set of}} van der Waals interactions with the chromophore. The Y145A and H148D mutations in Cerulean stabilize these interactions and allow the chromophore to be more planar, better packed, and less prone to collisional quenching.

Thus, a single transmembrane signal, glutamate, and the increased intracellular calcium it evokes can have opposing actions on a postsynaptic target phosphoprotein.

Loss of ATP rapidly leads to a massive calcium influx and release of calcium from intracellular compartments. Extracellular concentrations of glutamate are markedly elevated in ischaemic brain tissue. Intracellular Ca 2 + overload during ischemia has several deleterious consequences including the formation of reactive oxygen species. Nitrogen monoxide (NO) is an important mediator of cellular and molecular events which impacts the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. An increase in intracellular Ca 2 + activates the enzyme NO synthase which catalyzes the synthesis of NO. NO is produced in neurons, glia cells and vascular endothelium in central nervous system. Depending on its origin, its effects are varied. NO is a mediator having both neurotoxic and neuromodulator effects. Neuronal NO is the neurotoxic agent mediating glutamate toxicity and increasing acute ischaemic damage. Vascular NO as a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, may be beneficial {{in the early stages of}} focal cerebral ischemia. There is increasing evidence that ischaemic brain injury secondary to arterial occlusion is characterized by acute local inflammation, which involves accumulation of polymorphonuclea...|$|R
50|$|Khodorov {{published}} over 175 {{research papers}} and books, mostly concerning ion channels and membrane electrical excitability. He trained many successful scientists who hold faculty positions in universities {{all over the}} world. Initially at the V.I. Lenin Moscow State Pedagogical University, like other Soviet neurobiologists he was required to work on Pavlovian conditioning. After Soviet science was liberalized in the 1960s, he moved to ion channels, developing {{as a leader in}} the actions of local anesthetics and toxins on membrane excitability and building up one of the three principal centers of ion channel research in the Soviet Union. At the Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery, the Khodorov laboratory carried out pioneering studies in the field of ion channel biophysics, recording electrical activities from the nodes of Ranvier, studying the mechanisms of C-type inactivation in voltage-gated ion channels and the effects of neurotoxins and local anesthetics on membrane excitability. Subsequently, at the Institute of General Pathology and Pathophysiology3, he studied structure and function of the NMDA-subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, focusing on the mechanisms of gating and ion channel block. At the same time, in collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Pinelis at the Institute of Pediatrics (Moscow, Russia) and Dr. Duchen at the University College London, Khodorov was studying <b>calcium</b> homeostasis, <b>glutamate</b> excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. He {{was a member of a}} number of editorial boards including that of the journal Membrane and Cell Biology.|$|R
2500|$|Activity-dependent {{plasticity}} {{is a form}} {{of functional}} and structural neuroplasticity that arises from the use of cognitive functions and personal experience; hence, it is the biological basis for learning and the formation of new memories. Activity-dependent plasticity {{is a form of}} neuroplasticity that arises from intrinsic or endogenous activity, as opposed to forms of neuroplasticity that arise from extrinsic or exogenous factors, such as electrical brain stimulation- or drug-induced neuroplasticity. The brain's ability to remodel itself forms the basis of the brain's capacity to retain memories, improve motor function, and enhance comprehension and speech amongst other things. [...] It is this trait to retain and form memories that is associated with neural plasticity and therefore many of the functions individuals perform on a daily basis. This plasticity occurs as a result of changes in gene expression which are triggered by signaling cascades that are activated by various signaling molecules (e.g., <b>calcium,</b> dopamine, and <b>glutamate,</b> among many others) during increased neuronal activity.|$|R
40|$|New {{in vitro}} {{technologies}} that assess neuronal excitability and the derived synaptic activity within a controlled microenvironment {{would be beneficial}} for the characterisation of compounds proposed to affect central nervous system (CNS) function. Here, a microfluidic system with computer controlled compound perfusion is presented that offers a novel methodology for the pharmacological profiling of CNS acting compounds based on calcium imaging readouts. Using this system, multiple applications of the excitatory amino acid glutamate (10 nM - 1 mM) elicited reproducible and reversible transient increases in intracellular calcium, allowing the generation of a concentration response curve. In addition, the system allows pharmacological investigations to be performed as evidenced by application of glutamatergic receptor antagonists, reversibly inhibiting glutamateinduced increases in intracellular <b>calcium.</b> Importantly, repeated <b>glutamate</b> applications elicited significant increases in the synaptically driven activation of the adjacent, environmentally isolated neuronal network. Therefore, the proposed new methodology will enable neuropharmacological analysis of CNS active compounds whilst simultaneously determining their effect on synaptic connectivity...|$|R
