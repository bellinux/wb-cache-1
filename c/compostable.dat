5|$|Waste {{management}} is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme {{that has been}} in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. <b>Compostable</b> material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.|$|E

Student volunteers have been collecting recyclable and <b>compostable</b> {{material from the}} residences. <b>Compostable</b> bins will soon be available all across campus. The College is looking into partnering up with local farms to develop a larger scale composting facility that can accommodate the significant quantities of <b>compostable</b> food waste from the cafeteria.|$|E
25|$|Biopolymers are {{biodegradable}}, {{and some}} are also <b>compostable.</b> Some biopolymers are biodegradable: they are broken down into CO2 and water by microorganisms. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are compostable: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a <b>compostable</b> polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as <b>compostable,</b> {{even though they are}} biodegradable. In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.|$|E

25|$|The Olympic Park {{was planned}} to {{incorporate}} 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, {{with a total}} of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process. Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%. Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons. The focus has since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Food packaging at the Olympics is made from <b>compostable</b> materials– like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics– where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.|$|E

The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.

Old Ebbitt has long composted its food waste, but oyster shells are not <b>compostable</b> and before 2010 were thrown out as garbage.

5000|$|Curbside {{collection}} {{is the most}} common method of disposal in most European countries, Canada, New Zealand and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.In some areas, vacuum {{collection is}} used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.Pyrolysis is used for disposal of some wastes including tires, a process that can produce recovered fuels, steel and heat. In some cases tires can provide the feedstock for cement manufacture. Such systems are used in USA, California, Australia, Greece, Mexico, the United Kingdom and in Israel. The RESEM pyrolysis plant that has been operational at Texas USA since December 2011, and processes up to 60 tons per day.In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.In San Francisco, the local government established its Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in support of its goal of [...] "Zero waste by 2020", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and <b>compostables</b> out of the landfill.

2500|$|In 2002, Cargill Dow (now NatureWorks) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award {{for their}} {{improved}} method for polymerization of polylactic acid [...] Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform {{well and the}} project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. Lactic acid is produced by fermenting corn and converted to lactide, the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable polymer, which has some applications including textiles and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. Wal-Mart has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn't {{require the use of}} hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is recyclable and <b>compostable.</b>|$|E

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} wastes (C&D Waste) become major {{contributors to}} the environmental pollution in Hong Kong. Managing C&D Waste effectively becomes a pressing issue in the local construction industry. Although the principles of reuse, recycle and reduction for C&D wastes have been promoted among construction professionals for many years, {{the effectiveness of their}} applications seems limited. One of the major barriers for this is identified as the lack of guidelines to assist construction workers and professionals in implementing these activities. This paper presents a comprehensive system for implementing the reuse, recycling and reduction on C&D Waste by classifying the wastes into eight groups: plastic, paper, paperboard, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, glass, timber, <b>compostables,</b> and other materials. The suitability of each group of waste for reuse, or recycle or reduction is investigated and guidelines for implementation are proposed. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Wellington Center, Prince Edward Island. The waste cell at this {{facility}} receives only source separated waste materials. The Waste Watch source separation {{program is a}} three stream system with recyclables and <b>compostables</b> separated at source from remaining waste.

The leachate quality in the waste cell has been monitored and compared with leachate quality reported in the literature from traditional mixed waste landfill sites. The concentrations of several parameters including: Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), chloride, calcium, sodium, lead and other parameters are considerably reduced. The source separation system developed in Prince Edward Island prevents pollution in a number of ways: • Reduced landfill space for disposal operations (65 % reduction) • Reduced leachate strength (over 90 % for some parameters) • Reduced greenhouse gas emissions • Reduced resources required for treatment of leachat...|$|R
