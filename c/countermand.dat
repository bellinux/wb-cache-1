5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to <b>countermand</b> the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to <b>countermand</b> the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{civilian}} government {{was plagued by}} infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Tôn Thất Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralysed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the {{civilian government}}, but {{as members of the}} MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Thơ gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which the generals disagreed, they would go to the MRC and <b>countermand</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to <b>countermand</b> laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July, {{after the}} Huerta regime was toppled, Dresden carried Huerta, his vice president, Aureliano Blanquet, and their {{families}} to Kingston, Jamaica, where Britain had granted them asylum. Upon arriving in Kingston on the 25th, Köhler learned of the rising political tensions in Europe during the July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. By this time, the ship {{was in need of}} a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, Karlsruhe, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, who had arrived in command of Karlsruhe, traded places with Köhler aboard Dresden. The Admiralstab initially ordered Dresden to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to <b>countermand</b> the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct Handelskrieg (trade war) in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to <b>countermand</b> the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E

5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and <b>countermand</b> their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
25|$|His {{first term}} as {{governor}} wasn't without problems. He upset many colonists when he insisted, on orders from England, that the colonists abandon the lots they currently occupied {{and move to}} new lots allocated to them by Dawes.

Although Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long is angered by Roosevelt's precipitate action (which occurred during his absence), he does not <b>countermand</b> the order.|$|E
25|$|When MacNeill {{learned from}} Vol. Patrick Whelan that the arms {{shipment}} had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With {{the support of}} other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and The O'Rahilly, he issued a <b>countermand</b> to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded in putting the rising off for only a day, although it greatly {{reduced the number of}} Volunteers who turned out.|$|E
25|$|As an aristocrat and {{political}} intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed {{a threat to}} his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would <b>countermand</b> any legal process {{in order to save}} his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding an immutable justification to remove Rogers as royal governor {{in a way that would}} forestall royal intervention.|$|E

25|$|Before Charles could regroup, orders {{arrived from}} the Aulic Council, the {{imperial}} body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to <b>countermand</b> his plan; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation {{as long as he}} could, but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of the}} Rhine. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, they were too late to reverse.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 1513, Pope Julius, with England now in {{the league}} against France, issued a bull which was in effect a {{suspended}} sentence of excommunication on James if he broke the treaty with Henry. James then sent Andrew Forman once more to Rome on 31 March {{to try to get}} the new Pope Leo X to <b>countermand</b> the bull but without success. Forman did have personal success in July, however, when at the insistence of King Louis, he was made Archbishop of Bourges and paid homage to the French king on 12 September, just 3 days after the Battle of Flodden. It is unlikely that either Louis or Forman would have known of the death of James.|$|E
25|$|Goulart's {{attempt to}} <b>countermand</b> the Generals was disastrous. Two {{of his three}} {{military}} chiefs of staff were out of action for various reasons. His personal military aide was a newly promoted Brigadier General, General Assis Brasil. His greatest base of military support was located in his native Southern Brazil. His reaction, orchestrated by Assis Brasil, consisted of shifting a general from the southern 3rd Army to the southeast, to replace Castello Branco (he never arrived). Of his other generals, in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, four were on vacation, while two others were returning to their posts in Curitiba when {{they were forced to}} land in Porto Alegre due to bad weather, and thus away from their commands.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} central and peripheral targets in a saccadic <b>countermanding</b> task. Stop-signal reaction times (SSRTs) do not differ significantly for central and peripheral stop signals. Further, when central and peripheral stop signals are presented together, SSRTs behave as expected of independent processes in parallel. A linear rise-to-threshold race model (LATER) with independent go and stop processes describes the behavioural data successfully, predicting not only the latency distribution of saccades that escaped inhibition, but also the probability of successful <b>countermanding.</b> Central and peripheral stop signals appear to act independently and with equal effectiveness...|$|R

25|$|Captain Slayter {{had retired}} after his night watch, {{unaware of the}} situation, with orders to steer to Foula. Commander Smith took over the morning watch, and with his former {{knowledge}} of the ship was only happy when the ship was in open sea. Having previously disagreed with his naval superior about dodging around the island, he instructed the navigator to plot a course out to sea. Slayter must have felt the course change, as he reappeared on the bridge to <b>countermand</b> Smith's order and made {{what turned out to}} be a hasty and ill-informed judgement which resulted in the ship running directly onto the Shaalds on the morning of 8 September. She was wrecked in a flat calm and clear weather. She was the first Allied passenger ship to be lost in the war.|$|E
25|$|Offstage, Goneril, {{with all}} her evil plans thwarted, commits suicide. The dying Edmund decides, though he admits it is against his own character, {{to try to save}} Lear and Cordelia; however, his {{confession}} comes too late. Soon after Albany sends men to <b>countermand</b> Edmund's orders, Lear enters bearing Cordelia's corpse in his arms, having survived by killing the executioner. Kent appears and Lear now recognises him. Albany urges Lear to resume his throne, but like Gloucester, the trials Lear has been through have finally overwhelmed him, and he dies. Albany then asks Kent and Edgar to take charge of the throne. Kent declines, explaining that his master is calling him on a journey. Finally, Albany (in the Quarto version) or Edgar (in the Folio version) implies that he will now become king.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945, when Easy Company's initial {{attack on}} the German-occupied town of Foy bogged down due to the poor {{leadership}} of its commander, 1st Lieutenant Norman Dike, battalion executive officer Captain Richard Winters ordered Speirs to relieve Dike of command. The selection of Speirs was incidental; Winters later stated that Speirs was simply the first officer he saw when he turned around. Speirs successfully took over the assault and led Easy Company to victory. During this battle, Lt. Dike had ordered a platoon {{to go on a}} flanking mission around the rear of the town. To <b>countermand</b> this order, Speirs himself ran through the town and German lines (as this platoon had no radio), linked up with the Item Company soldiers and relayed the order. Having completed this, he then ran back through the German-occupied town. He was reassigned as commanding officer of Easy Company and remained in that position {{for the rest of the}} war. Of the officers who commanded Easy Company during the war, Speirs commanded the longest.|$|E
40|$|The {{cognitive}} {{control of}} movement suppression, including performance monitoring, {{is one of}} the core properties of the executive system. A complex cortical and subcortical network involving cerebral cortex, thalamus, subthalamus, and basal ganglia, has been regarded as the neural substrate of inhibition of programmed movements. By using the <b>countermanding</b> task, a suitable tool to explore behavioral components of movement suppression, the contribution of the cerebellum in the proactive control and monitoring of voluntary action has been recently described in patients affected by focal lesions involving in particular the cerebellar dentate nucleus. Here we evaluated the performance on the <b>countermanding</b> task in a group of patients with cerebellar degeneration, in which the cerebellar cortex was diffusely affected, and showed that they display additionally a longer latency in <b>countermanding</b> engaged movements. Overall, the present data confirm the role of the cerebellum in executive control of action inhibition by extending the contribution to reactive motor suppression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe stop-signal or <b>countermanding</b> task probes {{the ability}} to control action by {{requiring}} subjects to withhold a planned movement in response to an infrequent stop signal which they do with variable success depending on the delay of the stop signal. We investigated whether performance of humans and macaque monkeys in a saccade <b>countermanding</b> task was influenced by stimulus and performance history. In spite of idiosyncrasies across subjects several trends were evident in both humans and monkeys. Response time decreased after successive trials with no stop signal. Response time increased after successive trials with a stop signal. However, post-error slowing was not observed. Increased response time was observed mainly or only after cancelled (signal inhibit) trials and not after noncancelled (signal respond) trials. These global trends were based on rapid adjustments of response time in response to momentary fluctuations in the fraction of stop signal trials. The effects of trial sequence on the probability of responding were weaker and more idiosyncratic across subjects when stop signal fraction was fixed. However, both response time and probability of responding were influenced strongly by variations in the fraction of stop signal trials. These results indicate that the race model of <b>countermanding</b> performance requires extension to account for these sequential dependencies and provide a basis for physiological studies of executive control of <b>countermanding</b> saccade performance...|$|R
