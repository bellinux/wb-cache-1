5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the <b>centering</b> <b>unit</b> to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{force of}} control column is very {{important}} for the pilot in a flight simulator. So the control loading system in the flight simulator has been concerned since the flight simulator appeared. As the force command signal generated part of control loading system, flight control system module is the most important module for the fidelity of control loading system. This paper described a method to build flight control module. We used SimMechanics in simulink to model and analyze the feel and <b>centering</b> <b>unit,</b> which is the key part of feeling system in the flight control system, and in this paper we described the structure of the control loading system, and the function of the feel and <b>centering</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

The edge etcher machine is fully automated with very dangerous chemical circumstance; the shortcoming is low capacity for production, it spends {{too much time}} on the centering process, we use vision system to reduce the time of centering process and increase the capacity of production. Foreword The original machine is for “Edge Etching of Wafer “for 4 inch- 8 inch wafer by using chemical name HF the operation of dipping and spiking. The configuration of the machine is 3 sets of wafer transfer robot, Loading, Centering, Etching, Rinse and Unloading. The procedure is as below. 1) Push “Auto ” “Start “button, the machine loads the Cassette #A, #B. 2) The wafer transfer robot transfers wafer to <b>centering</b> <b>unit</b> from loading cassette #A or #B. 3) Wafer <b>centering</b> <b>unit,</b> during turning wafers the diameter of wafer is divided 2000 steps and finds the flat or notch of wafer. 4) Buffer position, centered wafer moves by wafer transfer robot to this buffer position to b...|$|E

50|$|Most {{sedimentation}} in the Adare Basin {{took place}} after the second extensional event. Sedimentation offshore Antarctica is primarily driven by pelagic settling, down-slope gravity flows, and across-slope current flows driven by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The continental slope in the Adare Basin is very steep and sinuous, causing turbidite channels to be common. Several Antarctic deep water currents are also responsible for depositing large amounts of sediment into the basin. Early Miocene tectonic faulting caused stratigraphic unconformities within the Adare Basin. These unconformities separate the deposition pattern into three characteristically unique domains of stratigraphic units in the Adare Basin. These are the West, East, and <b>Center</b> <b>units,</b> with the <b>Center</b> <b>unit</b> being inside the Adare Trough and along the spreading axis. Seismic transects reveal faster seismic velocities, deeper in the <b>Center</b> the West <b>units</b> of the basin, while faster velocities are detected shallower to the northeast of the trough in the East unit. This indicates that the stacked layers of sediment are thicker above the spreading axis than above the flanks of the trough.|$|R
