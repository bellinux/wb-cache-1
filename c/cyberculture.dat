5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into <b>cyberculture,</b> Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E

25|$|Technology can {{be viewed}} as an {{activity}} that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of <b>cyberculture</b> has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer. Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.|$|E
500|$|Gareth Branwyn, who {{was among}} the initial tech-experts Idol consulted, defended Idol's {{interest}} in cyberpunk. [...] "Billy is genuinely interested in and excited by <b>cyberculture,</b> and {{like all the rest}} of us, wants to factor that interest into his work, which happens to be pop music. Whether presenting <b>cyberculture</b> in that forum is ultimately a good thing or not is beside the point of Billy's right to bring it to that forum. After all, access to information should be free and total, right? Or at least that's how the mythology goes." [...] An update to Branwyn's Beyond Cyberpunk! hyper-card stack included a new introduction, which referred to the Cyberpunk controversy, frankly stating [...] "The release of Billy Idol's album Cyberpunk was met with a hailstorm of controversy on the Net, as young cyber-Turks whined about how he had ripped them off and destroyed their secret club." ...|$|E
500|$|Released to {{negative}} reviews, Cyberpunk polarised the internet {{communities of the}} period. Detractors viewed it {{as an act of}} cooptation and opportunistic commercialisation.

Alternatively, supporters saw Idol's efforts as harmless and well-intentioned, and were encouraged by his new interest in <b>cyberculture.</b>|$|E

500|$|Asked by Idol {{about how}} he could become further {{involved}} in <b>cyberculture,</b> Branwyn and Mark Frauenfelder advised him to investigate The WELL, {{one of the oldest}} online communities.

This has led to the removal of error from the prevailing image culture with the consequent foregrounding of accuracy and resemblance in relation to everyday photography practice. Error images disrupt the conventions of photographic representation and in so doing present an alternate conception of photography as emergent, processual and performative. The error image exposes photography as a human and technological ‘act’ and presents the viewer with a transformative visual experience which has aesthetic interest and value...|$|R
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Idol {{was asked}} if he feared his new {{interest}} in technology would be seen as an attempt to co-opt <b>cyberculture.</b> Idol denied this, stating that his belief in the relevancy of cyberpunk culture was genuine, and that he didn't care what others thought of him. However, the reaction by the majority of the online community was openly hostile and suspicious of Idol's motives. It was reported that his e-mail account on the WELL received mail from angry computer users, and was occasionally flooded with e-mail spam to antagonise him. Idol was also cast by many as a naive, tech-illiterate poseur. The charge of illiteracy was not entirely false, as {{at the time of the}} album's release, Idol was still typing using the [...] "hunt and peck" [...] system, and needed notes to log onto the internet.|$|E
500|$|Well known music critic, Robert Christgau, excoriated what he {{considered}} to be Idol's attempt to co-opt cyberpunk for commercial gain. In particular, he compared Idol's new interest in cyberpunk to the musician's previous co-optation of the punk subculture. [...] "Even if his interest was originally piqued by the dollar signs that appear {{in front of his}} eyes whenever he encounters the magic rune p-u-n-k, that's the fate of any good idea—sooner or later it touches people who have no deep connection to it." [...] However, unlike some critics who asserted Idol had no genuine interest in <b>cyberculture,</b> Christgau assumed he did and that this was to be expected, as many subcultures are eventually adopted by mainstream society. The problem, Christgau asserted, was that Idol had no genuine understanding of the concept, and that ultimately Idol could only [...] " [...] for, over, or with authenticity, a rock obsession [...] always kept at arm's length and never escaped." ...|$|E
500|$|Regardless, Cyberpunk {{is still}} {{seen as having}} been an act of hyped commercialisation. In Escape Velocity: <b>Cyberculture</b> at the End of the Century, Mark Dery commented on the {{mainstreaming}} of the cyberpunk subculture. He viewed Idol as representing {{some of the worst}} abuses this took, deriding Cyberpunk as [...] "a bald-faced appropriation of every cyberpunk cliché that wasn't nailed down." [...] In 1995, when writer Jack Boulware asked [...] "When did cyberpunk die?" [...] at a meeting of former staff members of Mondo 2000, a response was [...] "1993.

[...] In a section on [...] "cyberpunk music", The Cyberpunk Project website notes, [...] "... usual opinion is that Billy Idol's album is just commercialization and {{it has nothing to do}} with cyberpunk." [...] The F.A.Q for alt.cyberpunk, mirrored on the website, rejects the notion that there is a [...] "cyberpunk fashion". Of Billy Idol's attempts to base his fashion and music on it, it states, [...] "No matter how sincere his intentions might have been, scorn and charges of commercialization have been heaped upon him in this and other forums." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{contemporary}} practices of human genomics in the 21 st century are placed alongside the digital {{bodies of the}} 1990 s. The primary aim {{is to provide a}} trajectory of the biodigital as follows: First, digital bodies and biodigital bodies were both part of the spectacular imaginaries of early <b>cybercultures.</b> Second, these spectacular digital bodies were supplemented in the mid- 1990 s by digital bodywork practices that have become an important dimension of everyday communication. Third, the spectacle of biodigital bodies {{is in the process of}} being supplemented by biodigital bodywork practices, through personal or direct-to-consumer genomics. This shift moves a form of biodigital communication into the everyday. Finally, what can be learned from putting the trajectories of digital and biodigital bodies together is that the degree of this communicative shift may be obscured through the doubled attachment of personal genomics to everyday digital culture and high-tech spectacle.

Specifically, authors encourage feminist media scholars to engage with issues of political economy, new ICTs and <b>cybercultures</b> as well as digital media policy, media and identity, sexuality and sexualisation, and postfeminism.

40|$|<b>Cyberculture’s</b> {{influence}} {{in our lives}} and its possible threat to human physical identity is well documented in Harvest. American Virgil, posing as Ginni, seduces and controls the Prakash family. He uses gadgets like the “Contact Module” or the “Video Couch” to disperse identity through “cybernetic circuits”. Both the receiver and the donor assume new identities in the digital arena. Harvest highlights important questions about “digitization” of identities and separation from the physical form. Can a body “vacated” of its owner be claimed by another? How is identity determined if cyberspace can disguise one’s gender, class or race to divest them of their unique markers? Problematization of identity in cyberspace is pivotal to the discourse of postcolonialism. For marginalized bodies identity politics and suffering {{is rooted in the}} physical body. In Harvest, first world exploits the third world via wireless communication and unlimited money. Jaya sustains a postcolonial resistance to such capitalist domination. She claims her body, evocative of her dignity, through the corporeal limitation of death − the postcolonial Other’s triumph in the colonizer’s world of coercion and control...|$|R
500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of <b>Cyberculture</b> {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E

Later sections consider contrasting approaches found in software studies and in a cultural history of the digital industries.

40|$|David Gauntlett, in his {{foreword}} to Japanese <b>Cybercultures,</b> {{notes the}} tendency in the anglophone West to ‘assume {{that people in}} other countries, using other languages, are probably doing things with Internet technology that are pretty similar to those applications we are familiar with’ (Gauntlett, 2003, p. xii; emphasis in the original). However, as that collection goes on to make clear, particularly regarding mobile Internet applications, {{this is not always}} the case. As a researcher with a background in Japanese studies, in an attempt to help undergraduate students think critically about the interrelationship between society, culture and (new) technologies, I try to encourage them to consider that technologies have a history and that the meanings underlying their deployment are highly culture specific. Until recently the (now ubiquitous and quotidian) mobile phone was a helpful example to use. However, this particular technological innovation is becoming increasingly difficult to debate in class, since few students can remember a time before mobile phones and not one grew up in a household (as I did) where the landline telephone was a seldom-used late arrival. (My mother first rented one solely for ‘emergencies’, of which we thankfully had precious few. Accordingly, that original phone set lasted my family for 20 years. ...|$|R

Secondly???are sexual <b>cybercultures</b> a mere reflection of society? Finally??? is it possible that these cultures are shaping and transforming society in entirely new ways? Through conducting a virtual ethnography, this research seeks to further our understanding of how and why individuals create virtual identities, relationships, and lives.
