5|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for tracking down and reporting all <b>communicable</b> diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy {{in the face of}} mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.|$|E
5|$|A newborn in Uttar Pradesh is {{expected}} to live four years fewer than in the neighboring state of Bihar, five years fewer than in Haryana and seven years fewer than in Himachal Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh contributed to the largest share of almost all <b>communicable</b> and noncommunicable disease deaths, including 48 per cent of all typhoid deaths (2014); 17 per cent of cancer deaths and 18 per cent of tuberculosis deaths (2015). After Assam, Uttar Pradesh has India’s second-highest maternal mortality rate, 285 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (2013), with 62 percent of pregnant women unable to access minimum ante-natal care.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new <b>communicable</b> disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although {{some of them were}} living {{in different parts of the}} country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are <b>communicable</b> between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most <b>communicable</b> diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} friend and {{correspondent}} of Eduard Douwes Dekker, who under the pseudonym Multatuli published Max Havelaar, the 1860 satire that exposed colonial corruption in Java; Dekker {{was one of the}} first subscribers to Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Another acquaintance was W. Bosch, chief of the public health services in the colony, who had written critically on the effects of the colonial system on the health of the population, arguing to his superiors that they should help combat poverty, malnourishment, and <b>communicable</b> diseases. Bosch had provided logistical assistance during the events of May 1848, and they remained friends even after van Hoëvell returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{was active}} as a {{researcher}} in the scientific community. After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozoario del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community. He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and <b>communicable</b> diseases. In 1894, {{he returned to the}} Philippines where he took part in an examination to determine who would become the chief chemist of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of <b>communicable</b> language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national {{disaster in the}} aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction wrought by the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of <b>communicable</b> disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E
5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of <b>communicable</b> diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E

25|$|Industrialized cities became deadly {{places to}} live, due to health {{problems}} resulting from overcrowding, occupational hazards of industry, contaminated water and air, poor sanitation, and <b>communicable</b> {{diseases such as}} typhoid and cholera. Factories and slums emerged as regular features of the urban landscape.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, some theologians such as Louis Berkhof {{distinguish}} between the <b>communicable</b> attributes (those that human beings can also have) and the incommunicable attributes (those that belong to God alone). However, others such as Donald Macleod hold that all the suggested classifications are artificial and without basis.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia's main health {{problems}} {{are said to}} be <b>communicable</b> (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 44 million people (more than half the population) {{do not have access to}} clean water. These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.|$|E
25|$|Birds (as well {{as other}} animals) are often tagged with GPS {{tracking}} devices or identification bands to record their movements for animal migration tracking and similar reasons.

25|$|In {{temperate}} countries, chickenpox {{is primarily}} a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It {{is one of the}} classic diseases of childhood, with the highest prevalence in the 4–10-year-old age group. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly <b>communicable,</b> with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In temperate countries, most people become infected before adulthood, and 10% of young adults remain susceptible.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} population stabilized around {{one to one}} and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population. The population decline was primarily the result of <b>communicable</b> diseases, particularly smallpox, introduced during the Columbian Exchange. During the three hundred years of the colonial era, Mexico received between 400,000 and 500,000 Europeans, between 200,000 and 250,000 Africans and between 40,000 and 120,000 Asians. The 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizos.|$|E
25|$|Dual meets {{usually take}} place on evenings during the school week (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight {{allowances}} are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any <b>communicable</b> skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any <b>communicable</b> skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be <b>communicable.</b> The final judgement for whether a wrestler {{would be allowed to}} compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site. In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position {{at the start of the}} second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125lb, 141lb, 157lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133lb, 149lb, 165lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285lb.|$|E
25|$|The 22-acre site of Queens Hospital Center was {{originally}} the Haack farm, {{purchased by the}} city in 1903. The first hospital on the site was the Queensboro Hospital for <b>Communicable</b> Diseases, located east of Parsons Boulevard (then Flushing Avenue). It was designed by architects William E. Austin and George W. Conable, and opened on June 29, 1916. A total of 20 buildings were initially planned for the hospital. A second building was completed in 1923. The first morgue in Queens was opened at the hospital in 1930.|$|E
25|$|In 1492, when a Spanish {{expedition}} {{headed by}} Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus sailed west {{to find a}} new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently found the Americas. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), <b>communicable</b> disease, and ideas between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Queens General Hospital {{opened in}} 1935 {{as the first}} {{municipal}} general hospital in the borough. It would absorb the adjacent Queensboro Hospital for <b>Communicable</b> Diseases shortly after opening, and the campus would later include Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis, which opened in 1941. Queens Hospital Center was formed in 1952 and 1959 with the official merger of the three hospitals along with two other Queens medical facilities. The current campus consists of modern buildings constructed in the 21st century, along with the former Triboro Hospital building.|$|E
25|$|The Port Health Organisation, Chennai, {{functioning}} {{under the}} Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, {{was established in}} 1946 with an objective of preventing entry of yellow fever and other quarantinable and <b>communicable</b> diseases from abroad. Mosquito control in the port area is being undertaken by two agencies, namely, the Chennai Port Trust and the Port Health Organisation. Anti-mosquito measures are undertaken by the Port Trust while the issuance of yellow fever certificates, ship deratting and overall supervision of mosquito control is undertaken by the Port Health Organisation.|$|E
25|$|Springer's {{uncertain}} {{health was}} also a concern; Canadian officials refused to accept an orca with any <b>communicable</b> diseases. Returning Springer to her home waters would require the political, scientific, logistical and financial cooperation of federal agencies and multiple organizations in two countries, {{as well as the}} consent of the First Nations. Capturing and moving an orca risked further stress and injury. Local media continued covering the situation, with advocates demanding immediate government action to save the orca. Public sentiment strongly favored rescue as Springer's health deteriorated and her attraction to boats and people increased.|$|E
