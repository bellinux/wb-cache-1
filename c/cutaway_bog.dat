40|$|O’GORMAN, E. C., KAVANAGH, B. and ROCHFORD,J. : HOME RANGE AND HABITAT USE BY THE ENDANGERED GREY PARTRIDGE (Perdix perdix) IN THE IRISH MIDLANDS: The last {{potentially}} {{viable population}} of native Irish Grey Partridge (Perdix perdix) is located over a 25 km 2 area at Boora bog, Co. Offaly, in the Irish midlands. The habitat is {{a mosaic of}} cutaway bogland, coniferous forestry, newly created farmland and wetlands. Since 1996 a combination of predation control {{and the provision of}} habitat strips {{has been the focus of}} conservation efforts in Boora in an attempt to increase partridge numbers in the short-term. The aim of this study is to provide baseline information on partridge movements and habitat use in the conservation site. The result of two years fieldwork is presented. An area of 18 km 2 was mapped during the course of fielwork. Nine male birds were radio-tracked. The biological time periods (B. T. P.) calculated for breeding pairs were Exploration, Prelay, Lay, Incubation, Brood rearing, Primary and Secondqary covey movements. The home range varied in size and location from one B. T. P. to the next. This was linked to habitat availability. Breeding attempts occurred in young forestry plantations and newly created habitat strips within the <b>cutaway</b> <b>bog</b> area. The coveys left the <b>cutaway</b> <b>bog</b> area in late summer to feed on nerby pasture. A second movement in late Autumn was made to utilise winter stubbles on adjacent farmland. Birds returned to breeding sites in the <b>cutaway</b> <b>bog</b> area the following spring. The practical applications of the findings to the conservation effort are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Bord na Móna {{harvested}} peat at Bellacorick (Oweninny works) in County Mayo between 1961 and 2003. Milled peat was {{harvested from}} an area of over 6, 500 ha of former Atlantic blanket bog and associated habitat types. The peat was supplied to the adjoining peat burning power station at Bellacorick. Peat production ceased in 2003 and a large scale site specific rehabilitation plan was designed and implemented. The main aims of the rehabilitation were to ensure environmental stabilisation of the former industrial peat production area (<b>cutaway</b> <b>bog)</b> and mitigation of silt run-off. A baseline ecology survey of the site was completed in 2001. The rehabilitation work on the <b>cutaway</b> <b>bog</b> {{was carried out in}} phases between 2001 and 2005 and comprised an extensive and comprehensive programme of drain blocking, wetland creation, terracing to mitigate erosion on slopes and silt pond decommissioning. The site was re-surveyed in 2011 and the main changes in vegetation cover and composition between 2001 and 2011 were recorded. The study found that sections of the site where the rehabilitation work allowed for water retention were quick to re-vegetate. Sections of the site where water retention was not possible (slopes and gravel ridges) have been slower to re-vegetate. Vegetation cover has increased across the site, bare peat occupied 53. 3...|$|E
40|$|KAVANAGH, B. P., O 2 ̆ 7 GORMAN,C.,AND BUCKLEY, C. : THE IRISH GREY PARTRIDGE (PERDIX PERDIX) CONSERVATION STRATEGY: AN UPDATE 1995 - 1998. In May 1996 a {{strategy}} {{for the conservation of}} the last remaining population of the Irish Grey partridge was initiated. The strategy is a multipronged approach based on a) predation reduction, b) habitat improvement and c) monitoring of the birds’ response. A full-time game keeper was employed to reduce red fox (Vulpes vulpes), mink (Mustella vison), stoat (Mustella erminea), rat (Rattus norvegicus), grey crow (Corvus corone cornix) and magpie (Pica pica) numbers in a defined study area of 1, 000 hectares of <b>cutaway</b> <b>bog</b> at Boora in County Offaly. The habitatis a mozaic of cutaway bogland, conferous forestry, newly created farmland and wetland. The area contianed 6 - 8 pairs of breeding grey partridge in spring 1996. Bare peat areas within the study area were selected and a mix of either grasser or grains were planted in 0, 2 hectare blocks to provide nesting or chick rearing cover for birds. These plots were neither sprayed or harvested and have been left to develop naturally after planting. Fifteen hectares were planted over two years, 1996 - 97. In spring 1997 a number of male partridges were trapped and fitted with radio collars. Their home range and habitat preferences were recorded continuously for up to ten months. Radio-tracked birds were recorded leaving the keepered area and moving to winter stubble fields on adjoining farmland. Two successful coveys were produced in 1996 which resulted in a autumn count of 27 partridges in the study area. In spring 1997 the population in the study area was again 6 - 8 pairs. Two successful coveys were again produced in 1997 giving an autumn population was 23 birds within the study area. Winter survival in 1997 / 98 was poor. In spring 1998 only 4 - 6 pairs of partridges were found in the study area. Partridge numbers continue to decline both within and outside the study area. The remaining population is now less than 20 breeding pairs in total...|$|E
50|$|Many fine {{examples}} of virgin and <b>cutaway</b> <b>bogs</b> {{are to be}} found throughout the parish. Here you will find the Curlew, Snipe, Skylark and Herons in quiet meditation beside small water pools. The otter, fox and hares make their homes here. In mid-summer the bogs are a blaze of colour with cotton, orchids, ragged robin, cranberries, pitcher plant and mosses.|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, Bord na Móna {{launched}} its first Biodiversity Action Plan. This plan {{set out a}} number of objectives and actions to be carried out over a five-year period 2010 - 2015. It gave an overview of rehabilitation work, natural colonisation projects, and the biodiversity of the company's <b>cutaway</b> <b>bogs.</b> It also highlighted the biodiversity projects in progress and those completed. [...] In 2016, Bord na Móna released a second biodiversity action plan. This subsequent plan was developed to build upon the objectives of the first action plan while also looking to the future of Bord na Móna's peatlands with regard to Bord na Móna's announcement to stop harvesting peat for electricity production by 2030. Speaking about the biodiversity action plans, Bord na Móna's Senior Ecologist, Dr. Catherine Farrell said [...] "We all need to work together in Bord na Móna to ensure the best outcomes for rehabilitation and biodiversity. This will be critical to the delivery of our Biodiversity Action Plans".|$|R
50|$|Peat was {{traditionally}} manually harvested {{by operating}} <b>cutaway</b> <b>bogs.</b> This method (still privately used today) consists of sods being vertically {{cut from the}} side face of a peat deposit. Technology was derived to mechanically cut and remove layers of peat from blanket bogs. Today, equipment is used to remove tonnes of peat each day at suitable times of year (rainfall is a significant variable in peat harvesting). Almost all the peat now harvested is milled peat, scraped {{from the surface of}} the bog by tractor-towed pin millers. The milled peat is ridged into small piles which are then transferred by harvesters into large piles running parallel along the bog. Railways are laid alongside each pile, the pile loaded into trains and the railway lifted and moved to the next pile. This is the 'Peco' method of working. A few bogs use the 'Haku' method whereby the milled peat is loaded into tractor-towed caterpillar-tracked trailers and deposited in a single heap at the edge of the bog adjacent to a railway line. Each year, the network of drainage ditches is deepened by a few inches before the next harvest.|$|R
5000|$|Boora Bog (Irish Portach na Buaraí) is a <b>cutaway</b> peat <b>bog</b> {{situated}} in County Offaly, Ireland. Peat was harvested for fuel between the 1950s and 1970s, {{and the land}} is now being reclaimed for agricultural and eco-tourism use. There was a lake called Lough Boora (Loch na Buaraí), which was drained by Bord na Móna, but was not used for peat production: this area is now maintained as a nature reserve by the Irish Wildlife Trust. [...] There are two angling lakes.|$|R
