25|$|Corman {{financed the}} picture, {{serving as the}} film's uncredited Executive Producer. The budget was $75,000. Shooting began on April 15, 1965, with a {{production}} crew consisting of only seven individuals. During {{the first two days}} of the production, actual shooting was extremely limited due to near-constant rain which caused severe flooding in the areas they had planned to shoot. Hellman estimated that $5,000 of the already small budget was eaten up by the wasted time. Another $10,000 of the budget was for the horse wranglers' salaries, the only union element of the film, apart from the actors. Corman's deal with Hellman and Nicholson was that if the film went over budget, any additional costs would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own pockets. Despite the initial problems, the film was completed for the original budget estimate.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1922, upon {{learning}} that the sub inspector of Chauri Chaura police station assaulted Congress volunteers at Mundera Bazar, an angry mob {{gathered at the}} station, demanding explanation from the guilty official. While the crowd marched on, shouting anti-government slogans, police fired warning shots agitating the crowds further. In response the crowd began throwing stones at the police, who were then ordered to open fire, killing three and wounding several others. The police retreated, some believe {{due to lack of}} ammunition while others attribute it to fear of the angry and courageous crowd. Chaos ensued and the heavily outnumbered police returned to the shelter of Thana (City Hall). The enraged crowd challenged the police to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> den, and on paying no heed, took revenge by setting the Thana on fire, killing 22 officers (including the station officer) who were trapped inside.|$|E

500|$|... hey see, it is said, men {{who have}} been dead for several months, come back to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; so that people can only save {{themselves}} from their dangerous visits and their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, leeches; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.|$|E
500|$|Some {{denizens of}} Chulip only <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> underground, living apartments through {{holes in the}} ground at certain times of the day. If the player looks through these holes, clues are given in regard to {{when they come out}} or when to kiss them. After an NPC comes out of the ground, the player has a very limited {{opportunity}} to give them a kiss. If the player successfully kisses enough NPCs and returns home to sleep, the hero's father will recite his progress and the Lover's Tree will give the player more hearts and an improved reputation if he advances. Secondary to improving his reputation, the player must track down all the pieces to the [...] "Love Letter Set" [...] by traveling throughout Long Life Town. As the story progresses, the player gains access to new areas of the game world via train, which include many more underground residents and hazards. Saving takes place in various bathrooms.|$|E

2500|$|The revolt {{began at}} 2:30 PM when youths began riding {{through the streets}} with weapons, attacking {{government}} buildings and loyalist soldiers. This action provoked the population to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes with light arms and knives, known as [...] "white weapons," [...] {{to join in the}} attack. Such weapons became supplemented with heavier weapons captured from Baath Party forces. The Holy Endowments administration building was the first to be sacked, followed by several others. The rebels also stormed the al-Husseini hospital and took over their wards. Many of the holy Shia shrines immediately became the main headquarters for the insurgency, the main two being the Shrines of Husayn ibn Ali and Al-Abbas ibn Ali.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} border {{demarcation}} continued in February 2013. Russian troops started {{the installation of}} barbed wire barriers to separate the South Ossetian territory {{from the rest of}} Georgia. In some instances, the Georgian residents could not access their plots or <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes because the border of barbed wire runs through or around their property. According to Georgia's Interior Ministry, there was no fencing activities at the administrative border of Georgia’s other breakaway region of Abkhazia, where the Enguri river served as [...] "a natural dividing line", but Russian troops were blocking the pathways to prevent [...] "illegal" [...] movement across the administrative boundary line. The new South Ossetia-Georgia border extended between 50–300 meters beyond the occupation line. By August 2013, an estimated 27 kilometers of barriers had been built.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s Anita Bryant {{became the}} {{spokesperson}} for Florida orange juice, making {{a series of}} television commercials for them. She is also widely known for her strong views against homosexuality, and for her prominent Save Our Children campaign to prevent gay equality by overturning a 1977 Dade County (now Miami-Dade County) human-rights ordinance that prohibited {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation. Bryant led a highly publicized successful campaign to repeal the ordinance waged on what was labeled [...] "Christian beliefs regarding the sinfulness of homosexuality and the perceived threat of homosexual recruitment of children and child molestation." [...] The campaign was the start of an organized opposition to gay rights that spread across the nation and many credit it as a second Stonewall [...] mobilizing LGBT people to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> closets. Jerry Falwell went to Miami to help her and Bryant made the following statements during the campaign: [...] "As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children" [...] and [...] "If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters." [...] In response gay activists countered with the slogan Suck a Fruit for Anita playing on the words to imply that oral sex ("Suck") with other gays ("Fruit") was an appropriate response.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the return}} of Louis XVIII and his court, the Catholic Church again took a {{prominent}} role in the government and city. [...] Government support for the church increased from 12 million livres under Napoleon to 33 million during the Restoration. [...] The government and church together built new churches to replace those demolished during the Revolution and the Directory, and refilled the ranks of the clergy, [...] greatly reduced during the Revolution. [...] Seven hundred new priests were ordained in all of France in 1814; [...] 1,400 in 1821 and 2,350 in 1829. [...] Bishops and archbishops were chosen, as they had been under the Old Regime, based on their family connections with the Regime. Many rules, dropped during the Empire, were brought back into force; [...] all businesses were required to close on Sunday, including the guingettes, [...] or taverns {{on the outskirts of the}} city, where working Parisians were accustomed to spend their Sunday afternoons. [...] Parisians were instructed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes and show reverence when religious processions passed. [...] The church denied religious burials to former revolutionaries and to actors, sometimes leading to riots outside the churches. [...] An English visitor in 1814 was told that forty thousand of the 600,000 Parisians attended church regularly, but wrote: [...] "to judge from the very small numbers we have seen attending the regular service in any of the churches, we should this proportion greatly overrated. Of those whom we have seen there, at least two-thirds have been women above fifty, or girls under fifteen years of age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ester Dean and Dr. Luke {{also worked}} on the album, {{respectively}} writing and producing the other US lead single [...] "Rose Colored Glasses". The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a [...] "tinkling piano" [...] melody and light R beat.|$|E

2500|$|J. des Boulmiers, an {{eyewitness}} to {{a performance of}} Les Fêtes Chinoises wrote: a public square decorated for a festival with, in the background, an amphitheatre on which are seated sixteen Chinese [...] thirty-two are seen on the gradins (stepped tiers) going through a pantomime. As the first group descends, sixteen further Chinese, both mandarins and slaves, <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> habitations [...] All these form eight rows of dancers who, rising and dipping in succession, imitate fairly well the billows of a stormy sea. All the Chinese, having descended, begin a character march. [...] There are a mandarin, borne in a rich palanquin by six white slaves, whilst two negros draw a chariot on which a young Chinese woman is seated. They are preceded and followed {{by a host of}} Chinese playing various musical instruments [...] This march concluded, the ballet begins and leaves nothing to be desired either in the diversity or in the neatness of the figures. It ends in a contredanse of thirty-two persons whose movements trace a prodigious number of new and perfectly designed attitudes, which form and dissolve with the greatest of ease. At the end [...] the Chinese return to their place on the amphitheatre, which is transformed into a china cabinet. Thirty-two vases, which rise up, conceal [...] the thirty-two Chinese one saw before. Considering that most performances (theatrical and ballet) before this took place in either the royal courts or in inn yards, taverns, or pubs, having that many people on the stage at one time was unheard of. However, Lincoln Kirstein adds that it [...] "consisted of dance pictures with little plot, incorporating elements of the real and ideal, including the exotic China of travelers and explorers and the fantastic Cathay of Rococo chinoiserie designers." [...] Furthermore, the costumes were [...] "untraditional"—they were based on Roman armor and had Chinese embellishments on them.|$|E
2500|$|Tomkinson surveys what {{he regards}} as {{historical}} attitudes to hell. He {{says that the}} common manner of pagan writers was {{to see it as}} a place of cleansing and purifying rather than of punishment. A more modern view was that of Jacob Boehme that heaven and hell are within one another. Tomkinson jests, [...] "but of late there is made a new discovery of another world placed in the moon and as habitable as this is." [...] But none of these speculations is correct. Hell will be this earth after the end of time. [...] "I will judge thee in the place thou wast created." [...] "Their iniquity shall be upon their bones." [...] The elect will be quickened to eternal life and the damned will be quickened to their torment. The damned shall <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> graves as worms out of the earth and, after they have seen the elect rise up with Christ to heaven; the sun, stars and moon will cave in aflame. Then there will be blackness within and without as the earth is abandoned by God forever. The life of the damned will be to die forever in a hell that is their own bodies, tormented by the remembrance of sins they can never shake off. [...] "Every evil action will arise afresh in the mind." [...] Tomkinson is poetic, not forgiving. [...] "There will never be any intermission of pain, for as soon as one phial of wrath is drank off, another is presented without stop or stay, coming rolling one upon another, like waves of the sea." [...] This treatment will ensure new blasphemies against God for all eternity. With unusual grimness, Tomkinson remarks that if the reprobate seed [...] "can make shift to disbelieve it, they may have the more ease and time to fit them for the everlasting burning by making their bodies and spirits like a dry thorny hedge, to receive the fury of that fire." ...|$|E
