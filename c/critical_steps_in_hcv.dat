40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of liver disease {{worldwide}} and HCV infection represents a major health problem. HCV associates with host lipoproteins forming host/viral hybrid complexes termed lipoviral particles. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a lipoprotein component that interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) to mediate hepatic lipoprotein uptake, and may likewise mediate HCV entry. We sought to define the functional regions of apoE with an aim to identify critical apoE binding partners involved <b>in</b> <b>HCV</b> infection. Using adenoviral vectors and siRNA to modulate apoE expression we show a direct correlation of apoE expression and HCV infectivity, whereas no correlation exists with viral protein expression. Mutating the HSPG binding domain (HSPG-BD) of apoE revealed key residues that are critical for mediating HCV infection. Furthermore, a novel synthetic peptide that mimics apoE’s HSPG-BD directly and competitively inhibits HCV infection. Genetic knockdown of the HSPG proteins syndecan (SDC) 1 and 4 revealed that SDC 4 principally mediates HCV entry. Our data demonstrate that HCV uses apoE-SDC 4 interactions to enter hepatoma cells and establish infection. Targeting apoE-SDC interactions could be an alternative strategy for blocking <b>HCV</b> entry, a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> maintaining chronic <b>HCV</b> infection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{migration}} of neuronal precursors along radial glial fibers is a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> {{the formation of}} the nervous system. In this report, we show that neuregulin–erbB receptor signaling plays {{a crucial role in the}} {{migration of}} cerebellar granule cells along radial glial fibers. Granule cells express neuregulin (NRG), and radial glia cells express erbB 4 in the developing cerebellum and in vitro. When the glial erbB receptors are blocked, neurons fail to induce radial glia formation, and their migration along radial glial fibers is impaired. Moreover, soluble NRG is as effective as neuron–glia contact in the induction of radial glia formation. These results suggest that the activation of glial erbB 4 by NRG is an early <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the neuronal migration program...|$|R
