5|$|Activated in 2007, {{the unit}} is a modular brigade <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety of actions. Though {{assigned}} to the 1st Infantry Division on a permanent basis, {{it is capable of}} independent operations and taking on subordinate units to fulfill large scale sustainment operations for the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|A {{reported}} {{block on}} player transfers into the club, {{set in place}} by the Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers out would substantially reduce the £39million-per-year wage bill, at first cast doubt on the new manager's efforts to build a squad <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quick return to the Premier League; nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings into the club in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E

50|$|An acid is a {{molecule}} or ion <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> donating <b>a</b> hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H+), or, alternatively, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> forming <b>a</b> covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid).|$|R
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E

5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage {{was similar}} to the M3 Half-track, as it shared the same chassis, engine, {{suspension}}, armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum road speed of 45mph. The power-to-weight ratio was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of three}} {{separate}} sets of valve gear on the 1930 batch eased maintenance and improved the standardisation of parts. The prototype was rebuilt {{to the same}} specification as the 1930 batch, creating a robust workhorse <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good turn of speed when working heavy passenger and freight trains. The revised valve gear layout was subsequently applied to the 3-cylinder U1 and Vclass designs. The relatively early withdrawal of the N1s pre-dated the era of preservationists buying withdrawn locomotives from scrap dealers or British Railways, and consequently no examples of the N1class survived into preservation.|$|E

5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez {{to think of a}} way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E

5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E
25|$|Another export version, {{replacing}} the Hawk 50, intended for conversion and weapons training. Weapons carriage is increased. It is a two-seater, has uprated Rolls-Royce Adour 861 engines, and is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> level speed at altitude of 555 knots (1028km/h) or Mach0.84. The T-45 Goshawk {{was derived from}} this version.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the USSR did {{not develop}} a {{successful}} rocket <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manned lunar mission until the 1980s – their N1 rocket failed {{on all four}} launch attempts between 1969 and 1972. The Soviet LK lunar lander was tested in unmanned low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.|$|E
