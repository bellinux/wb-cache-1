5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of <b>curly</b> <b>maple</b> or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ inches in length.|$|E

Armed with a hatchet {{and a can of}} tree-wound paint he moves among the maples, removing 3 or 4 square inches of bark to a depth exposing the inner growths. Mr. Duffy says the telltale sign of bird's-eye maple is a swirling disordered surface, bumpy and sometimes pitted. <b>Curly</b> <b>maple</b> will reveal itself as an end view of a slice through a wave or ripple running parallel to the ground. Distinctive patterns are usually found in maples in densely wooded sites.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Flame maple (tiger maple), {{also known}} as flamed maple, <b>curly</b> <b>maple,</b> ripple maple, fiddleback or tiger stripe, is a feature of maple in which {{the growth of the}} wood fibers is {{distorted}} in an undulating chatoyant pattern, producing wavy lines known as [...] "flames". This effect is often mistakenly said {{to be part of the}} grain of the wood; it is more accurately called [...] "figure", as the distortion is perpendicular to the grain direction. Prized for its beautiful appearance, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of musical instruments, such as violins and bassoons, and fine furniture. Another well-known use of the material is its use in guitars, especially the venerated Gibson Les Paul. The Gibson Les Paul [...] "Standard", initially manufactured from 1958 to 1960, sported a flame maple top finished in a cherry-red sunburst on a mahogany body. Today, these instruments are some of the most prized on the vintage guitar market, and as such are unaffordable to most musicians.|$|E
5000|$|The first [...] "King Mortone" [...] {{double bass}} {{appeared}} in 1934, when H. N.

The string bass's fronts were made from the finest straight-grain spruce with very close grain quality, {{while the rest of the}} instrument was made of <b>curly</b> <b>maple.</b> Each bass was equipped with an improved geared key mechanism, ensuring rigidity and sensitive tuning. The H. N. White Company claimed that each [...] "King string bass has a greater volume of tone, and carries the vibrations over a longer period of time, than any other string bass ...". During the Second World War production had stopped, but by this point approximately 1200 basses had been made. In 1946 production resumed and continued steadily until 1965, when the string department of H. N. White was sold to Kay Double Basses. By this point approximately 5000 basses had been made. When Kay had control of King Mortone Basses, they stopped production and used the factories to make Kay Double Basses.|$|E
50|$|The top or belly (and {{often the}} back) of the archtop guitar is either {{carved out of}} a block of solid wood, or heat-pressed using either a solid top or laminations, the latter being a less {{expensive}} construction method. The belly normally has two f-holes, the lower of these partly covered by a scratch plate raised above the belly {{so as not to}} damp its vibration. The arching of the top and the f-holes are similar to the violin family, on which they were originally based. The contours of the arching profile are usually derived in an ad hoc fashion. The tops of Gibson's archtops were parallel braced. X-braced designs were introduced later, giving a tone closer to that of a flat-top guitar. Sitka spruce, European spruce, and Engelmann spruce are most often used for the resonant tops of archtop guitars, although some guitar builders use Adirondack spruce (Red spruce), or Western red cedar. Archtop guitars often have <b>Curly</b> <b>maple</b> or Quilted maple backs. Full-sized archtops are among the largest guitars ever made, with the width of the lower bout in some cases approaching 19 inches (47 cm).|$|E
5000|$|Paul Reed Smith was {{a guitar}} player who began {{building}} guitars {{while he was}} in college in the mid-1970s. Early guitar players to use his hand-built guitars were Stanley Whitaker (of Happy The Man), Derek St. Holmes (of Ted Nugent's band) and Howard Leese (then with Heart), but Smith's big break came when Carlos Santana began playing the still hand-built guitars, which at the time looked like a Gibson Les Paul with a double cut-away and were made of expensive woods like <b>curly</b> <b>maple.</b> He used the custom as a prototype to raise orders on the road worth nearly $300,000. Smith set up a partnership with his wife Barbara and businessman Warren Esanu, and set up a factory in Virginia Avenue, Annapolis. Smith produced 20 guitars for the 1985 NAMM Show (those guitars are now known as the [...] "NAMM 20"), and managed to find a niche in the guitar market: the mid-1980s was the time of the Superstrat, and there was little competition for the higher-quality, upscale guitars PRS was building, guitars with [...] "an elegant, modern, vintage-inspired design--the kind of guitar one might have expected Fenders and Gibsons to evolve into".|$|E
40|$|Stringed {{instruments}} {{are made of}} high quality wood species from physical, mechanical and acoustical point of view, being carefully selected, kiln dried and processed under specific conditions that assure micro-structural integrity. Maple wood (Acer Pseudoplatanus) for musical instruments is used to getting back plates and sides for string instruments (violin family). This species of wood is valued for both acoustic qualities but mostly for aesthetic, using a natural defect of maple wood characterized by wavy grain. The paper presents the research on visco-elasticity behavior of maple wood with different types of grain deviation in wood from very <b>curly</b> <b>maple</b> to common maple. The storage modulus, loss modulus, damping capacity in varying temperature conditions and for different loading frequencies were determined using dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA). It was found that specimens characterized by very wavy grain shows a high damping capacity of frequency range between 33. 33 to 50 Hz, unlike specimens of common maple which {{do not have the}} capacity of frequency selectivity...|$|E
