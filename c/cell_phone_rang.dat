50|$|While {{prosecution}} {{provided evidence}} against Cellini during Levine's testimony, Levine's credibility was called into question. Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Niewoehner, Levine gave mostly monotone answers about malfeasance while {{he served on}} the board at the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System- TRS. At one point on the stand, Levine became flustered when his <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and he struggled to silence it. Levine finally handed it over to Niewoehner.|$|E
50|$|On January 11, 2001, a {{resident}} spotted a large bag deposited in {{a garbage can}} on Shomrei Emunim Street. She called over her brother, a 36-year-old father of five who studies in a neighborhood yeshiva. He opened the bag and saw a bomb connected to a cell phone with wires. He detached the wires from the cell phone and then called police. While police were examining the bomb, which consisted of two mortar shells, the <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang,</b> but the connection had been severed. This was the second of four attempted bombings {{in the vicinity of}} Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael over a two-month period.|$|E
50|$|Smadi was {{provided}} with a fake bomb by FBI agents posing as members of al-Qaeda. He placed the device in the parking garage under the building and activated it with a cell phone. Instead of setting off a bomb, the <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> a phone number at the FBI offices. Smadi pleaded guilty to attempted use of {{a weapon of mass}} destruction. Under the terms of a plea bargain, an additional charge of bombing a public place was dropped, and a sentence of not more than 30 years was recommended. On October 20, 2010, he was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment. He will be deported from the United States after serving his sentence.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consistent}} electricity in the ashram, the guru uses modern technology to maintain a connection to those who cannot seek him out in person. During our conversation, his <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> with a melodious ringtone of a bhajan (a hymn celebrating devotion to the guru). The sant glanced at his followers {{with a smile and}} answered the phone. Since the phone was on speaker, it was easy to make out the voice and tone of the caller. Within an hour’s time, he had received about three phone calls from men and women with various queries: some devotees in Bihari dialect asked for his blessings for specific occasions (starting first day of college, marriage of daughter). Others in literate Hindi called for consultation with serious predicaments (job loss, the conflict arising from a son’s decision to marry a woman of a different caste). The guru patiently listened to the callers and told them to trust the will of the Supreme and to meditate on Sadguru Maharaj (he addresses his own guru in this way). The calm and serenity of the ashram’s meditative environment was often interrupted by the ringtone of the bhajan summoning another query or problem from a devotee, who considers the guru’s advice as a Divine command. By virtue of his persona of the sādhu, each day the guru negotiates the boundaries of sacred and secular problems as well as other–worldly profound discourses through his incorporation of technologies like cell phones.|$|E
