40|$|Congress {{has sought}} {{to address the issue}} of {{transitional}} economies through the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which is supposed to provide workers and their communities with advance notice of a shutdown. With advance notice, workers can then plan for the closure and avail themselves of the transitional type services available under other programs. By this theory, then, WARN might be viewed as a stepping stone in the direction of a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>employment</b> policy. This, however, presupposes that the states administering other programs through their Dislocated Worker Units (DWU) are actually receiving accurate information closures and compliance with WARN in their jurisdiction. In this paper, I examine WARN both in theory and in practice. Data drawn from surveys conducted of DWUs suggests that the information we have about closure, its impact, and WARN is uneven, and therefore does not easily lend itself to a clear policy path. plant closure, WARN, transitional economies, displacement, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>employment</b> policy,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of nontraditional {{training}} on the occupational attainment of economically disadvantaged women. Using a logit model of occupational attainment, we found that women who received nontraditional training under the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Employment</b> and Training Act (CETA) were much less likely than their male counterparts to be employed in male-dominated occupations, and also received somewhat lower hourly wages. These results suggest that nontraditional training alone may not be an effective way of reducing the occupational segregation of low-income women. ...|$|R

WOW’s up-and-coming program the Women’s Work Force Network, a network established in 1977 composed of women’s employment programs nationwide, was a key player in the effort made to include sex-equity language in public employment and training legislation of CETA.
