Biomaterials are widely used for dental implants, orthopedic devices, <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and <b>catheters.</b> One of the main concerns on using bio-implants is the risk of infection on the materials used. In this study, our aim is to quantify the effect of controlled surface roughness on the infection resistance of the titanium based bio-materials which are commonly used for orthopedic devices and dental implants. To modify the surface roughness of the surfaces in a controlled manner, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) technique, which is extensively used in semiconductor industry for the planarization of the interlayer dielectrics and metals, is utilized. To determine the infection resistance of the created films with varying surface roughness, bacteria growth response was studied on titanium plates after CMP. European Commissio...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study is to quantify the risk of lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients requiring temporary transvenous femoral pacing and {{to evaluate the use}} of different enoxaparin dosages (prophylactic or therapeutic) for thrombus prevention. Transvenous temporary <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker,</b> with <b>catheters</b> frequently used along the femoral vein is useful to relieve difficult bradyarrythmias and some tachyarrythmias. Up to one-third of patients receiving transfemoral pacing develop asymptomatic DVT. At present, there are no recommendations for thrombus prophylaxis in these patients. Besides, the efficacy in this specific condition has not been studied. Methods: Sixty consecutive patients who underwent transvenous femoral pacing and had no contraindication to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy were divided into 3 groups each group consisted of 20 patients. Group I received prophylactic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg/day; subcutaneously), group II received therapeutic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg/day every 12 hours; subcutaneously), and group III consisting of patients who were not treated with enoxaparin was considered as control group. Patients were evaluated daily for clinical features of DVT. Color Doppler sonography imaging was performed on both lower limbs of all patients within 24 hours after removal of the temporary pacemakers. Results: Of the sixty patients, two who belonged to group III, had definitive evidence of right lower limb DVT by color Doppler sonography. These two cases of DVT were asymptomatic and had thrombosis of femoral vein. No evidence of thrombus was detected in contra lateral lower limb. No DVT was detected among patients who received prophylactic or therapeutic doses of enoxaparin. No heparin related complications were detected in this study. There were {{no significant difference in the}} clinical characteristics among 2 groups (I, II) and control group. Correlations of age and gender with occurrence of DVT were not significant (P= 0. 512, 0. 737). Conclusions: This study showed that DVT is a common complication of femoral pacing, and that its incidence can be reduced with the use of prophylaxis and therapeutic intravenous enoxaparin...|$|R
40|$|The {{transistorized}} implanted pacemaker {{is proving}} to be an effective and reliable method for long-term pacing of the heart. All patients suffering from Stokes-Adams seizures were first given a trial period of conservative therapy, including isoproterenol (Isuprel), ephedrine, atropine and steroids. Twenty-four pacemaker implants were performed on 23 patients over a 21 -month period. The preoperative insertion of a <b>pacemaker</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheter</b> was a very valuable safety precaution. In this way the heart could be safely and reliably paced during the period of preoperative assessment and during the critical periods of anesthetic induction and thoracotomy. Infection did not occur, probably because of careful gas sterilization of the units. Various models of pacemakers are compared, and the reasons for two pacemaker failures are presented. There were two early deaths and one late death in the series. The relationship of progressive coronary disease to recent infarction is stressed. Patients having intermittent heart block frequently showed the picture of “competing pacemakers” postoperatively, but without deleterious effect. Twenty patients, between 54 and 88 years of age, are alive and well at the time of reporting, with excellent pacemaker response and no further Stokes-Adams attacks...|$|R

40|$|Batteries used in Implantable cardiac pacemakers-present unique {{challenges}} to their developers and manufacturers {{in terms of}} high levels of safety and reliability. In addition, the batteries must have longevity to avoid frequent replacements. Technological advances in leads/electrodes have reduced energy requirements by two orders of magnitude. Microelectronics advances sharply reduce internal current drain concurrently decreasing size and increasing functionality, reliability, and longevity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the possible effect of cellular radio on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in elevators. We previously investigated pacemaker EMI in elevator by examining the E-field distribution of horizontal plane at the height of expected for implanted pacemakers inside elevators. In this paper, we introduce our method for estimating EMI impact to implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> using EMF distributions inside the region of the human body in which pacemakers are implanted. Simulations of a human phantom in an elevator are performed and histograms are derived from the resulting EMF distributions. The computed results of field strengths are compared with a certain reference level determined from experimentally obtained maximum interference distance of implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> This enables us to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the EMI impact to pacemakers by cellular radio transmission. This paper uses a numerical phantom model developed based on an European adult male. The simulations evaluate EMI on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in three frequency bands. As a result, calculated E-field strengths are sufficiently low to cause the pacemaker to malfunction in the region examined...|$|R

Overexpression of SHOX 2 during ESC differentiation upregulated the pacemaker gene program, resulting in enhanced automaticity in vitro and induced biological pacing upon transplantation in vivo. The accentuated automaticity is accompanied by temporally evolving changes in the effectors and regulators of Wnt signaling.
