The experiment was conducted in complete randomized design in four replicates during four years experiment under glasshouse conditions. The assessment of the fruits and production traits of androgenic genotypes was performed according to instructions given in Descriptor for Capsicum spp. by IPGRI, AVRDC and CATIE. The fruits of androgenic genotypes KK 1 and KK 2 were characterized as long and triangular, large-size medium-fleshy pepper fruit. KK 1 is evaluated as medium-yielding, KK 2 as low-yielding genotype. Fruits of both genotypes are suitable for fresh consumption and processing. The fruits of F 5 and F 7 were evaluated as bellshaped, large-size peppers with very thin pericarp, while F 6 as blocky-elongated, large-size fruit. All three androgenic genotypes are estimated as medium-yielding. Androgenic genotypes KK 1 and KK 2 differ from the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> for four fruit traits.

The decisive data characterising the variety were: the height of the elongation, formation of the lateral fruiting spurs, number of flowers and the amount of harvested fruit. No less important for growth was the health condition of the leaf area and particularly the incidence of fungus diseases; here the monitoring was carried out on six dates and was focused on apple scab and powdery mildew of apple. Infestation of the variety Charlotte with powdery mildew of apple was significantly heavier than infestation of the other varieties. The variety Charlotte was also significantly more affected with apple scab and differed from the other less infested varieties. The highest number of ripe fruit was produced by the variety Polka; significantly less fruit was produced by the varieties Bolero, Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Waltz.

40|$|The area of {{cultivated}} land used for organic farming expands every year, as does consumer demand for organic food. Organic farming is a system of land cultivation without chemical inputs, because chemicals can have a negative {{impact on the}} environment, human health as well as health of farm animals. An important part of organic farming are also various sowing methods based on the alternation of a broad range of different crops. Dinkel wheat (Triticum spelta, also known as spelt or hulled wheat), is ideally suited for this system, as it is less demanding in terms of external environmental conditions than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, also known as common wheat. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to gain insight {{about the impact of}} the seeding rate on the yield and the consequent profit from dinkel wheat in organic farming. A second objective was to evaluate any differences in the values of selected quality indicators of grain, depending on the seed rate. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results, to choose the seeding rate which proved to be ideal in given conditions. The results of our experiments with selected genotypes of spring and winter dinkel wheat and control varieties of bread wheat sown in different seeding rates (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 germinable seeds per m 2) in the organic way of farming in the Research Station in Prague - Uhříněves show that the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had a peak of offsetting almost a month later, in comparison with the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> of spring bread wheat. Winter genotypes of dinkel wheat had this peak of offsetting approximately two weeks later than the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> of winter bread wheat. Both dinkel wheat and the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> of bread wheat from low seeding rates (1. 0 and 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha) offset more as expected, and simultaneously achieved a higher average weight of dry aboveground biomass and biomass of the roots per plant than plants of high seeding rates (4. 0 and especially 5. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). The evaluated genotypes of dinkel wheat compared to the control varieties of bread wheat were generally characterized by intense offsetting, higher weight of dry aboveground biomass, and especially higher weight of dry matter of roots per plant. Achieved yields were negatively influenced by the course of weather conditions, especially by the drought throughout most of the vegetation period in 2015 - spring varieties of wheat, however, were affected by the drought far more than winter wheat. Based on the resulting yields, we can say that in our experiment the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had the highest yields in the seeding rate of 4. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha, for winter dinkel wheat the best seeding rate was 3. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha (however, variety of Rubiota had a high yield already with the seeding rate of 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). To specify the information, it is needed to obtain results from more years. From the evaluated genotypes, the yield of white spring dinkel wheat slightly outperformed the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> of bread wheat Granny and in particular the second genotype of dinkel wheat, T. spelta KEW. In the case of winter varieties, the yield of dinkel wheat Alkor outperformed the second variety of winter dinkel wheat Rubiota as well as the <b>control</b> <b>variety</b> of bread wheat Penalta. The evaluation of qualitative parameters showed that genotypes of dinkel wheat outperformed the control varieties of bread wheat, especially in the content of N-substances and wet gluten content in grain dry matter. Both spring genotypes of dinkel wheat also achieved very good results in the Zeleny sedimentation test - both exceeded the minimum value required from wheat for bakeries (30 ml). Also winter varieties of dinkel wheat Rubiota exceeded this limit. The number of decrease was high in the evaluated varieties of winter wheat, while spring wheat was negatively affected by sprouting due to the rainy weather just before the harvest.

40|$|Wheat genetic {{resources}} may be grown in organic farming systems or in less favourable areas for bread wheat species. Characteristics of hulled wheat species (23 varieties of einkorn, emmer wheat, spelt wheat) were studied and evaluated within a two-year trial period (which was executed on certified organic fields) {{and they were}} compared to characteristics of landraces and modern bread wheat varieties. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the potential uses of {{genetic resources}} of wheat in organic farming. The hulled wheat species were resistant to mildew and brown rust. Their grains were less contaminated with DON than the grains of the <b>control</b> <b>varieties.</b> The grain yield rate was reduced.
