40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the following skill based parallel service queue-ing system: Customers are of types C = {c 1,. [...] , cI }, servers are of types S = {s 1,. [...] , sJ }, {{and there is a}} bipartite graph G of <b>compatiblities</b> between C, S. The graph has arc (i, j) ∈ G if server type sj has the skill to serve customer type ci. Customers arrive in independent Poisson streams of rates λi, and have absolutely continuous patience distributions Fi. There are nj servers of type sj, and the service times are customer-server-type dependent, the service of a customer of type ci by a server of type sj has a random duration distributed as Gij, with average mij. We use the terminology of queueing theory throughout, but this type of system, with minor modifications, is useful in modeling call centers, manufacturing systems, organ transplants, multimedia servers, and cloud computing [8]. Performance of such systems is highly dependent on the operating policy. We focus here on first come first served (FCFS), where a server is assigned to the longest waiting compatible customer, coupled with assign longest idle server (ALIS), where a customer is assigned to the compatible server that has been idle for the longest time. FCFS-ALIS is widely used, because it is fair to both customers and servers, it is simple to implement, it requires little information about the parameters and {{the current state of the}} system, and it is robust under time varying conditions. Our goal here is to develop a structured method to support the design and efficient operation of skill based parallel service systems under FCFS. At this level of generality such systems are highly intractable, no analytic results are expected, and asymptotics, e. g. using many server scaling are called for [12, 10, 7, 13].

This paper proposes a new method {{based on the}} Hopfield neural network for optimizing the wordwidth in the control memory of a microprogrammed digital computer. We present two methodologies, viz., the maximum clique approach, and a cost function based method to minimize an objective function. The maximum clique approach albeit being near O(1) in complexity, is limited in its use for small problem sizes, since it only partitions the data based on the compatibility between the microoperations, and does not minimize the cost function. We thereby use this approach to condition the data initially (to form <b>compatiblity</b> classes), and then use the proposed second method to optimize on the cost function.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} numerous examples of cell-cell interactions {{that are involved}} in the immune response. A striking feature of many of these events is the requirement for genetic <b>compatiblity</b> at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 between the participating cells. This requirement was initially seen as a need for genetic identity at the MHC locus. This concept lead to a model in which signals were passed between cells by cell interaction structures, one on the cell giving and one on the cell receiving the signal (1 - 3). Later work demonstrated that the need for genetic identity was not an absolute condition (4), and it now seems clear that many, but perhaps not all, of these requirements are a consequence of the nature of T cell specificity and the need to recognize self MHC as well as the foreign antigen (5, 6). It would appear that pre-T cells that recognize selfMHC are selected in the thymus and develop into the functional population of peripheral T cells.

40|$|Introduction: Antibiotics are {{regarded}} as one of the most widely consumed drugs, which have abundantly contributed to the treatment of diseases, though their incorrect prescription as well as indiscriminate use can cause such complications as drug resistance and failure in patients’ treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the pattern of prescribing antibiotics in surgical wards of Shahid Rahnemon Hospital compared to standard Methods. Methods: This is an analytical study conducted on 154 patients undergoing surgey in 4 surgery wards (General surgery, urology, neurosurgery and orthopedics) of Shahid Rahnemon hospital in Yazd in 2015. In order to glean the study data, a researcher-made data collection form was applied. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver- 19) applying descriptive statistics (frequency and perrentage) and Chi-square test. Results: 24 % of patients had consumed Ceftriaxone, 72. 1 % Keflin and 3. 9 % had recievd Cefazolin. The prescribed dose results showed 87 % of compatibility with the guidelines. Regarding the prescription method, 86. 4 % <b>compatiblity</b> was reported with the guidelines. In total, 68. 8 % of the prescribed antibiotics were matched with managed care instruction of number (8) in terms of their type. Conclusion: The present study findings revealed that in 68. 8 % of the operations, the prescribed antibiotics were compatible with the guidelines in all the cases.

In this paper, we focus on left dipterous (resp. right dipterous) algebras which are associative algebras with an extra left (resp. right) module on themselves and look for good triples were As is replaced by the dipterous operad Dipt. Since the work of Loday and Ronco, the triple of operads (As, Dipt, B_∞) endowed with the semi-Hopf compatibility relations is known to be good. In this paper, we prove that the triple of operads (As, Dipt, Grove) endowed with the so-called (nonunital) semi-infinitesimal compatibility relations is good. For that, explicit constructions of the free dipterous algebra and the free grove-algebra over a K-vector space V are given. These constructions turn out to be related to rooted planar trees and the little an large Schroeder numbers. Many examples of dipterous algebras are given, notably the free L-dipterous algebras. As a corollary of our results, we also recover that the triple of operads (2 As, Dipt, Vect) endowed both with the unital semi-Hopf and with the unital semi-infinitesimal compatibility relations is good, where 2 As denotes the operad of 2 -associative algebras. We also open this paper on a good triple, related to the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra in quantum field theory, (Com, Dipt, Prim_Com Dipt) endowed with the Hopf compatibility relations and also present a general theorem giving good triples from entangled dipterous like operads named associative molecules.

Then the working process of the detectors has been talked based on the properties of InGaAs and the theory of MSM structure. The main parameters and the measures for improving the performance have been proposed. Based on the above, the InGaAs-MSM photodetector has been designed as follows. The lattice matched InP is used as the substrate. 1000 nm InGaAs is designed as the astive layer and buffer layers are designed {{on both sides of the}} active layer.

[URL] Taverna 2. 5. 0 includes additional functionality (interaction service, PROV support, components), a simplified installation, user interface improvements and bug-fixes. Simplified Installation To simplify installation on common operating systems, Taverna distributions now come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment from OpenJDK and, {{in the case of the}} Workbench, the required Graphviz binaries. The installation no longer requires you to install the JCE Strong Encryption policy. Domain-specific versions Taverna Workbench and Command Line Tool are now available in domain-specific versions for Astronomy, Biodiversity, Bioinformatics and Digital Preservation. Domain-specific editions add support for specific service types and come pre-populated with lists of available services and example workflows that are specifically tailored for a given domain. The Core edition contains a Taverna Workbench suitable for building scientific workflows in any domain, accessing general services such as REST or SOAP Web services and command line tools. Enterprise Taverna is equivalent to the Core edition with BioMart,BioMoby, SoapLab, API Consumer, Service Catalogue and WebDAV installed. Interaction service The Interaction Service has been added to the Workbench. This provides the ability to ask questions and tell information users during the running of the workflow. Unlike the previous interactive local workers, this service uses web pages, and therefore also works when running workflows on a Taverna Server via Taverna Player. Component service The Component capability has been added. This allows the usage of component services, which encapsulate a nested Taverna workflow that has been constructed and described for <b>compatiblity</b> with other components within a chosen Component Family. This allows for publication of reusable and shareable workflow fragments, which appear as single services within the master workflow. Provenance Support for exporting Taverna-PROV provenance format has been added. This adds a new button “Save Provenance Bundle” when clicking “Save All” from the results perspective. The provenance bundle is a ZIP file containing all input, output and intermediate values as separate files, along with the provenance of the workflow run. The bundle is based on the Research Object Bundle specification, and complies with the W 3 C PROV-O provenance specification. For details, see [URL] Tutorials and examples Tutorials for Taverna are available under the Taverna 2. x documentation. Example workflows can be found under the Starter pack tab in the myExperiment perspective of the Workbench. They can also be downloaded from the myExperiment Web site.
