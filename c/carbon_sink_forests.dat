Forest carbon offsets transacted between GHG emitters in industrialised countries and sellers in developing countries have emerged as a useful climate policy tool. A model is developed that investigates the role of incentives in forestry carbon sequestration contracts. It considers the optimal design of contracts to ensure landowner participation and hence, permanence in <b>forest</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks</b> in a context of uncertain opportunity costs and incomplete contract enforcement. The optimal contract is driven by the quality of the institutional framework in which the contract is executed, in particular, as it relates to contract enforcement. Stronger institutional frameworks tend to distort the seller 2 ̆ 019 s effort upwards away from the full enforcement outcome. This also leads to greater amounts of carbon sequestered and higher conditional payments made to the seller. Further, where institutions are strong, there is a case for indexing the payment to the carbon market price if permanence is to be ensured. That is, as the carbon price increases, the payment could be raised and vice versa...|$|R

Century-scale {{ecological}} processes and their legacy effects require accounting for forest management when studying today's <b>forest</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>Forest</b> management reconstructions {{that are used to}} drive land surface models are one way to quantify the impact of both historical and today's large scale application of forest management on today's forest-related <b>carbon</b> <b>sink</b> and surface climate. In this study we reconstruct European forest management from 1600 to 2010 making use of diverse approaches, data sources and assumptions. Between 1600 and 1828, a demand-supply approach was used in which wood supply was reconstructed based on estimates of historical annual wood increment and land cover reconstructions. For the same period demand estimates accounted for the fuelwood needed in households, wood used in food processing, charcoal used in metal smelting and salt production, timber for construction and population estimates. Comparing estimated demand and supply resulted in a spatially explicit reconstruction of the share of forests under coppice, high stand management and forest left unmanaged. For the reconstruction between 1829 and 2010 a supply-driven back-casting method was used. The method used age reconstructions from the years 1950 to 2010 as its starting point. Our reconstruction reproduces the most important changes in forest management between 1600 and 2010 : (1) an increase of 593 000 km 2 in conifers at the expense of deciduous forest (decreasing by 538 000 km 2), (2) a 612 000 km 2 decrease in unmanaged forest, (3) a 152 000 km 2 decrease in coppice management, (4) a 818 000 km 2 increase in high stand management, and (5) {{the rise and fall of}} litter raking which at its peak in 1853 removed 50 Tg dry litter per year...|$|R

Land use and land cover change data (60 -m spatial resolution) derived from sequential remotely sensed Landsat imagery were used to generate 960 -m resolution land cover change maps for the Piedmont ecoregion. These maps were used in the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) to simulate ecosystem carbon stock and flux changes from 1971 to 2010.

It is critical to identify the fundamental constraints on forest productivity to addressing these constraints with modern genomic tools. Nitrogen availability extremely low in forest ecosystems, and consequently, forest trees have evolved adaptive mechanism and biotic interactions to guarantee the strict economy of this essential nutrient. Nitrogen assimilation and recycling {{play a key role in}} the tree growth and biomass production and we firmly believe that knowledge on nitrogen metabolism will lead to approaches aimed at increasing forest productivity. In our laboratory, we are interested in studying nitrogen metabolism and its regulation the conifer maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), a forest tree species of great economic and ecological importance in the Mediterranean area and relevant model for conifer genomic research in Europe.
