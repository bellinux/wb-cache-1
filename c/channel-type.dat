5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that <b>channel-type</b> transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning and}} painful sensations {{associated}} with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, {{as a member}} of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). First cloned in 1997, TRPV1 is an ion <b>channel-type</b> receptor. TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.|$|E

This paper {{illustrates}} the work presented in ‘Part I’, giving additional examples {{of use of}} <b>channel-types,</b> extended rendezvous and FORKs that lean towards real applications.

40|$|Bone {{turnover}} {{is regulated}} by a cocktail of hormones and signalling factors controlling key cell {{processes such as}} proliferation, differentiation, mineralisation and apoptosis. Disruption to the overall mineralisation-resorption balance leads to bone disorders, such as osteoporosis - a 'silent' disease affecting around 7 million people in England and Wales. Ion channels that are presumed targets for bone signalling factors include voltage-gated K channels, ATP-dependent K channels and transient receptor potential TRP channels, and several of these <b>channel-types</b> reportedly have roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation in various tissues. This Thesis shows that human osteoblasts express a number of channels in these families, including maxi-K, ATP-dependent K channels, TRPV 1 and TRPM 7. The maxi-K channel, displaying characteristic electrophysiological hallmarks, is abundant in patch-clamp recordings of primary human osteoblasts implying a functional role, and the Katp agonist pinacidil is shown to promote osteoblast proliferation. Electrophysiological evidence for the TRPVI channel is not found, although the mRNA signal for a TRPVI splice variant TRPVlb may provide an answer, as it renders the channel less sensitive to capsaicin and protons. However, Ca imaging indicates that osteoblastic TRPV 1 channels allow Ca 2 influx, and are sensitive to 1 µM capsaicin and protons. In functional studies the TRPVI ligands capsaicin and capsazepine do not influence mineralisation, but interestingly the TRPVI agonists capsaicin, resiniferatoxin and anandamide appear to prevent differentiation of osteoblastic pre-cursor cells to adipocytes, and instead encourage maturation along the osteoblast pathway, whilst TRPV 1 antagonists do not affect adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, a number of K channels and the TRPV 1 channel are expressed in osteoblasts and may have important putative roles in osteoblast cell function. Further steps are required to confirm this before the channels can be considered targets for drug development to treat bone disorders. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The Soviet-designed RBMK-1500 reactor was originally the most powerful reactor {{in the world with}} an electrical power capacity of 1,500 megawatts (MW) and thermal power capacity of 4,800 MW, but this distinction was later superseded by other nuclear reactors elsewhere. After the Chernobyl disaster of April 1986 the reactor was de-rated to 1,360 MW. These are of a similar type of reactor (RBMK-1000) as at the Chernobyl power plant, hence the European Union's insistence on closing them.

The depths of postglacial channel lakes in the Kashubian Lake District are achieving a depth between 20-40 metres and the width with an average from 200 up to 1500 metres (on average about 600 metres). The length of single funnel-like lakes fluctuates from 1 km up to 24 km. The inclinations of the slopes reach in places up to 40 °. Single funnel-like lakes often link with river systems e.g. Raduńskie Lakes.

This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, popularly known as bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
