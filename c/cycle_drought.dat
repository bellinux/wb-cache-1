40|$|It {{is now a}} well {{established}} fact that corn (Zea mays) originated in Mexico and that {{a great part of}} the evolution that may be observed in terms of this plant’s genetic variability took place in this country. 2 As the plant’s history unfolded, early forms of these races were taken by people into a wide variety of environments and ecological niches from which many distinct varieties developed in the relative isolation of these separated regions. Thus, Mexico also became a center of genetic diversity for corn, and its stock of germplasm has contributed in a decisive manner to global production of corn. Even the dented varieties of the U. S. Corn Belt are close descendants of the first Mexican landraces. The germplasm resources that are deposited in Mexico’s corn varieties, {{as well as in the}} wild relatives of this crop, are of prime importance for the world’s food production system of the next century. 3 Corn germplasm of Mexican origin has played a critical role in improvements for corn cultivated in tropical regions in relation to yield increments, plague resistance, short growth <b>cycle,</b> <b>drought</b> resistance and increases of protein content of grain.

During a second <b>cycle</b> of <b>drought,</b> xeric ecotype seedlings from N. E. Washington, both in the growth room and nursery environments, delayed the initiation of stomatal closure until they reached greater levels of plant moisture stress than in the first <b>drought</b> <b>cycle.</b> There was no apparent change in the stonatal behavior of the mesic ecotype seedlings during a second <b>cycle</b> of <b>drought.</b> In both ecotypes, during the first <b>drought</b> <b>cycle,</b> a sharp increase in ABA content occurred simultaneous with the increase in leaf resistance within a narrow water potential range. However, after rewatering, high leaf resistances were not concurrent with high ABA content. In xeric ecotypes a threshold level of moisture stress again triggered an increase in ABA content, but leaf resistances remained low. The change in stomatal response induced by previous stress could not be explained by altered ABA levels. In mesic ecotypes in the growth room, ABA levels remained high after rewatering and slowly decreased with time, although recovery of pre-stress leaf resistance was mainly complete two days after rewatering.

40|$|Cassava is {{attacked}} by a complex of arthropod pests across the tropical {{regions of the world}} where the crop is grown. Root yield losses have been recorded for several pests, including mites, mealybugs, whiteflies, hornworm, lacebugs, thrips and burrower bugs. Agronomic characteristics such as vegetative propagation, a long growth <b>cycle,</b> <b>drought</b> tolerance, staggered planting dates and intercropping contribute to the considerable diversity of pests that feed on the crop. The dynamics of cassava production are evolving as trends in the food, feed and industrial starch sector are leading to an increased demand for high quality starches. The resulting shift to larger scale production units, expansion of cultivated area and modifications in crop management combined with the effects of climate change, especially warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, affect the occurrence and dynamics of arthropod pests in cassava agro ecosystems. Data is presented to describe the effects of temperature and dry seasons on key pest species. Whiteflies, mites and mealybugs register a suitability increase in the same areas in South America: Northeastern Brazil, Northern Argentina, South-Central Bolivia, and Southwest Peru. In Africa increases are projected in Southeast Africa and Madagascar. In Asia, regions with greater projected suitability for these pest species are Coastal India and Southeast Asia.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of wheat in arid regions is an economically risky undertaking, mainly of fluctuating rainfall distribution and alternative dry spells throughout the growing season. Statistical analysis previously carried out shows the rainfall season usually starts in December and ceases in April, {{the reason the}} wheat crop is planted during the month November/December and harvested {{during the month of}} June {{in the northern part of}} Algeria. Although the wheat is a relatively drought –resistant crop, it may be sensitive to the random effects of severe drought conditions. According to its occurrence during the <b>cycle,</b> <b>drought</b> may be decisive on the final production quantity and quality. This study is an attempt to estimate reductions in wheat yields caused by drought. Acting from soil-plant-atmosphere interactions, impact of water deficit on wheat yield can be estimated for each of the main growing stages. To lessen the effects of drought and maximize results, we adjusted better to the wheat growing season by selecting three useful sowing dates. A means of assessing the effects of drought on the yield of wheat is of considerable interest to agronomist in the prospect of climate change adaptation. The simulation was conducted in ten consecutive agricultural years (1989 - 1998), for three locations characterizing the semi-arid climate in north western Algeria, by using CROPWAT software which incorporates the distribution of rainfall over the growing season.

Unfortunately, due to the complexity of drought tolerance, a quick and effective screen for this trait has yet to be established. The research reported herein was designed to evaluate a screening method for drought tolerance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seedlings. Twenty-one converted race stocks (CRS) and two cultivars were evaluated for seedling drought tolerance on an individual plant basis. CRS are day-sensitive primitive lines derived from various wild race stocks that were converted to day neutrality for use in temperate region plant improvement programs (McCarty et al., 1993). Genotypes were evaluated October - November 2004 and February - March 2005 under greenhouse conditions at the Norman E. Borlaug Center for Southern Crop Improvement, College Station, TX.

40|$|Plants may exhibit {{some degree}} of {{acclimation}} after experiencing drought, but physiological adjustments to consecutive <b>cycles</b> of <b>drought</b> and re-watering (recovery) have scarcely been studied. The Mediterranean evergreen holm oak (Q. ilex) and the semi-deciduous rockrose (C. albidus) showed {{some degree of}} acclimation {{after the first of}} three <b>drought</b> <b>cycles</b> (S 1, S 2, and S 3). For instance, during S 2 and S 3 both species retained higher relative leaf water contents than during S 1, despite reaching similar leaf water potentials. However, both species showed remarkable differences in their photosynthetic acclimation to repeated <b>drought</b> <b>cycles.</b> Both species decreased photosynthesis to a similar extent during the three cycles (20 – 40 % of control values). However, after S 1 and S 2, photosynthesis recovered only to 80 % of control values in holm oak, due to persistently low stomatal (gs) and mesophyll (gm) conductances to CO 2. Moreover, leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE) was kept almost constant in this species during the entire experiment. By contrast, photosynthesis of rockrose recovered almost completely after each <b>drought</b> <b>cycle</b> (90 – 100 % of control values), while the WUE was largely and permanently increased (by 50 – 150 %, depending on the day) after S 1. This was due to a regulation which consisted in keeping gs low (recovering to 50 – 60 % of control values after re-watering) while maintaining a high gm (even exceeding control values during re-watering). While the mechanisms to achieve such particular regulation of water and CO 2 diffusion in leaves are unknown, it clearly represents a unique acclimation feature of this species after a <b>drought</b> <b>cycle,</b> which allows it a much better performance during successive drought events. Thus, differences in the photosynthetic acclimation to repeated <b>drought</b> <b>cycles</b> can have important consequences on the relative fitness of different Mediterranean species or growth forms within the frame of climate change scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Hofmann’s {{long-term}} studies {{demonstrated that}} Ruminant’s digestive apparatus underwent to evolutionary steps and its evolution {{is still going}} on in addition to adaptation to environmental modifications (Hofmann, 1976, 1989, 1999), also during a short period (Catorci et al., 2014; Scocco et al., 2011, ’ 12, ’ 13). In Apennine grasslands, the flowering peak period yields the highest quantity of forage with the best nutritional value; in summer, a lack of green forage often characterizes the pastoral systems. So, the forage feed value decrease because it contains a greater percentage of fibers (Crofts and Jefferson, 1994). SubMediterranean climate, characterized by inter-annual variability, is undergoing increase in aridity thus the worsening of semi-extensive grazing activities sustainability is expected. To test this hypothesis, we used 18 sheep nourished with dry hay and cereals during the winter season and with fresh hay during the pasture vegetative cycle; samples from rumen indicative regions (atrium, A; dorsal and ventral sac, DS and VS; dorsocaudal blind sac floor, DBF) were collected for two consecutive years (2007 and 2008). We estimate the rumen Surface Enlargement Factor (SEF and the degree of keratinization of the epithelial lining (EK). Data on precipitation, soil water deficit, aboveground phytomass, forage chemical composition and animal body state (as BCS evaluation) were collected. SEF varied in the rumen regions in relation to the diets in both years; SEF of VS and DBF showed a trend similar to that of pasture vegetative cycle in 2007, while in 2008 the SEF trend of SD and SV were overlapping to that of pasture phytomass production. The opposite behavior was observed in the EK of both VS and A, which increased when animals were nourished with highly fibrous hay, and decreased when animals grazed on fresh fodder. Rumen VS reveals a modification trend strictly related to pasture vegetative <b>cycle.</b> <b>Drought</b> stress negatively affected forage quantity and quality. The most negatively affected plant communities are those of productive habitats. Also a decrease in the re-growth capacity after clipping was observed in dry year (2007), especially in xeric plant communities. Results indicated that a very detrimental joint effect might acts in sub-Mediterranean pastoral systems undergoing intense drought stress, in that the decrease of aboveground forage production and the increase of its lignification give rise to a combined negative effect. In fact, significant positive correlations were identified for sheep BCS with phytomass and crude protein and for EK with crude fiber and ADF. This means that, though other physiological factors undoubtedly involved in animal loss of welfare under drought event, the modification in rumen features {{plays a key role in}} the worsening of the sheep body status and thus their welfare...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{climate change}} is a global {{challenge}} that attracts much attention and debates at all levels. The current body of knowledge informs that human development quest has increased concentration of GHGs into the atmosphere thereby causing global warming. Most of the initial efforts to address climate change concentrated on mitigation. However, during the last decade, calls for implementing adaptation actions {{to deal with the}} impacts being experienced increased. Thus, adaptation is now a priority for developing countries particularly LDCs. Agriculture is an important sector worldwide but nowhere other than in the developing world is it the most crucial aspect to deal with. However, this sector {{is one of the most}} vulnerable and sensitive to change and variability of the climate. Significance of smallholder agriculture on livelihoods of a majority poor in the developing world and its vulnerability to impacts of climate change and variability motivated this study. Changes in farming practices in the Mkomazi sub-catchment, Tanzania (for example, shifts in crop production areas, crop growing patterns and type of crops grown most) were reported and observed. However, the real factors motivating such changes in the area remained unknown. Thus, the objective of this research was to explore, analyze and explain factors that motivate smallholder farmers in Mkomazi sub-catchment to change their farming practices overtime. It also sought to analyze socio-economic implications of the changes and recommend appropriate policy and strategic actions to assist smallholder farmers adapt and enhance their resilience. Using a mixed research approach and five data collection methods (household questionnaire survey, experts’ interviews, smallholder farmers FGD, rainfall and temperature records as well as stakeholder validation workshop), the study attempted to answer the following five research questions: Are there any possible changes in the local climate and how are they perceived and explained by smallholder farmers? Are there any changes in farming practices in the area? What factors motivate decisions to change farming practice? What are socio-economic implications of the changes in the local climate at household and community level? What are policy and strategic interventions to support smallholder farmers to adapt and enhance their long-term resilience? Results from the study revealed that the state of climate in the area is changing; rainfall shows a decreasing trend while temperature indicates an increasing trend. Smallholder farmers have also been changing their farming practices overtime. These farmers have introduced new crops and crop varieties; adopted crops and crop varieties, which are shorter <b>cycle,</b> <b>drought</b> tolerant and marketable; and they have also stopped cultivation of some crops as well as crop varieties. Smallholder farmers are engaging in various economic activities to diversify their income sources. The changes were motivated by multiple factors but the leading included changes in the climate, markets and high living costs and demand for personal and household needs. Change and variability of climate is the most dominant factor. Changes in the local climate and subsequent changes in farming practices had mostly negative implications at household and community levels. They include water shortage, decrease in income, food insecurity, threats to human health, social conflicts, increase in deforestation and forest degradation, and deterioration of life quality. Farmers recommended various interventions to support them to adapt in the following thematic areas: research and development to enhance resilience to changes in rainfall and temperature regimes; strengthening sustainable management of water resources to deal with increasing dry conditions and unpredictability of rainfall; and support diversification of household incomes through less climate sensitive income options. Other recommended aspects include enhancing access to incentives, subsidies and introducing crop insurance to farmers; and enhancing farmers’ adaptive capacity through provision of technological and technical support like adaptation technologies, early warnings, education and training. Using a combination of three categories of data (agro-ecological, social and meteorological) from five sources (questionnaire, interviews, FGD, climate records and a workshop), the study successfully brings up multiple considerations taken into account by smallholder farmers to make farm production decisions; and heterogeneity of crops and crop varieties for four villages within similar agro-ecological characteristics. The study recommends use of incentives mechanisms such as REDD+ and PES in addressing problems of unsustainable resource use while increasing availability of ecosystem goods and services like water. It also recommends a multi-stakeholders approach in addressing issues of awareness creation and adaptation education to smallholder farmers; availability of inputs, markets, and institutional capacity building. The study emphasizes on use of available opportunities at all levels to support smallholder farmers to adapt and enhance their long term resilience. Finally, the study recommends a scientific investigation to model climate variables against crop production to clearly identify the extent to which changes in the local climate economically affect smallholder farmers’ production and incomes. In addition, it is important to identify the contribution of each of the several economic activities and income sources farmers depend on, i. e. crop production, remittance, charcoal making, animal keeping, small-scale fishing, small business, tourism, selling labour, etc. These two studies will fill the gaps, which the current study did not manage to cover.

A 20-to-30-year <b>cycle</b> of <b>drought</b> and fire {{has allowed the}} Okefenokee to exist as the unique wetland it is. These periods cause changes in the abundance of certain plants (more grasses growing in exposed areas) the nesting success of certain wading birds (failure in extreme drought), {{and the location of}} some species of wildlife (fish migrate into deeper lakes and channels and are followed by predators).|$|R
25|$|Since the 19th century {{people began}} {{migrating}} from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge {{in the next}} decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and <b>cycles</b> of <b>droughts</b> stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços, in slums (favelas) of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants {{was found in the}} area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.|$|R
