5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, <b>carbimazole</b> and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} <b>carbimazole</b> (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and {{coupling}} of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications {{should see a}} doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis.

50|$|<b>Carbimazole</b> is used {{to treat}} hyperthyroidism. <b>Carbimazole</b> is a pro-drug as after {{absorption}} it is converted to the active form, methimazole. Methimazole prevents thyroid peroxidase enzyme from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, hence reducing {{the production of the}} thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine).|$|E

5000|$|Ideally a {{woman who}} is known to have {{hyperthyroidism}} should seek pre-pregnancy advice, although as yet there is no evidence for its benefit. Appropriate education should allay fears that are commonly present in these women. She should be referred for specialist care for frequent checking of her thyroid status, thyroid antibody evaluation and close monitoring of her medication needs. Medical therapy with anti-thyroid medications is the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in preventing pregnancy complications by hyperthyroidism. Surgery is considered for patients who suffer severe adverse reactions to anti-thyroid drugs and this is best performed in the second trimester of pregnancy. Radioactive iodine is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy and the puerperium. If a woman is already receiving <b>carbimazole,</b> a change to propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended but this should be changed back to <b>carbimazole</b> after the first trimester. This is because <b>carbimazole</b> can rarely be associated with skin and also mid line defects in the fetus but PTU long term also can cause liver side effects in the adult. <b>Carbimazole</b> and PTU are both secreted in breast milk but evidence suggests that antithyroid drugs are safe during lactation. [...] There are no adverse effects on IQ or psychomotor development in children whose mothers have received antithyroid drugs in pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the above}} reasons, it is {{preferable}} to use [...] PTU in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, {{with the possibility of}} changing to <b>Carbimazole</b> for the second and third trimesters.|$|E
50|$|Whilst rashes and {{pruritus}} are common, {{these can}} often be treated with antihistamines without stopping the <b>carbimazole.</b> For those patients where sensitivity reactions can not be controlled, propylthiouracil {{may be used as}} an alternative; cross-sensitivity between these drugs is rare.|$|E
50|$|Iodine uptake {{against a}} {{concentration}} gradient is mediated by a sodium-iodine symporter and {{is linked to}} a sodium-potassium ATPase. Perchlorate and thiocyanate are drugs that can compete with iodine at this point. Compounds such as goitrin, <b>carbimazole,</b> methimazole, propylthiouracil can reduce thyroid hormone production by interfering with iodine oxidation.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of drugshave been {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (<b>carbimazole,</b> methimazole, and propylthiouracil), antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular).

50|$|<b>Carbimazole</b> {{should be}} used judiciously in {{pregnancy}} as it crosses the placenta. It has (rarely) been associated with congenital defects, including aplasia cutis of the neonate but is not contra-indicated. However, it more predictably may cause fetal hypothyroidism so (in minimal doses) {{it can be used}} in order to control maternal hyperthyroidism. There are reported cases of goiter and choanal atresia in fetus. Furthermore, breast feeding is possible but only if lowest effective dose is used and neonatal development is closely monitored.|$|E
50|$|Levothyroxine is a {{stereoisomer}} of thyroxine (T4) {{which is}} degraded {{much more slowly}} and can be administered once daily in patients with hypothyroidism. Natural thyroid hormone from pigs is sometimes also used, especially for people who cannot tolerate the synthetic version. Hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease may be treated with the thioamide drugs propylthiouracil, <b>carbimazole</b> or methimazole, or rarely with Lugol's solution. Additionally, hyperthyroidism and thyroid tumors may be treated with radioactive iodine. Ethanol injections {{for the treatment of}} recurrent thyroid cysts and metastatic thyroid cancer in lymph nodes can also be an alternative to surgery.|$|E

50|$|Thyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are {{drugs that}} inhibit the {{production}} of thyroid hormones, such as <b>carbimazole</b> (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US), and propylthiouracil. Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated {{over a period of}} months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.|$|E

50|$|Iopanoic acid is an iodine-containing radiocontrast medium used in cholecystography. Both {{iopanoic acid}} and ipodate sodium are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone release from thyroid gland, {{as well as}} of {{peripheral}} conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). These compounds inhibit 5'deiodinase (5'DID-1 and 5'DID-2) enzymes, which catalyse T4-T3 conversion in the thyroid cell, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, pituitary. This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly when they are used as an adjunctive therapy with thioamides (propylthiouracil, <b>carbimazole).</b> They can be used in the treatment of patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) and significant morbidity (e.g., myocardial infarction, or stroke) for rapid control of elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations. The use of iopanoic acid for treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been discontinued in the United States.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Carbimazole</b> ameliorates {{hyperthyroidism}} but reduces radioiodine uptake and adversely {{affects the}} outcome of simultaneous radioiodine therapy. We explored whether withdrawal of <b>carbimazole</b> for 3 days can restore {{the outcome of}} radioiodine treatment without concurrent exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. By generating three groups with comparable radioiodine uptake, we also investigated whether the effect of <b>carbimazole</b> depends on the radioiodine uptake. METHODS: Stratified by a radioiodine uptake 0. 001; Crooks-Wayne score 3 (0 - 30), p> 0. 03]. Time to achieve cure was delayed on <b>carbimazole.</b> No changes in thyroid hormone levels occurred after 3 days' discontinuation of <b>carbimazole.</b> Logistic regression revealed that all observed cure rates were independent of entity, sex, age, thyroid volume, radioiodine uptake, radioiodine half-life, fT(4), T(3) and TSH. CONCLUSION: Patients under <b>carbimazole</b> treatment can be referred for radioiodine therapy after withdrawal of <b>carbimazole</b> for only 3 days. Three days of <b>carbimazole</b> withdrawal is long enough to restore the success of radioiodine therapy and short enough to avoid the risk of exacerbation of hyperthyroidism...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} propranolol {{as an adjunct to}} <b>carbimazole</b> in the treatment of hyperthyroid tremor and tachycardia in a double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled study. Seven patients were given <b>carbimazole</b> plus either placebo or propranolol (40 mg) for 1 month and then switched to the alternative adjunct treatment for a further month. All patients showed significant improvements (p < 0. 001) of heart rate and tremor amplitude after 1 or 2 months from baseline. One month after the baseline, the mean improvements of heart rate were 23 % for the <b>carbimazole</b> + placebo group and 38 % for <b>carbimazole</b> + propranolol group.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the antithyroid drug, <b>carbimazole</b> on liver of albino rats and the possible ameliorative role of selenium. Methods: Four groups of rats were used (n= 10), Group 1 served as normal control, Group 2 was orally given sodium selenite (10 μg/kg body weight) daily for 8 weeks, Group 3 was orally given <b>carbimazole</b> at a dose level of 1. 35 mg/kg body weight, Group 4 was orally administered <b>carbimazole</b> and sodium selenite daily for 8 weeks. Rats in control and treated groups were sacrificed by cervical decapitation after 8 weeks of treatment, their livers were removed and stained with H&E for histological examinations. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were determined in the sera. Malondialdehyde and the antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase were measured in the liver. Results: Cytoplasmic vacuolation of the hepatocytes, necrosis, leucocytic infiltrations, blood vessels congestion and fatty degeneration were observed in liver of carbimazole-treated animals. <b>Carbimazole</b> caused marked elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. It also caused an increase in malondialdehyde and depletion of the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Treating animals with <b>carbimazole</b> and selenium led to an improvement in both the histological and biochemical alterations induced by <b>carbimazole.</b> Moreover, selenium reduced the level of malondialdehyde and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the probable protective effect of Î±-lipoic acid against testicular toxicity in rats exposed to <b>carbimazole</b> during the embryonic period. Time-mated pregnant rats were exposed to <b>carbimazole</b> from the embryonic days 9 â 21. After completion of the gestation period, all the rats were allowed to deliver pups and weaned. At postnatal day 100, F 1 male pups were assessed for the selected reproductive endpoints. Gestational exposure to <b>carbimazole</b> decreased the reproductive organ indices, testicular daily sperm count, epididymal sperm variables viz., sperm count, viable sperm, motile sperm and HOS-tail coiled sperms. Significant decrease in the activity levels of 3 Î²- and 17 Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and expression of StAR mRNA levels with a significant increase in the total cholesterol levels were observed in the testis of experimental rats over the controls. These events were also accompanied by a significant reduction in the serum testosterone levels in CBZ exposed rats, indicating reduced steroidogenesis. In addition, the deterioration of the testicular architecture and reduced fertility ability were noticed in the <b>carbimazole</b> exposed rats. Significant reduction in the activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione content with a significant increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in the testis of <b>carbimazole</b> exposed rats over the controls. Conversely, supplementation of Î±-lipoic acid (70 Â mg/Kg bodyweight) ameliorated the male reproductive health in rats exposed to <b>carbimazole</b> during the embryonic period as evidenced by enhanced reproductive organ weights, selected sperm variables, testicular steroidogenesis, and testicular enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. To conclude, diminished testicular antioxidant balance associated with reduced spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis might be responsible for the suppressed reproduction in rats exposed to the <b>carbimazole</b> transplacentally. On the other hand, Î±-lipoic acid through its antioxidant and steroidogenic properties mitigated testicular toxicity which eventually restored the male reproductive health of carbimazole-exposed rats.

There are few birth defects associated with propylthiouracil, but this should be interpreted in the context of higher historical prescription rates for <b>carbimazole.</b> The authors are grateful to staff at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), UK, for extracting the data from the Yellow Cards, and providing helpful comments on our manuscript.
