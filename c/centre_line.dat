5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR had constructed some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city <b>centre.</b> <b>Line</b> 4 of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. But it was always delayed.|$|E

25|$|A later {{variation}} uses {{two separate}} but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along {{the length of}} the input shaft and crankshaft <b>centre</b> <b>line),</b> and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the generation of sensitivity maps in electrical capacitance tomography based on the concepts of electrical field <b>centre</b> <b>lines.</b> Electrical capacitance tomography systems are normalized at the upper and lower permittivity values for image reconstruction. Conventional normalization assumes the distribution of materials in parallel and results in normalized capacitance as a linear function of measured capacitance. A recent approach is the usage of a series sensor model which results in normalized capacitance as a nonlinear function of measured capacitance. In this study different forms of normalizations are combined with sensitivity maps based on electrical field <b>centre</b> <b>lines</b> and it is shown that a mix of two normalization models improves the reconstruction performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} is posed whether {{the application of}} a colour difference for the central line on the road is the best solution available for the coding of the categories of road. It has been proposed to apply yellow <b>centre</b> <b>lines</b> on roads with two-way traffic and white <b>centre</b> <b>lines</b> on roads with one-way traffic. When it is considered necessary to have a coding system by means of horizontal road markings in order to indicate the difference between one-way and two-way roads, the exclusive use of a colour difference for this coding should not be recommended because the difference will not be prominent under favourable conditions and would be hardly visible or not visible at all under unfavourable conditions...|$|R
25|$|Wider, American-style {{ambulances}} {{might also}} be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> during an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Currently, three {{variations}} of clutch installation are used. The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches {{shared the same}} plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> as the engine crankshaft; when viewed head-on {{along the length of}} the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.|$|E

A single 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun and two 7.7mm machine guns were located amidships on a raised platform for anti-aircraft defense. Two twin-mount torpedo launchers were also on the centerline of the ship’s axis, one fore and aft of the anti-aircraft gun platform, with four loaded and four reserve Type 93 torpedoes. The fire control system was centralized into an enlarged bridge.|$|E

The laser-guidance seeker, fitted on the nose of the LGB is a very critical component, which was designed jointly by IIT Delhi and ADE, with BEL as the production agency. A laser designator is used to mark a target. The on-board seeker detects the laser light reflected from the target and signals the kit's control surfaces to guide it towards the designated target. The seeker provides information on the deviation of the laser sport from the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> of the detector. Sudarshan has an on-board flight-control computer with microelectronic-mechanical systems-based rate gyros. It also has high-precision linear ball-lead-screw actuators.|$|E

40|$|Precise {{calibration}} of quartz line scales is {{very important}} for assuring traceability of microscopic measurements. Very significant influence in calibration uncertainty budget is represented by uncertainty of <b>line</b> <b>centre</b> detection. <b>Line</b> <b>centre</b> is usually detected through video signal processing using different types of algorithms. This paper is presenting calibration procedure that was developed in the Laboratory for Production Measurement at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Maribor. It is focused in uncertainty analysis and especially in the influence of line scale contamination on determination of <b>line</b> <b>centre</b> position. Different types of line scale contamination like dirt spots, scratches, line edge incorrectness, and line intensity were simulated in order to test the ability of the <b>line</b> <b>centre</b> detection algorithm to eliminate such influences from the measurement results...|$|R
25|$|In {{hopes of}} {{stealing}} a victory, Amber Holland opts {{to utilize the}} four rock rule, by having lead Heather Kalenchuk place a high <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> guard on her first rock. Jones responds by having lead Dawn Askin throw a rock in the rings to have the possible winning point. Holland calls for Kalenchuk to throw a tight guard to utilize the four rock rule once again, but she is heavy and it lands in the 12ft, in front of Askin's rock. This gives Canada the permission to remove it, which Jones asks Askin to do. However, Askin flashes her stone, missing everything entirely. Tammy Schneider then places a tight guard for Saskatchewan. At this point, Canada can start removing guards, and Jill Officer can now remove the high guard, which she peels off. Tammy Schneider then replaces it, and it is once again removed by Officer. Kim Schneider then puts up another high <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> guard, but it is removed Kaitlyn Lawes. Kim Schneider on her second rock comes a bit heavy, ending up as a halfway guard. Jones opts to have Lawes remove it as well. At this point, Amber Holland decides to make her move by coming around the tight guard placed by Tammy Schneider. Her rock has good weight, {{but it is too}} far outside, and the entire rock is visible for Jennifer Jones to remove, and even roll in for shot. Jones does remove the stone, but instead rolls out to the 12ft. On her final stone, Holland makes a perfect come around, landing on the button. This leaves Jones with a double run back on to it for the win. Jones almost makes the shot, but the Canada rock rolls further than the Saskatchewan rock, giving the title to Saskatchewan {{for the first time since}} 1997.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous goals in NHL history is the goal Lemieux scored in the 2nd period of game two. Receiving the puck between the Penguins' blue line and the <b>centre</b> <b>line,</b> Lemieux skated solo into the North Stars zone facing two defencemen and the goalie by himself. Mario skirted the puck through one of the defenders' (Shawn Chambers) legs, skated around him, forced the goalie to commit left, then {{switched}} the puck to his backhand side and sliding the puck in before crashing into the net himself. The brief video of the goal has been since featured on recent Stanley Cup promo ads by the NHL (played in reverse), as well as the opening montage of Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|Play runs rapidly, {{with quick}} change-of-hands of the quaffle, because every goal (each being worth 10 points) scored against a team gives that team the ball. Once a point is scored, the quaffle {{must be given}} to the other team's keeper, and almost {{immediately}} returns to the offensive with the chasers returning to their keeper zone or proper side of the pitch; beaters are not bound to return to their side of the pitch nor exit the opposing team's keeper zone at any point. Games can last any length of time longer than 18 minutes, depending on the skill and endurance of the seekers and snitch. Many tournaments introduce snitch handicaps, such as asking the snitch to use only one hand, no hands, or remain on the <b>centre</b> <b>line,</b> to ensure games fit within reasonable time slots.|$|E
