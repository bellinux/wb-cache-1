5000|$|The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) is {{the agency}} of the European Union (EU) that sets {{mandatory}} requirements for European railways and manufacturers {{in the form of}} Technical Specifications for Interoperability, which apply to the Trans-European Rail system. The ERA publishes a document summarizing the status of the TSIs. [...] The ERA sets <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> <b>targets,</b> common safety methods and common safety indicators, following Directive 2004/49/EC and amendments. The ERA also hosts a number of databases, among which a register of remaining, applicable national rules.|$|E
50|$|Some {{national}} authorities keep statistics on tramway incidents. An {{example of an}} authority collecting accident and incident reports from {{national authorities}} is the European Railway Agency. The Agency has a public safety database on railway licences, certificates, safety indicators, national safety rules, and accident investigations. In the European Union, the safety of railways has been regulated with directives, which also require e.g. the collection of common safety indicator statistics from member countries. In the EU, common safety methods (CSMs) and <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> (CSTs) have been set for European railways.|$|E
40|$|The {{apportionment}} of railway safety targets is a {{key issue}} in developing common safety management in the European railway system. In this paper, we develop a generic approach based on the functional railway architecture, to analyse the safety of railway systems for a unified European network and {{to comply with the}} <b>Common</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Targets</b> (CSTs) required by the European railway safety directive. We suggest using constraint programming with the functional railway architecture, developed by the AEIF, to allocate the safety targets to the railway functions...|$|E
30|$|Mature safety {{management}} {{concepts of the}} rail transit were formed in electronic and electrical standard IEC 61508 [3], aviation industry standard ARP 4761 [4], and the related European railway signal standards CENELEC [5, 6, 7]. According to these standards, British railway safety and standards board (RSSB) built the safety risk model (SRM) based on the accumulated data of railway operating for decades to evaluate the safety state of railway operation and to provide guidance [8]. The European commission proposed the SAMRail [9] and SAMNET [10] projects, which aimed at railway risk management promotion in 2002 and 2003. These projects have unified the railway safety operation strategy and established general <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> and indicators and finally formed the railway operation safety performance indicators and <b>safety</b> <b>target</b> allocation methods [11], based on the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> <b>target,</b> the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> indicator, and the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> method.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, many {{countries}} have set quantified road <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> {{as part of}} their comprehensive road safety strategies. This paper studies the association between the setting of quantified road <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> and road fatality reduction over the past two decades. Both aggregate and disaggregate levels of hypothesis tests are performed on data from 14 countries that set road <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> during the period 1981 - 1999. A before-and-after analysis of the treatment and comparison groups is conducted, and the results show that the majority of countries with quantified road <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> experienced a reduction in road fatalities in this period. Overall, the establishment of quantified road <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> is found to have an appreciable association with an improvement in road safety. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The European Railway Agency (ERA) has the {{challenging}} task of establishing <b>Common</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Targets</b> and Common Safety Methods throughout Europe. In this context, the harmonization of risk assessment methods is also discussed. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a new approach to risk assessment of technical systems in railway automation, which allows a rapid risk assessment while at the same time also allowing a rigorous check that the method is well constructed and robust. As a particular reference, a new German pre-standard, which lays out requirements for such semi-quantitative approaches, is taken into account. A particular method is constructed in this paper and the means by which compliance with legal and regulatory requirements can be demonstrated, is discussed. Although the paper deals with the European legal framework in railway automation, the approach can easily be generalized to other legal frameworks and other application domains. ...|$|E
30|$|In 2004, the European Commission {{produced}} Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC [3], {{in order}} to define <b>Common</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Targets</b> (CSTs) and to improve, where possible, system safety levels. The Directive stipulates that Member States are duty-bound to conduct an independent investigation {{in order to}} improve rail safety and prevent accidents. In addition to serious accidents, the investigating body may conduct investigations into accidents and incidents which, under slightly different circumstances, could have resulted in more serious accidents, including technical failures in structural rail sub-sections or interoperability components of the trans-European high-speed or conventional rail systems. The Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC requires the safety of railway transport to be defined according to acceptable individual risks to LX users (Article 7, § 4 a) [3]. The Directive expects the development of procedures and methods for risk evaluation and assessment (Article 6, § 3 a). The CSTs define safety levels that must at least be reached in each Member State by different parts of the railway system and by the system as a whole. These CSTs are expressed as risk acceptance criteria for individual risks (passengers, maintenance staff including subcontractors, LX users and others, and unauthorized persons) and societal risks.|$|E

40|$|Road tunnels {{are vital}} {{infrastructures}} providing underground vehicular passageways for commuters and motorists. Various {{quantitative risk assessment}} (QRA) models have recently been developed and employed to evaluate the safety levels of road tunnels in terms of societal risk (as measured by the F/N curve). For a particular road tunnel, traffic volume and proportion of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are two adjustable parameters that may significantly affect the societal risk, and are thus very useful in implementing risk reduction solutions. To evaluate the impact the two contributing factors have on the risk, this article first presents an approach that employs a QRA model to generate societal risk {{for a series of}} possible combinations of the two factors. Some combinations may result in F/N curves that do not fulfill a predetermined <b>safety</b> <b>target.</b> This article thus proposes an "excess risk index" in order to quantify the road tunnel risk magnitudes that do not pass the <b>safety</b> <b>target.</b> The two-factor impact analysis can be illustrated by a contour chart based on the excess risk. Finally, the methodology has been applied to Singapore's KPE road tunnel and the results show that in terms of meeting the test <b>safety</b> <b>target</b> for societal risk, the traffic capacity of the tunnel should be no more than 1, 200 vehs/h/lane, with a maximum proportion of 18 % HGVs.

40|$|A {{breach in}} a flood defence will affect the {{downstream}} water levels in a riverine system, and therefore the flood risk of the system. The effect of this changed flood risk is used in an economical optimization to assess if this significantly changes the economically optimal <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> of the flood defences in a riverine system. The impact of breaches on the flood risk and the economically optimal <b>safety</b> <b>targets</b> is modelled using simplified hydrodynamic relations {{and a number of}} conceptual case studies for small systems. Significant differences were found, but are limited to cases with a relatively high chance of breaching and/or high impact breaches. These differences seem to mostly affect the optimal heights of the flood defences, which means that including the effect of breaches can result in a different-optimal investment path.
