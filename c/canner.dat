500|$|During {{the reign}} of Henry VIII the chantry was {{under the control of}} the crown with Provosts Woulset and Carmer both being the kings chaplains and it {{unlikely}} that any investment was made in Stoke sub Hamdon Priory. By the time of the dissolution in 1548, the chantry was already greatly reduced. The chantry holder, Thomas <b>Canner,</b> was also the parish priest, but performed his duties by deputy: he supplied one to carry out his parochial role, and another to perform his chantry duties. The college building had become a free chapel, and served as a chapel of ease for the village's residents, offering a convenient alternative to the parish church of St Mary the Virgin which was a mile away in East Stoke. The Abolition of Chantries Act resulted in the college buildings being sold to the laity in 1548. The ownership of the estate exchanged hands frequently over the following 70 years, and during most of the period it was leased out to various tenants. The college was converted into a private house, and underwent significant renovation. Pantin suggests that the building work can be approximately dated to the period in which the Strode family inhabited the house, based upon an inscription in some panelling, [...] "1585/TS", in which the TS stands for Thomas Strode. The building was also expanded on its south side, along the street. Over the subsequent three centuries, the estate was primarily passed on through marriage and inheritance within families, though it was sold a few times; primarily the ownership was held by the Robinsons, the Rodbards, and the Hawkesworths. None of the three families lived on the estate, which was at the time a farm worked by a string of lessees.|$|E

Florence's secretary was Mary Emily Haworth (1901–1998), who was the maternal grandmother of Australian artist Kathy Panton (1969–).

Pressure <b>canners</b> are specifically designed for home canning, whereas ordinary pressure cookers are not recommended for canning due {{to the risk of}} botulism poisoning, because pressure <b>canners</b> hold heat and pressure for much longer than ordinary pressure cookers; these factors are a critical part of the total processing time required to destroy harmful microbes.|$|R
