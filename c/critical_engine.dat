25|$|Countering the {{statistical}} evidence, Rockwell demonstration pilot Bob Hoover's famous airshow stunt routine, with the Shrike Commander, included a full aerobatic routine performed first with both engines, then with one engine out (and the <b>critical</b> <b>engine,</b> at that), then both engines out, gliding.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} limiting the life of <b>critical</b> aircraft <b>engine</b> components, such as compressor discs and spacers, is the formation of low cycle fatigue (LCF) cracks in the fastener bolt holes.

25|$|The first {{production}} Seminoles {{are equipped}} with two 180hp (135kW) Lycoming O-360-E1A6D engines. The right-hand engine is a Lycoming LO-360-E1A6D variant, which turns {{in the opposite direction}} to the left-hand engine. This feature eliminates the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> and makes the aircraft more controllable in the event that an engine needs to be shut down or fails.|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} inboard engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an inboard engine {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of yawing moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the <b>critical</b> <b>engine,</b> safe control can be maintained.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{inherent}} risks of operating at {{or close to}} VMCa with asymmetric thrust, {{and the desire to}} simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification VSSE may be defined. VSSE safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> inoperative, established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, one engine inoperative speed. This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.|$|E

25|$|Leaded {{gasoline}} was {{the predominant}} type {{available in the}} first years of the Wankel engine's development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and leaded gasoline is designed to reduced the wearing of seal and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of gasoline's lubricating qualities. As leaded gasoline was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the gasoline to provide lubrication to <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> parts. Experienced users advise, even in engines with electronic fuel injection, adding at least 1% of oil directly to gasoline as a safety measure in case the pump supplying oil to combustion chamber related parts failed or sucked in air. A SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and cooling fins.|$|E
25|$|A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{with four}} or more engines have not only a VMCA (often called VMCA1 under these circumstances), where the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> alone is inoperative, but also a VMCA2 that applies when the engine inboard of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine,</b> on the same wing, is also inoperative. Civil {{aviation}} regulations (FAR, CS and equivalent) no longer require a VMCA2 to be determined, [...] although it is still required for military aircraft with {{four or more}} engines. On turbojet and turbofan aircraft, the outboard engines are usually equally critical. Three-engine aircraft such as the MD-11 and BN-2 Trislander {{do not have a}} VMCA2; a failed centerline engine has no effect on VMC.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of {{interactions between the}} propulsion and flight control systems of a three-fan subsonic VTOL aircraft was studied using nonreal time simulation. Time histories of <b>critical</b> internal <b>engine</b> parameters were obtained and possible deleterious effects of engine dynamics on flight control were identified and analyzed. No deleterious effects, {{with the exception of}} the effects of the fan actuator deadband, were found. A method of alleviating these effects through feedback of the actuator output to the flight controller was developed...|$|R

2500|$|The US Federal Aviation Administration defines it as: [...] "the {{maximum speed}} in the takeoff {{at which the}} pilot must take the first action (e.g., apply brakes, reduce thrust, deploy speed brakes) to stop the {{airplane}} within the accelerate-stop distance.

2500|$|Certified on 7 May 1971 and {{introduced}} in late 1971 as a 1972 model, the PA-34-200 Seneca I {{is powered by}} pair of Lycoming IO-360-C1E6 engines. The righthand engine is a Lycoming LIO-360-C1E6 engine variant, the [...] "L" [...] in its designation indicating that the crankshaft turns in the opposite direction, giving the Seneca I counter-rotating engines. The counter-rotating engines eliminate the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> limitations of other light twins and make the aircraft more controllable {{in the event of}} a shut down or failure of either engine. A total of 934 Seneca I models were built, including one prototype.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{monitoring}} of a serpentine belt tensioner performance, a <b>critical</b> automotive <b>engine</b> component guaranteeing the cooling system efficiency. A belt tensioner fault will affect the transmission, deteriorate the water pump efficiency, and eventually, lead the engine to stall. Monitoring this component is thus a key to design predictive or corrective maintenance. In this paper, we propose to estimate a parameter which is shown to be characteristic of this component's health by using an Adaptive Observer or an Extended Kalman Filter. Respective merits of these solutions are compared using simulations performed with GT-SUITE on a high-fidelity model...|$|R
2500|$|V1 is the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> failure {{recognition}} speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed above which the takeoff will continue even if an engine fails or another problem occurs, {{such as a}} blown tire. The speed will vary among aircraft types and varies according to factors such as aircraft weight, runway length, wing flap setting, engine thrust used and runway surface contamination, thus it must {{be determined by the}} pilot before takeoff. Aborting a takeoff after V1 is strongly discouraged because the aircraft will by definition not be able to stop {{before the end of the}} runway, thus suffering a [...] "runway overrun".|$|E

Variants of the Lycoming TIO-540 developing [...] were fitted to the Chieftain, with an opposite-rotation LTIO-540 installed on the right-hand wing; MTOW was increased to [...] The Chieftain's introduction was delayed by a flood at Piper's factory at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania caused by Hurricane Agnes, and deliveries did not commence until 1973. In 1974 Piper used a Navajo B {{as the basis for}} developing a new model, the PA-31-325 Navajo C/R. The Navajo C/R had lower-power versions of the counter-rotating engines of the Chieftain, rated at [...] After certification of the PA-31-325 in May 1974, production commenced in the 1975 model year.

50|$|During the {{experimental}} flight test {{phase of a}} multi-engine aircraft, the Experimental Test Pilot and Flight Test Engineer determine which of the engines is the <b>critical</b> <b>engine.</b> Definitions of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> {{can also be found}} in Flight Test Guides for Part 23 and Part 25 airplanes, issued by the FAA and by EASA.|$|E
5000|$|During normal cruise flight, {{the engine}} is exposed to many loads such as intense heat and {{centrifugal}} force. This causes expansion of certain components and alters {{the gap between the}} turbine casing and tips of the spinning turbine blades. The amount of air leaking around, past the edge of the blades without passing through them is <b>critical</b> to <b>engine</b> performance and fuel efficiency. For this reason since the late 1960s, blade tip sealing has taken on a prominent role in aircraft engine design. The ACC system dynamically controls the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) blade clearance. This can be achieved in numerous ways.|$|R

50|$|Airworthiness Standards and Certification Specifications (§ 23.149 and § 25.149) {{require the}} {{manufacturer}} {{to determine a}} minimum control speed at which the airplane is controllable after failure of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> and publish this speed in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual. The published Minimum Control Speeds (VMC's) of the aircraft are measured while the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> fails or is inoperative, hence, {{the effect of the}} failure of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> is included in the published VMC's. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual VMC that the pilot experiences in-flight will be a bit lower, which is safer, but this decrement is not documented. The <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> {{is just one of the}} factors that influences the VMC's of the aircraft. The published VMC's are therefore safe, whatever engine fails or is inoperative. Hence, (airline) pilots should not have to know about the criticality of an engine. The <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> is defined in Aviation Regulations for use by airplane tail design engineers for sizing the tail, and by experimental test pilots for measuring VMC's in-flight. Other factors, like bank angle and thrust, have a much greater effect on VMC's than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine. Please refer to the minimum control speed article for detailed information.|$|E

50|$|Wasted spark systems still {{require a}} timing {{signal from the}} crankshaft. In a {{conventional}} four-stroke engine, this signal must also observe the phase of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft, so contact breakers are normally driven from the camshaft and distributor drive. With a wasted spark, the crankshaft can be used instead, as the system fires on both revolutions. It simplifies the mechanical arrangements {{since there is no}} distributor drive and the contact breaker cam can be fixed to the crankshaft. Although a 2:1 reduction gear is still required to operate the camshaft and valves, the precision of this drive is now less critical (ignition timing is more <b>critical</b> for <b>engine</b> performance than valve timing): engines continue to run adequately even with worn camshaft drives and imprecise timing.|$|R
