This involves general interpretation {{of the system of}} rules in the international private law, of the difference between a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and a forwarding contract, and detailed interpretation of the legal sources of a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, especially of the CMR Convention. The main objective of the rigorous thesis is to describe and analyze rights and obligations of the participants to the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, including the recipient, not a party to the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The thesis further provides the interpretation of the breach of obligations under the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and <b>of</b> liability {{on the part of the}} carrier, and/or the sender, as a result of breaching the duties under the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The rigorous thesis also presents the obligation to pay damages on the part of an international road carrier, proviso and complaints under the CMR, special statute of limitation under the CMR, and resolutions of disputes in relation to a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international carriage by [...] ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the massive expansion <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods {{that went on in}} past couple of decades will soon resume after the worldwide recession.

The most important legal regulation that governs the area <b>of</b> international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road is the Convention on the Contract for the International <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> Goods by Road (hereinafter the CMR Convention) that has been signed on May 19, 1956.

60|$|But {{the result}} might be, that {{the fall of}} price might not have an effect exactly equal, on the demand in the two countries. Suppose, for instance, that the fall of cloth in Germany owing to the saving of the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> did not {{increase}} the demand for cloth in Germany; but that the fall of linen in England from a like cause, did increase the demand for linen in England. The linen imported {{would be more than}} could be paid for by the cloth exported: the difference must be paid in money: the change in the distribution of the precious metals between the two countries would lower the price of cloth in England, (and consequently in Germany), while it would raise the price of linen in Germany, (and consequently in England). Germany, therefore, by the annihilation <b>of</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> would save in price more than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the cloth; England would save less in price than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the linen. But if by the miraculous annihilation <b>of</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> England would not save the whole <b>of</b> the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> her imports, it follows that England did not previously pay the whole of that cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R

The Rome Convention is then compared with Rome I Regulation. The author observes and concludes {{that some of the}} complex problems of determining the law applicable to a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods through the default rules under the Rome Convention appear to have been improved under Rome I, which creates more certainty. However, the Rome I regime for determining the law applicable to a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods is by no means perfect, and a resort to some other case law decisions from the CJEU may prove to be helpful in the future...|$|R
