5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to <b>California,</b> <b>are</b> found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja <b>California</b> <b>are</b> distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{rotation}} of the Earth, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off <b>California</b> <b>are</b> rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only one to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E
5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern <b>California</b> <b>are</b> a result of two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate {{with respect to the}} North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off <b>California</b> <b>are</b> cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern <b>California</b> <b>are</b> also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though {{more research is needed to}} determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E
