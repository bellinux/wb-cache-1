OBJECTIVE: This {{study is a}} report of the treatment of a patient, 11 years and 4 months old, with Class II, division 1, malocclusion, convex profile, protrusion of upper incisors, pronounced overjet and overbite, and mild crowding. METHODS: The patient was treated with a Jasper Jumper associated to fixed appliances for 6 months and Class II intermaxillary elastics (3 / 16 in) during the last 4 months. After debonding, a Hawley retainer was used during daytime and a modified Bionator for night use during one year. In the lower dental arch a bonded lingual retainer was used. This treatment combination improved the profile, as well as the overjet, overbite and molar relation. RESULTS: There was clockwise mandibular rotation and increase of lower anterior facial height. The lower incisors were protruded and extruded and the lower molars were extruded. The <b>centric</b> occlusal <b>relation</b> was checked and it was coincident to the maximum usual intercuspation.

5000|$|One of {{the keys}} in {{diagnosing}} the anterior crossbite due to skeletal vs dental causes is diagnosing a CR-CO shift in a patient. An adolescent presenting with anterior crossbite may be positioning their mandible forward into centric occlusion (CO) due to the dental interferences. Thus finding their occlusion in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> (CR) is key in diagnosis. For anterior crossbite, if their CO matches their CR then the patient truly has a skeletal component to their crossbite. If the CR shows a less severe class 3 malocclusion or teeth not in anterior crossbite, this may mean that their anterior crossbite results due to dental interferences.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} teeth protect the posterior teeth by providing for a plane of guidance during excursions, thus allowing the cusps of the posterior teeth to disclude rather than strike one another during lateral or protrusive movements from <b>centric</b> <b>relation.</b> In other words, the posterior teeth have much larger crowns {{and many more}} cusps than the {{anterior teeth}}. Because posterior crowns are so much wider and possess cuspal projections in various configurations, the cusps of the maxillary teeth {{and those of the}} mandibular teeth have an opportunity to bang into each other during chewing, speech or simply meeting together when one bites down. To prevent this from happening, the anterior teeth of each arch will, ideally, be situated so as to come into contact before the cusps of the posterior teeth do, thus preventing wear on the posterior teeth. This requires less force because the anterior teeth are further from the joint (analogous to stopping a door further from its hinge).|$|E

Material and methodsThe records of 15 symptomatic patients who were subjected to a questionnaire and clinical evaluation for their inclusion in the study were used. Casts were mounted from three records: 1) maximum intercuspation, 2) <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> with Roth power centric bite, and 3) <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> a month after the daily use of the splint. Condylar position of the right and left side in horizontal and vertical was measured and compared as well as the vertical and horizontal overbite in each of the three records. ResultsThere were no significant differences in the results obtained from the records made in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> with an immediate splint and in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> after the use of the occlusal splint. However, it was found that there is a considerable discrepancy in the condylar and dental displacement in a position of maximum intercuspation and in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> after the use of the splint, as well as an improvement in the patients’ symptoms with the use of that device.

40|$|Starting {{point for}} this study was the {{assumption}} that centric slide could be an etiologic factor for a temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Centric slide must be considered as the mismatch between the ideal condylar alignment in the fossa and the maximal intercuspal position. Centric slide may be measured intraorally with a millimeter ruler or with plaster models mounted in an articulator. The former technique seems not very precise because the operator needs to make an interpretation of the increments in millimeters on the ruler and is a 2 -dimensional approach. The latter technique demands sophisticated articulator equipment to measure the centric slide 3 -dimensionally. There is no validated reference position for mounted models in an articulator; the operator may choose one of 7 different definitions of <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> as provided in the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms, or the maximal intercuspal position. The most recent definition of <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> can be achieved with 2 different methods: bimanual manipulation or with a leaf gauge. Reproducibility of bimanual manipulation has been tested, reproducibility of the method with a leaf gauge lacks in the current literature. Evidence of reproducibility is not satisfactory to validate a reference position. A construct validity of a method to locate <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> with a leaf gauge and elevator muscle contraction appears to be the most preferable choice to test reproducibility of musculoskeletally stable <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> position.

A sample of 15 subjects (6 men, 9 women, age 22 to 46), assessed with the Research Diagnostic Criteria to rule out any TMD-signs, was selected.

This study compared occlusal splints fabricated in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> and maximum intercuspation in muscle pain reduction of TMD patients. Twenty patients with TMD of myogenous origin and bruxism were divided into 2 groups treated with splints in maximum intercuspation (I) or <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> (II). Clinical, electrognathographic and electromyographic examinations were performed before and 3 months after therapy. Data were analyzed by the Student's t test. Differences at 5 % level of probability were considered statistically significant. There was a remarkable reduction in pain symptomatology, without statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the groups. There was mandibular repositioning during therapy, as demonstrated by the change in occlusal contacts on the splints. Electrognathographic examination demonstrated a significant increase in maximum left lateral movement for group I and right lateral movement for group II (p 0. 05) in the electromyographic activities at rest after utilization of both splints. In conclusion, both occlusal splints were effective for pain control and presented similar action. The results suggest that maximum intercuspation may be used for fabrication of occlusal splints in patients with occlusal stability without large discrepancies between <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> and maximum intercuspation.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{different}} bite registration methods for maxillomandibular relationship were examined using an electronic intraoral support pin system (IPR-Systems Dental Balance GmbH, Potsdam, Germany).

All study participants were placed on a specialized chair which supported a standardised upright seating position. The position of the mandible was recorded in two-dimensional coordinates. The following methods of the maxillomandibular relationship were performed on all study participants: field of adduction 1 (without movement of the central-bearing-point system) field of adduction 2 (after dynamic sequences with the intraoral pin, 			neuromuscular deprogramming) <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> guided manually: 		o by an experienced examiner 		o by a non experienced examiner The fields of adduction 1 / 2 {{were not significantly different}} (paired t-test as a group comparison test: transverse: p = 0. 369; sagittal: p = 0. 486). The fields of adduction were significantly anterior in comparison to the manually guided <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> (paired t-test as a group comparison test: p < 0. 0001). Comparing the fields of adduction 1 / 2 with the manually guided <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> {{it was found that the}} neuromuscular mandibular position above all tend to had a higher scatter, than the bite registration token by the two operators.

40|$|BackgroundNumerous {{condylar}} repositioning {{methods have}} been reported. However, {{most of them are}} 2 -dimensional or are complex procedures that require a longer operation time and a highly trained surgeon. This study aims to introduce a new technique using a condylar repositioning plate and a <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> splint to achieve a centric relationship. MethodsWe evaluated 387 patients who had undergone surgery for skeletal jaw deformities. During the operation, a <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> splint, intermediate splint, final centric occlusion splint, and condylar repositioning plate along with an L-type mini-plate for LeFort I osteotomy or a bicortical screw for bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy were utilized for rigid fixation. The evaluation included: a physical examination to detect preoperative and postoperative temporomandibular joint dysfunction, 3 -dimensional computed tomography and oblique transcranial temporomandibular joint radiography to measure 3 -dimensional condylar head movement, and posteroanterior and lateral cephalometric radiography to measure the preoperative and postoperative movement of the bony segment and relapse rate. ResultsA 0. 3 % relapse rate was observed in the coronal plane, and a 2. 8 % relapse rate in the sagittal plane, which is indistinguishable from the dental relapse rate in orthodontic treatment. The condylar repositioning plate could not fully prevent movement of the condylar head, but the relapse rate was minimal, implying that the movement of the condylar head was within tolerable limits.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} whether and to what extend the recording of the ‘centric relation’ in different heights (within the framework of the arc of <b>centric</b> <b>relation)</b> could affect the precision of the recording. For this aim there have been made recordings of the <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> in a sample of 30 participants, who have been selected under specific presuppositions, at three different heights (0. 5 mm - 1 mm - 1. 5 mm from the position of the first contact) for each participant. Based on the aforementioned recordings three different cast mountings were made for each participant in a semi-adjustable articulator (Dentatus) with the ‘split casts’ technique. The next step was to map and register in a special leaflet the dental contacts from the already articulated casts and directly from the participant’s mouth (‘control’), always in the position of the maximum intercuspation. The realization of our goal was achieved through the comparison (with the help of the science of statistics) of the dental contacts which were registered from the three different cast mountings for each participant in compare with the dental contacts registered directly from the participant’s mouth (‘control’). The statistical analysis of the data led the conclusion that the precision of the recordings of <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> was not practically affected by the three different heights at which the recordings took place.

Results: No significant changes were observed in the anterior, superior, or posterior joint space of the TMJ (p> 0. 05). In addition, no significant change was observed in TMJ sound (p> 0. 05). However, TMJ pain and locking both decreased significantly after surgery (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Due to its simplicity, this method may be fea sible and useful for repositioning condyles.

30|$|It is well {{accepted}} that occlusal factors may influence and cause functional disturbances of the masticatory system [50]. In particular, maxillary constriction and functional unilateral posterior crossbite {{have been shown}} to be associated with temporomandibular disorders and altered muscle function. The diagnosis of “functional crossbite” is based on the presence of a mandibular shift from <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> to an asymmetric intercuspal position. Patients with functional crossbites have symmetric mandibles that merely are positioned laterally [51].|$|E
40|$|Tooth wear is {{attributed}} to several factors many of which often remain unidentified. Management of tooth wear is challenging in preventive and restorative dentistry. Correct assessment of occlusal vertical dimension, interocclusal rest space, and <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> records are critical for successful treatment. In order to evaluate different treatment modalities and select the treatment of choice some information {{can be obtained from}} study casts and diagnostic wax-up. In order to achieve a predictable and desirable result, a systematic approach may be helpful. This paper describes the full mouth rehabilitation of a 36 -year-old bruxer with severely worn dentition and other dental problems such as unfavorable restorations. A diagnostic work-up was performed and provisional restorations were made; then, they were clinically evaluated and adjusted based on the criteria dictating esthetics, phonetics, and vertical dimension. After endodontic therapy, clinical crown lengthening was performed. Two short implants were inserted in the posterior mandible. Custom-cast dowel cores and metal-ceramic restorations were fabricated and a full occlusal splint was used to protect the restorations. We ensured stable contacts on all teeth with equal intensity in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> and anterior guidance in accord with functional jaw movements...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether there is any relationship between the condition of complete dentures and TMDs. Methods: The sample consisted of 61 consecutive patients (35 females and 26 males) who were admitted to the Department of Prosthodontics of Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry for fabrication of new complete dentures.  The age range of the participants was between 32 and 80 years, with the mean age of 57. 05 ± 10. 26 years. The patients were examined by two prosthodontists. Using a questionnaire, the first prosthodontist asked the patients about their habits and history of trauma to the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). She then examined the participants for signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).   The second prosthodontist examined each participant's existing denture and checked its fit, stability, retention, occlusion, and <b>centric</b> <b>relation,</b> and recorded how long it had been in service. The examination was double blind. The data were recorded in examination sheets. Results: The relationship between TMDs and denture fit, stability, retention, <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> and occlusion was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. No significant relationship was found between denture characteristics and TMDs in complete denture wearers (P-value> 0. 05). Conclusion: Complete denture characteristics did not play a role in the development of TMDs in edentulous patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to address the {{therapeutic}} goals regarding the static and functional occlusion in the completion of orthodontic treatment. For such purpose, a study population comprising 20 female treated Class II malocclusion subjects with an initial mean age of 11 years underwent a two-phase treatment (orthopedics and orthodontics). The patients were diagnosed in <b>centric</b> <b>relation</b> and were treated according to the six keys for normal occlusion and functional occlusal parameters (<b>centric</b> <b>relation,</b> vertical dimension, lateral and anterior guidances, occlusal contacts and direction of forces applied on the teeth). After removal of fixed mechanics, retainers were installed and maintained for two years. Five years after orthodontic completion, the occlusal stability of the patients was evaluated regarding molar relationship and overjet, measured in dental casts. All subjects maintained the normal molar relationship and correct overjet achieved at the end of treatment, indicating a fair level of occlusal stability. The importance of the criteria of the ideal functional occlusion to ensure a better stability after completion orthodontic treatment will be discussed in detail in this paper. In addition, some clinical situations in which localized adjustments are indicated for occlusal refinement will be described.

40|$|<b>Centric</b> <b>relation</b> (CR) {{has been}} {{considered}} a maxillomandibular position of choice for some dental and prosthetic procedures. Although regarded as a fully reproducible relation, there is great controversy about its clinical use and recording technique, especially in patients with {{signs and symptoms of}} temporomandibular disorders (TMD). This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a training program on intra- and interexaminer agreement when determining the clinical record of the CR position. Forty individuals constituted the sample, divided into symptomatic (TMD) and asymptomatic groups. Three previously calibrated examiners performed the initial assessment and the second evaluation after 30 days in a blind design, using Dawson?s bilateral manipulation technique with and without an anterior stop. The amount of frontal and sagittal deviations in relation to intercuspal position, the presence of pain and discomfort during manipulation, and the first occlusal contact in CR were analyzed. Kendall and Kappa tests with a 5 % level of significance were used to determine agreement. Values for both intra- and interexaminer agreement were deemed good. The best results were obtained for frontal deviations and assessment of pain (or absence of it) during manipulation. Sagittal deviations showed the lowest agreement in both examinations. The authors concluded that a calibration program could be effective for intra- and interexaminer agreement when recording <b>centric</b> <b>relation.</b> However, caution is recommended when analyzing some isolated items...|$|E
