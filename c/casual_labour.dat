40|$|Chinese {{farming in}} Australia between 1850 and 1920 has {{generally}} been given little attention, being usually characterised as just market gardening, but with little other detail especially about its development and characteristics. This article argues that Chinese farming was both complex and dynamic. Initially Chinese farming was primarily <b>casual</b> <b>labouring</b> along European lines. However, from the 1880 s onwards, Chinese farming became more specialised, focussing {{on a wide range}} of high-value, labour-intensive crops. The skill of the Chinese was not just the transference of farming techniques from China, but also in their entrepreneurship and ability to adapt their techniques to the Australian environment. Despite widespread European racism, some Europeans sought to capture the benefits of Chinese farming, developing European - Chinese partnerships. After 1900 Chinese farming declined in scale and diversity. The adoption of labourintensive techniques by European farmers led to a decline in European-Chinese partnerships and the squeezing of Chinese farmers out of niche markets...|$|R

Livelihoods are affected by non sustainable practices such as wanton cutting down of trees, shifting cultivation, and poor agricultural practices. The drivers of deforestation and soil erosion are interrelated with growing human population, increased demand of firewood and limited job opportunities being the main ones. The State of Environment Report of 2000 for the district identified five pressing environmental issues for the district and these included: overpopulation, encroachment in water catchment areas, poor public place sanitation, declining fish catch from natural water bodies and loss of biodiversity. One other thing that has exacerbated the social economic status {{of the people in}} this district is the introduction of tea estates a long time ago which took almost all cultivatable land away from the inhabitants leaving them only with <b>casual</b> <b>labouring</b> in the estates as an alternative for survival.

By the 1880s, the casual employment system caused Dock workers to unionise under Ben Tillett and John Burns. This led to a demand for 6d per hour (2.5p), and an end to <b>casual</b> <b>labour</b> in the docks.

While permanent academic staff are engaged in teaching and research, a growing group of hourly paid or casual employees deliver teaching services. This article explores some key dimensions of the work and aspirations of these casual academic staff, including levels of access to job and career supports, and career and job satisfaction. The 2011 Work and Careers in Australian Universities survey of staff in 19 universities provides data from more than 3000 casual academic staff. Three related issues are investigated: the characteristics of labour supply in the <b>casual</b> academic <b>labour</b> force; the key defining boundaries of labour segmentation; and barriers between casual and permanent academic employment. A typology of casual academic staff is proposed. In particular, gender, type of university and discipline are investigated to examine whether these have an impact on the various measures of career opportunity, job satisfaction and the incidence of the 'frustrated academic'. The research reveals that the <b>casual</b> academic <b>labour</b> market is not integrated with the permanent academic labour market and that discipline is a key determinant of the level of 'frustration' of casual academic staff.

A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of <b>casual</b> <b>labour</b> and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings.

5000|$|Poor {{families}} were those {{with less than}} one hectare of land, or whose adults consumed less than 200 kilos of maize each year; they formed 55% {{of the population in}} 1989, including most smallholders. This included 20% of families with less than half a hectare or adults eating less than 133 kilos of maize (the ultra-poor). By 2003, 72% were poor, 41% ultra-poor: many were estate labourers or tenants, or in female-headed households. Many were malnourished, consuming only 1,818 daily calories (1,165 calories for the ultra-poor). Families with half a hectare or less relied on <b>casual</b> <b>labouring</b> (often food-for-work, termed [...] "ganyu") and with those dispossessed by estate formation made up a virtually landless underclass. In congested parts of the Shire Highlands, the poorest 65% had only 0.2 hectare. As 95% of all suitable, and some marginal, land was already cultivated, land shortages could only intensify. Labour and fertilizer shortages or costs prevented poor households from growing Burley tobacco. For these, market liberalisation removed the safety net that subsidies had previously given. As fertilizer costs increased, in poor years the earnings of many smaller Burley growers did not meet the costs of production or allow purchases of extra food. Most tobacco growers reserved only 0.3 to 0.5 hectare to grow food, insufficient for family needs in some years.|$|R
50|$|From the 1880s onwards {{social thought}} and social action {{began to change}} in {{reaction}} to {{what was perceived as}} a national social crisis. It was a crisis borne out of a cyclical process of economic depression set against the background of Britain’s relative economic decline in comparison to competitors such as the United States of America and Germany. Faced with the challenges of falling prices, tighter profit margins and greater competition, employers reacted by rationalising their labour requirements through mechanisation and an increasing reliance upon unskilled <b>casual</b> and sweated <b>labour</b> {{at the expense of the}} traditional craft workers. This, however, was not the only cause of the crisis. The agricultural depression in the 1870s led to a huge demographic shift in the population with mass migration from rural Scotland to urban Scotland. Furthermore, Irish immigrants in their tens of thousands flooded into the cities, particularly Glasgow. The Highland Scots and the Irish came to the cities largely as <b>casual</b> unskilled <b>labour</b> with little or no job security to compete in the existing labour market depressing wages and thereby enabling their employers to exploit them. In reaction to this, organised labour began to assert itself through increasing unionisation and industrial militancy. Socialism began to gain currency and challenged the traditional class relationships in British society.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{informal}} employment in China in recent decades has attracted attention, but to understand its implications, the concept of informality must be deconstructed. We reclassify employment status into three categories: salaried workers who have long-term contracts; the self-employed; and causal workers without long term contracts (working in either the formal or the informal sector). The monthly earnings of the self-employed are much (47 %) higher than those casual employees. Self-employment {{is not necessarily a}} misfortune and the flexibility it provides may be optimal for some kinds of workers. For example, the self-employed {{are more likely to be}} disabled and to have young families. Institutionally, it is still difficult for casual workers and most rural-urban migrant workers to embark on business ownership. Although a large group of rural-urban migrants are employees with longer term contracts, their rural registration (hukou) means they lack the social protection of urban residents. The labour force with rural hukou is more likely to fall into the informal sector and, within that sector, is most likely to be engaged in <b>casual</b> <b>labouring</b> jobs. Policies to support small businesses may be warranted given the detrimental impacts of informality on casual workers. Experimental interventions could be tried along the lines of those used in Peru to provide funds to support entrepreneurial activities by this group to lift themselves out of a poverty trap into more sustainable employment. Skill training, encouragement for innovation, tax credits and reducing institutional constraints on starting up small business should be all considered...|$|R

As they were {{employed}} as <b>casual</b> <b>labour,</b> bal maidens were not tied to any particular mine, and it was not unusual for them to transfer to other mines offering better pay or conditions. Some mines may have paid a monthly loyalty bonus in an effort to retain their workers. The workers could be fined for bad language, failure to work hard enough, absenteeism and other misdemeanours. As their pay was dependent on the profitability of the mine, it was not unusual early in the 19th century for bal maidens to work for long periods (in at least one case, a laundry woman, 11 months) without pay, and to receive their pay in arrears once the mine returned to profit. While some younger bal maidens would attend school before starting work and, in 1841, around a quarter of bal maidens attended Sunday schools, illiteracy was rife. When [...] Charles Foster Barham's reported to the 1842 Royal Commission into the Employment of Children at the Mines he found that less than half of bal maidens he interviewed were able to read to any extent. Some mines subsidised basic education for the children of their employees. Mining families generally valued education so highly that they would often try to send at least one child to school, but any education children did receive tended to be curtailed once they became old enough to work in the mines.|$|E

I As a result of the transformations and metamorphoses of the last decades, in particular in the developed capitalist countries and with significant repercussions in third world countries with intermediary industrialisation, labour presents a multiple process. On the one hand, we see a de-proletarianisation of industrial labour in the capitalist developed countries. In other words there has been a reduction of the traditional industrial labour class. In parallel, on the other hand there is a significant underproletarianisation of labour occurring in the diverse forms of partial, precarious, <b>casual,</b> subcontracted <b>labour</b> attached to the manufacturing industries, to the informal economy and to the private sector. Therefore, one can see a significant heterogeneity, complexity and fragmentation of labour. Empirical evidence from various research studies has not supported the thesis of the suppression or elimination of the working class under capitalism, especially in view of the increase of multiple forms of <b>casual</b> or precarious <b>labour.</b> This is not {{to mention the fact that}} substantial parts of the class-that-makes-a-living-from-labour is strongly rooted in intermediar...|$|R

Further elite-run estates were later created on previously communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 “squatters” lived on surplus land with no security, forming a pool of <b>casual</b> <b>labour.</b> Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow. The preferred term for short-term rural casual work paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term [...] "Ganyu" [...] is said to derive from the Portuguese [...] "ganho" [...] (sometimes spelled [...] "ganyao") meaning something gained or a bonus. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another’s fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary “Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi”.|$|E
