5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that <b>chlorhexidine</b> mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of <b>chlorhexidine,</b> a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorhexidine</b> {{impregnated}} {{chips are}} also available.|$|E
25|$|Clean the patient’s {{skin with}} <b>chlorhexidine</b> antiseptic.|$|E
25|$|Using an {{antiseptic}} mouthwash: <b>Chlorhexidine</b> gluconate-based mouthwash {{in combination}} with careful oral hygiene may cure gingivitis, although they cannot reverse any attachment loss due to periodontitis.|$|E
25|$|If severe odor is a problem, an {{antibacterial}} soap like <b>chlorhexidine</b> {{may be used}} in the armpits when showering. After 1–2 {{weeks of}} daily use, a noticeable decrease in odor should occur.|$|E
25|$|In addition, as {{recommended}} in all dental traumas good oral hygiene with 0.12% <b>chlorhexidine</b> gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking {{for several days}} may provide a favorable condition for periodontal ligaments regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Gingivitis can be {{prevented}} through regular oral hygiene that includes daily brushing and flossing. Hydrogen peroxide, saline, alcohol or <b>chlorhexidine</b> mouth washes may also be employed. In a 2004 clinical study, the beneficial effect of hydrogen peroxide on gingivitis has been highlighted.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} shaving {{of the area}} around the vagina, was common {{practice}} due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an episiotomy (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries. It is currently less common, though it is still a routine procedure in some countries even though a systematic review found no evidence to recommend shaving. Side effects appear later, including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor. Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic <b>chlorhexidine</b> or providone-iodine solution in the vagina. Evidence of benefit with <b>chlorhexidine</b> is lacking. A decreased risk is found with providone-iodine when a cesarean section is to be performed.|$|E
25|$|Transient surface {{discoloration}} of {{the tongue}} and other soft tissues in the mouth can occur {{in the absence of}} hairy tongue. Causes include smoking (or betel chewing), some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee, tea or liquorice), and certain medications (e.g., <b>chlorhexidine,</b> iron salts, or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)).|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review {{reported that there}} is some evidence that rinsing with <b>chlorhexidine</b> (0.12% or 0.2%) or placing <b>chlorhexidine</b> gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth reduces the frequency of dry socket. Another {{systematic review}} concluded that there is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of dry socket (and infection and pain) following third molar extractions of wisdom teeth, however their use is associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. The authors questioned whether treating 12 patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection would do more harm overall than good, in view of the potential side effects and also of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, there is evidence that in individuals who are at clear risk may benefit from antibiotics. There is also evidence that antifibrinolytic agents applied to the socket after the extraction may reduce the risk of dry socket.|$|E
25|$|The {{blood is}} drawn from a large arm vein close to the skin, usually the median cubital vein {{on the inside of}} the elbow. The skin over the blood vessel is cleaned with an {{antiseptic}} such as iodine or <b>chlorhexidine</b> to prevent skin bacteria from contaminating the collected blood and also to prevent infections where the needle pierced the donor's skin.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of cases of ONJ have occurred in cancer patients receiving high dose intravenous bisphosphonates, almost 800 cases have been reported in oral bisphosphonate users for osteoporosis or Pagets disease. In terms of severity most cases of ONJ in oral bisphosphonate users are stage 1–2 and tend to progress to resolution with conservative measures such as oral <b>chlorhexidine</b> rinses.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, {{the area}} {{underneath}} the operculum is gently irrigated to remove debris and inflammatory exudate. Often warm saline is used but other solutions may contain hydrogen peroxide, <b>chlorhexidine</b> or other antiseptics. Irrigation may be assisted {{in conjunction with}} Debridement (removal of plaque, calculus and food debris) with periodontal instruments. Irrigation may be enough to relieve any associated pericoronal abscess; otherwise a small incision {{can be made to}} allow drainage.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with <b>chlorhexidine</b> gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, triclosan concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially inhalant and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} {{treatment}} {{is to remove}} plaque. Therapy is aimed at the reduction of oral bacteria and may {{take the form of}} regular periodic visits to a dental professional together with adequate oral hygiene home care. Thus, several of the methods used in the prevention of gingivitis can also be used for the treatment of manifest gingivitis, such as scaling, root planing, curettage, mouth washes containing <b>chlorhexidine</b> or hydrogen peroxide, and flossing. Interdental brushes also help remove any causative agents.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{pertains}} to the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed {{and there have been}} results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. Results from a study published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to <b>chlorhexidine</b> or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).|$|E
25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting rid of them. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as <b>Chlorhexidine,</b> which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E
25|$|To 'scrub' one's {{hands for}} a {{surgical}} operation, {{it is necessary}} to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some <b>chlorhexidine</b> or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes. Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary. When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands. After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with all}} the {{precautions}} taken by medical professionals, infection reportedly occurs in up to 13.9% of patients after stabilization of an open fracture, and in about 0.5-2% of patients who receive joint prostheses. In order to reduce these numbers, the surfaces of the devices used in these procedures have been altered in hopes to prevent {{the growth of the}} bacteria that leads to these infections. This has been achieved by coating titanium devices with an antiseptic combination of <b>chlorhexidine</b> and chloroxylenol. This antiseptic combination successfully prevents the growth of the five main organisms that cause medical related infections, which include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} <b>chlorhexidine</b> mouth wash in those with poor immune {{function}} and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as <b>chlorhexidine</b> is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It {{is also important to}} note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. <b>chlorhexidine)</b> can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral candidiasis developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and <b>chlorhexidine</b> have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
2500|$|A main way {{to combat}} the growth of {{bacterial}} cells on a surface is to prevent the initial adhesion of the cells to that surface. [...] Some coatings which accomplish this include <b>chlorhexidine</b> incorporated hydroxyapatite coatings, chlorhexidine-containing polylactide coatings on an anodized surface, and polymer and calcium phosphate coatings with <b>chlorhexidine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "Among the locally {{administered}} adjunctive antimicrobials, {{the most}} positive results occurred for tetracycline, minocycline, metronidazole, and <b>chlorhexidine.</b> Adjunctive local therapy generally reduced PD levels....Whether such improvements, even if statistically significant, are clinically meaningful remains a question." ...|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} {{approved by the}} American Dental Association that [...] "reduce plaque and demonstrate effective reduction of gingival inflammation {{over a period of}} time" [...] are triclosan, <b>chlorhexidine</b> digluconate, and a combination of thymol, menthol, eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate. These ingredients are found in toothpaste and mouthwash. Hydrogen peroxide was long considered a suitable over-the-counter agent to treat gingivitis. There has been evidence to show the positive effect on controlling gingivitis in short-term use. A study indicates the fluoridated hydrogen peroxide-based mouth rinse can remove teeth stain and reduce gingivitis.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{authoritative}} clinicians {{and researchers}} advise completing endodontic therapy {{as soon as}} possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay. [...] Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain medicaments prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of <b>chlorhexidine</b> gluconate and calcium hydroxide for infection control was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{pre-operative}} holding area, {{the patient}} changes {{out of his}} or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details {{of his or her}} surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as <b>chlorhexidine</b> gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an [...] "ether screen", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).|$|E
50|$|At {{physiologic}} pH, <b>chlorhexidine</b> salts dissociate {{and release}} the positively charged <b>chlorhexidine</b> cation. The bactericidal {{effect is a}} result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of <b>chlorhexidine,</b> this results in a bacteriostatic effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death.|$|E
50|$|Bathing with an {{antiseptic}} like <b>chlorhexidine</b> {{does not}} seem to affect incidence of complications after surgery. However, washing the surgical site with <b>chlorhexidine</b> after surgery does seem helpful for preventing surgical site infection.|$|E
50|$|A 2008 {{systematic}} review found that antibacterial mouthrinses may help. Mouthwashes often contain antibacterial agents including cetylpyridinium chloride, <b>chlorhexidine,</b> zinc gluconate, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide. Cetylpyridinium chloride and <b>chlorhexidine</b> can temporarily stain teeth.|$|E
50|$|Topical skin {{preparations}} such as <b>chlorhexidine</b> and ethyl alcohol {{have the potential}} to be ototoxic should they enter the inner ear through the round window membrane. This potential was first noted after a small percentage of patients undergoing early myringoplasty operations experienced severe sensorineural hearing loss. It was found that in all operations involving this complication the preoperative sterilization was done with <b>chlorhexidine.</b> The ototoxicity of <b>chlorhexidine</b> was further confirmed by studies with animal models.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorhexidine</b> {{does not}} meet current European {{specifications}} for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, {{no significant difference in}} the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of <b>chlorhexidine</b> digluconate and soap. In the U.S., between 2007 and 2009, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with <b>chlorhexidine</b> gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorhexidine</b> {{is another}} example of a {{non-specific}} antimicrobial agent. It acts by disrupting bacterial deposition and plaque formation on the teeth, further assisting in reducing gingivitis. <b>Chlorhexidine</b> can also reduce the amount of pre-existing plaque. <b>Chlorhexidine</b> is generally found on products such as dental chews or oral rinses and may not be suitable for use in a long-term diet as prolonged use may lead to staining of the teeth and tongue, and change the taste of the food.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chlorhexidine</b> {{has good}} {{substantivity}} (the {{ability of a}} mouthwash to bind to hard and soft tissues in the mouth). However, <b>chlorhexidine</b> binds to tannins, meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee, tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining (i.e. removable staining) of teeth. [...] <b>Chlorhexidine</b> is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with leukemia, desquamation and irritation of oral mucosa, salivary gland pain and swelling, and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.|$|E
