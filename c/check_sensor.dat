30|$|The risk of heatstroke becomes high {{when the}} core body {{temperature}} rises to about 39 °C. Equations for estimating core body temperature, {{described in the}} next section, have been proposed by Kubota et al. (2003). To evaluate risks of heatstroke in the thermal environment, wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is often used (Dang et al. 2006). WBGT is a composite of natural wet-bulb temperature, globe thermometer temperature, and dry-bulb temperature. However, heatstroke onset depends largely on the physiological condition of the individual. Wearable thermal sensors can measure body temperature and heat rate, but failure to <b>check</b> <b>sensor</b> readings or ignoring alarms can lead to failure of such measures to prevent heatstroke. Moreover, environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation significantly vary from place to place.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{have been conducted}} on several different batches of Vaisala RS 80 radiosondes to understand and develop methods to correct six humidity measurement errors, including chemical contamination, temperature dependence, basic calibration model, ground <b>check,</b> <b>sensor</b> aging, and sensor arm heating. The contam-ination and temperature-dependence (TD) errors dominate total errors. The chemical contamination error produces a dry bias, and {{is due to the}} occupation of binding sites in the sensor polymer by nonwater molecules emitted from the sonde packaging material. The magnitude of the dry bias depends on sensor polymer type (RS 80 -A and RS 80 -H), age of the sonde, relative humidity (RH), and temperature, and it exists throughout the troposphere. The contam-ination error generally increases with age and RH, and is larger for the RS 80 -H than the RS 80 -A. It is; 2 % and; 10 % at saturation for 1 -yr-old RS 80 -A and RS 80 -H sondes, respectively. The TD error for the RS 80 -A results from an approximation of a linear function of temperature to the actual nonlinear temperature dependence of the sensor, and also introduces a dry bias. The TD error mainly exists at temperatures below 2208 C, increases substantially with decreasing temperatures below 2308 C, and is much larger for the RS 80 -A than the RS 80 -H. The RS 80 -A’s TD correction (CTA) dominates the total correction at temperatures below 2408 C and has a correction factor [CTA 5 (RH) (CTApfactor) ] of 0. 15, 0. 75, and 2. 3 at 2408, 2608, and 2808 C, respectively.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} for checking timing constraint violation in wireless sensor networks. We present the process for checking timing constraint violation and the techniques for calculation of clock drift, collection of sending and receiving time, and calculation of data transfer time. Through the techniques of this paper, the user can know about data transfer time on each node and total data transfer time from a sensor node to the server. Then, the user can confirm whether the expected data transfer time is satisfied by analyzing the information. If the expected data transfer time is not satisfied in the sensor network, the user can {{find out where the}} delay has occurred. Real-time data processing is a key factor in sensor networks, so the sensing data should be transferred to the server in right time in order to perform the correct action at proper time. The proposed strategy will help the user to maintain correct real-time processing in the sensor network because the user can debug timing constraint violation.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It is also {{available}} at: www. actuator. deIt is generally accepted that incorporating so-called ‘smart’ control and monitoring technologies can improve the reliability and availability of industrial systems. ‘Smart’ control {{can be defined as}} making full use of all the measured, inferred and a priori information that is available from a system. In general terms, the idea is that system level knowledge can be developed and used to <b>check</b> <b>sensors</b> for problems, to detect and identify faults as they develop and, where appropriate, to re-configure the controller(s) to accommodate plant or sensor faults until repair can be effected. To-date success, in terms of real industrial applications of the more advanced techniques, has been limited. Hence, demonstrators are needed. The work described in this paper is part of an on going project aimed at demonstrating these “smart” concepts on a Stewart-Gough platform comprising six pneumatic actuators. To-date the research has focussed on specifying the demonstrator system and developing and validating models of the pneumatic system. This is probably the most important step in designing a fault tolerant actuation system – as the model is the foundation of the other algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Part of {{this work}} was done while Tatiana Bokareva was visiting Portlan State University. 1 Ad-Hoc {{wireless}} sensor networks derive much of their promise from their potential for autonomously monitoring remote or physically inaccessible locations. As we begin to deploy sensor networks in real world applications [17], ensuring the integrity of sensor data is of paramount importance. In this paper, we motivate, propose, evaluate and analyze an online algorithm for modeling and validating sensor data in an unknown physical environment. Previous work on <b>checking</b> <b>sensor</b> data integrity developed {{within the context of}} process control systems uses a priori characterization of sensor data. In contrast, our approach leverages the concept of competitive learning for online characterization of a dynamic, unknown environment and the derivation of conditions for verifying sensor data integrity over time. Moreover, to scale to very large sensor networks, our algorithm leverages in-network processing a hierarchical, tiered sensor network by executing on the distributed cluster heads, rather than at a central base station. We prove the convergence properties of our algorithm through theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we implement our algorithm on a real physical sensor network of motes and Stargates, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully learns real-world environmental data characteristics and filters anomalous data in a sensor network. 2...|$|R

Three different bond-line thicknesses of the adhesive bond (nominally 0. 3, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm), all with an overlap length of 100 mm, were tested. The usual AE signal parameter set was recorded with four AE sensors (either of type SE- 45 H or SE- 150 M) from three tests each per DLJ type.

40|$|Abstract—For {{a sensor}} network to be {{reliable}} and useful, sensor data must sustain high Quality of Information (QoI). While QoI depends on many factors, {{the most crucial}} is the integrity of sensor data sources themselves. Sensor data quality may be compromised by causes such as noise, drifts, calibration, and faults. On-line detection and isolation of such misbehavior are crucial to assure high QoI for the end-user, and efficient management of network resources. We describe a two-tiered system for on-line detection of sensor faults. A local tier running at resource-constrained nodes uses an embedded model {{of the physical world}} with a hypothesis-testing detector to identify potential faults and notifies a global tier. In turn, the global tier uses these notifications for consistency <b>checking</b> among <b>sensors</b> and provides more robust estimates for events of interest, and also generates feedback to update the local models.
