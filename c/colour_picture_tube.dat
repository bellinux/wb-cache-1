40|$|Abstract: E-waste {{released}} from Television <b>colour</b> <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> manufacturing process is hazardous {{in nature and}} its worldwide disposal has become major concern to safe guard the environment and ecology. The solid wastes generated from the picture tube manufacturing process contain significant quantity of compounds of lead, nickel, cobolt, iron etc. The presence of toxic substances and their characteristic nature made these wastes hazardous and pose serious problems in their disposal resulting in major environmental concerns. In the present study an attempt {{has been made to}} develop a new cost effective process for immobilizing and recycling e-waste {{released from}} electronic industry in developing non-hazardous building material using additives and binders. Detoxification /immobilization of e-waste was achieved in making composite products using cement and sand as additives through solidification/stabilization process. Further strength and stability of solidified composite products was achieved through curing process. The quality and suitability of the S/S cured composite products were tested and assessed for their Engineering properties (compressive strength, water absorption, density), Toxicity leachate characteristics, Mineralogical studies, Morphological studies for their use in engineering applications, application as construction materials like bricks, blocks, aggregates and confirmed their environmenta...|$|E

The condition for optimum focusing of the electron beam has been determined, the method for analysis of the paraxial electron trajectories has been proposed and developed, the generalized numerical model of electron flow in the electron-optic system design with super-high resolution and also the complex of programs and alorithms for numerical simulation of the electron-optic systems (EOS) have been developed. EOS for the colour tubes with super-high resolution and increased durability has been developed. The methods of engineering design of the proposed gun have been given.

5000|$|From 1946 to 1951 the 7JP4 was {{a common}} CRT (<b>Picture</b> <b>Tube</b> or Kinescope) used in lower priced {{televisions}} sold in the United States. These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward electromagnetic deflection type televisions. Electromagnetic deflection uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are placed at the <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> neck, called the [...] "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946. Soon after electrostatic <b>picture</b> <b>tubes</b> and the television electronic design would be completely replaced.|$|R

5000|$|The Philco Predicta TV set was {{introduced}} in 1957 for the 1958 model year. It was {{a black and white}} television with the <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> mounted in a unique steerable pod on a pedestal. There were many versions: 17" [...] or 21" [...] <b>picture</b> <b>tubes,</b> wood or metal cabinets and table or floor standing versions, some with rare UHF tuners. Its specially designed, high-deflection-angle (to achieve a shallow front-to-back depth) <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> {{turned out to be a}} very unreliable design, and cost the company dearly in repairs and reputation. Many of them were sold to motels and bars due to the convenience of the swivel tube arrangement. It was discontinued in 1960; a great failure for Philco, like the Edsel automobile was for Ford, which coincidentally ran exactly the same model years. Today, due to the unique design, the Predicta is a collector's favorite and restored examples can easily be found.|$|R
40|$|Color <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> (CPT) {{is a major}} {{component}} of television sets and monitors. The manufacturing line of CPT includes an adjustment process for the integrated tube components (ITC). The adjustment process requires considerable expertise, and when operated manually, it {{is considered to be a}} bottleneck in view of the productivity of color <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> manufacturing. This paper deals with the design of a multi-task- and multi-processor- based automatic adjustment system for color purity control in the ITC adjustment process. In this work, the color purity control system is regarded as a large-scale system with modeling uncertainties. Specifically, the control object is hierarchically decomposed into several subsystems using heuristic knowledge from the experts, and real time multi-level control algorithms are given based on analytic modeling and also on-line robust visual sensing algorithms are proposed to effectively classify several types of color <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-level algorithms together with the proposed sensing algorithms are satisfactory and reliable for practical industrial use. close 19...|$|R
