The <b>co-ordination</b> <b>bond</b> formation phenomena of metals depend on the co-ordination number. In case of Fe treated specimens, more metals were exhausted as iron has higher co-ordination number amongst the employed metals. Almost 60 – 75 % of metals were exhausted onto fabric surface. These unreacted metals in mordant bath are great headache of environmental impediment. Moreover, during coloration process, the exhausted amount of metals will not partake fully into the dye–fiber binding purposes. So, the effluent after dyeing and washing {{were used to determine}} the concentration of metal ions into dyeing wastewater before discharge. The concentration of metals ions in residual mordant bath were found as 1.91, 1.28, 1.54 and 1.71  g/L for Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, Cu 2 + and Sn 2 + separately. Due to the lower exhaustion %, more amount residual metals were found for Al 3 +. The amounts of metal ions that remain unexhausted in the mordant baths were more than that of the legal limits for textile effluents discharged to a typical effluent treatment plant of home and abroad (Tonetti and Innocenti 2009). Though the amount of Fe 2 + in mordant bath was within the acceptable range of Bangladesh limit but fatefully it was up to almost four times higher than the international limits (Rather et al. 2016; Tonetti and Innocenti 2009).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Adsorption and {{catalytic}} decomposition of 4 -nitrobenzenesulphonylmethylcarbamate (herbi-cide Nisulam) on Upton, Wyoming, bentonite saturated with different cations was studied using thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. Nisulam is adsorbed {{at room temperature}} by coordination through the NO ~ group to the exchange cation regardless of the cation's nature. On moderate heating (75 ~ 176 this molecule decomposes to 4 -nitrobenzenesulphonamide whereas a similar compound (her-bicide Asulam) containing the NHz functional group instead of NOz is adsorbed by protonation atroom temperature and decomposes into different products. For cations having a high polarizing power, a <b>co-ordination</b> <b>bond</b> between the Asulam molecule's C=O group and the exchange cation is established, and the molecule decomposes tosulphanilic and carbamic acid. In contrast, for cations having a low polarizing power there is no coordination, and the molecule decomposes mainly into sulphanilamide. Nisulam's co-ordination to the exchange cation through the NO 2 group instead of C=O is ascribed to inductive and conjugation effects, typical of the nitro group...|$|E

For the dye-mordant-fiber intereation, all mordanted samples were exhibited upgraded outcomes interestingly. BFS comprises of many organic and inorganic compounds (de Assis et al. 2014). Hydroxyl and carbonyl {{groups in the}} polyphenolic flavonoids and cellulose structure are capable of forming chelate by <b>co-ordination</b> <b>bond</b> with positively charged metals. Some alteration were appeared in color coordinates value for mordanted dyed specimens as compared (B, C, D, and E) to the control sample (A). Hence, one molecule of metal can form a bond with two or more molecules of dye and fiber simultaneously according to their co-ordination numbers. Both iron and copper metals have excellent ability to form complexes by readily chelating with the dye molecule. As the coordination numbers of copper and iron are 4 and 6 respectively, some co-ordination sites remain vacant when they interact with the cotton. Thus, metals can form a complex simultaneously with the cotton in one site by keeping the dye (tannin, flavonoids) on the other site. Such firm binding promote dye uptake accordingly. Iron exhibited stronger fabric-mordants-dye interaction than copper (Uddin 2015; Ali 2008). Thus, all mordanted samples were exhibited better color fastness properties. Exceptionally, iron has stronger coordination linkage formation capability for higher coordination numbers 6 than other metals. In case of tin, slightly change in color was also appeared for its lower coordination bond strength.|$|E

Conventional non-surgical and surgical treatments aim to halt disease progression and repair the lost periodontal tissues. Surgical therapies such as open flap debridement are aimed to replace the lost alveolar bone and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) {{is also used to}} treat this disease. Whilst the regeneration of lost support is an aim of periodontal treatment, the outcomes of current approaches to periodontal regeneration (PR) are unpredictable. Consequently, significant laboratory and clinical research has been undertaken to explore the possibilities of improving the outcomes of treatment over the past few decades. In this respect chitosan (CH), a well-known biopolymer holds promise to be fabricated in various forms. The aim of the project was to fabricate a trilayered functionally graded GTR membrane by fabricating surface and core layers of non-porous and porous morphologies with complete physiochemical and biological characterisation. Solvent Casting, Freeze gelation (FG) and Electrospinning was performed on CH alone and in combination with Hydroxyapatite (HA). Membranes were characterized with Scanning electron Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), tensile testing, long term degradation and swelling studies were also performed. Cell culturing was performed using human osteosarcoma and progenitor cell line. Sirius red and Alizarin red assays were conducted to assess matrix deposition. Amongst the non-porous membranes fabricated by solvent casting, with Low molecular weight (LMw) CH:HA ratio of 30 : 70 showed better biocompatibility, and amongst the porous membranes made up of FG, ASa (ascorbic acid) :CH:HA (50 : 50) showed better stability and biocompatibility after in-vitro analysis. Histology of FG membranes conducted after in-vivo studies showed ASa:CH:HA to have higher cellular infiltration after 30 days of implantation. Electrospun fibres obtained in both aligned and random orientations were conducive to cellular attachment and mineralized matrix deposition with time. FTIR analysis showed strong <b>co-ordination</b> <b>bond</b> formation in between CH and HA. HA incorporated samples treated with simulated body fluid (SBF) showed an embryonic layer formation of hydroxyl carbonated apatite. Membranes can be combined together in different ways to achieve structural and functionally graded structures.

40|$|Metal Organic Frameworks” or MOFs {{is a term}} being {{associated}} to represent a class of novel adsorbents that has {{caught the attention of}} researchers owing to their great diversity in structures resulting from <b>co-ordination</b> <b>bonds</b> between inorganic metal atoms as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. They have high specific surface area (ca. 1000 - 5000 m 2 /g), large pore volume (ca. 0. 7 - 2. 5 cc/g) and low to moderate heat of adsorption (ca. 12 to 30 kJ/mol at moderate coverage). Proper selection of metal atoms and organic linkers leads to innumerable possibilities in the coordination geometry with wide variation in topology and functional groups. The tunable matrices or so-called tailor made structures has made it possible to design and synthesize materials meeting specific applications. Porosity, crystallinity and product purity are some of the key features of MOFs. Adsorptive gas separation/purification, gas storage and catalysis are some of the potential areas of study. Although MOFs have shown tremendous potential, however there remain certain challenges which are typical of this class of adsorbents. Before being explored effectively at the industrial level, it is important to study some of their key features. MOFs are reported to show highest surface area to the tune of ca. 1000 - 5000 m 2 /g. A careful review of literature has shown a major anomaly though. It is been observed that surface area and pore volume for the same MOF synthesized and reported by different research groups across different laboratories varied considerably. This is even true for different batches of the same MOF synthesized in the same lab. The reasoning behind this can be attributed to various synthesis conditions and post-treatment thereafter. It is been observed that percentages of impurities formed during synthesis requires a thorough post synthesis treatment to remove all the residual impurities which eventually dictates the “effective surface area” for any gas adsorption study. Thermal and chemical stability of MOFs is another area which needs to be studied carefully. The effectiveness of any MOF adsorbent can be measured from its robustness at high temperature and structural immunity against various organic, inorganic and atmospheric conditions. We conceived our idea on present research work based on the discussions in the preceding paragraph. Our research objectives can be broadly divided into following sub-sections: (I) 	Synthesizing MOFs of various topologies and tuning the synthesis route for better reproducibility (II) 	Studying thermal and chemical stability of the synthesized materials (III) 	Studying the surface characteristics of the synthesized materials It is noteworthy to mention here that a careful review of the literature reveals more than 2, 000 different MOF structures being synthesized and characterized. Although the number speaks volumes about their variation in structural configuration but the most important in that series include IRMOFs, Cu-BTC and MIL series. For our present research work we have opted for (I) 	Zn-BDC also known as MOF- 5 or IRMOF- 1 (II) 	Cu-BTC more familiarly HKUST- 1 or MOF- 199 (III) 	Cr-BDC popularly known as MIL- 101 Synthesis and characterization of Cu-BTC, Cr-BDC and Zn-BDC samples were successfully carried out in our present study. SEM images confirmed the authenticity of each of the MOFs. Cr-BDC and Cu-BTC were found octahedral in shape whereas Zn-BDC crystals appeared to be cubic in nature. The presence of impurities was not uncommon in MOF synthesis and here as well we had seen reactions leading to the formation of impure by-products. Post synthesis treatments in different organic environments were particularly important in removal of these impurities. Powder XRD patterns validated the crystalline nature of the products formed and thereby degree of purity in various batches owing to different solvent treatments. TGA patterns were typical of specific MOFs synthesized. However, a shift towards low thermal stability had been observed for cases where solvents eliminated impurities. Although it appeared that elimination of impurities decreased the thermal stability of the products but if not, eventually it would lead to reducing the effective surface area which is most crucial in any gas adsorption study. The packing density data nicely corroborated the TGA analysis...|$|R

It is concluded that in both <b>co-ordination</b> modes σ <b>bonding</b> {{is by far}} the most dominant, mainly due to strong charge donation from the pyrroli nitrogen lone pairs into the empty 4 dx 2 -y 2 and 4 dxz, with additional effects from donation into the 4 dz 2 and 5 s orbitals. The π bond, resulting from donation from occupied pyrrolyl π orbitals into the metal 4 dxy and 4 dyz orbitals is significant for η 5,σ,η 5,σ- but rather weak for σ,σ,σ,σ-co-ordination due to the diminished donation into the 4 dxy orbital. The total orbital interaction contribution (the covalent component) is about one third of the ionic component of the bond, the latter being identified as the sum of the Pauli repulsion and the attractive electrostatic interaction between L 4 – and Zr 4 +. The ionic contribution is about the same in the two configurations, but the covalent component of the bond decreases by ca. 3 eV for σ:σ:σ:σ co-ordination due mostly to a weaker π-bond interaction. The η 5,σ,η 5,σ complex is only 2. 1 eV more stable, indicating that the interconversion between the two co-ordination modes is a relatively easy process.

Presently, a flurry of experimental works is taking place for the better understanding of structural characterization and functional efficacy of supramolecular structures (CLs-DNA complex).

EXAFS model fitting of the FeK-edge spectra for individual vivianite grains produces Fe–O and Fe–P <b>co-ordination</b> numbers and <b>bond</b> lengths consistent with previous structural studies of vivianite (4 O atoms at 1. 99 – 2. 05 Å; 2 P atoms at 3. 17 – 3. 25 Å).

EXAFS modelling of the Zn K-edge data, together with linear combination XANES fitting of model compounds, indicates that Zn may be incorporated into the crystal structure of vivianite (4 O atoms at 1. 97 Å; 2 P atoms at 3. 17 Å). Low levels of Zn sulphate or Zn-sorbed goethite are also indicated from linear combination XANES fitting and to a limited extent, the EXAFS fitting, the origin of which may either be an oxidation artifact or the inclusion of Zn sulphate into the vivianite grains during precipitation. This study confirms that early diagenetic vivianite may act as a sink for Zn, and potentially other contaminants (e. g.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the derivation of a detailed structure for the Cu(II) -DNA complex. Cu(II) readily facilitates the denaturation and renaturation of DNA under certain conditions. Such processes occur during biological replication and recombination. Thus, there is considerable importance attached to a detailed knowledge of the Cu(II) -DNA complex. This is especially true when one finds that 'unwindase' (a DNA denaturing protein) which is essential for DNA replication during cell division has very similar solution properties (with DNA) to that of Cu(II). From numerous solution studies, other workers have derived various models of the Cu(II) -DNA complex. However, these models do not provide detailed structural features of the Cu(II) -DNA complex. So, {{an attempt was made}} to obtain additional evidence that would give rise to a more detailed structural model of the Cu(II) -DNA complex which in turn would more fully account for its properties. Two main approaches were made: (1) 	Studies of Cr(II) -DNA chemistry. Cu(II) and Cr(II) very often have similar chemistries due to the axial distortions of its bonding geometry in five and six co-ordinate complexes. By analogy with the studies of Ag(I) -DNA with Hg(II) and Cu(I) -DNA, similarity of properties could mean similarity of geometry of binding of these ions to DNA. (2) 	Correlation with the electron microscopic studies of 'unwindase'-DNA. The similarities of the properties of Cu(II) and 'unwindase'-DNA complexes could mean the similarity of certain basic structural features of these complexes. These studies result in the derivation of a model of Cu(II) -DNA which readily accounts for the kinetic and equilibrium properties of the Cu(II) -DNA complex. This model involves a square pyramidal (with a long axial <b>bond)</b> <b>co-ordination</b> of Cu(II) to N₇ of adenine or guanine and a phosphate group of the same strand on the next but one nucleotide as shown in Figure 34 (following page 124). The structural features of the 'unwindase'-DNA complex show {{how difficult it is to}} transfer twists from neighbouring denaturing regions towards the ends of the DNA molecule during denaturation (as required by the Watson-Crick model of DNA). Such studies therefore support the contention of Day and Rodley that an essentially non-intertwined structure (SBS) of DNA (which requires minimal twists on denaturation) could more readily account for the requirements associated with the separation of the two strands of DNA. This conclusion is also supported by the Cu(II) -DNA studies. Since Cr(II) solutions are hydrolysed at high pH and are readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen, special conditions and apparatus had to be devised for its studies. Under the conditions which had to be used (pH ≃ 4. 2), the structural features of the DNA molecule could be different from those under 'normal conditions' of pH ≃ 6. So, a systematic study of Cr(III), Co(II) and Cu(II) was carried out to check the applicability of the Cr(II) results. These studies show that the structures of the metal DNA species are not very different from those under 'normal conditions', thus allowing for the application of known properties of other metal ion systems in the interpretation of the results obtained. Also, as predicted the properties of the Cr(II) -DNA complex are similar to those of Cu(II) under these conditions. However, the greater reactivity of Cr(II) with DNA does not allow for a 'straight forward' comparison. The Cr(III) -DNA studies are also of interest. Experimental results show that it behaves differently towards DNA than Cr(II) but there are certain similarities. Other studies of metal-DNA interaction (optical) and studies of X-ray metal-nucleotides were attempted to further support the proposed model of Cu(II) -DNA. Due to various difficulties, very little additional information was obtained. Finally, the indirect biological and medical implications of the Cu(II) -DNA studies are discussed in some detail...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{systems have}} the {{incredible}} ability to accomplish uncommon chemical transformations with supreme delicacy. Many of those chemical transformations {{take place within}} the pocket of enzymes, which provide unique micro environment. From the quest of better understanding and to mimic such complex biological systems chemists have developed their own prototypes having well-defined cavity. To this end, in last few years many aesthetically elegant 3 D discrete architectures have been devised by employing noncovalent interactions especially metal-ligand <b>co-ordination</b> and hydrogen <b>bonding.</b> Conversely, architectures based on purely covalent interactions are relatively limited in number, owing to the laborious traditional covalent synthesis, which involves multi-step synthetic protocols and irreversible covalent bond formations. Nevertheless, in recent times by utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) several such organic 3 D discrete ensembles have been developed with ease and efficiency from simple and easily accessible building blocks. Interestingly in most of such cases imine condensation reaction has been utilized due to easy formation and cleavage of the imine bonds in an efficient and reversible manner. However, it is quite surprising {{that even though the}} dynamic nature of imine bonds has been well established; self-sorting/self-selection process has been overlooked in organic cage systems. Self-sorting in biological realm is a well-established synthetic protocol. DNA double helix formation via hydrogen bonding between the complimentary base pairs is probably the best known example of biological self-sorting. Self-sorting process has the ability to discriminate self from non-self to achieve highly ordered architectures from within a random reaction mixture. The credit of self-sorting/self-selection process goes to the hidden ‘molecular instructions’ encrypted within the complimentary building blocks. The foremost objective of the present thesis work is to implement the self-sorting/self-selection protocol in organic cage formation by harnessing the dynamic imine chemistry. During the course of the investigation it has been observed that non-covalent interaction especially hydrogen bonding could manipulate the outcome of such a process. Besides that, selective formation of a single isomer of an organic cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical aldehyde and a flexible amine has been successfully achieved by simply fine tuning the geometric features (shape and size) of the reacting aldehyde. Such three-dimensional cages are well appreciated by the scientific community owing to their potential applications in anion sensing, catalysis and gas storage/separation. However, they have not been explored as sensors for nitroaromatic explosives. Therefore, at this juncture several fluorescent organic cages have been synthesized and their potential application as chemosensor for the nitroaromatics has been tested. Moreover, a new synthetic protocol has been introduced for the post-synthetic modification of organic cages. Chapter 1 covers a brief introduction about dynamic covalent chemistry with main emphasis on dynamic imine chemistry and its use in covalent cage synthesis. Moreover, this chapter accounts the very recent applications of such cage compounds in various fields such as a pours material for gas storage/separation, a molecular host for the stabilization of reactive species and for the recognition of ions or molecules. Chapter 2 describes first time ever achieved self-sorting process in three-dimensional purely organic cages. First of all, four different [3 + 2] cages were synthesized by treating two different triamines with two different dialdehydes separately, by employing dynamic imine chemistry. The formation of desired cages was ascertained by various spectroscopic techniques. When a mixture of all the four components (two aldehydes and two amines) was subjected to reaction, only two cages were found to form (Scheme 1) out of several equally probable possibilities, which suggest a high-fidelity self-recognition. The issue of partner preferences was further verified by transforming a non-self-sorted cage into a self-sorted cage by treating the former with appropriate triamine or dialdehyde. For an in-depth understanding on this subject, theoretical calculations (gas phase DFT) were carried out, which suggested that observed self-sorting is a thermodynamically governed process. Scheme 1. Self-sorting in organic imine cages through partner preferences. Chapter 3 focuses that supramolecular interaction especially hydrogen-boding could be a possible way to direct a self-sorting process operating in imine based organic cage systems. It is a well-accepted fact that in most of the cases self-sorting process operates owing to the difference in geometric features (shape and size) of the competing building blocks. Thus increasing similarity in geometric features would create the situation more complex. It is anticipated that in such circumstances H-bonding could have a decisive role in partner selection. In order to investigate this, four different dialdehydes (A, B, C and D) having similar geometric background were synthesized. These aldehydes upon treatment with flexible amine X were found to form three nanosocpic [3 + 2] organic cages (aldehyde C gave insoluble uncharacterized material). When a one-pot reaction of triamine X with mixture of all the four aldehydes was carried out, selective formation of cage B 3 X 2 was observed (Scheme 2). Conversely, the same reaction in absence of aldehyde B resulted in the formation of mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental studies fully support the fact that the presence of hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the formyl group in aldehyde B has the key role in selective formation of cage B 3 X 2 from a complex reaction mixture, in which there are numerous equally probable possibilities. Such remarkable selection was further examined by converting a non-hydroxy (non-preferred) cage into hydroxy cage B 3 X 2 (preferred) by treating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in self-sorting process of two dialdehydes and two triamines has been established. Furthermore, the possibility of cage–to- cage transformation through imine bond metathesis has also been addressed. Scheme 2. H-bond directed 15 -fold (2 + 3) incomplete self-sorting in organic imine cages. Chapter 4 presents the investigation on the formation of single isomeric species of a [3 + 2] oligoimine cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical dialdehyde and a flexible triamine. So far, most of the reported organic cages are derived by symmetric building units. Asymmetric building blocks for the construction of such organic architectures are not the desirable choices, as they could lead to form mixture of isomeric cages. However, the asymmetric building blocks might form selectively one isomer only under the thermodynamic bias, which prefers the formation of one isomer over the other (s). In order to understand the factors that can direct such a process, three asymmetric dialdehydes (A, B and C) were synthesized and their reaction with a flexible amine X was carried out. Experimental outcomes suggested a striking difference in the abilities of isomer selection between aldehydes A/B and C. In case of aldehyde A/B selective formation of one oligoimine cage was observed, whereas aldehyde C led to form two isomeric oligoimine cages (Scheme 3). Experimental and theoretical findings have pointed out that the geometric features (shape and size) of the aldehyde play a decisive role in such isomer selection process. Scheme 3. Shape and size directed self-selection in organic imine cages. Part A of Chapter 5 describes the synthesis and characterization of a fluorescent organic cage compound and its application as a sensor for the detection of explosive picric acid (PA). Picric acid is known to be as explosive as trinitrotoluene (TNT) and one of the principle constituents of many unexplored landmines. Though there are several fluorescent polymers, metal-organic frameworks and small molecule based sensors have been devised in last few years but very little attention has been given towards selective and sensitive detection of picric acid. In this context desired organic cage compound 4 was synthesized by employing imine condensation between 4, 4 -diformyltriphenylamine (1) with 1, 3, 5 -tris(aminomethyl) - 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzene (2) followed by reduction of the imine bonds (Scheme 4). This fluorescent nature of the cage in both the solid and solution has been utilized for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). Among the various NACs tested it has been found that PA induces highest quenching of the initial fluorescence intensity of the cage solution. Furthermore, this cage has the ability to discriminate PA from other nitrophenolic compounds, such as 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) and 4 -nitrophenol. In addition to solution phase detection cage 4 has also been successfully utilized for the solid phase detection of PA. The experimental results demonstrates that high sensitivity of the cage towards PA is attributed to the stronger ground state complex formation between the cage and PA as well as excitation v energy transfer (EET) process from protonated cage to the picrate. This represents the first report of a cage compound as a sensor for nitroaromatic compounds. Scheme 4. Synthesis of a fluorescent organic cage for the selective detection of picric acid. Part B of Chapter 5 reports a new synthetic methodology to decorate covalent organic cages post-synthetically, based on one-pot copper(I) catalyzed A 3 coupling. A 3 -coupling is a three-component reaction between formaldehyde, secondary amine and terminal alkyne. In the present study selected organic cage 4 is furnished with six secondary amine moieties and thus it was allowed to react with 6 equiv. of formaldehyde and 6 equiv. of terminal alkyne in presence of CuI as a catalyst (Scheme 5). By employing this synthetic strategy parent cage 4 has been modified to cages 5 a-c with appendages phenyl-, xylyl- and napthyl-actylenes. The resulting decorated cages were characterized by multinuclear NMR (1 H and 13 C), MALDI-TOF and FTIR spectroscopy. All the post-synthetically decorated cages were found to be fluorescent in nature and thus in v order to explore their potential use as a chemosensor for nitroaromatic compounds, cage 5 a was tested. Experimental findings have suggested high selectivity of the cage towards nitroaromatic compounds. Interestingly, among the various nitroaromatics tested it has been observed that the cage is more sensitivity towards nitrophenolic compounds, whereas among the various nitrophenols tested, picric acid induced highest quenching.
