40|$|Because of the {{environmental}} pressure concerning both global and local pollution new ways of using energy are under study. Given that the Norwegian transport sector is a significant contributor to those pollutions at the national scale, the hydrogen and fuel cells technology is a potential solution thanks to its eco-friendly properties. This technology that allows transforming hydrogen and oxygen into electricity has many advantages but has also a cost, some drawbacks {{and has to be}} introduced properly in the transport market to insure the success of the energetic transition. By collecting information about existing projects and competitive fuels (diesel, battery, hydrogen and associated technologies) and by using the total cost of ownership as a comparative tool, the most relevant market segments to introduce fuel cells and hydrogen have been determined. This fuel comparison has been completed on a ferry, a light truck, a heavy truck and a car while other sectors have been covered more briefly. It appears that hydrogen has a significant advantage over batteries for medium and long distance trips as well as high energy consumption vehicles like heavy trucks. This advantage can even compete with diesel cars or light diesel trucks thanks to the Norwegian road tax exemption. However those applications are currently limited to <b>captive</b> <b>fleet</b> operation {{because of the lack of}} refueling infrastructure network. It has also been determined that, in the maritime sector, fuel cells are competitive with battery ferries for distances longer than 11. 5 km. A simplified life cycle assessment also allows us to state that in addition to bring an undisputable CO 2 emission reduction the replacement of diesel vehicle by a fuel cells vehicle also generates significant energy saving whatever the value chain used...|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{plants were}} opened in many European countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden. France launched local production of biodiesel fuel (referred to as diester) from rapeseed oil, which is mixed into regular diesel fuel {{at a level}} of 5%, and into the diesel fuel used by some <b>captive</b> <b>fleets</b> (e.g. public transportation) {{at a level of}} 30%. Renault, Peugeot and other manufacturers have certified truck engines for use with up to that level of partial biodiesel; experiments with 50% biodiesel are underway. During the same period, nations {{in other parts of the}} world also saw local production of biodiesel starting up: by 1998, the Austrian Biofuels Institute had identified 21 countries with commercial biodiesel projects. 100% biodiesel is now available at many normal service stations across Europe.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy has increased slowly in most sectors and the transport sector is predominantly depending on traditional fossil fuels notably petrol and diesel. This has created a difficult situation concerning the fuel supply and fuel prices {{as well as an}} increase of emissions of climate gasses. A number of local and regional projects have been carried out and are still ongoing regarding the use {{of renewable}} fuels in the transport sector. Most of those covers <b>captive</b> <b>fleets</b> of busses and lorries but also taxis and other passenger cars are participating. Common for this type of projects are that the fuel distribution system and the supply of fuel normally can be handled within reasonable resources since no extensive distribution system has to be built up. This also means that the experiences from those projects are difficult to apply on a European wide scale. The study "Renewable fuels for cross border transportation" is concentrating on cross border transport and basically leaving small <b>captive</b> <b>fleets</b> outside. It includes all modes of transport. The basis for the study are a) that the long term solutions should be based on the use {{of renewable energy}} for the fuels, b) the fuel distribution issue is the critical part of the development and therefore c) investments in intermediate solutions should fit into a long term concept. The study contains: A survey of promising technical concepts for vehicles, aeroplanes, ships and railroad locomotives intended for the use of non fossil fuels. A survey of energy resources to supply the cross border traffic with fuel for the different technical concepts studied. A description of the environmental consequences for different concepts of vehicle/crafts and fuels. A description of industrial concerns and other consequences for EU and the different Member States for different concepts. A proposal for a limited number concepts including implementation strategy in a long term (25 - 30 years) and in an intermediate (5 - 10 years) perspective...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, a new {{specification}} for synthetic fuels containing up to 7 % biodiesel (FAME) {{was approved}} (CEN TS 15940). This specification allows {{the sale of}} neat paraffinic diesel, such as Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) diesel, to <b>captive</b> <b>fleets</b> in Europe. Several aspects are important in the final end-use application, including {{the stability of the}} fuel. The current study evaluated the stability of neat GTL diesel and FAME/paraffinic fuel blends via standard laboratory stability tests commonly used to study petroleum-derived fuels. The stability of GTL diesel, containing biodiesel, was evaluated using the Rancimat, PetroOxy, and ASTMD 2274 tests. Selected samples were also evaluated using ASTM D 5304. The Rancimat results indicated that FAME/GTL diesel blends performed similar to the FAME/petroleum derived fuel blends. In the PetroOxy test, the addition of more than 2 v/v% of a highly stable FAME resulted in an unexpected boost in the stability of the FAME/GTL diesel blend. The ASTM D 2274 results were generally insensitive to the addition of FAME. The correlation between the PetroOxy and Rancimant tests was evaluated and found to be base fuel dependent. From this study it was concluded that GTL diesel (in blends with FAME) performed similar to petroleum-derived reference fuels in standard laboratory stability...|$|R

50|$|Cartagena {{remained}} a <b>captive</b> until the <b>fleet</b> reached Patagonia. On 1 April 1520 he secretly left the Victoria and reboarded the San Antonio, where he rallied supporters among the Spanish crew and officers {{in opposition to}} the Portuguese Magellan. In company with Concepcións captain Gaspar de Quesada, pilot Juan Sebastián Elcano and thirty Spanish crew members, Cartagena seized control of San Antonio and declared the vessel independent of Magellan's command. The officers of both Concepción and Victoria joined in the mutiny, and on 2 April 1520 a letter was sent to Magellan's flagship, the Trinidad, demanding that the captain-general acknowledge that the fleet was no longer under his command.|$|R

40|$|Scientific and {{technical}} information including field trials about uses of palm oil as fuel {{has been available}} {{for more than half}} a century now. Several ways were investigated, from the simple mixture with petroleum Diesel fuel, to more sophisticated solutions. The quality of vegetable oils in natura as fuel is difficult to assess because of interferences between properties of the triacylglycerols – the main components – and those of the many minor components, their content varying significantly from sample to sample. A methodology set up at Cirad allowed to investigate separately natural triacylglycerols alone and the effect of minor components. In addition to these laboratory experiments, engine test at bench and field trials performed in palm oil producing countries, show that this oil is among the best oils as fuel; palm kernel oil whose chemical and physical properties are very close to those of the best of the series investigated, namely copra oil, should display also very interesting properties as Diesel biofuel. Both oils do require external adaptation of the engine when using an indirect injection type engine but even heavier adaptations for a direct injection model. Thus for use as Diesel fuel palm and palm kernel oils are suitable for <b>captive</b> <b>fleets</b> or for engine gensets, to balance the adaptation cost by a scale-up effect either on the number of identical engines or on the nominal vegetable oil consumption per set. Direct use of palm et palm kernel oils fits very well with technical and economical conditions encountered in remote areas. It is also possible to mix palm oil to Diesel fuel either as simple blend or as micro-emulsion. 				Out of the direct use, palm oil methyl or ethyl ester, often referred to as biodiesel, displays properties similar to those of petroleum Diesel fuel. This technical solution which is suitable to feed all kinds of standard compression ignited engines requires a chemical plant for carrying out the alcoholysis reaction and processing of the crude glycerin by-product. Economical outputs depend also on market price of this last commodity. 				The last technique opening a way for using palm oil as fuel involves catalytic cracking, then allowing to feed any kind of engine –either spark or compression ignited- although a few results are available only from laboratory or small pilot scale experiments. If the economic viability would be favored by scale-up effect for large national or international markets assuming palm oil producing cost would become and remain competitive is spite of lack of harvest mechanization, and oils would remain available for large non food markets, as this is presently the case, there is a lack of technical and economical data. This is especially the case regarding the minimum size required for applying these more sophisticated chemical transformations –alcoholysis and cracking- for supplying energy under most critical conditions found in remote areas where millions of people are facing difficult access to both electric power and transportation fuels. 				Today large scale production and marketing of palm oil methyl or ethyl ester is under development in oil palm cropping countries like Malaysia, Thailand or Brazil. The follow-up depends on many parameters on environment, social and economic sides...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the recent}} Gulf oil spill, a {{collective}} conscious has begun to ponder the question: When will we stop using oil {{as a base for}} transportation fuel, and what will replace it? While it is unlikely that conventional, petroleum-based fuels will be completely replaced in the next decade; {{it is possible that the}} ever increasing demand for energy in the transportation sector could be met by a variety of fuels and technologies. The most likely options include biodiesel, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG) and electrification. One of the primary reasons for pursuing alternative fueled vehicles is to decrease emissions of environmentally harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. As legislation like the renewable-fuels standards and low-carbon fuel standards intensify, a niche market for alternative fuels is beginning to emerge. The importance of reducing energy demand and carbon intensities of fuels is going to greatly impact the type of vehicles and choices of fuels expected to be manufactured in the future automobile industry. Natural gas, as an alternative, is very attractive due to its low price and low carbon intensities. Per unit of energy, natural gas contains less carbon than any other fossil fuel, and thus produces lower carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions per vehicle mile traveled. While there is a current lack of infrastructure that has greatly limited natural gas use to <b>captive</b> public <b>fleets,</b> commercial industries are beginning to invest in alternative fuel vehicles. Making America less dependent on foreign oil is a national priority. President Obama, in accepting his party’s nomination, established his own clear goals: “For the sake of our economy, our security and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. ” While the United States imports more than 60 percent of the oil it uses, 98 percent of the natural gas used in the U. S. was produced in North America. Every gallon equivalent of natural gas used in vehicles is one less gallon of petroleum that has to be imported. (Federal NGV Tax Incentives, 2010) Despite the recent growth in interest of natural gas, there is still significant obstacles natural gas vehicles face in order to capture a major share of the market. Concerns amount around economics-whether the equivalent gasoline or diesel vehicle is cheaper, as well as concerns about safety and availability of refueling stations. This paper investigates evidence around all of these concerns as well as identifies markets where natural gas vehicles would be the most efficient...|$|R
