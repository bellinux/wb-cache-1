40|$|Rational choice {{accounts}} of political participation identify two major solutions to "the paradox of participation" — <b>collective</b> incentives and <b>selective</b> incentives. Prior findings regarding {{the viability of}} these solutions are seemingly inconclusive and contradictory. In our view, one important {{reason for this is}} that the applicability of these solutions varies across participatory modes. In this paper, we make a first attempt to develop a theoretical answer to the question of why this may be the case. We then test our predictions across four different modes of participation, using longitudinal data that eliminate or reduce the biases inherent in cross-sectional designs. Our results show different types of incentives to strike with distinctly variable force across different modes of participation. Most importantly, we find that whereas electoral modes of participation (voting and party activity) are affected by selective incentives only, the non-electoral modes (contacting and manifestations) are the consequence of both <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> incentives...|$|R

We take both a seman-tic and a syntactic approach in order to define a suitable notion of theory dilation {{in the context of}} approximate reasoning on the one hand, and a generalized no-tion of forgetting in propositional logic on the other hand. We place our work in the context of existing theories of approximation spaces and forgetting, and show that neighbourhoods obtained by combining <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> dilation pro-vide a suitable semantic framework within which to reason computationally with uncertainty in a classical setting...|$|R

It does this by reflecting on Habermas’ focus on human agency and, by reconsidering the fact value division, it proposes a new <b>collective</b> consisting of <b>selective</b> humans and non–humans.

40|$|Background: De Winter and Happee [1] {{examined}} whether science {{based on}} selective publishing of significant {{results may be}} effective in accurate estimation of population effects, and whether this is even more effective than a science in which all results are published (i. e., a science without publication bias). Based on their simulation study they concluded that ‘‘selective publishing yields a more accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything, (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective’’ (p. 4). Methods and Findings: Using their scenario with a small to medium population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more effective for the scientific <b>collective</b> than <b>selective</b> publishing of significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority of publishing everything over selective publishing. Conclusion: Publishing everything {{is more effective than}} only reporting significant outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{patterns of}} interest group collaboration at the EU level and investigates factors {{with the potential}} to influence collaborative behaviour. Ideas from the literature on collective action, interest group coalitions, American and European interest representation and new institutionalism create a framework for analysing the range of collaborative fora at the EU level and the factors driving collaboration among groups seeking to shape EU public policies. Empirical evidence drawn from a case study of collaboration by European environmental interest groups presents a number of conclusions about the nature of and reasons for collaboration. The European environmental interest groups favour informally organised, flexible coalitions in which the members decide their level of participation. The case study identifies <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> incentives, issues and allies (coalition partners) as factors driving collaborative behaviour. The case study also demonstrates the importance of considering the potential influence of opposition actors and the EU institutional framework on interest group collaboration. environmental policy; institutions; institutionalism; interest representation; lobbying; NGOs; political science...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses contextual {{explanations}} of regional governance {{to explore how}} the limitations to voluntary regionalism {{can lead to the}} more centralized, more regulated method of using regional special districts. An ICA perspective is used to discuss the range of choices in institutional arrangements available to jurisdictions. Motivations that jurisdictions may have to use more versus less autonomous methods of ICA are outlined to frame how regional districts fall within this spectrum. A rational choice perspective is also employed to identify the <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> benefits that motivate local actors to cooperate, as well as identify the potential transaction cost barriers to doing so. The analysis of this piece focuses on three specific types of special districts (fire, hospital and library districts) that are compared within the context of motivations to regional collective action. The assumptions from this analysis suggest that regional districts will act as a substitute for voluntary cooperation when the individual and collective benefits are threatened by high transaction costs. These assumptions are worked into sets of contextual propositions about how regional districts can present themselves as mechanisms of addressing collective action problems where substantial transaction cost barrier...|$|R
40|$|The {{drawing of}} {{boundaries}} for local government jurisdictions allocates {{costs and benefits}} to individuals and groups. For this reason boundary change decisions carry important distributional implications and can determine whose preferences are decisive in public decisions. This paper extends the model of boundary change as collective action. Boundary decisions are described {{as the product of}} actors eeking particular outcomes within a local context of existing overnments and established rules governing boundary change. While institutional changes have collective effects they also have distributive consequences for individuals and groups. These selective costs and benefits, rather than collective costs and benefits are most likely to provide incentives for collective action to alter local boundaries. One advantage of this collective action framework is that it provides a single explanation for the use of various instruments to create new boundaries or expand old ones. This approach also helps integrate the fragmented literature on local government boundary change by focusing on the role boundary entrepreneurs play in seeking institutional change and how <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> incentives motivate entrepreneurial action. In the final section we identify some limitations of the collective action framework and identify how adding management of conflict expansion to this framework may further enhance or understanding o...|$|R
40|$|People may {{engage in}} protest {{activity}} {{either because of}} <b>collective</b> incentives or <b>selective</b> incentives, {{or a combination of}} them. In this study we focus on the selective incentives part of the calculus of political participation, particularly the impact of the social dimension. We hypothesize that people will participate in demonstrations or other forms of protest, to a higher extent if they are afraid of rejection, but only if they feel that they have high social support for their own position. This hypothesis was supported in an online survey experiment where social support was manipulated. Results also revealed that individuals who were highly rejection sensitive were among the most likely to participate even though they did not believe protest activity to be an efficient way to bring about social change. This supports the notion that some individuals tend to engage in protest activity for purely social reasons. However it is still unclear whether these individuals are driven by an approach motivation to establish new social bonds or an avoidance motivation to escape possible social rejection...|$|R

This article examines the use of 18 th-century history in early 20 th-century politics. Building on a long-term survey of Swedish and Finnish estate and parliamentary debates, it analyses {{the political implications of}} differing national historiographies in the two successor states of the 18 th-century Swedish realm, focusing on how the ancient past and <b>collective</b> (and often <b>selective)</b> memories of the Age of Absolutism, the Age of Liberty and the Gustavian Age were used by parliamentarians in constitutional debates. The analysis demonstrates how the Finnish polity continued to be profoundly influenced by these 18 th-century constitutions even after the Russian Revolution, while Sweden took the post-French Revolution constitution of 1809 as its point of departure. In both countries, interpretations of the long 18 th century were ideologically motivated in an age of the parliamentarization of government and the democratization of the representative system. This leads us to a discussion of the history-political significance of the common and differing understandings of representative government in the two interconnected countries...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, {{community-based}} hazard mitigation (CBHM) has been newly proposed and implemented as an alternative conceptual model for emergency management to deal with disasters comprehensively in order to curtail skyrocketing disaster losses. Local community members have been growingly required to share information and responsibilities for reducing community vulnerabilities to natural and technological hazards and building a safer community. Consequently they are encouraged to join local mitigation programs and volunteer for collective mitigation action, but their contributions vary. This research examined factors associated with Tulsa Project Impact partners?? contributions to collective mitigation action. In the literature review, self-interest and social norms were identified and briefly discussed as two determinants to guide partners?? behavior by reviewing game theoretic frameworks and individual decision-making models. Partners?? collective interest in building a safer community and feelings of obligation to participate in collective mitigation action were also considered for this study. Thus, the major factors considered are: (1) <b>collective</b> interests, (2) <b>selective</b> benefits, (3) participation costs, (4) norms of cooperation, and (5) internalized norms of participation. Research findings showed that selective benefits and internalized norms of participation were the two best predictors for partners?? contributions to collective mitigation action. However, collective interests, participation costs, and norms of cooperation did not significantly influence partners?? contributions...|$|R

Starting from some reflections in philosophy about Other-ness and the sociological inquiries of building collective identities a fundamental problem re-mains: Who is the Other? Or: What does Europe have to gain from rediscovering the History of the Muslim Other and his normative space in order to understand his collective identity and to resituate his Otherness in an inclusive plural albeit value oriented Europe? There is no doubt that historians recognize the decisive role played by translations and Arab thought for the reception of the heritage of Antiq-uity and Greek philosophy.

In order to tackle this complex question some Islamic pasts will be remembered in a first step (I). Then a further look is thrown upon Islamic Law in the History of European Law (II), whereas the case of Spain is analysed as a problem of interacting and overlapping legal cultures on the basis of a critical analysis of research traditions (III).

40|$|As neo-liberalisation adapts its {{new forms}} and {{eventually}} finds its best {{ground in the}} Chinese city, surging tides of urban redevelopment/gentrification are widespread and bring about immense displacement. Consequently, protests and appeals against redevelopment and demolition have become one focal point of Chinese citizen’s weiquan (rights defending) movements. Yet, these movements are often {{in the form of}} individual resistance (e. g. the so-called nail households), and rarely lead to progressive results. Little is known about under what circumstances and how citizens could be mobilised and organised in collective resistance. Drawing on an in-depth investigation on the resistance movements against the Enninglu gentrification project in Guangzhou, China, this paper aims to understand how different actors are mobilised together to seek spatial justice and to defend the urban commons, in particular the cultural heritages and collective memories of the historical area of Enninglu area. Since 2005, Guangzhou has seen the rise of neoliberal urban policies. And the city is engulfed in a new wave of gentrification featuring ambitious urban upgrading scheme aiming for growth-seeking and city re-imaging. As a historical area located in the old city core of Guangzhou, Enninglu is threatened by an ambitious gentrification project involving large-scale demolition and displacement. To resist the redevelopment project, Enninglu residents launched a campaign since 2010, involving various forms of resistance. These resistance movements have received great support from activists, volunteers, academics, and local media. This research shows that while local residents’ resistance is motivated by defending their spatial rights, other actors are largely mobilised by the aestheticisation of <b>selective</b> <b>collective</b> memories and cultural values of the historical area. Although incongruence occurs between the two groups owning to the frictions between the ‘conceived space’ and ‘perceived space’, the resistance movements did achieve some modest progresses and forced the local authority modifying the gentrification plan for several times. These resistance movements have gone beyond defending ‘the right to appropriation’, and involved struggles for ‘the right to participation’, although they are still far from seriously challenging the trajectory of (re) urbanisation dominated by neo-liberalisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{collective}} action problem {{in political science}} examines {{the circumstances under which}} groups can be successfully formed and maintained. While earlier generations of political scientists believed that groups developed in democracies {{because of the nature of}} democratic culture and procedures, Mancur Olson (The Logic of Collective Action, 1965) demonstrated that free-riding doomed many attempts at <b>collective</b> action unless <b>selective</b> benefits were granted to members [...] hence automobile association members receive free travel services, for example. Subsequent theories posited other reasons for successful {{collective action}}, such as communication, leadership and anticipated returns from joining. 	Tests of these hypotheses have taken place primarily in laboratory experiments. This study conducts a real-world natural experiment, examining interjurisdictional competition (IJC) [...] a government's offer of incentives for businesses to locate within its environs as opposed to the territories of others [...] in the setting of urbanized areas of various degrees of fragmentation (political organization as one, several or many local governments). If the free-rider hypothesis is true, IJC would increase with higher fragmentation. 	As the "free-rider" title suggests, IJC has been portrayed in game theory as a prisoners' dilemma. However, more detailed analysis in this study reveals several possible games, each posing a related collective action problem. 	Methodologically, additive indices from a nationwide survey of economic development practices measure the intensity of IJC effort. Urban area fragmentation is represented by indices using the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index method. The major hypothesis [...] IJC is a function of fragmentation [...] is analyzed using OLS regression. 	The regressions refute the free-rider hypothesis. The statistical analysis then examines the subsequent explanations of collective action. Anticipated returns cannot be substantiated; however, civil society-based indicators show communication and leadership to be causes of successful collective action. 	Finally, a case study of Hampton Roads (the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Virginia metropolitan area) provides a historical narrative of the efficacy of communication and leadership in successful collective action as well as a possible example of game transition from the prisoners' dilemma to an assurance game...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have had}} a bad sick week, mostly in bed--with putting pen to paper quite out of my power: {{otherwise}} I should sooner have thanked you for the so generous spirit of that letter, and told you, with emotion, how much it has touched me. I am really more overcome than I can say by your having been able to indulge in such freedom of mind and grace of speculation, during these dark days, on behalf of my poor old rather truncated edition, in fact entirely frustrated one--which has the grotesque likeness for me of a sort of miniature Ozymandias of Egypt ("look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!")--round which the lone and level sands stretch further away than ever. It is indeed consenting to be waved aside a little into what was once blest literature to so much as answer the question you are so handsomely impelled to make--but my very statement about the matter can only be, alas, a melancholy, a blighted confusion. That Edition has been, {{from the point of}} view of profit either to the publishers or to myself, practically a complete failure; vaguely speaking, it doesn't sell--that is, my annual report of what it does--the whole 24 vols.--in this country amounts to about £25 from the Macmillans; and the ditto from the Scribners in the U.S. to very little more. I am past all praying for anywhere; I remain at my age (which you know,) and after my long career, utterly, insurmountably, unsaleable. And the original preparation of that <b>collective</b> and <b>selective</b> series involved really the extremity of labour--all my [...] "earlier" [...] things--of which the Bostonians would have been, if included, one--were so intimately and interestingly revised. The edition is from that point of view really a monument (like Ozymandias) which has never had the least intelligent critical justice done it--or any sort of critical attention at all paid it--and the artistic problem involved in my scheme was a deep and exquisite one, and moreover was, as I held, very effectively solved. Only it took such time--and such taste--in other words such aesthetic light. No more commercially thankless job of the literary order was (Prefaces and all--they of a thanklessness!) accordingly ever achieved. The immediate inclusion of the Bostonians was rather deprecated by the publishers (the Scribners, who were very generally and in a high degree appreciative: I make no complaint of them at all!)--and there were reasons for which I also wanted to wait: we always meant that that work should eventually come in. Revision of it loomed peculiarly formidable and time-consuming (for intrinsic reasons,) and as other things were more pressing and more promptly feasible I allowed it to stand over--with the best intentions, and also in company with a small number more of provisional omissions. But by this time it had stood over, disappointment had set in; the undertaking had begun to announce itself as a virtual failure, and we stopped short where we were--that is when a couple of dozen volumes were out. From that moment, some seven or eight years ago, nothing whatever has been added to the series--and there is little enough appearance now that there will ever. Your good impression of the Bostonians greatly moves me--the thing was no success whatever on publication in the Century (where it came out,) and the late R. W. Gilder, of that periodical, wrote me at the time that they had never published anything that appeared so little to interest their readers. I felt about it myself then that it was probably rather a remarkable feat of objectivity--but I never was very thoroughly happy about it, and seem to recall that I found the subject and the material, after I had got launched in it, under some illusion, less interesting and repaying than I had assumed it to be. All the same I should have liked to review it for the Edition--it would have come out a much truer and more curious thing (it was meant to be curious from the first;) but there can be no question of that, or of the proportionate Preface to have been written with it, at present--or probably ever within my span of life. Apropos of which matters I at this moment hear from Heinemann that four or five of my books that he has have quite (entirely) ceased to sell and that he must break up the plates. Of course he must; I have nothing to say against it; and the things in question are mostly all in the Edition. But such is [...] "success"! I should have liked to write that Preface to the Bostonians--which will never be written now. But think of noting now that that is a thing that has perished! ...|$|R
