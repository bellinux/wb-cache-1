To achieve a desirable humus content, {{it was necessary to}} know the relation between supply of humus and humus content, here studied, and the relation between humus content and productivity. A field trial begun in 1911 to compare <b>complete</b> <b>fallow</b> with normal exploitation indicated two axioms: from a supply of crude organic matter a certain constant part became humus each year; from humus in soils a certain constant part was mineralized each year. If supply was equal each year it was possible to derive the following formula for the rise or fall in humus content: y = y m - (y m - y 0) (1 - K 2) t, where y = humus content, y m = humus content at ultimate equilibrium,y 0 = initial humus content, K 2 = rate of mineralization (see axiom 2), and t = time in years. Further y m = K 1 /K 2 x, where K 1 = rate of humification (see axiom 1), and x = supply with raw organic material. These formulae were tested in the few available experiments, suitable for the purpose (which did not include the classical Rothamsted fields). K 1 was 0. 4; thus 40 % of the supply becomes humus each year. K 2 had values between 0. 015 and 0. 02; from this it followed that 2 % of the humus was yearly mineralized. No difference was yet found in the value of either coefficients for different organic materials and in different soils...|$|E

To fill this gap of knowledge, detailed {{interviews were conducted with}} 108 farm households about their rationale in managing the {{soil fertility}} of 307 individual fields in the agro-pastoral village territory of Chikal in western Niger. To amplify the farmers’ information on manuring and corralling practices, repeated measurements of applied amounts of manure were carried out within six 1 -km^ 2 monitoring areas from February to October 1998. The interviews revealed that only 2 % of the fields were completely fallowed for a period of 1 – 15 years, but 40 % of the fields were at least partially fallowed. Mulching of crop residues was mainly practiced to fight wind erosion but was restricted to 36 % of the surveyed fields given the alternative use of straw as livestock feed. Manure application and livestock corralling, as most effective tools to enhance soil fertility, were targeted to less than 30 % of the surveyed fields. The application of <b>complete</b> <b>fallow</b> and manuring and corralling practices were strongly related to the households’ endowment with resources, especially with land and livestock. Within particular fields, measures were mainly applied to spots of poor soil fertility, while the restoration of the productivity of hard pans was of secondary importance. Given the limited spatial coverage of indigenous soil fertility measures and their strong dependence on farmers’ wealth, supplementary strategies to restrict the decline of soil fertility in the drought prone areas of Niger with their heavily weathered soils are needed...|$|E
40|$|Cover or {{catch crops}} have {{beneficial}} effects for soil, water, erosion, etc. If harvested, {{they also provide}} feedstock for biogas without competition for arable land in regions, where only one main crop can be produced per year. On average gross energy yields of approx. 1300 m³ methane (CH 4) ha- 1 can be expected from 4. 5 tonnes (t) of cover crop dry matter (DM) in Austria. Considering the total energy invested from cultivation to compression for biofuel use a net energy yield of about 1000 m³ CH 4 ha- 1 is remaining. With the straw of grain maize or Corn Cob Mix (CCM) similar energy yields can be achieved. In comparison to catch crops remaining on the field as green manure or to <b>complete</b> <b>fallow</b> between main crops the effects on soil, water and climate can be improved if cover crops are harvested without soil compaction and digestate is returned to the field in an amount equivalent to cover crop removal. In this way, the risk of nitrate leaching can be reduced approx. by 25 % in comparison to full fallow. The risk of nitrous oxide emissions may be reduced up to 50 % by contrast with cover crops serving as green manure. The effects on humus content and erosion are similar or better than those of cover crops used as green manure when {{the same amount of}} biomass was produced. With higher biomass production the positive effects increase even if cover crops are harvested and the only digestate is brought back to the fields. The ecological footprint of arable farming can be reduced by approx. 50 % considering the substitution of natural gas with CH 4 produced from cover crops...|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{then began}} a {{campaign}} of his own to bring peace—that is, an amicable reduction of profit-destroying competition—between the two trunk lines. In the working out of this peace, Gowen's erstwhile syndicate for constructing the South Penn line that would turn the Reading into a viably competitive trunk line was undermined entirely, leaving little prospect of completing that project. Ultimately, significant portions of the South Penn's right of way and partly <b>completed</b> gradings lay <b>fallow</b> until they were eventually utilized in the 1930s for construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.|$|R
