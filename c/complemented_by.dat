The {{pathophysiology}} of the septic response is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon which in part involves the activation of <b>complement</b> <b>by</b> bacterial endotoxin. A monoclonal antibody to human complement factor B, code-named 1 H 5, which was capable of specifically inhibiting the alternative pathway of complement activation at concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml, is described. This agent {{had no effect on}} the classical pathway of complement activation. It was capable of preventing the activation of <b>complement</b> <b>by</b> even high concentrations (0. 1 mg/ml) of whole endotoxin; however, it was ineffective in preventing activation of <b>complement</b> <b>by</b> endotoxin derived from a rough mutant. This agent could potentially be used in the treatment of sepsis...|$|R

40|$|Ca++ potentiates the {{inactivation}} {{of human}} <b>complement</b> <b>by</b> streptokinase-activated plasmin and chloroform-activated bovine plasmin.

C' 2 and C' 4 are most readily inactivated by plasmin in the presence of Ca++, while C' 1 disappears first in the absence of Ca++.
