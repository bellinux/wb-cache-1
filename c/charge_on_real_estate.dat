40|$|Among {{the most}} {{troublesome}} urban problems facing American society {{are those that}} are closely tied to how land is used, including how land should be developed and how land use resources should be allocated. Most of our population lives and works in metropolitan areas and is intimately affected by how these urban land use related problems are dealt with. Satisfactory progress in solving or at least substantially alleviating these problems may be necessary if this country is to avoid increasing the polarity between rich and poor and between privileged and disadvantaged that can have such long-term adverse national consequences. Among the many current land use related urban problems are housing quality and affordability, especially for the poor; neighborhood security from crime and violence; the extent and impact of racial, ethnic and class segregation in urban communities; pollution and other threats to the natural environment; the amount and burden of taxes and other <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> including property taxes and utility costs; and channeling urban growth and revitalization efforts. Concerns over these and other land use related problems are accentuated by uncertainties as to the future. That American urban areas will change over time is assured. Whether that change will be for better or worse is difficult to predict, but current trends justify pessimism about many areas...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to withdraw the [...] by 1934, but the Nazi government decided to continue to use the , which enjoyed a considerable trust due to its stability. Nevertheless, the Nazis deliberately overissued both currencies to finance infrastructure investments by the state, and expanded government employment and expenditure on items such as armaments. By 1935, laws limiting increases of prices, wages, and rents were needed to suppress inflation. Enormous extra taxes, <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> owners (RM 1 bn in 1936), and {{on the occasion of}} the anti-Semitic November Pogrom (...) , on Jewish Germans (RM 1 bn in 1938), could not stabilise the economy for long. The start of World War II was used to justify general price controls and rationing. Thus inflation was officially hidden, and was expressed as ever-growing aggregate savings of the population, which could only spend its earnings on limited rations of goods at artificially low prices. However, inflation could clearly be seen in the rising prices on the black market. During the war, the German economy was supported by war booty taken from occupied countries, continuing to some extent until 1944. By the end of the war, the oversupply of banknotes and coins (RM 3.9 bn in 1933, RM 60 bn in 1945) became obvious, openly showing up in inflated black market prices.|$|R
50|$|The Prices paid {{index is}} an index that {{measures}} {{changes in the}} prices paid {{for goods and services}} used in crop and livestock production and family living. The production component of the index accounts for over 65% of the total, and family living expenses represented by the CPI-U account for less than 20% of the index. The remaining components are interest <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> farm <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and non-real estate debt, taxes payable <b>on</b> farm <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> and wage rates paid to hired farm labor. NASS currently publishes the index on a 1990-92 = 100 base. Used in calculating the federal grazing fee, among other purposes. The index of prices paid on a 1910-14 = 100 base is called the parity index and is used in calculating the parity ratio.|$|R
50|$|A {{luxury tax}} {{is a tax}} on luxury goods: {{products}} not considered essential. A luxury tax may be modeled after a sales tax or VAT, charged as a percentage on all items of particular classes, except that it mainly affects the wealthy because the wealthy {{are the most likely}} to buy luxuries such as expensive cars, jewelry, etc. It may also be applied only to purchases over a certain amount; for instance, some U.S. states <b>charge</b> luxury tax <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> transactions over a limit.|$|R
40|$|With rapid {{recovery}} from the financial crisis, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> prices in China have increased dramatically over recent years. Increase in demand for properties in China was originally driven {{by the desire to}} improve living standards and later reinforced by the opportunities offered for investment and speculation. Speculators are looking for capital gain and many of them do not lease out the properties on hand. State Grid Corporation of China performed a survey in 660 cities and found that 65. 4 million of residential properties had not consumed any electricity in the past six months. Holding the properties will reduce the supply of residential premises in the market and thus, drive up the property prices. In order to avoid a possible bubble in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market, the Chinese government reconsidered the plan discussed in the Third Plenary Session of the 16 th Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) held in October 2003 to reform the tax system on properties. The plenum deliberated and approved the document titled, “The decision of the CPC Central Committee on Issues Regarding the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economic System” (the “Document”). The Document specified that reform on taxation system in urban and rural areas should be introduced. When conditions were ready, a unified tax system on immovable properties should be implemented to replace the current fees and <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> transactions. Starting in 2003, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) began the pilot running of the <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> Tax in provinces and 32 cities and counties in three batches. The pilot running involved cooperation from different parties in the regulatory bodies to test the feasibility of implementing the tax law, but no tax had been levied. In late April 2010, the press reported that “the State Council approved the introduction of a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> tax trial program which would be launched in Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen. In addition, the trial program would be extended to Shanghai after the end of World Expo at the end of October 2010. On May 19, 2009, the State Council released the “Circular on Approval and Transmission of the ‘National Development and Reform Commission, Opinion on Intensifying the Reform of the Economic System in 2009 ’” (the “Circular”). The Circular stated clearly that reform of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> tax system had to be intensified. In addition, it delegated MOF, SAT, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to be responsible for studying the introduction of <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> Tax. There were concerns over government policies to control <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> prices. Investors worried about the impact of policies restricting investment in the property sector and the corresponding effect on the banking industry. Critics also said that the introduction of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> tax would increase the cost of holding properties. The resulting reduction in demand for properties will affect the desire of property developers in building new residential and commercial buildings. This will affect not only the construction sector, but also those industries relating closing to the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> business, including coal, steel, cement, and furniture. As a result, the demand for loans from financial institutions will decline. This would have significant negative impact on property market and on the investment atmosphere in securities market. Although in response to media enquiries on the press report, the spokesperson of the SAT replied that no information with regard to the approval was received, the share prices had reflected the bad news. Shortly after the press report on the issue of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> tax, during the week of April 18 - 22, 2010, the Shanghai Composite Index had its biggest weekly decline in five months. However, commentators argued that the proposed regulation <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> tax is not an additional levy but a restructuring of current system of taxes and levies.
