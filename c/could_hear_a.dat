5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the night, the {{children}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> dog barking somewhere nearby, {{but no one}} came to their aid. As the night wore on, Hazel talked less and less, until she finally became silent.|$|E
60|$|The little canoe {{swung into}} the stream, {{and as it}} sprung forward in {{response}} to the vigorous dig of the paddles they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> angry shout.|$|R
60|$|Carroll got {{no farther}} than the scuttle, for the saloon {{floorings}} on the depressed side were already awash and he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> ominous splashing and gurgling.|$|R
60|$|Ronald listened intently, but <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing. <b>A</b> {{moment later}} a dark figure came up.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} mixed and overdubbed at Studio Des Dames, Paris in January 1978. All sources agree that overdubbing {{took place on}} Live and Dangerous, {{although}} there is considerable disagreement {{about the extent of}} them. According to Visconti, the album was [...] "75% recorded in the studio" [...] with only the drums and audience noise remaining from the original live recordings. Visconti later said the overdubs and production were essential in order that the listener <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> professional sounding band. He claims to have created some audience sounds from a keyboard-triggered tape loop in a similar manner to a Mellotron or sampling keyboard. Nevertheless, Visconti was happy with the production and believes the end result sounds authentic.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was widely {{acclaimed}} in publications such as Publishers Weekly, MTV, Ain't it Cool News, Complex magazine, Comic Book Resources, iFanboy and ComicsAlliance; they all praised Vaughan's ability to incorporate elements of different genres, establishing the vast setting and mythology, and introducing characters that engaged the reader. Multiple reviewers likened {{the book to}} a combination of sci-fi/fantasy works such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings and classic works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and the New Testament. AICN singled-out the use of the newborn Hazel as a lone individual to chronicle large-scale events from a past perspective, and Alex Zalben of MTV Geek remarking that he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> John Williams score as he read the book. Multiple reviewers also lauded Vaughan for beginning the story with Hazel's birth rather than hurting the story's pace with copious exposition of Alana and Marko's initial meeting and courtship. Todd Allen of The Beat approved of the book's unique [...] "flavor", singling out the characters' motivations, the immersiveness of its surrealist setting, the strangeness of the story's various oddities and the timely nature of the story's political undertones. Both Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review and P. S. Hayes of Geeks of Doom called the series a [...] "classic"; Hayes also praised Image Comics for publishing such an [...] "original" [...] series. Also widely praised was Fiona Staples' artwork, which was characterized as [...] "glorious", with Zalben predicting that readers would [...] "fall head over heels in love" [...] with it, and Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources positively comparing it to that of Leinil Francis Yu, specifically her use of delicate lines to frame characters with large, bold figures and Staples' mixture of the familiar and the foreign together in her character designs to create a visually cohesive universe. AICN singled out Staples' handling of grand, sweeping space shots and other genre trappings, as well as her mastery of facial expressions – which AICN felt was perfectly suited to Vaughan's subtle dialogue. Todd Allen of The Beat wrote that Staples' landscapes at times play as much a part in the story as the foreground.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} recording that way, [...] "In the past, we've always done one instrument {{at a time and}} it takes twice as long, and half the members of the band are gone once their parts are done. [...] This way we all got to enjoy the entire process together and every two days we <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> rough mix of what that specific track sounded like." ...|$|E
5000|$|The unusual {{title of}} the album came from a dream that Linkous had - he {{described}} it as being [...] "about General Lee having a crude submarine back in the Civil War, and the dream I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> old-time band playing inside, all distorted by the water".|$|R
60|$|While {{emptying}} the buckets at {{the back}} of the house he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> animated conversation in progress within-doors between his great-aunt, the Drusilla of the sign-board, and some other villagers. Having seen the school-master depart, they were summing up particulars of the event, and indulging in predictions of his future.|$|R
60|$|Here a long talk followed. It was so {{low that}} Jerry <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> word.|$|R
2500|$|Rachmaninoff also possessed {{an uncanny}} memory—one {{that would help}} put him in good stead {{when he had to}} learn the {{standard}} piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a decade after that. Siloti would give him a long and demanding piece to learn, such as Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel. Two days later Rachmaninoff would play it [...] "with complete artistic finish." [...] Alexander Goldenweiser said, [...] "Whatever composition was ever mentioned—piano, orchestral, operatic, or other—by a Classical or contemporary composer, if Rachmaninoff had at any time heard it, and most of all if he liked it, he played it {{as though it were a}} work he had studied thoroughly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Circa the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, {{less than}} 5% of New Zealand was held as Māori {{customary}} land. In 2002, the Privy Council {{confirmed that the}} Maori Land Court, which does not have judicial review jurisdiction, was the exclusive forum for territorial aboriginal title claims (i.e. those equivalent to a customary title claim) [...] In 2003, Ngati Apa v Attorney-General overruled In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach and Wi Parata, declaring that Māori could bring claims to the foreshore in Land Court. The Court also indicated that customary aboriginal title interests (non-territorial) might also remain around the coastline. [...] The Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 extinguished those rights before any lower court <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> claim to either territorial customary title (the Maori Land Court) or non-territorial customary rights (the High Court's inherent common law jurisdiction). That legislation has been condemned by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. [...] The 2004 Act was repealed {{with the passage of}} the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011.|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E
60|$|A short {{distance}} off, Ralph could see parties with lanterns; {{and one of}} them seemed approaching. Far in his rear, he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> occasional shot; and it rushed across his mind, at once, that the French had been defeated, and were falling back upon Orleans. These lights, therefore, must {{be in the hands of}} Germans.|$|R
60|$|The {{path was}} so narrow that two could seldom come up abreast, and so steep {{that the enemy}} had much ado to {{struggle}} and stumble upwards. The men seemed half unwilling to proceed, and hung back more than once; but Amyas <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> authoritative voice behind, and presently there emerged to the front, sword in hand, a figure at which Amyas and Cary both started.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> myself <b>a</b> mile away," [...] {{the trooper}} said. [...] "Still, that horse of yours is making row {{enough for a}} squadron." ...|$|R
60|$|All <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> soft patter on the leaves. Then {{distinct}} footfalls {{broke the}} silence.|$|E
60|$|The house bell {{began to}} ring violently; and they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{confused}} noise of voices and footsteps without.|$|E
60|$|Listening attentively, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> low {{rustling}} sound, with {{sometimes a}} faint crack as of a breaking stick.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} years of his life he lived in a hogan with his wife at the Red Lake Trading Post near Tonalea, Arizona on Navajo Nation land. At that time, he was a sheep herder, drove his own wagon, and claimed he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> {{approaching}} automobile from 10 miles away, although his eyesight was no longer good. [...] His wife Susie's eyesight was good, but her hearing was poor.|$|R
60|$|It seemed, indeed, as if {{the storm}} had made its last effort in the great surge that had shifted the vessel forward. For {{although}} the waves still struck her with tremendous force, and they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> occasional rending and splintering of the timbers astern, she no longer moved, although she quivered {{from end to end}} under each blow, and worked as if at any moment she would break into fragments.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} stroll up and down. The night was wonderfully still. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> {{somebody}} {{walking up the}} drive--one of the maids, I supposed, returning from her evening out. I <b>could</b> even <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> bird rustling in the ivy {{on the walls of}} the stables.|$|R
60|$|They paused, and <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{confused}} {{sound of}} shouting, and a noise as of a tumult. They listened attentively.|$|E
60|$|During the pauses {{of the low}} {{conversation}} {{of the two men}} still sitting by the fire, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> footfall outside.|$|E
60|$|Walter listened intently. He <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> deep thundering noise, {{which was}} {{certainly}} {{made by the}} hoofs {{of more than two}} horses.|$|E
60|$|A buzz of excited comment {{rose from}} below, {{and though he}} <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> word beyond the water-boy's call {{he was able to}} imagine the comment.|$|R
60|$|They all rose {{quickly to}} their feet. In a {{momentary}} lull of the storm, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> distinctly <b>a</b> girl's shrill call from outside, {{followed by the}} clamour of angry voices.|$|R
60|$|The grave fronts and bastions {{were wrapped}} in silence; so much so, that, {{standing}} awhile {{in the inner}} ward, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> through <b>an</b> open window a faintly clicking sound from within.|$|R
60|$|Overhead, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{constant}} tramping of {{feet and}} murmur of voices. They {{tried to make}} out what was being said, but could not.|$|E
60|$|Frank <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> low moaning noise, {{rapidly growing}} louder, {{and then he}} saw a white line on the water coming along with {{extraordinary}} velocity.|$|E
60|$|Then I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> curious pattering {{upon the}} door, almost like some one {{feeling for the}} handle in the dark, and Pyecraft's {{familiar}} grunts.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a sudden}} and {{involuntary}} announcement, though it was best it should be so under the circumstances. It was long before Maud <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>an</b> outline, even, of the details, but she bore them better than Willoughby could have hoped. The excitement had been so high, as to brace the mind to meet any human evil. The sorrow that came afterwards, though sweetened by so many tender recollections, and chastened hopes, was deep and enduring.|$|R
60|$|The only {{reply that}} he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> for <b>a</b> little while was the smack of the horse's hoofs on the {{moistening}} road, and the cluck of the milk in the cans behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... "The servants' wing {{is right}} over the stables, a long way off," [...] Cecil remarked. [...] "They <b>could</b> never <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> bell there that rang {{from any of the}} living-rooms." ...|$|R
