25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a <b>continuous</b> <b>miner</b> propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E
2500|$|Shortwall mining, {{a method}} {{currently}} accounting {{for less than}} 1 percent of deep coal production, {{involves the use of}} a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The <b>continuous</b> <b>miner</b> shears coal panels [...] wide and more than a half-mile (1km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.|$|E
2500|$|Continuous mining {{utilizes}} a <b>Continuous</b> <b>Miner</b> Machine {{with a large}} rotating {{steel drum}} equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a “room and pillar” (also known as “bord and pillar”) systemwhere the mine is divided {{into a series of}} 20-to-30-foot (5–10 m) “rooms” or work areas cut into the coalbedit can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut [...] (or a bit more with MSHA permission) (12 meters or roughly 40ft in South Africa before the <b>Continuous</b> <b>Miner</b> goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the [...] "continuous" [...] miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the [...] "continuous" [...] label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} examining the risk of silica (7631869) dust exposure in mine workers exposed to <b>continuous</b> <b>miners</b> equipped with flooded bed scrubbers. Recent reductions in {{the density of the}} filter media in scrubber filter panels have suggested concomitant decreases in dust collection efficiencies and increases in the exposure levels of mine workers to respirable silica dust. A description of the structure and operation of <b>continuous</b> <b>miners</b> with flooded bed scrubbers was presented. The respirable silica collection efficiencies of wire mesh filter panels constructed using 10, 15, 20, or 30 layers of stainless steel wire mesh and of two synthetic filters were examined using both high and low capacity scrubbers with supplying air velocities of 2, 200 or 3, 500 feet per minute at the scrubber filter. The respective collection efficiencies of the 10 and 20 layer filters at the two air velocities were 58 % and 76 %, and 69 % and 84 %. The highest collection efficiencies were measured using the 30 layer wire filter and the two synthetic filter panels composed of nonwoven synthetic fiber and an array of nylon brushes. The relative overall performance of each type of scrubber was determined using data on the silica collection efficiency and the air moving capacity of each filter panel. The 30 layer wire mesh panel and the synthetic filters were the most effective in removing silica dust. Based on these findings, the 30 layer stainless steel wire mesh and the synthetic filter panels were recommended by NIOSH for use in flooded bed scrubbers to improve silica collection.
