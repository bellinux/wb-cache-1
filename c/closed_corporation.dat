Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Financial Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{report of}} the {{accounting}} officer is of little or no value. There is uncertainty about {{the duties of the}} accounting officer where there are material omissions and mistakes in the accounting records and financial statements of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation</b> because the {{report of the}} accounting officer must only state that the financial statements are in agreement with the accounting records. Nowhere in the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act it is stated what the duties of the accounting officer are whether he is aware or not of such mistakes or omissions. The <b>close</b> <b>corporation</b> doesn't require the accounting officer to do an audit on the books and records of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation,</b> and the accounting officers are therefore under the impression that they may not be held liable for all the debts of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation.</b> The accounting officer is however vulnerable as his duties in terms of the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act are far reaching and he cannot fulfil his duties completely unless he has done an audit, and can therefore be held liable for the debts of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation.</b> He can further be held liable for the debts of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation</b> due to the following: 7. 1 the shortcomings in the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act nr. 69 of 1984; 7. 2 the impracticability of the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act; 7. 3 the vagueness and indistinctness of certain articles in the Act that the accounting officer must comply with or are exposed to; 7. 4 the accounting officer may use his professional judgment to investigate the accounting records of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation,</b> and nothing prohibits him to do so if he think it lit. If however he is of the opinion that {{it is not necessary to}} investigate the accounting records, this will contribute towards the accounting officer becoming liable for the debts of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation,</b> although the Act doesn't require the accounting officer to do an audit on the books and records of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation.</b> In the case where the accounting officer decides to investigate the books and records of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation,</b> his duties are extensive because he takes the decision to investigate. 7. 5 The accounting officer act in many cases as advisor/bookkeeper/ accountant for the CC, because of the size and nature of the entity, and by doing that, he then participates in the management of the CC and he is then vulnerable in terms of section 64 of the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act to be liable for all the debts of the corporation, without being the accounting officer's intention to participate in the management of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation.</b> 7. 6 The powers of the accounting officer are not fully addressed in the <b>Close</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act and the accounting officer is not properly protected by the Act. Because of the current <b>Close</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act, the interpretation and use thereof, the accounting officer is excessively vulnerable to creditors and third parties of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation</b> and he can be held liable for all the debts of the <b>close</b> <b>corporation.</b> Amendments and changes to the act are necessary to clarify the duties of the accounting officer and to get certainty about certain articles in the Act which are vague.

40|$|The main {{governance}} {{problem in}} <b>close</b> <b>corporations</b> is the expropriation of minority shareholders by the controlling shareholder.

We test this prediction on two datasets of <b>close</b> <b>corporations.</b> Our evidence indicates that control dilution is associated with lower expropriation of minority shareholders. An important implication of our findings is that control dilution, which has been typically viewed as detrimental to firm performance in public firms, is beneficial in <b>close</b> <b>corporations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Following the {{restoration}} in 1660 {{the governance of}} the corporation declined until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 again brought order. The borough was both subject to disastrous manipulation by Charles II and James II and also {{by the rise of}} party politics. The town was strongly puritan and during the winter of 1662/63 Royal commissioners arrived to enforce the Corporation Act 1661 and ask all officeholders and freeman to renounce the 'Puritan Covenant'. Half of the assembly were purged. In 1684 the charter was then called in and replaced by another which named to new officeholders {{and for the first time}} in its history Portmen were imposed on the town many of whom were outsiders, Freemen were refused participation in the borough government. The aim was to create a compliant <b>closed</b> <b>corporation.</b> Control over the Holy Rood Fair which took place on St Margaret's Green was passed to the Corporation. A further charter was imposed by James II in 1688 without revoking the earlier charter and the result was confusion and chaos and permanent problems in 1835. In 1719 the corporation blocked proposals to make the River Orwell navigable as far as Stowmarket; further plans were raised in 1790 and the work was completed by 1793 after which numerous maltings were soon operating in Stowmarket.|$|E
