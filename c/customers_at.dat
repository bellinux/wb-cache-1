5|$|Cecil Roland McKenzie {{was a young}} {{electrical}} engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Years Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a wireless room in the attic. The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.|$|E
5|$|Orders for the A318 {{have been}} {{relatively}} slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737–600. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model compared to 69 for the 737-600. The sales pace has {{been influenced by the}} strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E-Jets series. The biggest A318 <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), LATAM Airlines Group (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).|$|E

5|$|The Bulletin {{noted that}} a 2011 edition of the drink {{produced}} in Oregon was made with bacon vodka manufactured on site at the restaurant The Blacksmith. A report by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in April 2012 observed that a variety on the cocktail made by mixologist Paul Yeomans in Florida was concocted utilizing bacon salt and tomato water, infused with cucumber vodka. This version was a favorite selection among <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida. The Food Network recommended additional ingredients including lemon juice, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, and horseradish.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of standard gauge, Flekkefjord went from being an important hub for transport along the south coast, to merely being a branch station. However, the number of daily trains to Sira and Moi had increased to twelve, operated with Class 86 and Class 87 multiple units. The Class 87 was used until 1956, when Class 86 came into service. In 1966, Class 87 was reintroduced. Important cargo <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> the time were Draco (who made boats) and Halvorsens Kjelfabrikk (who made boilers). From 1981, the Class 89 came into use, remaining until the station was closed in 1990.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> {{outrageous}} prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with back support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field. Bullpens are located in foul territory in the outfield, with the home team occupying the third base dugout, and the visitors occupying the first base dugout. Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100feet (30m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2017, {{in a press}} {{announcement}} held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube {{announced the}} launch of YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> a price of US$35 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017, the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox Broadcasting Company and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, and NBCUniversal (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Red original content (YouTube TV does not include a YouTube Red subscription).|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached {{during the first week of}} May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> their lunch counters for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> a local gas station whenever he saw somebody {{that looked like}} they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose <b>customers</b> <b>at</b> both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
