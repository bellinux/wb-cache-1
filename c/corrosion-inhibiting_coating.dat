40|$|We {{show that}} acetone-derived {{graphene}} coating can effectively enhance the corrosion efficiency of copper (Cu) in a seawater environment (0. 5 - 0. 6 M (∼ 3. 0 - 3. 5 %) sodium chloride). By applying {{a drop of}} acetone (∼ 20 μl cm- 2) on Cu surfaces, rapid thermal annealing allows the facile and rapid synthesis of graphene films on Cu surfaces with a monolayer coverage of almost close to ∼ 100 %. Under optimal growth conditions, acetone-derived graphene is {{found to have a}} relatively high crystallinity, comparable to common graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition. The resulting graphene-coated Cu surface exhibits 37. 5 times higher corrosion resistance as compared to that of mechanically polished Cu. Further, investigation on the role of graphene coating on Cu surfaces suggests that the outstanding corrosion inhibition efficiency (IE) of 97. 4 % is obtained by protecting the underlying Cu against the penetration of both dissolved oxygen and chlorine ions, thanks to the closely spaced atomic structure of the graphene sheets. The increase of graphene coating thickness results in the enhancement of the overall corrosion IE up to ∼ 99 %, which {{can be attributed to the}} effective blocking of the ionic diffusion process via grain boundaries. Overall, our results suggest that the acetone-derived graphene film can effectively serve as a <b>corrosion-inhibiting</b> <b>coating</b> in the seawater level and that it may have a promising role to play for potential offshore coating. close 0...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{several aspects of}} the {{electrochemical}} behaviors of two-dimensional layered materials are discussed. First, large-area continuous few-layer molybdenum disulfide film is prepared by simple solid-gas elemental reaction and transferred onto fluorine doped tin oxide glass substrate as the counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells. The catalytic activity of the MoS 2 atomic layers are dramatically improved by craving the MoS 2 film and creating artificial edges on it. Electrochemical analysis shows that the edges contribute to the improve catalytic activity of MoS 2. Second, large-area continuous hexagonal boron nitride film is grown by chemical vapor deposition method. The film is transferred onto copper substrate and tested as the <b>corrosion-inhibiting</b> <b>coating</b> in sodium sulphate aqueous solution. The sample with 30 nm h-BN coating shows significantly suppressed copper dissolution peak and only one fourth of the corrosion rate of the uncoated sample. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the charge transfer resistance is much higher when h-BN film is present. Third, we invent a local probe electrochemical measurement method and successfully applied it to the electrolysis catalytic activity measurement of various kinds of transition metal dichalcogenides. The catalytic activity and turnover frequencies of the 2 H-MoS 2 basal plane versus edge {{as well as the}} 1 T’-MoS 2 basal plane are identified by this measurement. At the same time, the basal plane activity and turnover frequencies of transition metal dichalcogenides from different element groups has been obtained. We have shown that the general trend of the transition metal dichalcogenides in the form of volcano plot follows the trend of metals. VB-VIA dichalcogenides have been identified as the preferential selection for hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. Last, we discussed the measurement of layered materials in photoelectrolysis using the local probe electrochemical method. Gallium selenide as a good photoconductor, is examined as the photoelectrolysis catalyst and shows promising photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution performance. The turnover frequency and photon-to-electron conversion efficiency are obtained from our measurements...|$|E
