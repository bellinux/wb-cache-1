2500|$|There {{were two}} control strips, both {{located on the}} inward-facing {{sides of the border}} fences. The {{secondary}} [...] "K2" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran alongside the signal fence {{to the rear of the}} Schutzstreifen, while the primary [...] "K6" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran along the inside of the border fence or wall. The K6 strip ran almost uninterrupted along the entire length of the border. Where it ran across roads, the road surface would be ripped up to make way for the control strip; where the border ran along streams and rivers, the strip was constructed parallel with the waterways. In places where the border was prone to escape attempts, the control strip was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage) installed on <b>concrete</b> <b>poles,</b> which were also used at vulnerable points such as rivers and streams crossing the border. The strip was patrolled several times a day by guards, who would inspect it carefully for signs of intrusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{drilling}} of installed <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> is not feasible. Users {{may wish}} to have the attachment hardware cast into the concrete during the pole manufacture. As {{a result of these}} operational difficulties, banded hardware has become the more popular means to attach cable plant to <b>concrete</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
40|$|The major {{causes of}} {{electric}} <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> failures has been highlighted {{in this paper}} and possible solutions suggested. The technique involves an on-site assessment and analysis of some factors that influence the design and manufacture of <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> commonly used for electrification purpose. Some major manufacturers in Niger State, Kwara State and Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria were visited and interview conducted on their method of design and manufacture of electric transmission <b>concrete</b> <b>pole.</b> Site study of some major high-tension and low-tension electrification work was also carried out. Based on observation made anomalies in <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> manufacture were pointed out and solution proffered. Finally <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> suitable for electrification purpose was designed and constructed. A rig was constructed to test {{the strength of the}} pole, thereby determining their suitability for electrification work...|$|R
50|$|The 33kV {{transmission}} line was 10.2km long, and connected {{up to the}} 33kV line at the Ratnapura Grid Substation. A single circuit <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> line was built along {{the road from the}} powerhouse to the feeder.|$|R
40|$|Unique conductor-pole {{couplings}} {{complicate the}} dynamic behaviors of electric transmission pole line systems. Finite element modeling is performed on two typical transmission poles used in southeastern USA – a steel pole and a prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pole.</b> The two poles {{are representative of}} unique structure types: a heavy rod-like structure and a lightweight, shell-type structure. Since coupling issues between the pole and the cable introduce great complexities for modeling the pole line system, simplified numerical models are used. Limited full-scale modal test results are presented to verify the numerical models. The prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> is shown to be easier for mode identification than the steel pole – but both numerical models show complicated coupled vibration modes. This study {{is part of a}} larger study to establish an understanding of the dynamic response analyses of power grid under ground vibrations...|$|R
50|$|The most {{widespread}} use of <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> is in marine environments and coastal zones where excellent corrosion resistance is required to reduce the impact of sea water, salt fog, and corrosive soil conditions (e.g., marsh). Their heavy weight also helps the <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> resist the high winds possible in coastal areas.|$|E
50|$|Design {{criteria}} and requirements for <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> {{can be derived}} from various industry documents including, but not limited to, ASCE-111, ACI-318, ASTM C935, and ASTM C1089.|$|E

40|$|This master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of grounding systems in HV/LV distribution networks, which includes grounding system of distribution substation and transmission lines. Explores the issue and principles for the measurement of parameters, which are important {{for the protection of}} persons and animals in order not to touch exposed conductive part accidentally, protection of electrical machines and equipment against high fault current and dangerous surges while the correct function of the connected electrical equipment is maintained. These parameters include earth potential rise, ground resistance, soil resistivity, touch voltage, step voltage and transferred potential to the LV network. The aim of this work is the preparation, analysis and subsequent evaluation for the real measurement in practice. These earthing-system measurements were carried out at the distribution station and the <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> with a section disconnector. Then a numerical model of the grounding system of <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> was created in ANSYS. Subsequent evaluation of the results as numerical terms (comparison measurements and simulated results) and evaluation in terms of analytical (measurement results compliance with the standard) including the numerical model of the earthing system is solved in the practical part of the master's thesis...|$|R

50|$|Although steel poles can be drilled on-site with a annular {{drill bit}} or {{standard}} twist drill, {{it is not}} a recommended practice.

50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} at 500 volts direct current, with power supplied through simple trolley wire supported either from span wires between steel poles (<b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> between Immingham Town and Immingham Dock), or from side brackets.

50|$|The {{electrode}} lines, which {{look like}} a 110 kV-powerlines with 2 conductors, use similar, but smaller pylons as the main line. In opposite to the main line, all strainers are free-standing lattice towers with a single crossbar, while the suspension towers of the electrode line are usually <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> with a single crossbar made of steel. Only suspension towers of extraordinary height are built as lattice towers.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{stands on}} the San Fernando Valley side of the Hollywood Hills, just off Mulholland Drive. It is a one-story octagon with around 2200 square feet (200 m2) of living space. Most distinctively, the house is perched atop a 5 ft <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> nearly 30 ft high. This innovative design was Lautner's solution to a site that, with a slope of 45 degrees, {{was thought to be}} practically unbuildable. Because of a concrete pedestal, almost 20 ft in diameter, buried under the earth and supporting the post, the house has survived earthquakes and heavy rains. The house is reached by a funicular. Chemosphere is bisected by a central, exposed brick wall with a fireplace, abutted by subdued seating, in the middle.|$|R
50|$|Reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>poles</b> {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used in SWER lines {{because of their}} low cost, low maintenance, and resistance to water damage, termites and fungi. Local labor can produce them in most areas, further lowering costs. In New Zealand, metal poles are common (often being former rails from a railway line). Wooden poles are acceptable. In Mozambique, poles {{had to be at}} least 12 m high to permit safe passage of giraffes beneath the lines.|$|E

30|$|Most {{domestic}} plantation timbers {{available for}} commercial use in Taiwan are fast-growing species with short rotation years. Therefore, wood members used for timber construction contain {{a high percentage}} of juvenile wood, knots, and have low mechanical properties. To effectively utilize the low-quality wood resources for making commercially accepted structural glulam products, it is necessary not only to ensure the strength quality of glulam but also to evaluate the adequacy of the connection performance in timber construction application. Japanese cedar has the highest plantation area, i.e., 15  %, among major commercial wood species and was mainly used for utility <b>pole</b> application before <b>concrete</b> <b>pole</b> dominated. There are 72  % of forests at the ages of 20 – 70  years which can be harvested for market. Currently, commercial structural glulam products were made of Douglas fir and southern pine in Taiwan.
