40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the attenuation patterns and detectability of {{common bile duct}} (CBD) stones by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). METHODS: Between March 2010 and February 2012, 191 patients with suspicion of CBD stones undergoing both MDCT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were enrolled and reviewed retrospectively. The attenuation patterns of CBD stones on MDCT were classified as heavily calcified, radiopaque, less radiopaque, or undetectable. The association between the attenuation patterns of CBD stones on MDCT and stone type consisting of pure cholesterol, mixed cholesterol, brown pigment, and black pigment and the factors related to the detectability of CBD stones by MDCT were evaluated. RESULTS: MDCT showed CBD stones in 111 of 130 patients in whom the CBD stones were demonstrated by ERCP with 85. 4 % sensitivity. The attenuation patterns of CBD stones on MDCT were heavily calcified 34 (26 %), radiopaque 31 (24 %), less radiopaque 46 (35 %), and undetectable 19 (15 %). The radiopacity of CBD stones differed significantly according to stone type (P < 0. 001). From the receiver operating characteristic <b>curve,</b> <b>stone</b> size was useful for the determination of CBD stone by MDCT (area under curve 0. 779, P < 0. 001) and appropriate cut-off stone size on MDCT was 5 mm. The factors related to detectability of CBD stones on MDCT were age, stone type, and stone size on multivariate analysis (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The radiopacity of CBD stones on MDCT differed according to stone type. Stone type and stone size {{were related to the}} detectability by MDCT, and appropriate cut-off stone size was 5 mm...|$|E

50|$|Cultic {{practices}} were {{performed by the}} people of the Bronze Age in diverse locations: in mountains, trees, springs, rivers, clearings or even, as noted, in specially assigned places inside the settlements. At Sălacea, Bihor County, in the southern area of the settlement of the Otomani culture there was a cultic edifice, a megaron type sanctuary measuring 5.20x8.80m, with a porch with two in antis pillars, a pronaos with an elevated altar and a naos with two fixed altars. The solid crust on the altar surface testifies to the rituals involving fire, while the walls nearby were provided with circular orifices (a ventilating system and alternative lighting of the altars depending on sunrise and sunset). On one of them were found nine clay weights, three <b>curved</b> <b>stone</b> knives, and one cylindrical clay stand. The other had nine clay weights in miniature, three <b>curved</b> <b>stone</b> knives and one cylindrical stand.|$|R

However, the Tomb of Clytemnestra displays slightly more advanced technical features with rows of <b>curved</b> <b>stones</b> continuing around the structure {{at the same level}} of the lintel. This may indicate that the Tomb of Clytemnestra was a slightly later construction compared to the one of Atreus.|$|R

50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to say when and where the first oil lamp was used. This is partly because it is difficult to draw a line detailing when the primitive forms of creating a continuous source of light from fire can be termed a lamp.The first lamps were made of naturally occurring objects, coconuts, sea shells, egg shells and hollow stones. Some believe that the first proper lamps were carved from <b>stones.</b> <b>Curved</b> <b>stone</b> lamps were found in places dated to the 10th millennium BC. (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, circa 10,300 - 8000 BC) The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in Lascaux in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.|$|R

500|$|In 1912, Wright {{designed}} what {{he called}} a [...] "tea circle" [...] {{in the middle of the}} courtyard, adjacent to the crown of the hill. This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen's council circles, but also took influence from Japanese wabi-sabi landscape architecture. Unlike Jensen's circles, the rough-cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center. The circle featured a <b>curved</b> <b>stone</b> bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the Ming Dynasty. A large oak tree stood at the center until it blew down in a storm in 1998. The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of Flower in the Crannied Wall, a statue originally designed by Richard Bock for the Susan Lawrence Dana House; the namesake poem is inscribed on its rear.|$|R
50|$|Akasegawa {{discovered}} the first Thomasson in 1972, in Yotsuya, Tokyo {{when he noticed}} a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the <b>curved</b> <b>stone</b> tray of the ticket window, {{where it had been}} worn through years of use. Minami Shindō, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in Ochanomizu that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition.|$|R
