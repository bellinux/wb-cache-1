He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a <b>cowled</b> figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} events of Baldur's Gate, the hero and companions are {{overcome}} and taken captive. When the game opens, the hero awakens in a cage and is shortly thereafter experimented upon by a wizard named Jon Irenicus. Irenicus is distracted as his complex is attacked by thieves, and disappears to fight them. The hero uses this opportunity {{to escape from the}} complex with a few other companions, including Imoen and emerges into the city of Athkatla. As soon as the hero and his party have entered the city proper, they see Irenicus fighting off some of his attackers. After he has destroyed his attackers, he notices the hero and his companions. An argument ensues, during which Imoen angrily attacks Irenicus using magic. Immediately <b>Cowled</b> Wizards appear, after a fight arrest both Irenicus and Imoen for the unsanctioned use of magic, and teleport both of them away.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of flight tests with three different airplanes using several types of low-drag <b>cowling</b> for radial air-cooled engines. The greater part of the tests were made with a Curtiss XF 7 Cc- 1 (Sea Hawk) with a 410 horsepower. Wasp engine, using three fuselage nose shapes and six types of outer <b>cowling.</b> The six cowlings were: a narrow ring, a wide ring, a wide <b>cowling</b> similar in the original NACA <b>cowling,</b> a thick ring incorporating an exhaust collector, a single-surface <b>cowling</b> shaped like the outer surface of the exhaust-collector <b>cowling,</b> and polygon-ring <b>cowling,</b> of which the angle of the straight sections with the thrust line could be varied over a wide range...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the external <b>cowl</b> angle, and hence the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag, were investigated on a two-dimensional model. One method used at both on- and off-design Mach numbers was {{the addition of a}} <b>cowl</b> visor that had the inner surface parallel to the free stream at 0 deg angle of attack. The other method investigated consisted in replacing the original <b>cowl</b> by a flatter <b>cowl</b> that also provided internal contraction. Both the visor and the internal-contraction <b>cowl</b> reduced the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag 64 percent or more. The visor had little effect on inlet performance at the design Mach number except to reduce the stability range slightly. At off-design, the visor caused an increase in critical pressure recovery...|$|R

The Aeronáutica Militar aircraft had their radial engines <b>cowled</b> with Townend rings and driving a metal propeller; their wings carried Hadley Page slots. the Naval machines had uncowled engines, wooden propellers and folding wings.|$|E
25|$|Frank Barnwell {{designed}} a clean single-bay biplane with staggered and unequal-span wings. Wire bracing was used {{only in the}} centre section; outboard of that was a single streamlined compression strut and a three-strut drag brace on each wing. Frise-type ailerons were fitted only to the upper wings. The fuselage was of fabric-covered metal construction, similar in detail {{to that of the}} Bulldog. Rudder and elevators were horn balanced and the tailplane was of cantilever, unbraced form. The undercarriage was divided and attached to the fuselage with streamlined legs and struts. The Jaguar installation left the cylinder heads exposed, but later engines were <b>cowled</b> with a Townend ring.|$|E

The local thieves' guild, the Shadow Thieves, also has considerable power. The group, which operates all along the Sword Coast, is based in Athkatla. Another powerful organization in Amn are the <b>Cowled</b> Wizards, who regulate the use of magic in the region. [...] The Shadow Thieves, the <b>Cowled</b> Wizards, and the Harpers, a semi-secret conglomeration of good organizations, all factor prominently into the story and provide side quests.|$|E

500|$|The B-37, {{given the}} service name [...] "Firebrand" [...] on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, {{all-metal}} monoplane. Aft {{of the cockpit}} the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the [...] main fuel tank and the [...] auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly <b>cowled</b> Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended {{to the edges of}} the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four [...] Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in {{the fact that there was}} an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.|$|E
40|$|A thrust {{reverser}} is provided for both modulating and reversing bypass flow discharged from a fan through a bypass duct of a turbofan gas turbine engine. The reverser includes an aft <b>cowl</b> joined to a forward <b>cowl</b> and having an aft end surrounding a core engine {{to define a}} discharge fan nozzle of minimum flow throat area. The aft <b>cowl</b> is axially translatable relative to the forward <b>cowl</b> from a first position fully retracted against the forward <b>cowl,</b> to a second position partially extended from the forward <b>cowl,</b> and to a third position fully extended from the forward <b>cowl.</b> A plurality of cascade turning vanes are disposed between the forward and aft <b>cowls,</b> and a plurality of thrust reversing deflector doors are pivotally mounted to the aft <b>cowl</b> and bound the bypass duct. The deflector doors are selectively deployed from a stowed position corresponding with {{the first and second}} positions of the aft <b>cowl</b> for allowing unrestricted flow of the bypass flow through the fan nozzle. The doors also have a deployed position corresponding with the third position of the aft <b>cowl</b> for substantially deflecting the bypass flow from discharging through the fan nozzle to discharging through the cascade vanes for effecting thrust reverse. Axial translation of the aft <b>cowl</b> {{between the first and second}} positions varies flow area of the fan nozzle to vary thrust effected by the discharged bypass flow...|$|R

40|$|Adjustable <b>cowling</b> flaps, an {{adjustable}}-length <b>cowling</b> skirt, and {{a bottom}} opening with adjustable flap were tested as means {{of controlling the}} rate of cooling-air flow through an air-cooled radial-engine <b>cowling.</b> The devices were tested in the NACA 20 -foot tunnel on a model wing-nacelle-propeller combination, through an airspeed range of 20 to 80 miles per hour, and with the propeller blade angle set 23 degrees at 0. 75 of the tip radius. The resistance of the engine to air flow through the <b>cowling</b> was simulated by a perforated plate. The {{results indicated that the}} adjustable <b>cowling</b> flap and the bottom opening with adjustable flap were about equally effective on the basis of pressure drop obtainable and that both were more effective means of increasing the pressure drop through the <b>cowling</b> than the adjustable-length skirt.
