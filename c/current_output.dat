5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} <b>current</b> <b>output,</b> {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E

However, analysis of load-independent <b>output</b> <b>current</b> in three-coil WPT system is still lacking in previous studies. This paper investigates the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> characteristics of a three-coil WPT system against load variations, and determines the operating frequency to achieve a constant <b>output</b> <b>current.</b> First, a three-coil WPT system is modeled by circuit theory, and the analytical expression of the root-mean-square of the <b>output</b> <b>current</b> is derived. By substituting the coupling coefficients, the quality factor, and the resonant frequency of each coil, we propose a method of calculating the frequency for load-independent <b>output</b> <b>current</b> in a three-coil WPT system, which indicates {{that there are two}} frequencies that can achieve load-independent <b>output</b> <b>current.</b> Experiments are conducted to validate these analytical results...|$|R

25|$|If {{the walls}} of the {{accelerating}} cavities are made of normally conducting material and the accelerating fields are large, the wall resistivity converts electric energy into heat quickly. On the other hand, superconductors also need constant cooling to keep them below their critical temperature, and the accelerating fields are limited by quenches. Therefore, high energy accelerators such as SLAC, still the longest in the world (in its various generations), are run in short pulses, limiting the average <b>current</b> <b>output</b> and forcing the experimental detectors to handle data coming in short bursts.|$|E
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low <b>current</b> <b>output,</b> so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E
25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct <b>current</b> <b>output,</b> aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E

25|$|William Grove {{produced}} the first fuel cell in 1839. He based his experiment {{on the fact}} that sending an electric current through water splits the water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen. So, Grove tried reversing the reaction—combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. Eventually the term fuel cell was coined in 1889 by Ludwig Mond and Charles Langer, who attempted to build the first practical device using air and industrial coal gas. He also introduced a powerful battery {{at the annual meeting of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839. Grove's first cell consisted of zinc in diluted sulfuric acid and platinum in concentrated nitric acid, separated by a porous pot. The cell was able to generate about 12 amperes of current at about 1.8 volts. This cell had nearly double the voltage of the first Daniell cell. Grove's nitric acid cell was the favourite battery of the early American telegraph (1840–1860), because it offered strong <b>current</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
