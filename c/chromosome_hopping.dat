50|$|Chromosome jumping (or <b>chromosome</b> <b>hopping)</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1984 by Collins and Weissman.At the time, cloning techniques allowed for generation of clones of limited size (up to 240kb), and cytogenetic techniques allowed for mapping such clones {{to a small}} region of a particular chromosome to a resolution of around 5-10Mb. Therefore, a major gap remained in resolution between available technologies, and no methods were available for mapping larger areas of the genome.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mutants in the meiosis-specific RED 1 gene of S. cerevisiae fail to {{make any}} synaptonemal complex (SC) or any obvious {{precursors}} to the SC. Using antibodies that specifically recognize the Red 1 protein, Red 1 has been localized along meiotic pachytene chromosomes. Red 1 also localizes to the unsynapsed axial elements present in a zip 1 mutant, suggesting that Red 1 is {{a component of the}} lateral elements of mature SCs. Anti-Red 1 staining is confined to the cores of meiotic chromosomes and is not associated with the loops of chromatin that lie outside the SC. Analysis of the spo 11 mutant demonstrates that Red 1 localization does not depend upon meiotic recombination. The localization of Red 1 has been compared with two other meiosisspecific components of <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>Hop</b> 1 and Zip 1; Zip 1 serves as a marker for synapsed chromosomes. Double labeling of wild-type meiotic chromosomes with anti-Zip 1 and anti-Red 1 antibodies demonstrates that Red 1 localizes to chromosomes both before and during pachytene. Double labeling with anti-Hop 1 and anti-Red 1 antibodies reveals that Hop 1 protein localizes only in areas that also contain Red 1, and studies of Hop 1 localization in a red 1 null mutant demonstrate that Hop 1 localization depends on Red 1 function. These observations are consistent with previous genetic studies suggesting that Red 1 and Hop 1 directly interact. There is little or no Hop 1 protein on pachytene chromosomes or in synapsed chromosomal regions...|$|R
50|$|Cut-and-paste {{transposition}} {{does not}} cause {{an increase in the}} number of transposons per se: there is one copy at the start and one copy at the end. If this was the end of the matter the transposon would perish by genetic drift and the loss of copies owing to the occasional failure to achieve successful integration at the target site. However, the transposon has a mechanism to favor transposition immediately after a replication fork passes through, leaving a hemimethylated copy of Tn10 on each sister chromosome. Since transposition is favored when Tn10 is hemimethylated, the transposon on one sister <b>chromosome</b> can <b>hop</b> somewhere onto the other chromosome so that two copies of the transposon end up on one chromosome.|$|R
40|$|The {{budding yeast}} genome {{contains}} regions where meiotic recombination initiates {{more frequently than}} in others. This pattern parallels enrichment for the meiotic <b>chromosome</b> axis proteins <b>Hop</b> 1 and Red 1. These proteins are important for Spo 11 -catalyzed double strand break formation; their contribution to crossover recombination remains undefined. Using the sequencespecific VMA 1 -derived endonuclease (VDE) to initiate recombination in meiosis, we show that chromosome structure influences the choice of proteins that resolve recombination intermediates to form crossovers. At a Hop 1 -enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers, like most Spo 11 - initiated crossovers, required the meiosis-specific MutLg resolvase. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop 1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutLg-independent. In pch 2 mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop 1 occupancy levels, and VDE-induced crossovers were similarly MutLg-dependent. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, and that features of meiotic chromosome structure determine whether {{one or the other}} predominates in different regions...|$|R
40|$|Synaptonemal complex (SC) {{proteins}} Hop 1 and Mek 1 {{have been}} proposed to promote homologous recombination in meiosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by establishment of a barrier against sister chromatid recombination. Therefore, {{it is interesting to}} know whether the homologous proteins play a similar role in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Unequal sister chromatid recombination (USCR) was found to be increased in hop 1 and mek 1 single and double deletion mutants in assays for intrachromosomal recombination (ICR). Meiotic intergenic (crossover) and intragenic (conversion) recombination between homologous chromosomes was reduced. Double-strand break (DSB) levels were also lowered. Notably, deletion of hop 1 restored DSB repair in rad 50 S meiosis. This may indicate altered DSB repair kinetics in hop 1 and mek 1 deletion strains. A hypothesis is advanced proposing transient inhibition of DSB processing by Hop 1 and Mek 1 and thus providing more time for repair by interaction with the homologous <b>chromosome.</b> Loss of <b>Hop</b> 1 and Mek 1 would then result in faster repair and more interaction with the sister chromatid. Thus, in S. pombe meiosis, where an excess of sister Holliday junction over homologous Holliday junction formation has been demonstrated, Hop 1 and Mek 1 possibly enhance homolog interactions to ensure wild-type level of crossover formation rather than inhibiting sister chromatid interactions...|$|R
