40|$|Evaluation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) Chemical Process Cell (CPC) {{cycle time}} {{identified}} several opportunities {{to improve the}} CPC processing time. Of the opportunities, a focus area related to optimizing the equipment and efficiency of the sample turnaround time for DWPF Analytical Laboratory was identified. The Mechanical Systems & Custom Equipment Development (MS&CED) Section of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) evaluated {{the possibility of using}} an Isolok{reg_sign} sampling valve {{as an alternative to the}} Hydragard{reg_sign} valve for taking process samples. Previous viability testing was conducted with favorable results using the Isolok sampler and reported in SRNL-STI- 2010 - 00749 (1). This task has the potential to improve operability, reduce maintenance time and decrease CPC cycle time. This report summarizes the results from acceptance testing which was requested in Task Technical Request (TTR) HLW-DWPF-TTR- 2010 - 0036 (2) and which was conducted as outlined in Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP) SRNL-RP- 2011 - 00145 (3). The Isolok to be tested is the same model which was tested, qualified, and installed in the Sludge Receipt Adjustment Tank (SRAT) sample system. RW- 0333 P QA requirements apply to this task. This task was to qualify the Isolok sampler for use in the DWPF Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) sampling process. The Hydragard, which is the current baseline sampling method, was used for comparison to the Isolok sampling data. The Isolok sampler is an air powered grab sampler used to 'pull' a sample volume from a process line. The operation of the sampler is shown in Figure 1. The image on the left shows the Isolok's spool extended into the process line and the image on the right shows the sampler retracted and then dispensing the liquid into the sampling container. To determine tank homogeneity, a <b>Coliwasa</b> <b>sampler</b> was used to grab samples at a high and low location within the mixing tank. Data from the two locations were compared to determine if the contents of the tank were well mixed. The <b>Coliwasa</b> <b>sampler</b> is a tube with a stopper at the bottom and is designed to obtain grab samples from specific locations within the drum contents. A position paper (4) was issued to address the prototypic flow loop issues and simulant selections. A statistically designed plan (5) was issued to address the total number of samples each sampler needed to pull, to provide the random order in which samples were pulled and to group samples for elemental analysis. The TTR required that the Isolok sampler perform as well as the Hydragard sampler during these tests to ensure the acceptability of the Isolok sampler for use in the DWPF sampling cells. Procedure No. L 9. 4 - 5015 was used to document the sample parameters and process steps. Completed procedures are located in R&D Engineering job folder 23269...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{standard}} operating procedure (SOP) is to provide technical guidance {{for the implementation of}} sampling protocols for tanks and other confined spaces from outside the vessel. These are standard (i. e., typically applicable) operating procedures which may be varied or changed as required, dependent on site conditions, equipment limitations or limitations imposed by the procedure or other procedure limitations. In all instances, the ultimate procedures employed should be documented and associated with the final report. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute U. S. EPA endorsement or recommendation for use. 2. 0 METHOD SUMMARY The safe collection of a representative sample should be the criteria for selecting sample locations. A representative sample can be collected using techniques or equipment that are designed for obtaining liquids or sludges from various depths. The structure and characteristics of storage tanks present problems with collection of samples from more than one location; therefore, the selection of sampling devices is an important consideration. Depending on the type of vessel and characteristics of the material to be sampled, one can choose a bacon bomb sampler, sludge judge, subsurface grab sampler, glass thief, bailer or Composite Liquid Waste <b>Sampler</b> (<b>COLIWASA)</b> to collect the sample. A sludge judge, bacon bomb or COLIWASA can be used to determine if the tank contents are stratified. Various other custom-made samplers may be used depending on the specific application. All sample locations should be surveyed for air quality prior to sampling. At no time should sampling continue with an LEL reading greater than 25 %...|$|R
