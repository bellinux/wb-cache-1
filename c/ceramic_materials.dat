5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an ointment. Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. This brings a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is the ceramic remains. The composition of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> identifies the region or more specifically the polity that produced them. Ceramics with the snake emblem glyph found at several sites also give more evidence to identify ties or control over that site by Calakmul.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

An apparatus is designed to create a machining environment where workpiece and cutting tool are submerged in a bath filled with cutting fluids. Observations on the surface texture formed during machining have been made to investigate the effectiveness of submerged machining on quality and efficiency of the machining operation. The obtained results strongly suggest that the chemo-mechanical interactions occurred during machining have great influence on the stress distribution produced in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> being machined, thus have direct effects on crack initiation and propagation. By controlling the machining parameters, higher material removal rate with less surface damage can be achieved, showing the potential of submerged machining as an innovative technology for machining <b>ceramic</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R
40|$|Effect of C on {{wettability}} and interface reaction {{between a}} nickel based superalloy and <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> was investigated {{by using a}} sessile drop method. It {{was found that the}} content of C in the alloy is able to influence the wettability and interface reaction. Alloys with C content lower than 0. 1 wt. % are stable on <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> and no interface reaction generates at the alloy-ceramic interface. However, when C content is higher than 0. 1 wt. %, the interface reaction occurs and the wetting angle decreases quickly. The product of interface reaction is discontinuous and composed of 9 Al 2 O 3 ⋅Cr 2 O 3. Such result indicates that Cr in the alloy is impossible to react with the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> and form Cr 2 O 3 without the assistance of C. It is suggested that C in the alloy deoxidizes SiO 2 in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> and produces SiO and CO. SiO is unstable and it can release active O atom at the interface. Cr at the interface combines with free O atom and forms Cr 2 O 3. Al 2 O 3 in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> and Cr 2 O 3 finally forms 9 Al 2 O 3 ⋅Cr 2 O 3...|$|R
