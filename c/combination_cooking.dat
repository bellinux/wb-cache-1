40|$|Assessments of {{pollution}} from domestic fuel burning in South Africa have, in the main, based their conclusions on measured ambient pollutant concentrations. This approach {{does not allow}} for direct comparison of emissions from different domestic fuel burning appliances. Pollution from domestic fuel burning depends both on appliance efficiency, since a more efficient appliance· will burn less fuel, and appliance emission rates. A test cell was designed and built to measure efficiencies and emissions of various fuel/appliance <b>combinations</b> during <b>cooking</b> and space heating tests representative of field operating conditions. A range of fuels, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), paraffin, coal and wood were burnt in domestic appliances commonly used in South Africa. Emissions of gaseous pollutants, C 02, CO, NOx and HC, and particulate pollutants, total suspended particulates (TSP) and particles less than 2. Sμrn aerodynamic diameter, were measured...|$|R

The Mughlai cooking styles {{is used in the}} traditional cuisine of North India (especially Uttar Pradesh and Delhi), the Indian city of Hyderabad and the Pakistani city of Karachi (particularly among Muhajir migrants from India). The cuisine is strongly influenced by Central Asian cuisine, the region where the Turco-Mongol Mughal rulers originally hailed from, and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.|$|R
50|$|Denmark {{has many}} fine dining restaurants, {{not only in}} the larger cities, but also in the countryside. The kro (roughly {{equivalent}} to an inn, but held in higher social regard) provides lodging as well as meals and drinks. Especially the royally privileged lodges have a long and interesting history. Danish cuisine continues to evolve and keep up with the times. It has become more health-conscious, and has drawn inspiration not only from the traditional French and Italian kitchens, but also from many other more exotic gastronomical sources. Increasingly, restaurants are turning to trends based on a <b>combination</b> of continental <b>cooking</b> and the growing interest in products from the local environment served in accordance with seasonal availability.|$|R
50|$|Pressure cooking always {{requires}} liquid. Pressure cooking {{cannot be}} used for cooking methods that produce little steam such as roasting, pan frying, or deep frying. However, Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants use a <b>combination</b> of pressure <b>cooking</b> and frying, with special pressure fryers in which the chicken's own juices supply the water. Cooking time is reduced substantially, to approximately 12 minutes per amount cooked, but the breading texture is much softer (less crispy) than deep-fried chicken since moisture remains in the breading. Thick sauces do not contain enough liquid to vaporize and create pressure, so they usually burn onto the interior base of the pressure cooker after prolonged heating. Sauces should be thickened after pressure cooking.|$|R
50|$|Parts of the Midwest also {{incorporate}} {{their own}} styles of barbecue into their culinary traditions. For example, in Kansas City, barbecue entails {{a wide variety}} of meats, sweet and thick sauces, dry rubs, and sliced beef brisket. Kansas City barbecue {{is a result of the}} region’s history; a <b>combination</b> of the <b>cooking</b> techniques brought to the city by freed slaves and the Texas cattle drives during the late nineteenth century has led to the development of the region's distinctive barbecue style. Barbecue as a cultural tradition spread from the South and was successfully incorporated into several Midwestern regions such as western Missouri, again owing to the cultural ideals that the barbecue tradition represents and the need for locals to express those ideals. Variations of these ideals by region are reflected in the great diversity of barbecue styles and traditions within the United States.|$|R
40|$|Combined {{microwave}} and convection cooking has gained {{popularity in the}} last 20 years because of more accurate heat control and more efficient use of energy. <b>Combination</b> microwave/convection <b>cooking</b> allows for more rapid cooking, {{but it does not}} have the same even heat distribution as convection cooking. Cooking is a critical stage when preparing meat. The main factors to consider during cooking are: temperature on the surface of meat, internal temperature throughout, and the method of heat transfer. Temperature on the surface and method of heat exchange primarily affect surface color and aroma, whereas internal temperature affects protein structure and flavor as well as aroma. At any temperature above 230 °F, Maillard browning reactions start to occur and give meat its typical brown, caramelized appearance; however, high humidity prevents Maillard browning from occurring and dilutes flavor and odor components. All sensory attributes can, therefore, be significantly influenced by the cooking technique used. Different cooking methods allow for tenderness, flavor development, and color changes, all of which can be either acceptable or unacceptable for consumers. Different cuts of beef are cooked using different cooking methods to ensure that even a low-quality cut of meat can be acceptable for consumption. The objectives of our study were to investigate the differences between convection <b>cooking</b> and a <b>combination</b> of {{microwave and}} convection cooking and endpoint temperatures to observe how these factors affect post-cooking temperature rise, cooking yields, and tenderness...|$|R
40|$|Recirculation hoods {{equipped}} with carbon and plasma filters {{are becoming more}} and more popular. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of recirculation hoods with regard to PM 2. 5 and NOx removal in a 26 m 3 lab kitchen with a gas furnace. With the carbon filter PM 2. 5 is reduced for about 30 %. A fresh carbon filter removed about 60 % of the NO 2, dropping within a few weeks of cooking to 20 %. With the plasma hood NO 2 concentrations were above the WHO 1 -hour limit and above the Dutch Health Council 15 -minutes limit. For plasma hoods it is recommended to optimize odor and particulate matter reduction while minimizing the ozone production. As recirculation hoods have favorable properties in terms of applicability and energy conservation it is recommended to add a particulate filter to recirculation hoods and to apply them preferably in <b>combination</b> with electrical <b>cooking...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT India is a largest {{producer}} and consumer of the pulses {{in the world}} and accounts for 33 percent of the global area. (Singh et al., 2003). The major pulses which find an important place in our dietaries are red gram dhal, bengal gram dhal, black gram dhal, green gram dhal and masoor dhal. Some are used as whole grams. Some of the pulses like cow pea, rajmah and dry peas also belong to the leguminous family (Manay, S. and Shadakharaswamy, Pulses are good sources of fiber and water soluble vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin and niacin. Pulses are also rich in minerals like potassium, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, chromium which are easily destroyed by heat when subjected to cooking. Pulses also contain toxic substance like phytate, trypsin etc and hence it becomes essential to cook the pulses for easy digestion (Lutz, 1997). The aim {{of the present study was}} to esti-mate levels of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and potassium in the selected Pulses (Whole Green gram and cow pea) before and after pro-cessing techniques like soaking, boiling and pressure cooking. Thiamine and riboflavin estimation was done by fluorimetric analysis, Niacin by colorimetric method and potassium was done by flame photometry. Soaking pulses for three hours in water resulted in loss of thiamine, riboflavin but soaking did not affect the niacin and potassium content. Boiling resulted in greater reduction of vitamins and minerals when compared to pressure cooking. Potassium losses was seen only when the pulses were boiled. Therefore it can be summarized that a <b>combination</b> of <b>cooking</b> methods will prove to be more advantageous in improving the retention of vitamins tha...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of gastrointestinal illness affecting 12 of 29 customers of a ‘Hawaiian’ theme restaurant specializing in stir-fried food occurred in Cardiff, Wales in February 1997. Campylobacter jejuni serotype HS 50 phage type 49 (PT 49) was isolated from 5 cases. A total of 47 isolates of C. jejuni HS 50 PT 49 were identified from Wales during 1997, of which 11 were isolated in late February or early March {{and from the}} Cardiff area. In the outbreak, illness was associated with eating stir-fried chicken pieces (relative risk 4 · 81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0 · 76 – 30 · 44, P= 0 · 03) and a dose-response relationship between risk of illness and amount of chicken consumed was observed (χ 2 -test for linear trend 3 · 96, P= 0 · 047). Undercooking of chicken was probably due to a <b>combination</b> of inadequate <b>cooking</b> time and use of large chicken pieces. This {{is the first time}} that stir-fried food has been associated with a campylobacter outbreak. The incident also illustrates the value of routine campylobacter subtyping in supporting outbreak investigation...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion as a {{pretreatment}} before {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} of soybean meal {{is an effective}} technique to eliminate antinutritional properties of the main thermostable soy proteins glycinin and β-conglycinin for production of feed ingredients with enhanced properties. In terms of economic efficiency, biotechnological processes are preferable to carry out at high substrate concentrations. The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the influence of high substrate concentrations {{in the range of}} 26 - 32 % and enzyme dosages (0. 4 - 3. 1 PU/g) on efficiency of hydrolysis of extruded toasted soybean meal with bacterial protease. The results showed that maximum degree of hydrolysis was 42. 1 % at the enzyme dosage of 3. 6 PU/g and at the substrate concentration of 29. 0 %. The increase in the substrate concentration had a strong effect on the deterioration of dynamic viscosity of the hydrolysates from 0. 2 to 5. 82 Pa•s.

40|$|Indigenous plant foods {{play a major}} {{nutritional}} {{and cultural}} role in the diets of rural people in Africa. However, they can contain high levels of antinutrients, which may exacerbate nutritional and health problems in young children consuming nutrient deficient diets. Also, the rapid increase in urbanization in Africa {{has led to the}} need for convenience type meals. This study investigated the potential of micronization (infrared treatment) in <b>combination</b> with extrusion <b>cooking</b> in developing a ready-to-eat sorghum and cowpea based porridge supplemented with cooked cowpea leaves for young child-feeding. Micronization not only inactivated the trypsin inhibitors in cowpea, it also produced an instantized product with excellent hydration properties. When served as a stiff porridge with cooked cowpea leaves in the recommended portion sizes for children aged 2 e 5 years, one daily serving would meet 40 % of the children's protein and lysine requirements. Further, the calculated Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score would be comparable to commercial maize-soy instant products. This is notwithstanding that the cowpea leaves had a negative effect on protein digestibility due to their high tannin content. This nutritious ready-to-eat meal from locally available plant foods could contribute substantially to food security in both urban and rural communities in Africa.

40|$|Abstract. A {{total of}} 36 steer {{carcasses}} (18 slaughtered in Australia and 18 slaughtered in Korea), where one side had been suspended by the hip (tenderstretch) {{and the other}} by the Achilles tendon were used to provide sensory and shear force samples from theMm. triceps brachii, longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus. Sensory samples were cooked using grill (25 mm thick) and barbeque (BBQ, 4 mm thick) methods and served to 360 untrained Australian and 720 untrained Korean consumers. Australian consumers sensory tested grill and BBQ samples from Australian carcasses (216 samples), while Korean consumers sensory tested grill and BBQ samples from both Australian and Korean carcasses (a total of 432 samples). The three-way interaction between carcass suspension, cooking method and muscle was significant (P < 0. 05) for tenderness, overall liking and a composite palatability score (MQ 4), where the <b>combination</b> of BBQ <b>cooking</b> and hip suspension resulted in large increases in sensory scores for theM. semimembranosus. Variation in sensory scores and shear force {{are discussed in the}} context of possible interactions with cooking temperature. There was a significant (P< 0. 05) first order interaction between consumer group andmuscle for juiciness score. Consumer effectswere significant (P< 0. 05) for all sensory scores, being largest for juiciness (~ 8 sensory units), like flavour and overall liking (both ~ 6 sensory units) andMQ 4 (~ 5 sensory units) scores, with the smallest effect on tenderness (~ 2 sensory units) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of hydrodynamic pressure (HDP) treatment for inactivation of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in blade-tenderized beef steaks was studied. Beef steaks (N = 48) were inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and treated with blade tenderization (BT), HDP {{or a combination}} of BT followed by HDP (BTH). Control and treated steaks were cooked to 54. 4 C (undercooked), 62. 8 C (medium rare) and 71. 1 C (medium) on open-hearth Farberware grills. HDP treatment reduced E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations by 0. 3 log 10 cfu/g, which was not different (P 0. 05) from untreated controls. At each endpoint cooking temperature, E. coli O 157 :H 7 survival was always higher in BT-treated steaks than in untreated steaks cooked to corresponding temperatures. This could be due to migration of surface bacteria to the interior of the muscle thereby protecting bacteria from the lethality of heat. E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations in BTH-treated steaks cooked to 71. 1 C were nondetect-able and were significantly different from BT-treated steaks cooked to 71. 1 C. Results suggest that BT of intact beef muscle does transfer surface bacteria to the interior of the muscle, which would necessitate a <b>combination</b> of elevated <b>cooking</b> temperatures (71. 1 C) and a treatment like HDP for inactivation of bacteria. * Mention of trade names or commercial products does not imply recommendation or endorsement to the exclusion of other products by the U.

40|$|Past {{research}} conducted by our lab demonstrated that potatoes contain significant levels of phytochemicals important to human health. However, since potatoes are not consumed raw, {{it is important to}} determine the effects of processing on these levels. Therefore, the changes in carotenoid content, antioxidant activity, and phenolic content were investigated using <b>combinations</b> of cultivars, <b>cooking</b> methods, storage treatments, and low-dose ionizing irradiation. Carotenoid content was measured via absorbance at 445 nm, 450 nm, and HPLC identification. Antioxidant activity was measured initially and at stabilization via the DPPH method and phenolic content was measured via the Folin method and HPLC identification. Microwaved, baked, fried, and raw potato samples contained more carotenoids than boiled samples. The samples microwaved, baked, and fried contained higher antioxidant activity and phenolics than the boiled or raw samples. However, the compound quercetin dihydrate appeared to decrease with cooking. Carotenoids, antioxidant activity, and phenolics appeared to decrease with storage; however, high storage temperatures and long storage times were believed to cause a dehydration and concentration of compounds, which caused levels to be equal to or greater than before storage. However, this decreasing trend was not linear and there were multiple significant interactions. The compound chlorogenic acid appeared to be quite sensitive to high temperature storage. Irradiation dose appeared to have only a minor, if any, effect on carotenoid levels. The interaction between storage time and irradiation dose was very influential on antioxidant activity. In early stages of storage, higher doses of irradiation had greater antioxidant activity, while, with continued storage, low doses had higher antioxidant activity. Exposure to irradiation appeared to cause an increase in phenolic content, determined by the Folin method. There may be a stimulation, induction, or release of some compounds due to processing; however, its magnitude is not believed to be as great as genetic control. The effects of processing can not be denied and should continue to be investigated. Future studies investigating the health properties of fruits and vegetables, particularly potatoes should include processing effects...|$|R
