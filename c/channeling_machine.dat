2500|$|Cutting a block {{involved}} a <b>channeling</b> <b>machine</b> (consisting of several drill bits and powered by electricity or steam) that made vertical holes {{from the top}} down. Next the bottom was cut by drilling horizontal holes. The block was then freed from the mountainside by inserting wedges into the horizontal holes, then inserting feathers until the block broke free. (Sometimes in winter water was poured into the holes so {{the expansion of the}} freezing water would break the block loose.) [...] Sometimes a wire saw would cut the quarried block inside the quarry into individual blocks before it was lifted out.|$|E

50|$|The company owned a {{total of}} 898 acres of land, of which only 240 acres were {{developable}} stone land. The original machinery used to excavate the quarry consisted of one <b>channeling</b> <b>machine</b> and a derrick. By 1895 the company had 10 machines running around the clock and was shipping between 10 and 15 car loads of stone each day on the Monon Railroad.|$|E
40|$|The α-channeling effect {{entails the}} use of {{radio-frequency}} waves to expel and cool high-energetic α- particles born in a fusion reactor; the device reactivity can then be increased even further by redirecting the extracted energy to fuel ions. Originally proposed for tokamaks, this technique {{has also been shown}} to benefi t open-ended fusion devices. Here, the fundamental theory and practical aspects of α- <b>channeling</b> in mirror <b>machines</b> are reviewed, including the influence of magnetic field inhomogeneity and the effect of a finite wave region on the α-channeling mechanism. For practical implementation of the α -channeling effect in mirror geometry, suitable contained weakly-damped modes are identifi ed. In addition, the parameter space of candidate waves for implementing the α -channeling effect can be signi cantly extended through the introduction of a suitable minority ion species that has the catalytic effect of moderating the transfer of power from the α-channeling wave to the fuel ions...|$|R
