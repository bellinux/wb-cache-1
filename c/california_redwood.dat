25|$|The local {{environment}} and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early <b>California</b> <b>redwood</b> water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) {{were part of a}} self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Fire plays a {{key role}} in the ecology of the upper slopes of the Big Sur region's {{mountains}} where chaparral dominates the landscape. Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food. In the lower elevations and canyons, the <b>California</b> <b>Redwood</b> is often found. Its thick bark, along with foliage that starts high above the ground, protect the species from both fire and insect damage, contributing to the coast redwood's longevity. Fire appears to benefit redwoods by removing competitive species. A 2010 study compared post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species. It concluded that fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.|$|E

500|$|This species grows solitarily or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground or}} in forest duff in mature {{coniferous}} forests, occasionally abundant on grassy edges of the forest, rarely on badly decayed conifer logs. It is an ectomycorrhizal mushroom, meaning that the fungal hyphae form sheaths around the rootlets of certain trees, exchanging nutrients with them in a mutualistic relationship. The fungus associates with alder, poplar and other hardwoods, and has been shown in laboratory culture to form ectomycorrhizae with Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). However, the fungus may have saprobic tendencies, as it has been noted to grow under <b>California</b> <b>Redwood</b> (sometimes in the rotted wood of old trunks), a tree not known to form mycorrizhae. It is known to form long rhizomorphs (aggregations of hyphae that resemble roots), and has been noted to be more abundant in sites with buried wood than without. In British Columbia, it occurs from summer to early winter, although it also appears infrequently in early spring. In California, the mushroom often fruits after the rainy period in autumn through to March or April. The dark coloring of the cap make this species difficult to notice, [...] "unless a glimpse of the yellow hymenium is obtained". Fruit bodies are eaten by the American shrew-mole.|$|E
500|$|According to {{newspapers}} reporting Lane's death, it {{was said}} that had he been born in the United States he would have been elected President. Following Lane's death, a memorial committee was formed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Lane assistant and member of the Federal Reserve Board Adolph C. Miller. The committee established a Franklin K. Lane Memorial Fund, initially dedicated to the support of Lane's widow, Anne Lane, and upon her death to be used to promote causes in which her husband believed. [...] The two future presidents, Miller, and National Park Service Director Mather were among the major contributors to the fund. [...] In 1939, after Mrs. Lane's death, the corpus of the trust (just over $100,000) was transferred to the former Secretary's alma mater, the University of California, to promote the understanding and improvement of the American system of democratic government. Fifty years later, the entrusted amount, still administered by the University, had grown to almost $1.9 million. In November 1921, Lane Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named for the former Secretary. Other tributes to Lane included a World War II Liberty ship, a New York City high school, and a <b>California</b> <b>redwood</b> grove. Lane's patriotic essay [...] "Makers of the Flag" [...] adapted from a speech he delivered to Interior Department employees on Flag Day 1914, continues to be reprinted as a speech and in schoolbooks.|$|E
2500|$|Sequoia sempervirens [...] is {{the sole}} living species of the genus Sequoia in the cypress family Cupressaceae (formerly treated in Taxodiaceae). Common names include coast redwood, coastal redwood and <b>California</b> <b>redwood.</b> It is an evergreen, long-lived, {{monoecious}} tree living 1,200â€“1,800 years or more. This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to [...] in height (without the roots) and up to [...] in diameter at breast height (dbh). These trees are also among the oldest living things on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated [...] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.|$|E
