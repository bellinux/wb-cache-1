40|$|For a long time, the {{application}} of composite materials was restricted to military aircraft and secondary structures of commercial aircraft. Furthermore, the design possibilities offered by composite laminates were narrowed to quasi-isotropic configurations due to their closer behaviour with monolithic materials, hence with a more predictable response, and easiness of manufacturing. However, this picture is changing. Nowadays, there are automated systems capable of rapidly manufacturing large and high quality composite parts. As an example, the fuselage of the all-new long haul Boeing 787 aircraft is being built by means of automated fibre-placement machines. These highly precise systems can build laminates made of <b>combinations</b> of <b>ply</b> angles other than the conventional 0 degrees, 90 degrees and 45 degrees. Furthermore, automated fibre-placement machines can steer the fibres tows as these are being placed, resulting in plies with variable fibre orientation and laminates whose elastic properties vary along their planar coordinates, termed “variable-stiffness panels”. In this thesis, the expression “non-conventional composite laminates” refers to straight-fibre laminates made of <b>combinations</b> of non-conventional <b>ply</b> angles {{as well as to}} variable-stiffness panels. The structural behaviour of these non-conventional composites is not fully understood yet, particularly their damage and failure responses. The goal of this thesis is to shed light on this field.

40|$|An {{updated version}} of the {{integrated}} design program Composite Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures (C/CARES) was developed for the reliability evaluation of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) laminated shell components. The algorithm is now split into two modules: a finite-element data interface program and a reliability evaluation algorithm. More flexibility is achieved, allowing for easy implementation with various finite-element programs. The interface program creates a neutral data base which is then read by the reliability module. This neutral data base concept allows easy data transfer between different computer systems. The new interface program from the finite-element code Matrix Automated Reduction and Coupling (MARC) also includes the option of using hybrid laminates (a <b>combination</b> of <b>plies</b> of different materials or different layups) and allows for variations in temperature fields throughout the component.

40|$|Synopsis: This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on the response of continuous reinforced concrete (RC) beams with shear deficiencies, strengthened with externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. The experimental program consisted of nine full-scale, two-span, continuous beams with rectangular cross section. The tested beams were grouped into three series. Three beams, one from each series, were not strengthened and taken as reference beams, whereas, six beams were strengthened using different schemes. The variables investigated in this study included the amount of steel shear reinforcement, amount of CFRP, wrapping schemes, and 900 / 00 <b>ply</b> <b>combination.</b> The experimental results indicated that the contribution of externally bonded CFRP to the shear capacity of continuous RC beams is significant and is dependent on the tested variables.

50|$|Proper vehicle safety {{requires}} specific {{attention to}} inflation pressure, tread depth, and general {{condition of the}} tires. Over-inflated tires {{run the risk of}} explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid tread wear particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain <b>combinations</b> of cross <b>ply</b> and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 New, high {{performance}} chopped, discontinuous, or short fiber composites (DFCs), DFCs, such as HexMC and Lytex, made by compression molding of randomly oriented pre-impregnated unidirectional tape, can be formed into complex geometry while retaining mechanical properties suitable for structural use. These DFCs provide the performance benefits of Continuous Fiber Composites (CFCs) in form factors {{that were previously}} unavailable. These materials demonstrate some notably different properties from continuous fiber composites, especially with respect to damage tolerance and failure behavior. These behaviors are not very well understood, and fundamental research efforts are ongoing to better characterize the material and to ease certification for future uses. Despite this, these new DFCs show such promise that they are already in service in the aerospace industry, for instance in the Boeing 787. Unfortunately, the relative novelty of these parts means {{that they needed to}} be certified by “point design”, an excess of physical testing, rather than by a mix of physical testing and finite element analysis, which would be the case for CFCs or metals. In this study, one particular approach to characterizing both linear-elastic and failure behaviors are considered. The Stochastic Laminate Analogy, which represents a novel approach to modeling DFCs, and its <b>combination</b> with a <b>Ply</b> Discount scheme. Owing to limited available computational resources, only preliminary results are available, but those results are quite promising and warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and fatigue}} {{properties}} are important factors when developing design rules {{to optimize the}} reduction of damage {{in the middle of}} a composite component loaded under a three point bending test. The progressive damage which occurs in a composite laminate during fatigue will affect the mechanical properties of the component to an extent which depends on the material type and lay-up of the composite and on the mode of testing. By choosing an appropriate <b>combination</b> of <b>ply</b> materials and ply stacking sequence for the composite laminate, a better static condition, as well as better fatigue behavior of the component is expected under in-service conditions. In order to minimize the through-thickness damage {{in the middle of a}} composite laminate under a short beam shear test, the present work focuses on determining the best stacking sequence, combining two different materials through-thickness of a composite component. The use of an algorithm that has been created to run all possible combinations of angles and materials was the key to finding the best stacking sequence for a composite component. Through the optimization method, two different hybrid laminate lay-ups were obtained for a maximum of 40 % of glass plies within a composite laminate. The laminates developed through the algorithm, which are, the Hybrid Design 1 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 c) 2 /(± 45 g) 2 /(± 45 c) ]s) and Hybrid Design 2 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 4 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 2]s), have shown that the best ply orientations to minimize the damage in the middle of a composite component occur when the value of the variable angle θ in ±θ plies has a maximum value of 90 degrees. The algorithm used showed that best laminates were obtained when glass plies were not used as the central plies in a glass/carbon composite laminate, with a maximum 40 % of glass plies. Static and fatigue tests were performed on both hybrid designs and on a quasi-isotropic composite laminate ([(0 / 45 / 90 /- 45) 3]s) made of carbon plies. The results of the static and fatigue tests have demonstrated that the best design, giving the best static and fatigue behavior is the Hybrid Design 1. Also, it has been demonstrated through experimental tests that 90 degree plies within a composite laminate subject to a three point bending condition will cause the component to be weaker in terms of fatigue and static properties due to the tendency to develop inclined cracks in the through-thickness direction on the 90 degree plies of the composite laminate, causing delamination and loss of stiffness of the component...|$|R
40|$|Three related methodologies {{relating}} to the modelling and design of aero elastic aircraft structures are considered. In the first study, a procedure for devel 9 pirig efficient aeroelastic Nonlinear Reduced Order (NROM) Models for aerospace structures containing geometric nonlinearities is described. The structural modelling is based upon a combined modal/FE approach (CMFE) that describes the nonlinear stiffening effects from nonlinear static analyses {{for a range of}} prescribed inputs. The prescribed load cases and resultant displacements from the static nonlinear test cases are transformed into modal coordinates using the modal transformation of the underlying linear system. A regression analysis is then performed to curve-fit the sets of nonlinear stiffness force / displacement maps in order to find the unknown nonlinear modal stiffness coefficients. Once the structural NROM has been defined, it is coupled to the Rational Fraction Approximation of the doublet lattice aerodynamic model corresponding to the wing planform. The aeroelastic model can then be used to predict the dynamic aeroelastic behaviour of the defined structure. The methodology is demonstrated on an aeroelastic model of a flexible high aspect ratio wing with the static deflections, limit cycle oscillation (LCO) behaviour and gust response being predicted. To further understand the aeroelastic behaviour of high aspect ratio wings, and to validate the mathematical model, an experimental model is developed. Experimental modal testing was employed to analyze the dynamical behaviour of the structure and the Finite Element (FE) representation updated to bring the model close to the experimental counterpart. The wing was analyzed in both deformed and undeformed shapes. The static and dynamic response of the wing was demonstrated and a comparison made with the numerical model; a good agreement was achieved. In the second study, an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) approach is used to maximize the flutter-divergence speed of a simple rectangular composite wing through determination of the best <b>combination</b> of <b>ply</b> orientations. An improved aeroelastic tailoring implementation is proposed based upon a combination of rank based and min-max ant system algorithms, and compared with several different implementations. A statistical investigation is performed on the example aeroelastic tailoring problem in order to investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the approaches. Consideration is also made to the best weightings of the pheromone addition and evaporation parameters. In the third study, innovative metallic wing structural designs are introduced {{that can be used to}} influence the bending I torsion coupling behaviour of aircraft wings, leading to the possibility of metallic aeroelastic tailoring. It is intended that the aeroelastic behaviour, such as the flutter I divergence speed or gust loads response, can be influenced in a beneficial way without any increase in weight. Two different approaches are demonstrated: using ribs with varying orientations, and making use of crenellations in the wing skins. The concepts are demonstrated using two simple FE models: a rectangular wing box and a more realistic wing model. In both cases it is shown that bending-torsion coupling can be achieved in metallic structures using both approaches and that this has an encouraging influence on the wing aeroelastic behaviour.

40|$|M (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The AHRLAC {{aircraft}} is a {{high performance}} light aircraft that is developed and manufactured in South Africa by Aerosud ITC in partnership with Paramount. This aircraft {{is the first of}} its kind to originate from South Africa. The aircraft has a twin boom, tandem pilot seating configuration, with a Pratt and Whitney turbine-propeller engine in a pusher configuration. The main structure of the aircraft is a conventional metallic structure, while the fairings and some secondary structures are composite. This study will focus on the design and development of the composite ventral fin of the first prototype aircraft, the experimental demonstrator model (XDM). It is crucial to ensure that the ventral fin can function safely within the design requirements of the aircraft under the loads which the fin is likely to encounter. Preceding the design process, a critical overview of composite materials used in aircraft applications is provided. This will include the materials, manufacturing methods, analysis and similar work done in this field of study. The literature will be used in the study for decision-making and validation of proven concepts and methodologies. The first part of this study entailed choosing a suitable composite material and manufacturing method for this specific application. The manufacturing method and materials used had to suit the aircraft prototype application. The limitations of using composite materials were researched as to recognize bad practice and limit design flaws on the ventral fin. Once the material and manufacturing methods were chosen, ventral fin concepts were evaluated using computer aided finite element analysis (FEA) with mass, stiffness and strength being the main parameters of concern. The load cases used in this evaluation were given by the lead structural engineer and aerodynamicist. The calculations of these loads are not covered in detail in this study. The FEA input material properties used, were determined by material testing by the relevant test methods. The ventral fin concept started as the minimal design with the lowest mass. The deflections, composite failure and fastener failure were then evaluated against the required values. The concept was modified by adding stiffening elements, such as ribs and spars, until satisfactory results were obtained. In this way a minimal mass component is designed and verified that it can adequately perform its designed tasks under the expected load conditions. Each part used in the ventral fin assembly was not individually optimized for mass, but rather the assembly as a whole. The final concept was modelled using the computer aided design software, CATIA. This model used in <b>combination</b> with a <b>ply</b> book made it possible to manufacture the ventral fin in a repeatable manner. A test ventral fin was manufactured using the selected materials and manufacturing methods to validate the design methodology. In the next step the selected load cases were used in static testing to validate the FEM through comparison. The result of the study is a composite ventral fin of which the mass, stiffness and strength are suitable to perform its function safely on the first prototype AHRLAC aircraft. The study concludes on the process followed from material selection to FEA and detail design, in order for this same method to be used on other AHRLAC XDM composite parts. Master...|$|R
