40|$|Radiometric {{calibration}} is {{a method}} of capturing digital images and processing the digital image data so that the pixel values represent actual measurements of light. Radiometric camera calibration converts ordinary digital images into radiometric images. Absolute radiometric <b>calibration</b> <b>means</b> that the image pixels are calibrated with reference to physical units such as watts per steradian per square meter (W. sr− 1. m− 2) or photon counts. Relative radiometric <b>calibration</b> <b>means</b> that the image pixels are calibrated with reference to each other — the ratio of two image pixels {{is the same as}} the ratio of the corresponding physical measurements of light. Radiometric calibration, both absolute and relative, has a wide range of applications in science and technology, including astronomy, remote sensing, and machine vision. Methods for radiometric calibration typically involve up to four steps. First, the camera response is corrected to be linear. Second, the camera's black response is subtracted. Third, corrections are applied for spatial variations in the effective aperture of the lens and the sensor sensitivity. This correction yields a relative radiometric calibration. A final step converts the relative calibration to absolute calibration by applying an appropriate scaling factor. This article first explains the basis of radiometric calibration — the additive property of light and the formation of digital images. Techniques for radiometric calibration are then explained, focusing on the four steps of estimating the camera response function, measuring the black response, correcting for vignetting and sensitivity, and using calibration targets. Finally, applications of radiometric imaging are discussed briefly. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A new {{calibration}} algorithm for multi-camera systems using a planar reference pattern is proposed. The algorithm {{is an extension}} of Sturm-Maybank-Zhang style plane-based calibration technique for use with multiple cameras.

Thus the algorithm yields a simple <b>calibration</b> <b>means</b> for stereo vision systems with an arbitrary number of cameras while maintaining the handiness and flexibility of the original method. The algorithm is based on factorization of homography matrices between the model and image planes into the camera and plane parameters.

The obtained parameters are finally refined by a non-linear maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) process.

40|$|Accurate {{characterization}} of pipeline corrosion defects {{is required in}} order to identify the criticality of the defect, and calculate the remaining lifespan of the pipe. In radiography, accurate {{characterization of}} a defect generally requires an additional object – such as a step wedge – {{to be included in the}} exposure setup. This is used to calibrate the resulting radiograph, allowing for accurate measurements. In the case of the step wedge, <b>calibration</b> <b>means</b> calculating the relationship between intensity and wall thickness, allowing wall thickness loss to be found from the change in intensity caused by the defect. However, in situations where pipe access is limited, for example in a subsea environment, it may be difficult to include additional objects in the inspection setup. Therefore there is a need to develop methods of defect characterization that would not require additional calibration objects. This work presents a method of pipeline defect characterization based on knowledge of the setup geometry and the use of images taken at different angles around the pipe. The method uses background subtraction to identify a defect, with a ray tracing algorithm used to calculate the range of possible locations of the defect in 3 D space. Constraints are applied on the pipe wall location and the effective attenuation coefficient to further refine the defect range.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the pixel sensitivity variation and off-axis dose response of an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID), and develop a correction method to improve EPID dosimetry. The uncorrected or raw pixel response of the aS 500 amorphous silicon EPID shows differences in response (sensitivity) of individual pixels as well as a large off-axis differential response with respect to an ion chamber in water. Both can be corrected by division of raw images by the flood-field (FF) image. However, this leads to two problems for dosimetry: (1) the beam profile is present in both the raw image and FF image, and hence is "washed out" of the corrected image, and (2) any mismatch of EPID position between dosimetry and FF <b>calibration</b> <b>means</b> that the beam profile and off-axis response in the raw image and FF are misaligned. This causes artifacts in FF division and dosimetric errors. A method was developed to measure the off-axis response and pixel sensitivity variation separately to allow correction of images at any EPID position while retaining beam profile information. The pixel sensitivity variation is applied to the imager plane and is independent of imager position. The off-axis response depends on the imager plane position relative to the beam central axis. The pixel sensitivities were derived from multiple images of the same symmetric field acquired with the detector displaced laterally between each image. The off-axis response was measured by acquiring off-axis raw images (FF correction removed) and dividing out the off-axis beam fluence and previously determined pixel sensitivity differences. The dosimetric errors due to lateral and vertical detector displacement with the conventional FF calibration method were measured and compared to the new method. Corrected EPID profiles were then compared to beam profiles measured with ion chamber in water for open fields. The EPID was found to have a large off-axis differential response with respect to an ion chamber in water, particularly for 6 MV. This increased to 13 % at 15 cm off-axis for 6 MV, and 3. 5 % for 18 MV at the isocenter plane. The dosimetric errors introduced by detector displacement with conventional FF calibration were found to be approximately 1 % per centimeter of lateral detector displacement and 0. 1 % per centimeter of vertical displacement. These were reduced to less than 1 % for any position with the new correction method. Corrected EPID images agreed with ion-chamber measurements to within 2 % (excluding penumbra and low-dose areas outside the field) for various field sizes. The new correction method gives consistent dosimetry for any EPID position and retains beam profile information in the image...|$|E
