Reporting back to Fizzwidget, Ratchet soon begins pursuing the thief, only to receive a video message showing that the culprit has captured <b>Clank.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was {{the main}} focus of the Insomniac Team during development. The team of around 115 people were aiming to create a new Ratchet and <b>Clank</b> game that would differ {{significantly}} from its predecessors and almost end up being two games in one. Insomniac believed that one of the key processes in the development process was the rigorous testing. Working closely with Sony and listening to fans of the Ratchet and <b>Clank</b> series, they gathered feedback and made improvements to the game. They felt that they had created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with the inclusion of elements of platform, action and side-scrolling gameplay.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & <b>Clank</b> {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, <b>Clank.</b>|$|E

5|$|Both the Resistance {{franchise}} and the Ratchet & <b>Clank</b> franchise {{continued into}} the 2010s. The team in North Carolina developed , which received mixed reviews. The North Carolina team continued to develop the next game in the series, , which expanded upon levels from previous games in the series and has a structure {{similar to that of}} a tower defense game.|$|E
5|$|In Ratchet & <b>Clank,</b> {{the main}} playable {{character}} is Ratchet, whom the player controls from a third-person perspective, though a first person mode {{to view the}} player's surroundings is available. The player traverses diverse environments with a large collection of unusual gadgets and weapons, using them to defeat enemies and pass obstacles. Up to 36 weapons and gadgets can be bought or found in the game.|$|E
5|$|Spyro: Year of the Dragon is a {{platformer}} {{video game}} developed by Insomniac Games {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 2000. Year of the Dragon is the third installment in the Spyro series and the last Spyro game to be released for the first generation PlayStation. The game was also the last Spyro game Insomniac developed; their next title would be Ratchet & <b>Clank</b> for the PlayStation 2.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Going Commando {{is similar}} to that of the original Ratchet & <b>Clank.</b> The player controlled protagonists are seen in a third-person perspective; the player uses various weapons and gadgets to defeat enemies and solve puzzles, while exploring planets, completing platforming sections and minigames, and progressing through the story. The game features many improvements over the original game, such as the aesthetics, and introduces many new gameplay aspects, such as weapon upgrading.|$|E
5|$|In a warbot factory {{on planet}} Quartu, a {{defective}} but intelligent robot escapes and crash-lands on Veldin, the homeworld of the mechanic Ratchet (a feline-like humanoid).

5|$|The company's first {{project was}} Disruptor, {{for the first}} PlayStation console, whose poor sales almost led to the company's bankruptcy. Insomniac's next project was Spyro the Dragon, a {{successful}} video game that spawned two sequels within two years. Insomniac then developed a new franchise, Ratchet & <b>Clank,</b> for the PlayStation 2. The company also developed the Resistance series for the PlayStation 3, and released its first multi-platform game, Fuse in 2013. The company also worked with Microsoft Studios on 2014's Sunset Overdrive. The company's current projects include an underwater Metroidvania game called Song of the Deep, an Oculus Rift action-adventure game titled Edge of Nowhere, and Marvel's Spider-Man for PlayStation 4.|$|E

It stopped--was silent all at once, as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was, but soon remembered--and so, with the same <b>clanking</b> noise, the shadow disappeared.|$|R

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous games in the series but introduces new features such as a new control system and more levels in the upgrade system for weapons.

Characters such as Dr. Nefarious and Sasha, a Cazar starship captain who helps Ratchet throughout the game, are introduced, {{and a number of}} characters return from the original Ratchet & <b>Clank.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jim Cummings was {{the only}} past TMNT actor to appear in this film, where he had {{previously}} contributed voice-work in the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. The film also features three voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & <b>Clank</b> series, Mikey Kelley and Kevin Michael Richardson from the first game, and James Arnold Taylor from the others, playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively. TMNT would be Mako Iwamatsu's final acting role. Mako was announced {{as the voice of}} Splinter at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2006. He then died the next day, aged 72. A dedication to Mako appears {{at the end of the}} film's credits. Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role, Greg Baldwin performs a substantial portion of Splinter's dialogue in the finished film; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu's voice when he took up the late actor's role as Iroh in the concurrently-produced cartoon , and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu's death.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production of {{the game}} began in late March 2001, {{with a team of}} {{approximately}} 35 people.

The game was first released in North America on November 4, 2002, and then in Australia on November 6, 2002. It was later released in PAL regions on November 8, 2002, and in Japan on December 3, 2002. In November 2003, Sony added Ratchet & <b>Clank</b> to their Greatest hits series of games for the PlayStation 2 when Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was released at that time, and the game was similarly added to Sony's Platinum Range used in the PAL region on August 22, 2003. The game was added to Japan's The Best range on July 3, 2003; it was also the only game to be bundled with the PlayStation 2 in Japan.|$|E
