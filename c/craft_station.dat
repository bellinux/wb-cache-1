This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally any item which is destroyed in the loot collector also provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting.|$|E
50|$|A {{maritime}} {{mobile service}} (also MMS or maritime mobile radiocommunication service) is a mobile service between coast stations and ship stations, or between ship stations, or between associated on-board communication stations.

The British Foreign Office protested to the Spanish government over the incident, described as the most serious Spanish incursion since the 1960s. The incident followed previous incursions involving Spanish police motorboats entering Gibraltar's waters, interfering with pleasure craft and protecting fishermen using illegal practices.|$|R

50|$|USS Halcyon II (SP-582) was a yacht {{acquired}} by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was outfitted as an armed patrol <b>craft</b> and <b>stationed</b> in Boston harbor in Massachusetts.

2500|$|Solomon Holbourn, coxswain of the Mary White of Broadstairs had an aunt, Sophia {{who married}} at Folkestone in 1813 to William Stevenson. His eldest son William became a mariner and boatman, and married an Elizabeth Wellard in 1839 at St Peter's, Broadstairs. One of their children, born in 1848, {{was named after}} his father, William, but in his adult life was better known as Bill [...] "Floaty" [...] Stevenson, and {{as a member of}} the Frances Forbes Barton {{lifeboat}} crew. The [...] "Frances Forbes Barton" [...] was originally, in 1897, the legacy of a Miss Webster to the boatmen of Broadstairs. It is recorded as having remained at that station until 1912, when it was moved to the Walmer station when the Broadstairs one closed, during which time it had been taken out on 77 launches and saved 115 lives, by far the most effective of the RNLI <b>craft</b> <b>stationed</b> there.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} popular and unusual {{features}} is the ability for players to build their own homes, called cornerstones. Each World has pre-built locations where a cornerstone can be activated. When activated the players home will appear at that location and will remain there until that player leaves the World or summons their cornerstones in a different place. Players other than the owner of the home may freely enter the structure but cannot add to or destroy the building in any way. They may also access the players <b>crafting</b> <b>stations</b> and portals but when entering the players storage chest, they will only be able to see their own storage list and cannot see or affect the owning players storage. This means that players can summon their homes without any fear that other players will damage, alter or steal from them or their structures.|$|R

50|$|The game {{starts in}} a procedurally {{generated}} world. The player starts with three basic tools: a pickaxe for mining, a shortsword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting. Many resources, notably ores, {{can be found}} while mining or exploring underground caves. The player begins with {{a limited amount of}} health and magic points, which can both be increased by finding certain items by exploring. Some resources, and most items, may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies. The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate <b>crafting</b> <b>station</b> for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench, and bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace. Several advanced items in Terraria require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as an ingredient for another.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, {{recovery}} {{began on}} July 24 with thirty Army and Navy divers at Hugh Taylor Birch State Park, {{where it was}} thought about 300,000 tires were caught against a natural reef. Loading the caught tires onto the Army <b>craft</b> Brandy <b>Station,</b> the first day's haul brought approximately 1,400 tires ashore. Wrapping up for the year in mid-August, Coastal America's William Nuckols told the Associated Press that cleanup efforts have thus far recovered approximately 73,000 tires from the reef.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{which is}} {{administered}} by Naval Station Norfolk, consists of two parallel pile-supported piers, roughly 1140 ft. (345 m.) in length, which form a slip that can accommodate all Navy and Coast Guard ships {{up to and including}} the largest warships afloat, the Nimitz class aircraft carriers. There is a second pier for smaller vessels and support <b>craft.</b> The <b>station</b> has administrative offices and a medical clinic on site. When viewed from the air, the pier configuration resembles the number 41.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to a {{widespread}} misconception, the FUSAG deception was not primarily implemented with dummy tanks, airplanes, or other dummy equipment, since {{at that stage}} of the war the Germans were unable to fly reconnaissance planes over England and such effort would have been wasted. Dummy landing <b>craft</b> were <b>stationed</b> at ports in eastern and southeastern England where they might {{be observed by the}} Germans. (The Allies did possess extensive dummy equipment, which was used in North Africa and later in continental Europe.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Midgley Reefs (...) {{are several}} tidal and {{submerged}} rocks among the islands lying off {{the west side}} of Midgley Island, in the Windmill Islands, Antarctica.

500|$|Zniam was {{stranded}} on 19 December 1943 and was torpedoed by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) two days later. On 24 June 1944, T7 and two German [...] S-boats were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, {{when they were}} attacked by three Royal Navy MTBs near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at T7, but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. The river monitor Bosna struck a mine in the same month, and Sava was scuttled on 8 September 1944 when her crew deserted to the Partisans. Mosor was {{stranded on}} Ist Island near Zadar on 31 December 1944, and remained there until {{after the end of}} the war. By this stage, the RMNDH consisted of a flotilla of small coastal <b>craft</b> <b>stationed</b> at Rijeka. The entire flotilla tried to desert to the Partisans in December 1944, but all but one craft (carrying the commander of the flotilla) was prevented from doing so by the Germans. The Germans disarmed the remaining vessels and sent the crews to Zagreb where they formed a special unit for service on land.|$|R
50|$|The Orbital Ascender airship {{would be}} the final flight stage from the station to orbit.
