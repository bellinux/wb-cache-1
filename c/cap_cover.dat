2500|$|The battle {{commenced}} on {{the morning}} of June 4; the first several waves of U.S. attack aircraft were badly beaten, both near Midway and at sea around the Japanese task force. Then U.S. dive bombers from Spruance's Enterprise located Nagumo's fleet of four carrierswhich, fatefully, were without air cover. Most of Nagumo's attack planes had just returned from the first strike on Midway and were immobilized on the carrier decks, while his <b>CAP</b> <b>cover</b> planes were engaged with battling torpedo bombers sent by Spruance from Hornet (see [...] ). The U.S. dive bombers critically damaged three Japanese carriers including Nagumo's flagship all three eventually sank. The surviving carrier, , gave the Japanese some (brief) respite by sending strikes that crippled Yorktown. But several hours laternear the end of daylight hoursa U.S. scout plane located Hiryū again. Spruance quickly ordered his dive bombers to strike, which fatally damaged the fourth Japanese carrier; it was scuttled the next day.|$|E

40|$|Settlement of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in {{landfill}} is a geotechnical key concern {{since it}} could lead to dramatic failure of <b>cap</b> <b>cover</b> systems.

40|$|International audienceLandfill cap covers are {{designed}} to contain fugitive methane emissions and to prevent uncontrolled leachate infiltration. The objective {{of this paper is}} to propose a method for assessing their impact on the mitigation of landfill greenhouse gas emissions using a new dedicated model (IMAGE-Landfill) that takes into account the different steps of landfill management history as well as the incremental methane production from the different cells. In particular, different collection and oxidation efficiencies are considered depending on the landfill operation, on its life step and on the chosen <b>cap</b> <b>cover</b> system. Two different theoretical single cell case studies and one real-scale landfill were used to calibrate the IMAGE-Landfill model. The results highlight that, depending on the selected <b>cap</b> <b>cover</b> lining system, the potential greenhouse gas emissions may be divided by a factor 2. 5 - 7, even if no energy is recovered from the collected methane. This model is a useful tool for landfill operators to model methane production, but also to select the most appropriate cover type for each step of the landfill lifetime. Finally, this research appeals for a better consideration of environmental impacts when designing landfill barriers...|$|E

40|$|International audienceComposite lining systems {{comprising}} different geosynthetics {{and soil}} are typical capping devices in modern landfills. Analyses {{of the behavior}} of capping devices have shown that they are very sensitive components {{thanks in part to the}} shear strength of geosynthetic interfaces, many of which were reported to have controlled slippage between capping lining components during landfill slope failures. There are some laboratory testing alternatives for measuring the shear strength of the interface between geosynthetics or between geosynthetics and soil. The inclined plane test is especially appropriate for shear strength tests under low normal pressure which is a specific condition of these geosynthetic systems on <b>cap</b> <b>cover.</b> However, the selected shear strengths, inferred from the laboratory experimentation, show considerable variability, which depends on the test procedure. This work proposes a new procedure and a new interpretation of the inclined plane test taking as an example the interface between geospacers and geomembranes often considered as a critical interface. The measurement of displacement acceleration during the test gives the possibility of more accurately defining the large sliding displacement shear strength, which may approach the true residual condition...|$|E
