40|$|Autonomous {{agricultural}} robots {{have experienced}} rapid development {{during the last}} decade. They are capable of automating numerous field operations such as data collection, spraying, weeding, and harvesting. Because of the increasing demand of field work load and the diminishing labor force on the contrary, {{it is expected that}} more and more autonomous agricultural robots will be utilized in future farming systems. The development of a four-wheel-steering (4 WS) and four-wheel-driving (4 WD) robotic vehicle, AgRover, was carried out at Agricultural Automation and Robotics Lab at Iowa State University. As a 4 WS/ 4 WD robotic vehicle, AgRover was able to work under four <b>steering</b> modes, including <b>crabbing,</b> front <b>steering,</b> rear steering, and coordinated steering. These steering modes provided extraordinary flexibilities to cope with off-road path tracking and turning situations. AgRover could be manually controlled by a remote joystick to perform activities under individual PID controller of each motor. Socket based software, written in Visual C#, was developed at both AgRover side and remote PC side to manage bi-directional data communication. Safety redundancy was also considered and implemented during the software development. One of the prominent challenges in automated navigation control for off-road vehicles is to overcome the inaccuracy of vehicle modeling and the complexity of soil-tire interactions. Further, the robotic vehicle is a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) high-dimensional nonlinear system, which is hard to be controlled or incorporated by conventional linearization methods. To this end, a robust nonlinear navigation controller was developed based on the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory and AgRover was used as the test platform to validate the controller performance. Based on the theoretical framework of such robust controller development, a series of field experiments on robust trajectory tracking control were carried out and promising results were achieved. Another vitally important component in automated agricultural field equipment navigation is automatic headland turning. Until now automated headland turning still remains as a challenging task for most auto-steer agricultural vehicles. This is particularly true after planting where precise alignment between crop row and tractor or tractor-implement is critical when equipment entering the next path. Given the motion constraints originated from nonholonomic agricultural vehicles and allowable headland turning space, to realize automated headland turning, an optimized headland turning trajectory planner is highly desirable. In this dissertation research, an optimization scheme was developed to incorporate vehicle system models, a minimum turning-time objective, and a set of associated motion constraints through a direct collocation nonlinear programming (DCNLP) optimization approach. The optimization algorithms were implemented using Matlab scripts and TOMLAB/SNOPT tool boxes. Various case studies including tractor and tractor-trailer combinations under different headland constraints were conducted. To validate the soundness of the developed optimization algorithm, the planner generated turning trajectory was compared with the hand-calculated trajectory when analytical approach was possible. The overall trajectory planning results clearly demonstrated the great potential of utilizing DCNLP methods for headland turning trajectory optimization for a tractor with or without towed implements...|$|R
50|$|<b>Crab</b> <b>steering</b> is {{a special}} type of active four-wheel steering. It {{operates}} by steering all wheels {{in the same direction}} and at the same angle. <b>Crab</b> <b>steering</b> is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but under an angle (i.e. when moving loads with a reach truck, or during filming with a camera dolly), or when the rear wheels may not follow the front wheel tracks (i.e. to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment).|$|E

Generally the 4WD machine has four large wheels of equal size, it has a four-wheel steering system and also features <b>crab</b> <b>steering</b> mode. The special purpose tractor-like vehicle has a travel length of 11.5 m, and a travel height of about 3.96 m. Its road transport width depends on tire dimensions, and takes up from just 3 to(-) 3.5 m.|$|E
50|$|Camera dollies {{have several}} {{steering}} mechanisms {{available to the}} dolly grip. The typical mode is rear-wheel steering, where the front wheels remain fixed, while the wheels closest to the operating handle are used to turn. A second mode, round steering, causes the front wheels to turn {{in the opposite direction}} from the rear wheels. This mode allows the dolly to move in smooth circles and is frequently used when the dolly is on curved track. A third mode, called <b>crab</b> <b>steering,</b> is when the front wheels steer {{in the same direction as}} the rear wheels. This allows the dolly to move in a direction diagonal to the front end of the dolly.|$|E
40|$|A {{self-propelled}} agricultural sprayer {{was modified}} to enable both {{front and rear}} wheel steering through electrohydraulic control valves. These modifications, {{in conjunction with a}} digital controller, enabled the vehicle to be four-wheel steered in multiple modes. The research focused on modeling and evaluating the effect of multi-mode four-wheel steering on vehicle handling characteristics and vehicle performance of the sprayer. The multi-mode steering system was evaluated by driving the sprayer through specified paths in the different steering modes. The position and heading of the vehicle were measured for each mode using two dual frequency DGPS receivers. From the measure of vehicle posture, sprayer performance measures such as over/underspray and crop damage were assessed for each steering mode. Preliminary results show that drivers were {{able to take advantage of}} added maneuverability in headland turning procedures. <b>Crab</b> <b>steering</b> reduced the amount of area sprayed in error during lateral course adjustments. The steering and vehicle models yielded similar responses to steering inputs as experimental responses...|$|E
40|$|Space {{exploration}} {{is moving}} forward {{and one of the}} topics currently being researched is mining. The objective of this thesis is to design and develop software for the auton- omous navigation of a wheeled rover that is being built for NASA’s Lunabotics Mining Competition. The motion control system is a crucial component of a planetary rover system and its implementation heavily depends on the chassis configuration. The configuration of the rover enables us to use three steering modes: Ackermann, Point- turn and <b>Crab</b> <b>steering.</b> The implementation takes advantages of all the modes and involves algorithms for path planning, path smoothing and path following. In addi- tion, the system offers a feature of automatic steering mode selection. The system can be tuned and controlled by the cross-platform application specifically developed for this purpose. The performance of the implemented system is analyzed by testing in a simulator with a realistic physics engine and 3 D visualization capabilities. Our con- ducted tests confirm that the system is sufficient in the framework of the Lunabotics Mining Competition. Validerat; 20131016 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|The NASA/Johnson Space Center {{has been}} {{developing}} robotic systems in support of space exploration {{for more than two}} decades. The goal of the Center's Robotic Systems Technology Branch is to design and build hardware and software to assist astronauts in performing their mission. These systems include: rovers, humanoid robots, inspection devices and wearable robotics. Inspection systems provide external views of space vehicles to search for surface damage and also maneuver inside restricted areas to verify proper connections. New concepts in human and robotic rovers offer solutions for navigating difficult terrain expected in future planetary missions. An important objective for humanoid robots is to relieve the crew of "dull, dirty or dangerous" tasks allowing them more time to perform their important science and exploration missions. Wearable robotics one of the Center's newest development areas can provide crew with low mass exercise capability and also augment an astronaut's strength while wearing a space suit. This presentation will describe the robotic technology and prototypes developed at the Johnson Space Center that are the basis for future flight systems. An overview of inspection robots will show their operation on the ground and in-orbit. Rovers with independent wheel modules, <b>crab</b> <b>steering,</b> and active suspension are able to climb over large obstacles, and nimbly maneuver around others. Humanoid robots, including the First Humanoid Robot in Space: Robonaut 2, demonstrate capabilities that will lead to robotic caretakers for human habitats in space, and on Mars.

40|$|Purpose: Modern and {{advanced}} mountain tractor allows four different modes of steering wheels: front wheels, back wheels, four wheels and <b>crab</b> <b>steering.</b> The current paper presents {{the impact of}} different ways of steering to control the slip in the work transverse on the steep hill slope (39. 08 %). Design/methodology/approach: For each mode of steering eight measurements were made; four measurements at a forecasted speed of 0. 69 m/s and four measurements at a speed of 1. 39 m/s. During the two of four measurements the travelling direction was from the left to the right, and vice versa. Findings: The measured slip depended significantly on the steering system, while the driving direction did not cause any differences in the slip. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied only with the similar mountain tractors, which allows four different modes of steering wheels. Additional limitation represents the working polygon and the growing conditions of grass. Practical implications: The crab - steering resulted in the smallest slip (5. 96 %) at the average driving speed of 1. 08 m/s. When steering with all four wheels, the slip at the average speed of 1. 03 m/s increased to 7. 27 %. The biggest slip was measured when steering with only front wheels was applied. In this case the slip was 8. 07 % at the average speed of 1. 01 m/s. Originality/value: The findings from our experiments indicated {{that it is very}} useful to have all wheels steering tractor when working on step slope, because it is grass friendly, offers bigger agility of tractor and improve the safety of the operator...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this master thesis is to develop the {{kinematic}} equa- tions for NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot. A geometrical approach to nd the kinematic model is proposed. Kinematic constraints is identi ed, and a short discussion whether dynamics can be neglected or not is included. As <b>crab</b> <b>steering</b> is wanted on NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot, a short discus- sion of the kinematics is presented. Ackerman geometry is introduced, and four wheel Ackerman equations are derived. Curvature and turning radius {{is used in the}} kinematic equations, and a singularity condition is both identi ed and taken care of. Kinematic equa- tions are developed further for unambiguous steering angles in all wheel po- sitions and separate equations for all four wheels are presented. A map from signed turning radius to inner and outer side is also found, and this gives us unique kinematic equations. Input like signed turning radius and desired speed in center of robot, outputs correct positions and velocity of all actuated joints. Numerical singularity threshold in singularity workaround are discussed and found. A map from steering angles to number of motor turns is found, as well as a map from ground speed in center of robot to RPM in propulsion motors. An intuitive example where the robot follows a simple path is in- cluded. And in the end, two proposals intended to minimize wheel slip when a vehicle is operating in uneven terrain is shown, and the relevance for these system in NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot is discussed. A sub-goal is to introduce the concept of mobile agricultural robots, and nd a suitable steering system. Battery as energy source is also discussed, and propulsion, traction and frame of NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot is mentioned.
