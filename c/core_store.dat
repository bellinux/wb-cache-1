50|$|Titan {{differed}} from the original Manchester Atlas by having a real, but cached, main memory, rather than the paged (or virtual) memory used in the Manchester machine. It initially had 28K of memory, but this was expanded first to 64K and later to 128K. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite <b>core</b> <b>store</b> rather than the part core, part rotating drum-store used on the Manchester Atlas.

50|$|The 903 was a desk-sized machine {{popular with}} {{universities}} and colleges as a teaching machine, with small research laboratories as a scientific processor and also as a versatile system for use in industrial process control.

The machine was usually programmed in symbolic assembly code, Algol or Fortran II. The civilian 920C was the 905, also in a desk-sized configuration. Some 905s had fixed head disk systems attached. A Fortran IV system was provided for the 905.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to being easier to manufacture, the Mark 4 introduced the concept of in flight insertion (IFI), a weapons safety concept which was used {{for a number of}} years.

50|$|The Argus 500, {{designed}} about 3 years later, used parallel arithmetic and {{was much}} faster. It {{was designed to}} be plugged into a larger 19 inch rack mounted frame, together with up to four <b>core</b> <b>store</b> (memory) units. The Argus 400 was repackaged to be the same as the Argus 500 and the two machines were plug compatible. The Argus 400 used 18 small PCBs for its CPU each of which was wire-wrapped to the backplane using 70 miniature wire wraps. Removing a card was tedious. The Argus 500 initially used the same packages, and also wire-wrap, on larger boards, but later versions employed dual-in-line ICs which were soldered flat onto the PCB and were much easier to remove.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{with only}} 16 KiBytes of <b>core</b> <b>store,</b> the Minisystem and Fortran {{compiler}} would not both fit in memory together, {{so the next}} stage would be to load the Fortran compiler tape (which was stored in another cardboard box on the shelf in the computer room). Whilst this was being read in, and spilling out the other side, the newly punched source tape could be torn off from the free end that was protruding out of the punch, and wound up using the hand winch. It would be loaded into the tape reader once the compiler had finished being read in, and the compiler tape would be wound back into a tidy reel.|$|E
5000|$|The MCU {{contained}} a non-volatile data store, which used a <b>core</b> <b>store.</b> There were {{three types of}} data store, Main Ferrite Store (MFS), Special Ferrite Store (SFS) and Register Ferrite Store (RFS). The MFS {{was used by the}} MCU itself to hold data for various reasons and the SFS was used for manipulating data. An example of this was that SFS2 could take the data stored is positions 1-5 and swap them with data stored in positions 6-10. It can be seen from this that each store had 10 positions and each one could hold values from 1 to 10. Incidentally this was stored in 2 out of 5 code, i.e. [...] = 1, =2, =3. The RFS held data from each of the MCUs associated registers, e.g. dialled digits. There were 20 MFS, 4 SFS and up to 36 RFS.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the Orion's {{instruction}} set used a three-address form, with sixty-four 48-bit accumulators. Each program {{had its own}} private accumulator set which were the first 64 registers of its address space, which was a reserved contiguous subset of the physical store, defined by {{the contents of a}} [...] "datum" [...] relocation register. Operand addresses were relative to the datum, and could be modified by one of the accumulators for indexing arrays and similar tasks. A basic three-address instruction took a minimum of 64 µs, a two-address one 48 µs, and any index modifications on the addresses added 16 µs per modified address. Multiplication took from 156 to 172 µs, and division anywhere from 564 to 1,112 µs, although the average time was 574 µs. The Orion 2, having a <b>core</b> <b>store</b> with a much shorter cycle time, was considerably faster.|$|E
5000|$|Prestel {{computers}} {{were based on}} GEC 4000 series [...] minicomputer [...] with small differences in the accumulation according to {{the function of the}} machine. IRC main machines were originally GEC 4082 equipped with 384 Kbytes memory <b>core</b> <b>store</b> machines, six 70 Mbyte HDD and 100 ports for 1500 initial users. The network has since grown to the point that in June 1980 there are four stand-alone retrieval computers in the London area with six other computers installed in pairs in Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester. The ten computers can output to approximately 1000 user ports, expandable as required to 2000 when the number of subscribers goes up significantly. The GEC 4082 computer with 512 megabyte capacity will interconnect to the 10 and later to 20 retrieval computers to handle the data files. The initial data base consists of approximately 164,000 information pages (June, 1980) with planned update capacity of 260,000 pages. A page consists of a maximum of 960 data characters (5x7 bits each, suggesting approximately 35,000 bits per page).|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{provision}} {{to terminate the}} outer loop (inner loop plus location 1). The tape can be stopped manually, or allowed to run out through the reader (since the blank trailer is ignored). More usually, Initial Instructions are used to read a more sophisticated secondary bootstrap (T23) {{into the top of}} store. After writing to the last store location (8191) the address is allowed to wrap round to 0. Writing zero to locations 0 - 3 has no effect (since the contents of these locations are created by logic gates rather than being read from the <b>core</b> <b>store),</b> and a special value is then written to location 4. This value has 22 in the function code bits and the secondary bootstrap entry point minus 3 in the address bits. This means that the B digit has the effect of transforming the 16 (store) instruction in location 1 into a 40 (jump) instruction (16 + 22 = 40 in octal), and of adding 3 to the address bits. The net result is a jump to the entry point of the secondary bootstrap! ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{steady-state}} probe permeameter {{is designed}} that is robust, insensitive to moisture {{and can be}} operated using a low-pressure gas source.

5000|$|Like most {{machines}} of the day, the 1401 used magnetic-core memory.

A stack of eight such planes stored the six data bits, word mark bit, and parity bit for 4000 memory locations. Together with eight additional planes with fewer cores on them for additional storage functions, this made up a 4000-character memory module.One such module could be housed within the 1401's primary enclosure. Systems were commonly available with two, three, or four such modules. The additional modules were contained in an add-on box, the 1406 Core Memory Unit, which was about two feet square and three high.|$|R
