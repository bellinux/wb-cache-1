Despite its unique features, Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh treated the species under their Niebla ceruchis, a name they misapplied to <b>corticolous</b> species in North America. They also included seven other <b>corticolous</b> species described by Spjut; the listings made without taxonomic discussion or explanation as to why they all should be treated as one species.|$|E

5000|$|Although Howe {{recognized}} Ramalina (Vermilacinia) ceruchis as a <b>corticolous</b> species, {{his interpretation}} of it as being {{the same as the}} type from South America is not supported by the thin-layer chromatography data. The <b>corticolous</b> North American species (subgenus Cylindricaria) generally lack the T3 compound, except species that produce soredia, and two other species that mostly occur in Baja California, V. cerebra, distinguished by swollen apical lobes, and V. tigrina, by accessory lichen substances of depsidones. The species are even more distinct by differences in the lichen cortex, features that distinguish subgenera Cylindricaria and Vermilacinia. [...] In view of these differences Vermilacinia ceruchis is strictly a South American species, which includes other species that have yet to be clearly defined. [...] The species of Vermilacinia that occur on trees and shrubs along the Pacific Coast north of Baja California include: V. cephalota (frequent, California to southeastern Alaska), V. cerebra (infrequent, Los Angeles southwards and Channel Islands), V. corrugata (rare, Channel Islands), V. leopardina (rare on mainland, occasional in Channel Islands), V. nylanderi (infrequent, Channel Islands), and V. zebrina (frequent, California).|$|E

50|$|William Nylander {{described}} Niebla testudinaria as {{a species}} of Ramalina (R. testudinaria) occurring on rocks (saxicolous) and branches of shrubs and tress (<b>corticolous</b> lichen) in California among {{a small group of}} related species that included R. ceruchis reported to occur on rocks and shrubs (and cacti) in South America (=Vermilacinia ceruchis), R. comboeides (=Vermilacinia combeoides) on rocks in North America, R. homalea (= Niebla homalea) on rocks around San Francisco, and R. flaccescens (= Vermilacinia flaccescens) on shrubs in South America.|$|E
50|$|It {{seems that}} Howe firmly {{established}} Ramalina ceruchis as a <b>corticolous</b> lichen species in North America, whereas its occurrence in South America was still viewed {{as one that}} grew on rocks, sand and shrubs including cacti. Additionally, Nylander also described R. combeoides (=Vermilacinia combeoides) as a new species growing on rocks around San Francisco, California, and R. flaccescens (=Vermilacinia flaccescens) to occur on shrubs near Coquimbo, Chile and near San Lorenzo, Peru. Since Nylander’s monograph in 1870, the South American species of Vermilacinia ceruchis and related species there have not been revised except for those interpreted to occur in North America. Saxicolous variants of typical Vermilacinia ceruchis have branches that arise from a holdfast, and well-developed apothecia.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Myxogastria species live terrestrially in open forests.

The comprehensive group of the nivicol Myxogastria populate closed snow blankets, to quickly fructificate at exposurefor example during thawsand release their spores. Other habitats are deserts33 species were found in the Sonora desert, for exampleor living on leaves from plants in the tropics. Some species live in aquatic environments, such as those of the genera Didymium, Physarum, Perichaena, Fuligo, Comatricha and Licea, which were found living underwater as myxoflagelletes and plasmodia. All but one species, Didymium difforme, fructificated only when the water ebbed or when they left it.|$|E
50|$|A crustose lichen {{that grows}} on rock {{is called a}} saxicolous lichen. Crustose lichens that grow on the rock are epilithic, and those that grow {{immersed}} inside rock, growing between the crystals with only their fruiting bodies exposed to the air, are called endolithic lichens. A crustose lichen that grows on bark is called a <b>corticolous</b> lichen. A lichen that grows on wood from which the bark has been stripped is called a lignicolous lichen. Lichens that grow immersed inside plant tissues are called endophloidic lichens or endophloidal lichens. Lichens that use leaves as substrates, whether the leaf {{is still on the}} tree or on the ground, are called epiphyllous or foliicolous. A terricolous lichen grows on the soil as a substrate. Many squamulous lichens are terricolous. Umbillicate lichens are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point. A vagrant lichen is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.|$|E
5000|$|The hamathecium (hyphae {{or other}} tissues between asci) is {{composed}} of persistent cellular pseudoparaphyses (hyphae originating above {{the level of the}} asci and growing downwards between the developing asci), in a gel matrix, with tips often darkened or branched at maturity to form an epithecium (the external layer of tissue of the fruiting body of lichens and fungi, formed by the union of the tips of the paraphyses over the spore sacs). Bitunicate (double-walled) asci are borne in a basal layer and at maturity are typically club-shaped to cylindrical, bearing eight ascospores, overlapping in two series, ranging from hyaline to dark brown, obovoid, clavate, ellipsoid or [...] Ascospores are highly diverse in septation, and range from didymospores to phragmospores to dityospores, at times surrounded by a gel coating, and often show bipolar asymmetry.The Hysteriaceae are panglobal in distribution and are primarily [...] or <b>corticolous</b> (living on bark), although recently a [...] and apparently lichenized species has been described from Tasmania.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Ceruchis-Group", {{which was}} defined by Gerhard Follmann [...] by the {{presence}} (−)-16 α-hydroxykaurane, included species subsequently classified by Peter Bowler in three groups within the genus Niebla (1) N. homalea, (2) N. combeoides, and (3) N. ceruchis. The first two groups are generally recognized to grow on rocks, the third group (N. ceruchis) on trees and shrubs; however, the type for the species in the “Niebla ceruchis group” is one that grows on sand and rock; the type compares closely to specimens that lack a holdfast, {{as might be expected}} for thalli growing on soil. A specimen collected by Charles Darwin was noted by him to have been found at [...] "Iquique, 2,000 to 3,000 ft high, where clouds often hang, lying without adhesion on bare sand ... through the coast mountains, no other plant on the coast for 16 leagues inward" [...] (Taylor Herbarium within the Farlow Herbarium, Harvard University. Vermilacinia ceruchis was described to have a cortex 75-125 microns thick, to lack apothecia, and to contain three characteristic terpenes of the N. combeoides group, described by Peter Bowler to have a thick cortex up to 200+ microns, in contrast to the <b>corticolous</b> lichen species, not more than 60 microns thick. There seems to be no disagreement on the morphological differences between the corticulous and saxicolous groups, only a lack of applying the appropriate types to the names, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Despite the continued reports indicating that Niebla ceruchis, which is a synonym of Vermilacinia ceruchis, to occur on shrubs and trees in North America, it does not occur in North America. Vermilacinia ceruchis is endemic to South America, and may be extinct.|$|E

40|$|The <b>corticolous</b> fauna of plane trees: I. Arachnids (Arachnida: Araneae, Pseudoscorpiones, Acari) From February until September 2000 an {{inventory}} {{was made of}} the bark-dwelling arthropod fauna of more than 400 plane trees (Platanus hybrida), all over the Netherlands. Arthropods were collected from bark and under the ‘loose’ bark fragments at a height of 160 - 175 cm from the ground. Algae, mosses and fungi are important resources for the <b>corticolous</b> fauna. Crevices in the tree trunk and loose bark fragments form a habitat for a large number of arthropods. The <b>corticolous</b> fauna is adapted to an extreme microclimate, caused by fluctuations in temperature, wind, humidity and water availability. Since plane trees are mostly planted in cities and along roads, air pollution is an additional stress factor. In total 31 species of spiders, 1 species of pseudoscorpion, and 3 species of oribatid mites were recorded. In this paper the results are presented with location maps, with notes on the presence on the stems and their ecology. Although the species composition varied from location to location, no clear distribution patterns for the individual species were observed. Only the pseudoscorpion, Chernes cimicoides, seems to be limited to {{the southern part of the}} country. Two spider species, Zygiella x-notata and Anelosimus vittatus were only recorded in spring.

40|$|In {{tropical}} lowland forests, <b>corticolous</b> crustose green algal lichens {{are abundant}} and highly diverse. This {{may be related}} to adaptation to prevailing microenvironmental conditions including, for example, high precipitation and low light intensities. In the understory of a tropical lowland rain forest in French Guiana, we studied the morphology of crustose green algal lichens and measured gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence. We found that (i) periods of thallus suprasaturation with water were reduced by the presence of water-repelling surface structures of mycobiont hyphae at the thallus surface and the medulla; (ii) photosynthesis was adapted to the low light intensities present in the understory; and (iii) photosynthesis was rapidly activated in fluctuating light. The combination of these three mechanisms enables <b>corticolous</b> lichens to implement specific morphological and physiological strategies, which may favour growth in the limiting understory habitat of tropical lowland rain forests...|$|E

Arthropods were collected from bark and under bark fragments at a height of 160 - 175 cm from the ground. Crevices in the tree trunk and bark fragments represent a habitat for a large number of arthropods. The abundance of algae, mosses and fungi, which are important resources for the <b>corticolous</b> fauna, were measured, as well as the number and total surface of bark fragments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{study was}} made to present any {{evidence}} as to differences {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of <b>corticolous</b> lichens from east to west in the Willamette Valley on a bark substrate of Quercus Garryana. Twenty-four species of lichens were observed to be present within the grid area of the 100 trees used in the study, i. e., ten trees in each of ten stands of White Oak. At the western base of the Cascades the total number of species present was 15. This number diminished to a total of three species at the eastern base of the Coast Range. Only two lichens, Arthopyrenia punctiformis and Pertusaria multipuncta, occurred throughout the ten stands in some frequency. Among the stands nine species of lichens were found in one stand out of ten. Variations in the frequency of occurrence were found to exist among the other 14 species, and in many cases not necessarily in direct relationship to their habitats. This was especially true of Lobaria pulmonaria which occurred most frequently in stand IV, but in stand I, which was environmentally similar in all respects to stand IV, it did not occur at all. Certain species of <b>corticolous</b> lichens have a greater tendency to appear on the north or south side of the trunk, while others appear in approximately equal frequency on the north or south sides of the trunks. The grid method, applied to determine the frequency of occurrence, was successful for all three forms of lichens: crustose, fruticose and foliose.

40|$|Lichens {{are a key}} {{component}} of forest biodiversity. However, a comprehensive study analyzing lichen species richness in relation to several management types, extending over different regions and forest stages and including information on site conditions is missing for temperate European forests. In three German regions (Schwa¨bische Alb, Hainich-Du¨ n, Schorfheide- Chorin), the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories, we studied lichen species richness in 631 forest plots of 400 m 2 comprising different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests resulting from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, and site conditions, typical for large parts of temperate Europe. We analyzed how lichen species richness responds to management and habitat variables (standing biomass, cover of deadwood, cover of rocks). We found strong regional differences with highest lichen species richness in the Schwa¨bische Alb, probably driven by regional differences in former air pollution, and in precipitation and habitat variables. Overall, unmanaged forests harbored 22 % more threatened lichen species than managed age-class forests. In general, total, <b>corticolous,</b> and threatened lichen species richness did not differ among management types of deciduous forests. However, in the Schwa¨bische-Alb region, deciduous forests had 61 % more lichen species than coniferous forests and they had 279 % more threatened and 76 % more <b>corticolous</b> lichen species. Old deciduous age classes were richer in <b>corticolous</b> lichen species than young ones, while old coniferous age-classes were poorer than young ones. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of stand continuity for conservation. To increase total and threatened lichen species richness we suggest (1) conserving unmanaged forests, (2) promoting silvicultural methods assuring stand continuity, (3) conserving old trees in managed forests, (4) promoting stands of native deciduous tree species instead of coniferous plantations, and (5) increasing the amount of deadwood in forests...|$|E
