Seventy-two college aged dating couples completed a sexual communication interaction task in a laboratory and then completed self-report measures of family environment, psychosocial characteristics, and past and current sexual behavior. Results indicated that family environment factors were a major predictor of situational social skill for women, but not men. Additionally, participants who indicated higher levels of HIV communication {{were also more likely}} to engage in HIV risk behaviors. Individuals whose partners reported more HIV communication were more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors.

40|$|Summary. The urban living {{standard}} {{index of the}} Population Crisis Committee, based on 10 indicators of urban {{quality of life for}} the 98 largest metropolitan cities of the world, has been used in this paper to create three groups of cities: those having high, medium, and low standards of living. The discriminant analysis technique has been applied for identifying those measures that contribute most in discriminating the three groups. The adequacy of the technique has been demonstrated by the fact that 97 per cent of the cases have been correctly classified. The first discriminant function accounted for 93 per cent of the total discriminable variance. The analysis shows that food cost, measured by the percentage of income spent on food, is the most influential discriminator among the three groups of cities. The other important discriminators are living space (number of persons per room), housing standard (percentage of homes with water/electric-ity), <b>communication</b> (<b>number</b> of telephones per 100 persons), education (percentage of children in secondary school), and infant mortality rate (infant deaths per 1000 live births).

For an indoor <b>communication</b> <b>number</b> of users and their device are increasing very rapidly so as a result capacity of frequency spectrum to accommodate further users in future is limited and also it would be difficult for service providers to provide more user reliable and high speed communication so this short come can be solve in future by using Li-Fi based indoor communication system. Li-Fi which is an emerging branch of optical wireless communication can be useful in future as a replacement and backup of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) for indoor communication because it can provide high data rate of transmission along with high capacity to utilize more users as its spectrum bandwidth is much broader than the radio spectrum. In this paper we will look at the different aspects of the Li-Fi based indoor communication system,summarizes some of the research conducted so far and we will also proposed a Li-Fi based communication model keeping in mind coverage area for multiple user and evaluate its performance under different scenarios.

40|$|In recent years, great {{disasters}} {{happen now}} and then. Disaster management test the emergency operation {{ability of the}} government and society all over the world. Immediately after the occurrence of a great disaster (e. g., earthquake), a massive nationwide rescue and relief operation need to be kicked off instantly. In order to improve the organizations efficiency of the emergency rescue, the organizers need to take charge of the information of the rescuer teams, including the real time location, the equipment with the team, the technical skills of the rescuers, and so on. One of the key factors for the success of emergency operations is the real time location of the rescuers dynamically. Real time tracking methods are used to track the professional rescuer teams now. But volunteers’ participation play more and more important roles in great disasters. However, real time tracking of the volunteers will cause many problems, e. g., privacy leakage, expensive data consumption, etc. These problems may reduce the enthusiasm of volunteers’ participation for catastrophe rescue. In fact, the great disaster is just small probability event, {{it is not necessary to}} track the volunteers (even rescuer teams) every time every day. In order to solve this problem, a ground moving target emergency tracking method for catastrophe rescue is presented in this paper. In this method, the handheld devices using GPS technology to provide the location of the users, e. g., smart phone, is used as the positioning equipment; an emergency tracking information database including the ID of the ground moving target (including the rescuer teams and volunteers), the <b>communication</b> <b>number</b> of the handheld devices with the moving target, and the usually living region, etc., is built in advance by registration; when catastrophe happens, the ground moving targets that living close to the disaster area will be filtered by the usually living region; then the activation short message will be sent to the selected ground moving target through the <b>communication</b> <b>number</b> of the handheld devices. The handheld devices receive and identify the activation short message, and send the current location information to the server. Therefore, the emergency tracking mode is triggered. The real time location of the filtered target can be shown on the organizer’s screen, and the organizer can assign the rescue tasks to the rescuer teams and volunteers based on their real time location. The ground moving target emergency tracking prototype system is implemented using Oracle 11 g, Visual Studio 2010 C#, Android, SMS Modem, and Google Maps API...|$|E
