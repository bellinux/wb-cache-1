In the HSCB DC-DC converter, {{there are two}} 3 -stage SC cells between HV bus (high-voltage DC side) and LV bus (low-voltage DC side), where each 3 -stage SC cell has 3 pumping capacitors and 6 bidirectional switches. One SC cell can provide the voltage gain of 3 (or 1 / 3) at most via capacitors charging in parallel (series) and discharging in series (parallel) cyclically. Based on the connection of these two SC cells, plus control of bidirectional power flow, this converter is able to boost the voltage at HV side up to 3 × 3 times voltage of LV supply source (step-up mode), or convert the voltage at LV side into 1 /(3 × 3) times voltage of HV supply source (step-down mode). In addition, the controller of HSCB converter contains HV/LV PWM block and phase generator.

The outer loop is composed of a voltage controller, a current control loop including a current controller, a PWM converter, and a capacitor. Then, all the components, except the voltage controller, are identified by a discrete-time equivalent linear model, using the closed-loop output error (CLOE) method.

The closed-loop output impedances of the converter under single-voltage-loop and dual-loop controls are derived and compared. It is shown that both control strategies can effectively reduce the <b>converter's</b> <b>closed-loop</b> output impedance, thus favoring the flow of harmonic current and prevent it from being drawn from either the fuel cell branch or the dc-link capacitor. However, as shown by experimental results, the use of conventional PI control alone still produces noticeable voltage ripple on the dc voltage bus due to harmonic current being drawn from the dc-link capacitor. Proportional-resonant control is proposed to effectively compensate for the dc-bus voltage variation by generating an extremely low impedance path for harmonic current flow at specific frequency. An analog-based frequency tracking circuit is further proposed to adjust the resonant frequency for compensating the effect of harmonic frequency variation.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} digital control {{has resulted in}} many improvements in low power switching mode power converters. Digital control has introduced alternative control laws and new features to previously analogue-controlled converters. It has also enhanced performance and cost factors in particular applications. This is evident in systems comprising of multiple ASICs, DSPs, memory devices, FPGAs, etc., which require multiple DC-DC converters. A single digital controller can perform the control {{for all of the}} DC-DC converters even though the specifications of each may be different. This thesis addresses fundamental issues in the architectural design and hardware implementation of a digital controller for such multi-rail systems. A review of conventional digital controllers indicates that they are not specifically optimised for multi-rail applications. In some cases existing digital signal processors are used, which have superfluous features to those required for the simple control task. In other cases fixed-algorithm controllers are used, which are unsuitable for applications having multiple converters with individual control algorithm requirements. A new digital signal processor core that overcomes the shortcomings of existing controllers has thus been designed, implemented and evaluated. The requirements of computational, memory and program control elements have been analysed in relation to the algorithms to be executed and the power converter system to be controlled, where linear compensators for multi-rail DC-DC converter systems are considered in particular. This analysis has led to the design of an instruction set and a corresponding dual-datapath architecture.

Recently, voltage scheduling techniques such as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and multiple supply scheduling (MSS) have been demonstrated {{to be the most}} effective ways in efficient power management, which require multiple or/and adaptive-output power converters. However, researches on such DC-DC conversion techniques are still in the theoretical stage. This research first analyzes and compares prior arts of DC-DC conversions on topology, control method, stability and circuit implementation issues. A family of single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters are then proposed as cost-effective solutions in realizing multiple-output converters. A time-multiplexing (TM) control method is developed to solve the cross regulation problem, which widely exists in multiple-output counterparts. Freewheel switching control and pseudo-continuous conduction mode (PCCM) are first introduced to SIMO converters to decrease current and voltage ripples, and reduce switching noise and current stress. The designs are extended to transform one supply voltage to virtually any given multiple output voltages, regardless of whether the output voltage is higher or lower than the input voltage, or having the same or opposite polarity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} steady-state and small-signal {{models for}} digital pulsewidth modulators (DPWM) employed in multiple sampling digital control schemes for dc–dc switched mode power supplies (SMPS), and identifies the triangular modulation as intrinsically superior to other modulation schemes in multisampling applications. In conventional digital control of dc–dc <b>converters,</b> <b>closed-loop</b> bandwidth limitations are mainly set by analog-to-digital conversion times, computational delays and DPWM delays originated by the sampled {{nature of the}} PWM. While the use of hardwired logic and fast A/D converters minimizes computational and A/D delays, the DPWM small-signal phase lag strictly depends on the adopted sampling strategy. Multiple sampling techniques recently proposed in literature can achieve a strong reduction of the DPWM delay by operating the control and modulation steps at a sampling frequency strictly higher than the converter switching frequency. On the other hand, multisampled pulse width modulators (MSPWMs) exhibit nonlinear behaviors which do not have analog counterparts nor are encountered in conventional digital control, the most relevant effect being the onset of sampling induced dead bands, i. e., regions of zero modulation gain in the modulator transcharacteristic which may compromise proper closed-loop operation of the converter. The models proposed in this paper fully characterize the steady-state and small-signal behavior of DPWMs operated in multiple-sampling fashion.

This paper presents a full-bridge architecture where the traditional single-phase transformer is replaced by a three-phase transformer. A prototype was realized and tested for the power supply of automotive devices. In this environment, {{one of the most important}} requirements is the ability to provide a burst of power during short-duration events, together with high-efﬁciency and high-quality output voltage.

In this paper, the aforementioned issues were tackled relying on an open-loop topology.
