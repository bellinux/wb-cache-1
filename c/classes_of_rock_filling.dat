For this purpose a two-dimensional finite difference model, representing typical pile-supported wharf structures from western United States has been constructed using software FLAC 2 D. Incremental dynamic analysis has been applied to evaluate the response of wharf structure under different levels of seismic loading. The uncertainties at both structural and geotechnical parameters have been investigated using a tornado diagram and a ﬁrst-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) analysis. It has been found that the uncertainties at the dead load of structure, friction angle <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and the porosity <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> contribute most to the variability of the displacement ductility factor of the pile-supported wharf structures.

The settlements <b>of</b> the <b>rocks</b> depend upon the height <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and how the rocks have been laid out.
