India's exports to foreign countries increased during the early 20th century, particularly to the United Kingdom, followed by Arabia, Aden, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Persia and Egypt. However, some 95% of cardamom produced in India is for domestic purposes, and India is itself {{by far the most}} important <b>consuming</b> <b>country</b> for cardamoms in the world. India also imports cardamom from Sri Lanka. In 1903 - 4, these imports came to 269,132 lb., valued at Rs. 1,98,710. In contrast, Guatemala's local consumption is negligible, which supports the exportation of most of the cardamom that is produced. In the mid-1800s, Ceylon's cardamom was chiefly imported by Canada. After saffron and vanilla, cardamom is currently the third most expensive spice, and is used as a spice and flavouring for food and liqueurs and in medicine.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the USSR in 1991, energy relations between China and Russia have been generally marked by cooperation and a regard for mutual geopolitical and strategic interests. China's fast-growing economy places increasing pressure on itself to secure energy imports, while Russia's economy is largely driven by the demand for the export of natural resources. China became a petroleum importer {{for the first time in}} 1993, had become the world's second-largest oil <b>consuming</b> <b>country</b> as of 2011, and the world's largest overall energy consumer as of 2010. In a report released January 2012, the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation estimated that the country's crude oil consumption would increase to 480 million tonnes in 2012, or 9.6 million barrels per day. The group also forecast that natural gas consumption would rise 15.3 percent to 148.2 billion cubic meters (bcd). Given its geographical proximity to China and position as one of the world's largest oil producers and natural gas exporters, Russia has been a clear candidate in meeting this increased demand. While energy relations have been primarily around hydrocarbons of oil, gas, and coal, there have been partnerships with regard to nuclear and renewable (wind and water) energy technology.|$|E

40|$|Summary. — Coffee {{is a truly}} global {{commodity}} and a major {{foreign exchange}} earner in many developing countries. The global coffee chain has changed dramatically {{as a result of}} deregulation, new consumption patterns, and evolving corporate strategies. From a balanced contest between producing and <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> within the politics of international coffee agreements, power relations shifted to the advantage of transnational corporations. A relatively stable institutional environment where proportions of generated income were fairly distributed between producing and <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> turned into one that is more informal, unstable, and unequal. Through the lenses of global commodity chain analysis, this paper examines how these transformations affect developing countries and what policy instruments are available to address the emergin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} the resource rent distribution aspect of the Kyoto process. The paper focuses on the “battle for resource rents” with oil <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> on one side and oil producing countries on the other. Our analysis is carried out within the framework of a theoretical model of resource extraction over time. In particular, it is shown how CO 2 emission caps may be used by the oil <b>consuming</b> <b>countries,</b> acting under the realm of the Kyoto process, to maximize the rent acquisition from oil producing countries and how the oil producing countries may constrain this possibility by exercising market power. The paper also compiles data and numerical results regarding the order of magnitudes of resource rents redistribution. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of cigar smoking {{varies depending on}} location, historical period, and population surveyed, and prevalence estimates vary somewhat depending on the survey method. The U.S. is the top <b>consuming</b> <b>country</b> by far, followed by Germany and the UK; the U.S. and western Europe account for about 75% of cigar sales worldwide. The 2005 U.S. National Health Interview Survey estimated that 2.2% of adults smoke cigars, {{about the same as}} smokeless tobacco but far less than the 21% of adults who smoke cigarettes; it also estimated that 4.3% of men but only 0.3% of women smoke cigars. A 2007 California study found that gay men and bisexual women smoke significantly fewer cigars than the general population of men and women, respectively. Substantial and steady increases in cigar smoking were observed during the 1990s and early 2000s in the U.S. among both adults and adolescents. Data suggest that cigar usage among young adult males increased threefold during the 1990s, a 1999-2000 survey of 31,107 young adult U.S. military recruits found that 12.3% smoked cigars, and a 2003-2004 survey of 4,486 high school students in a Midwestern county found that 18% smoked cigars. Recent CDC Youth Risk surveys show a decline in tobacco use, and does not distinguish between premium and little cigar usage. It is assumed that premium cigar use among adolescents is negligible.|$|E

The technology for producing the substitute is known, and the strategy of the <b>consuming</b> <b>country</b> is to choose an investment program for installing the substitute. We derive equilibrium configurations of investment and extraction for the case of linear demand under three scenarios: (1) the resource supplier is a von Stackelberg leader; (2) the <b>consuming</b> <b>country</b> is a von Stackelberg leader; and (3) buyers and sellers of the resource engage each other period by period.

40|$|With {{crude oil}} price largely fluctuating, both oil {{producing}} and <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> {{have come to}} identify the challenges brought by the destabilization of crude oil price. Among those, there have been discussions on fair price, that is, the price level which both consuming and oil producing countries can accept. It is, however, difficult to specify a particular price level as a fair price. It is reasonable to understand that a fair price {{is determined by the}} price level obtained {{as a result of the}} pursuit of stabilization of the crude oil market by both oil producing and <b>consuming</b> <b>countries.</b> As measures for stabilization of the crude oil market, it is important to form a mechanism that provides the market with balanced information that will avoid unnecessary price fluctuation, taking into account the recently increasing importance of “market sentiments” and “information” in price formation. It is furthermore meaningful that both oil producing and <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> ensure enough flexibility to absorb the occurrence of unexpected phenomena in terms of supply and demand. It is also important to ensure a diversity of market players and design a system where the market mechanism is exerted to the utmost extent. crude oil, price level, price stabilisation, oil consumption, oil supply...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} key industry and other stakeholders and their embeddedness in particular national contexts in driving the proliferation and co-evolution of sustainability standards, based {{on the case of}} the global coffee industry. We find that institutional conditions and market opportunity structures in <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> have been important sources of standards variation, for example in the cases of Fairtrade, UTZ Certified and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4 C). In turn, supplier structures in producing countries as well as their linkages with traders and buyers targeting particular <b>consuming</b> <b>countries</b> have been key mechanisms of standards transmission and selection. Unlike prior research, which has emphasized the role of global actors and structures in promoting – and hindering – sustainability initiatives, we argue that national economic and institutional conditions in <b>consuming</b> and producing <b>countries</b> have not only served as important drivers of standards multiplicity and co-evolution, but also as catalysts for the entire global sustainability movement...|$|R

If China wants to change the long-standing coal-dominated energy consumption structure to achieve a cleaner and more efficient development of the national economy, increasing natural gas consumption is the most realistic and scientific choice (Ma and Li 2010).

40|$|As one of {{the largest}} {{producers}} and consumers of nonfuel minerals, the United States greatly influences mineral markets and trade worldwide. Historically, the country has followed a policy of relatively free trade in mineral commodities, encouraging consumers to search abroad for low-cost supplies, and producers to sell wherever the price is highest. Of course, there are exceptions, but overall public policy favors trade, allowing huge quantities of minerals to flow across the country's borders. In recent years, particularly as worldwide recession and depressed commodity markets have battered domestic mineral producers, a growing number of voices have called for a change in this policy, for more protection and greater domestic self sufficiency. Should such a change occur on a significant scale, it would have obvious, and serious, implications for every major mineral producing and <b>consuming</b> <b>country.</b> Even the modest movements toward protection {{over the last few years}} clearly demonstrate the potential of such a change to disrupt the existing economic and political relations among nations...|$|E

The findings reveal that there is evidence of OFDI-led trade hypothesis, particularly, merchandise exports and imports, an indication for OFDI to open up important channels for intra-firm trade activities, home country sourcing and backward integration. However, there is no evidence of causality relationships between Singapore’s OFDI and services trade because the nature of services is mainly to provide market presence in the <b>consuming</b> <b>country.</b> As such, Singaporean multinationals are likely to outsource their services either from the host country services sector or their own services-supporting subsidiaries that have been relocated abroad.
