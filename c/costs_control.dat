40|$|ABSTRACT. Although data on Great Lake {{fish stocks}} and values are {{uncertain}} estimates, reasonable approximations {{can be made}} concerning economic losses for the United States from various types of management practices. Based on biometric changes that are projected to occur, it appears that early con-trol of a non-indigenous fish species, specifically ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), can result in signifi-cant investment returns. By instituting a ruffe control program, benefits to the public will exceed costs by 44 to I {{over the next five}} decades. Under a moderate case projection of benefits this will yield an esti-mated net public savings of $ 513 million for the United States. Since sportfishing values are much greater than commercial fishing values, anglers will benefit the most from this program. INDEX WORDS: Ruffe, discount rate, <b>costs,</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E

30|$|The cloud plays {{a crucial}} role for the FMS due to several reasons. Besides {{utilizing}} the edge infrastructure, e.g., vehicle sensors and the on-board devices, the FMS heavily relies on cloud infrastructure to be able to process and reliably store vast amounts of sensory data as well as to connect large number of vehicles and provide centralized, simultaneous access to the geographically distributed fleet (needed by the services such as emergency remote fleet control). Further, since different stakeholders manage different portions of the fleet, i.e., are allowed to access specific vehicles and their data, FMS {{has to be able to}} support multiple tenants. In addition, since many of FMS’s services can be elastically scaled down in off peak times, e.g., during the night, the elastic nature of cloud plays a significant role, especially in terms of <b>costs</b> <b>control,</b> since systems of such scale as our FMS incur very high costs in practice (e.g., of computation or networking).|$|E

Quality elements {{that are important to}} terminal customers are reliability, flexibility, availability, time, <b>costs,</b> <b>control,</b> and after sales support. Overall, {{it is important for the}} terminal operator to provide services that deliver excellent quality and fit into the value chain of its customers. From past and current research it follows that especially reliability and costs (related to quality) are important quality dimensions for the overall quality. Theory shows that structural measurement of quality is possible and this also holds for quality of container terminal services. If measurement takes place, knowledge of the quality performance is the result. Probably, this knowledge about the quality performance results in a need for improvement. This improvement of terminal quality may result in a better price for the services provided. At this moment, it is not possible to compare terminal service quality on this regular bases, as no data are available. ...|$|E

The article contributes to the strategy literature first by exploring how ‘strategists’ are constituted and how they forge themselves as particular types of subject through participating in strategy discourses. Second, it examines the consequences of numericalization for those on the receiving end of strategic discourses. It is argued that the accountability that numbers seek to generate can undermine accountability, and so numbers are not entirely the servant of strategists or frontline staff but instead reflect and contribute to ongoing workplace struggles. Finally, it is argued that both strategists and academics need to reflect on the discourses that they (we) employ because otherwise we risk further numericalizing the other...|$|E
40|$|Construction project <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> {{has often}} been {{subjected}} to a myriad of studies, but these studies are often circulated around the scope of corrective project <b>control.</b> The conventional <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> system is basically corrective based, where the cost overruns have already been incurred and the company may have experienced losses, {{which is a little}} too late. The weakest form of <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> will be where the cost reports for a particular project are unable to make corrections for cost deviations incurred in that project but maybe useful for upcoming projects.
