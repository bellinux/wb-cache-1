The effects of the <b>clearing</b> <b>width</b> on the fl ow fi eld were studied for two-dimensional forest-clearing-forest sequences.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of <b>clear</b> zone <b>widths</b> on accidents and to determine the "break-even" traffic volumes and <b>clear</b> zone <b>widths</b> where accident savings equalled roadside improvement costs. Although sufficient data was not available to determine the statistically significant combined effects of <b>clear</b> zone <b>widths</b> and traffic volumes on accident frequency, some very logical trends were observed which provided the basis for accident prediction models and cost-safety-effective analyses. The cost of clearing the roadside of fixed objects (trees, culvert headwalls and entrances) was generally greater than the present worth of the cost of all collisions involving these objects for most highway segments. For those segments whose accident costs were higher, remedial action should be considered. Generally, these segments have higher ADTs than other segments. In contrast, for all segments examined the cost of flattening the side slopes and removing all fixed objects exceeded the present worth of the savings from the predicted reduction in run-off-road accidents...|$|R

40|$|In the wet tropics of {{north-eastern}} Queensland, {{the composition}} of the small-mammal community close to the edge of an unsealed rainforest road differed from that of the forest interior. During the first of two trapping series, mark–recapture trapping demonstrated that the abundance of Melomys cervinipes increased near the road and that significantly more Rattus sp. resided further from the road. At sites lacking canopy closure where the road <b>clearing</b> <b>width</b> measured 20 m, these edge effects were more noticeable than where canopy closure was maintained across narrower (12 m) clearings, with greater proportions of M. cervinipes occurring near wider clearing edges. During the second trapping series, edge effects also clearly occurred at the narrower clearings: M. cervinipes again preferred edge habitats and Rattus sp. preferred the forest interior. However, no significant effect of <b>clearing</b> <b>width</b> or distance from the edge for individual species was found during the second trapping series. The proportions of Rattus sp. and M. cervinipes had altered due to an influx of juvenile M. cervinipes into the trappable community during and after the breeding season, together with more individuals of Rattus sp. colonising the previously under-utilised habitat near the road. Edge avoidance by Rattus sp. appeared to be linked to preference for undisturbed habitat, while M. cervinipes was more of a generalist. Road verges with grassy habitat allowed the occasional intrusion of Rattus sordidus and Melomys burtoni – species alien to the rainforest...|$|R

50|$|A Special Bridge or Subway Committee {{was formed}} in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a {{solution}} to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Bazalgette's design was rejected {{because of a lack of}} sufficient headroom, and design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a bascule bridge. Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer with Sir Horace Jones as architect (who was also one of the judges). An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a <b>clear</b> <b>width</b> of 61 m and a headroom of 41 m. Construction had to be in a Gothic style.|$|E

40|$|Along a narrow, {{unsealed}} {{road through}} rainforest in north-eastern Queensland, movements of small mammals were examined {{to determine whether}} the road would inhibit road crossings, thereby causing linear barrier effects. Crossings of a 12 - or 20 -m-wide road clearing by Melomys cervinipes were severely inhibited, crossing inhibition of Rattus sp. was less severe, while crossings by Uromys caudimaculatus were unaffected. This differential effect was attributed to species differences in size, mobility and behaviour. Baiting on only one side of the road increased crossing rates for all species. During the breeding season, crossings of 20 -m clearings by Rattus sp. were almost completely inhibited and were significantly fewer than crossings of 12 -m clearings. <b>Clearing</b> <b>width</b> had little effect on crossing rate outside the breeding season. Seasonal dispersal of juvenile and breeding animals appeared to explain this discrepancy in clearing-width effects. Rattus sp. were significantly less likely to cross a road where there was no vegetative cover at the entrance to a road culvert than where there was cover at both culvert entrances. Linear barrier effects for small mammals may be mitigated by narrower road-clearing widths, by replanting of grassy road verges resulting in increased cover at culvert entrances and canopy closure above the road, and by providing more faunal underpasses. ...|$|R

50|$|The Gotthardbahn and its branchlines {{pass over}} {{a total of}} 1234 bridges and open {{passages}} which span a total of 6471 m.

The construction of each bridge represented its own individual challenge, depending on the surrounding geography and geology. With the exception of three arch bridges all steel bridges consisted of very simple, straight, single beam truss constructions. These had to be reinforced already before 1914 still during steam operation of the Gotthardbahn due to quickly increasing traffic and load. Fish-belly truss structures were attached to the bridges from below where possible and an arch truss structure was added from the top, where a short clear height made this necessary, besides other measures. Eventually all original iron bridges had to be replaced with modern bridges {{because they had been}} built and were repeatedly reinforced to specifications that again and again were surpassed by increasing traffic, velocity and load.|$|E

The results show that both the lateral flow in front of pier and the turbulent flow behind it could result in a force upon ship. The magnitude of the force is related to the distance between ship and bridge. The motion of ship can increase the weaving amplitude of pier wake and the width of turbulent area after it passes through the bridge. 1...|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{concept in}} understanding run-off-road crashes is the clear zone. This is the roadside {{area that is}} free from obstacles and dangerous slopes.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the clear}} zone design parameters, including driver reaction time, conditions of vehicle leaving roadway and driving distance in clear zone.

40|$|Abstract The interrelationship between {{variables}} {{involved in}} focusing schlieren systems is fairly well understood, however how changing the variables affects the resultant images is not. In addition, modified grids and arrangements, such as two dimensional, colour and retroreflective systems {{have never been}} directly compared to a standard system. The existing theory is developed from first principles to its current state. An apparatus was specifically designed to test grid and arrangement issues while keeping the system geometry, optical components and the test object identical. Source grid line spacing and <b>clear</b> line <b>width</b> to dark line width ratio were varied to investigate the limits of diffraction and banding and to find an optimum grid for this apparatus. Two dimensional, colour, retroreflective and a novel projected arrangement were then compared to this optimum case. In conclusion, the diffraction limit is accurately modelled by the mathematical equations. The banding limit is slightly less well modelled as additional factors seem to affect the final image. Inherent problems with the two dimensional and colour systems indicate that while they can be useful, they are not worth developing further though chromatism in the system meant that colour systems were not fully investigated. The retroreflective and projected systems have the most potential for large scale use and should be developed further...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the normal anatomic radiographic land-marks of the ankle syndesmosis, standardized anterior-posterior radiographs {{of the right}} ankle were performed on 40 male and 40 female volunteers. The average tibio-fibular clear space was 3. 8 mm in females, 4. 6 mm in males, and 4. 2 mm overall. The tibiofibular overlap mea-sured 6. 0 mm in females, 9. 6 mm in males, and 7. 8 mm overall. Due to this variability and the gender differences, we investigated the anatomy of the syndesmosis as ra-tios of the potentially variable values to fixed landmarks. The ratio of the tibiofibular overlap to the fibular width averaged 54 % and {{the ratio of the}} tibiofibular clear space to the fibular width averaged 30 %, with no statis-tically significant difference due to gender. Our data show that for 90 % prediction intervals, the values are: (I) tibiofibular clear space less than 5. 2 mm in women and 6. 5 mm in men; (2) tibiofibular overlap of greater than 2. 1 mm in females and 5. 7 mm in males; (3) tibiofibular 0 verlap:fibular width ratio greater than 24 %; (4) tibiofibular <b>clear</b> space:fibular <b>width</b> ratio less than 44 %.

40|$|Brazilian {{legislation}} considers river margins {{as environmental}} preservation areas {{that should not}} be used for agricultural production or other commercial activities. For small areas, were detailed cartographic data is available, the definition of these areas are simpler tasks however, Country wide estimates of protected area is still a mater of debate. For large area estimates, two mains uncertainties occur. The lack of detailed cartographic data at suitable scales under-represents the river channels and thus, makes it difficult to estimate total river length. Also, marginal preservation areas are a function of channel width, an information often lacking but crucial for the correct estimation of protected areas in large river basins. Here, three methods for estimating marginal preservation areas are applied to the Ji-Paraná river basin (RO, Brazil) in order to evaluate the importance of channel width. The first considers a constant width along the entire river network for estimating preserved area. The second divides the basin according to the location of fluviometric stations and prescribes different widths for each sub-basin while the third estimates channel width based on an area:width relationship. Total protected area for the three methods ranges from 2 % to 21 % of basin area, making it <b>clear</b> that channel <b>width</b> should be taken into account when estimating protected areas for large regions and that the methods and assumption used in defining such areas should be clearly stated in order to avoid precipitated conclusions. 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{shape analysis}} of the caudate nucleus structure in a large schizophrenia study (30 controls, 60 schizophrenics). Although {{analysis of the}} caudate has not drawn the same attention as the hippocampus, it is a key basal ganglia structure shown to present di#erences in early development (e. g. autism) and also to present changes due to drug treatment. Left and right caudate were segmented from high resolution MRI using a reliable, semi-automated technique. Shapes were parametrized by a surface description, aligned, and finally represented as medial mesh structures (m-reps). Since schizophrenia patients were categorized based on treatment, we could test size and shape di#erences between normals, atypically and typically treated subjects. Statistical shape analysis used permutation tests on objects represented by medial representations. This allowed us to bypass the common problems of feature reduction inherent to low sample size and high dimensional feature vectors. Moreover, this test is non-parametric and {{does not require the}} choice of a shape template. The choice of medial shape representations led to a separate testing of global and local growth versus deformation. Results show significant caudate size and shape di#erences, not only between treatment groups and controls, but also among the treatment groups. Shape di#erences were not found when both treatment groups were grouped into one patient group and compared to controls. There was a <b>clear</b> localization of <b>width</b> and deformation change in the caudate head.
