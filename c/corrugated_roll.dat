40|$|The article {{explains}} {{the influence of}} number of passes on {{the parameters of the}} microstructure of D 16 aluminium alloy during rolling in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls,</b> and the impact of the drafts while rolling of the strips on the longitudinal wedge mill. A comparative evaluation of the grain size of the ultrafine grained structure was conducted after rolling strips in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls</b> by various passes, and after rolling on the longitudinal wedge mill at deformation temperature of 320 °C. It is shown that the sheet material of D 16 aluminium alloy ensures uniform formation of an ultrafine grain structure with the size of about 220 - 240 nm, which leads to increased strength properties of the alloy and preserve good ductility...|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} of cutting, attrition, and crushing occurs in rollermills. These are smooth or <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls</b> rotating {{at the same}} speed set at a pre-determined distance apart with material passing between the two. A tearing action may be added by operating the rolls at different speeds and by different for each roll.|$|R
50|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls</b> {{spinning}} {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. Oat flakes, also known as rolled oats, have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} oat groats passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick rolled oats, whereas whole oat groats are used to make regular, medium and thick rolled oats. Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36 mm to 1.00 mm.|$|R

40|$|European earwigs (Forficula auricularia L.) were sampled in a Canterbury apple orchard {{over two}} growing seasons using shelter traps {{comprised}} of <b>corrugated</b> cardboard <b>rolls.</b> Adult activity peaked during December and January in both seasons, while activity of nymphs peaked two weeks earlier. Earwig counts were consistently higher in a block receiving herbicide treatments, {{compared with an}} adjacent block receiving pea straw mulch. Competition between the sampling unit and the surrounding pea-straw habitat probably explains this effect. Factors affecting the sampling method used are discussed, {{and the need for}} an alternative sampling system that better reflects absolute abundance is concluded...|$|R
50|$|Above the awning are {{two levels}} of {{projecting}} verandahs. These highly ornate verandahs are supported by twin cast-iron columns and feature timber handrails, cast-iron balustrades and brackets and a timber and cast-iron frieze at the junction {{between the first and}} second levels. French doors open onto the verandah which is roofed with <b>rolled</b> <b>corrugated</b> iron.|$|R
60|$|THE giant gave a roar {{like that}} of a baby bull when he saw Prince Melga {{standing}} before him, and in a twinkling he had caught up a big club that stood near and began whirling it over his head. But before it could descend, the prince ran at him and stuck his sword as far as it would go into the corrugated body of the giant. Again the monster roared and tried to fight; but the sword had hurt him badly, and the prince pushed it into the evil creature again and again, until the end came, and his <b>corrugated</b> enemy <b>rolled</b> over upon the floor quite dead.|$|R
5000|$|Second World War {{remnants}} include {{concrete slabs}} {{and a number}} of creek crossings, concrete drains and footbridges at the J.C. Slaughter Falls and Hoop Pine Picnic Grounds. There is also a [...] "Detonator Locker", cut into a hillside and partially covered with earth, beside one of the walking tracks in J.C. Slaughter Falls Park. It is formed by curved <b>corrugated</b> iron, <b>rolled</b> to an elliptical profile. The manufacturer's stamp [...] "Manufactured by the American Rolling Mill Co. Middleton Ohio" [...] is still clearly visible. The back wall of the shelter is formed by tray-profile sheet metal. A steel frame surrounds the opening. There is a section of steel frame inside the shelter, which appears to have been built to reinforce the structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has {{rectangular}} timber sash windows. Windows {{on the first}} and second floors are arranged in an alternating pattern of paired narrow arched windows and wider single arched windows. A timber-framed verandah projects from the first floor. It has a <b>rolled</b> <b>corrugated</b> iron roof and ornamental cast-iron balustrade, posts, post brackets and frieze. The building has painted corrugated iron hip roofs with narrow overhangs supported on paired modillions. Three rendered chimney stacks are located along the ridges of the roof.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{part of the}} {{building}} is the southeast corner facing Ruthven Street with subsequent extensions made to the west and the north. The ground floor of this southeast section has been extensively remodelled with most decorative features removed and original columns replaced by round steel columns. The first floor retains much of the 1910 interior including timber posts and an elaborate pressed metal ceiling. This coved ceiling is divided into three vaulted bays which run east to west. Each vault is roofed by a corrugated iron hip roof and illuminated by skylights with <b>rolled</b> <b>corrugated</b> iron roofs.|$|R
40|$|A {{dry milling}} {{strategy}} has been developed for separating oats into bran-rich and starch-rich fractions. For the first time, this process combined the benefits of oat pearling with the efficiency of break and reduction milling and sifting to allow production of flour and bran fractions from an oat cultivar of high lipid content. The bran-rich fraction complies with the separation ratio and chemical composition of the AACC’s definition for oat bran. Oat cultivars with a lipid content below 10 % (db) can be dry milled by the process developed in this study. The roll disposition, roll gap and the speed differential of the <b>corrugated</b> and smooth <b>rolls</b> together with the aperture size of the sieves for flour separation were the important parameters that determined the milling and separation efficiency of this oat dry milling process. Critical settings of these parameters included a roll disposition of dull to dull, a roll gap of not larger than 0. 1 mm, and a sieve aperture size of 212 μm for flour separation. A pearling step as short as 5 s prior to roller milling effectively removed all the trichomes {{from the surface of}} two cultivars of naked oats. This would significantly reduce the health hazards arising from trichomes during oat dry processing...|$|R
