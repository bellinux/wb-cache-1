DNA samples were obtained from infected plants or cultured bacteria. A typical ladder-like pattern on gel electrophoresis was observed in all positive samples in contrast to the negative controls. In addition, amplification products were detected by visual inspection using SYBRGreen and using a lateral flow dipstick, eliminating the need for gel electrophoresis. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were evaluated in different conditions and using several sample sources which included purified DNA, bacterium culture and infected plant tissue. The sensitivity of the CBC-LAMP was 10 fg of pure Xcc DNA, 5 CFU in culture samples and 18 CFU in samples of infected plant tissue. No cross reaction was observed with DNA of other phytopathogenic bacteria. The assay was capable of detecting CBC-causing strains from several geographical origins and pathotypes.

It reduces {{quality and quantity}} of citrus fruit and results greatly in economic loss. In addition, this disease is regulated under quarantine or eradication program in several countries such as the northern, and the southeastern U. S. The bacterium spreads and disperses by wind-driven rain and penetrates through stomatal pores or wounds. After several severe typhoons and flooding particularly Typhoon Morakot occured in Taiwan, the disease severely emerged. It infects various citrus variaty inclusive of Golden seal orange, navel orange, Valencia orange and Murcott orange etc [...] Notebaly, <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> has been reported on Pummelo such as Wen-Dan which is known as relatively resistant variety. The suggested pesticides include anitibiotics and copper compounds. While pesticide resistance to copper compounds has been repoted, thus eradication becomes the most effevive stretagy for the management of this disease. There is no known biocontol agents available. In this project, native microorganisms such as Bacillus species with antagaonistic activity against X. axonopodis pv. citri will be screened and assessed. The potential application of native microorganisms as biocontrol agents for <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> will be examined. Information gained from this study will provide strategies by using biocontrol agents in disease management of this disease. In addition, fungicides and insecticides comparible with microorganism pesticides will be evaluated to {{serve as the basis for}} the application of abiotic and biotic pesticides combination products. In the long term, problems of pesticide residue in fruits and pesticide resistance will be resolved. 由Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri所造成之柑橘潰瘍病為台灣及國際影響柑橘產業最具威脅之細菌性病害，不僅嚴重影響柑橘品質與產量，造成經濟上嚴重損失，亦是世界各國防檢疫單位所重視的病害，在美國及中南美國家均將之列為植物檢疫病害，並花費不貲極力剷除。台灣地屬颱風易侵襲地帶，今年又逢豪大雨不斷，尤以八八水災後，柑橘潰瘍病菌不僅可藉風雨遠距離傳播，也由風雨在柑橘所造成之傷口侵入感染，而導致柑橘潰瘍病在台灣各地區嚴重蔓延及發生，受感染之品種廣及檸檬、臍橙、晚崙西亞橙、茂谷柑等，甚至連原屬較抗病之柚類，如文旦，亦發現有潰瘍病。目前雖有推薦使用波爾多液、氧化亞銅、嘉賜銅等防治此病害，然報導指出已有抗藥性菌系出現，無法有效抑止此病害之蔓延及傳播，因而砍除及銷毀植株為目前不得已而採行之最有效之防治策略。本研究擬篩選對柑橘潰瘍病菌具拮抗能力之台灣本土枯草桿菌屬菌株，並評估其應用於柑橘潰瘍病防治之潛力，本研究所建立相關應用技術將可提供擬定應用微生物防治柑橘潰瘍病之依據。另針對常用殺蟲及殺菌劑篩選與生物製劑具親和性之藥劑，作為生物與非生物藥劑混合應用基礎，以降低農藥殘留與減少抗藥性問題產生...|$|E

40|$|Droplet digital {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (ddPCR) is a novel molecular biology technique providing absolute quantification of target nucleic acids {{without the need for}} an external calibrator. Despite its emerging applications in medical diagnosis, there are few reports of its use for the detection of plant pathogens. This work was designed to assess the diagnosis potential of the ddPCR for absolute quantitative detection of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium that causes <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> in susceptible Citrus species. We transferred an established quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> diagnosis directly to the ddPCR format and compared the performance of the two methods. The qPCR assay has a broader dynamic range compared to the ddPCR assay and the ddPCR assay has a significantly higher degree of sensitivity compared to the qPCR assay. The influence of PCR inhibitors can be reduced considerably in the ddPCR assay because the collection of end-point fluorescent signals and the counting of binomial events (positive or negative droplets) are associated with a Poisson algorithm. The ddPCR assay also shows lower coefficient of variation compared to the qPCR assay especially in low target concentration. The linear association of the measurements by ddPCR and qPCR assays is strong (Pearson correlation = 0. 8633; P< 0. 001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicates the ddPCR methodology is a more robust approach for diagnosis of <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker.</b> In summary, the results demonstrated that the ddPCR assay has the potential for the quantitative detection of X. citri subsp. citri with high precision and accuracy as compared with the results from qPCR assay.

The pathogenicity defect of the colS, colR, and colR colS mutants could be complemented using the wild-type colS, colR, and colR colS genes, respectively. Mutation of colS or colR significantly reduced X. citri subsp. citri growth in planta. The ColR/ColS system also played important roles in bacterial biofilm formation in glass tubes and on leaf surfaces, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, catalase activity, and tolerance of environmental stress, including phenol, copper, and hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays demonstrated that the ColR/ColS system positively regulated the expression of important virulence genes, including hrpD 6, hpaF, the O-antigen LPS synthesis gene rfbC, and the catalase gene katE.

40|$|Xanthomonas axonopodis {{pathovar}} citri (Xac) causes <b>bacterial</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>canker,</b> {{a serious}} disease of most citrus species. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is the causal agent of black rot disease in cruciferous plants. In Xcc, cell-cell signaling is mediated by diffusible signal factor (DSF). Synthesis of DSF depends on RpfB and RpfF. DSF perception and signal transduction {{have been suggested}} to involve a two-component system comprising RpfC and RpfG. It has been proposed that these proteins participate in a signal transduction system linking changes in the environment to the synthesis of DSF and the expression of virulence genes. Although the cluster of the rpf genes in Xac has synteny with the corresponding cluster in Xcc, two genes (rpfH and rpfI) are absent in Xac. To investigate DSF-mediated regulation during Xac-Citrus limon interaction, we constructed two strains of Xac, one with a mutation in the rpfF gene, leading to an inability to produce DSF, and one with a mutation in the rpfC gene leading to an overproduction of DSF. These mutants also show decreased levels of extracellular cyclic &# 946;-(1, 2) -glucans and decreased production of endoglucanase and protease extracellular enzymes. The Xac DSF-deficient rpfF and the DSF-hyper producing rpfC mutants are both severely compromised {{in their ability to}} cause canker symptoms in lemon leaves compared to the wild-type.

40|$|The genus Xanthomonas {{consists}} of bacterial species causing {{economically important plant}} diseases in major crops. In {{a wide variety of}} Xanthamonas species, the transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors (proteins) are synthesized and secreted into host cells, whereby they enter the plant nucleus. TAL effectors bind specific host gene promoters, inducing the expression of the targeted genes, which in some cases leads to either resistance or an enhanced state of disease susceptibility. The TAL effectors in individual Xanthomanas species and their targets in host plants have been characterized in relatively few cases. The premier example is the induction of any one member of a clade of sugar transporter genes in rice by TAL effectors of the bacterial blight pathogen X. oryzae pv. oryzae, where induction of the susceptibility (S) genes was shown to be required for the disease process.

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> is {{a serious}} disease of sweet cherry that limits orchard life and tree productivity.  New York tree fruit growers ranked the need for {{research}} on <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> in the top ten. Currently, copper sprays are used to manage the disease, however, the effectiveness of copper sprays in protecting pruning cuts is unknown. Leaving a 15 -cm-long pruning stub to manage the lethal canker phase of the disease has shown promise. The occurrence of copper-resistant bacteria and negative impacts of copper on soils underscore the need for research. We studied the effectiveness of spring copper sprays and the pruning stub in preventing canker infection. Neither copper nor pruning stubs prevented infection of inoculated and uninoculated pruning cuts. Six training systems were assessed and ranked in order of increasing <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> incidence as follows: Perpendicular V, Zahn Vertical Axis, Marchant, Vogel Slender Spindle, Modified Central Leader, and Spanish Bush. Five cultivars in each training system ranked in order of increasing <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> incidence as follows: Sweetheart, Lapins, Tehranivee, Hedelfingen, and Regina . Our results suggest that applying copper sprays may not improve control of the canker phase of this disease. The pruning stubs appeared to impact the progression of the disease by distancing infections from the main trunk. The Perpendicular V and Zahn Vertical Axis orchard training systems showed the lowest vulnerability to canker infections. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the pruning strategy’s effectiveness on long term management of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, {{the causal}} agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker,</b> is {{currently}} causing severe economic losses to kiwifruit production worldwide. The pathogen has affected green-fleshed kiwifruit cutlivars and yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars since 1988 and 2006 in Korea, respectively. In recent years, the biovar 3 strains of P. syringae pv. actinidiae were introduced through imported contaminated pollens and have rapidly spread to neighboring kiwiruit orchards by secondary infection, leading to outbreaks of <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> and tremendous damages on yellow- and red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars. In this review, we summarize the various management practices of <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> of kiwifruit such as disease escaping, cultural practices, blocking of dissemination, early diagnosis, eradication of inoculum sources, chemical control, and trunk injection {{on the basis}} of our research works and field experiences and important research products conducted during the last three decades in the world. Finally, we propose a manual for the efficient management of the disease that can be practically utilized at the farmers’ orchards in order to keep kiwifruit vines healthy in the future...|$|R
30|$|Bacillus spp. are Gram-positive {{bacteria}} found diversely {{in nature}} especially in soil. In unsuitable {{conditions such as}} high temperature, radiation and harsh chemical reagents, they can form endospores for survival (Errington 2003). Besides spore forming, Bacillus spp. are also able to produce secondary metabolite products (Sansinenea and Ortiz 2011), which is an additional function to compete against other organisms. Bioactive compounds from Bacillus subtilis, bacteriocin-like substances, were reported to inhibit several clinical bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi (Xie et al. 2009) and also a substance from Bacillus licheniformis could inhibit food spoilage bacteria (Guo et al. 2012). Moreover, the culture supernatant from Bacillus spp. isolated from soil named KW and SA was reported to contain N-acyl homoserine lactone that significantly decreased biofilm formation of Burkholderia pseudomallei (Ramli et al. 2012). In addition, the Bacillus strain TKS 1 - 1 in endospore form, was used to {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> (Huang et al. 2012). Some Bacillus spp. can produce several types of active compounds such as B. amyloliquefaciens FZB 42 that has 8.5 % of the genome dedicated for the synthesis of secondary metabolites (Chen et al. 2007). It can produce lipopeptides; surfactin, fengycin, bacillomycin D, polyketide (difficidin) and dipeptide bacilysin that can suppress growth of Erwinia amylovora (Chen et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) A strain causes <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker,</b> {{a serious}} leaf, fruit and stem {{spotting}} disease of several Citrus species. X. alfalfae subsp. citrumelonis (Xac) {{is the cause}} of citrus bacterial spot, a minor disease of citrus nursery plants and X. campestris pv. campestris (Xc) is a systemic pathogen that causes black rot of cabbage. Xanthomonas spp. form biofilms in planta that facilitate the host infection process. Herein, the role of extracellular DNA (eDNA) was evaluated in the formation and stabilization of the biofilm matrix at different stages of biofilm development. Fluorescence and light microscopy, as well as DNAse treatments, were used to determine the presence of eDNA in biofilms and bacterial cultures. DNAse treatments of Xcc strains and Xac reduced biofilm formation at the initial stage of development, as well as disrupted preformed biofilm. By comparison, no significant effect of the DNAse was detected for biofilm formation by Xc. DNAse effects on biofilm formation or disruption varied among Xcc strains and Xanthomonas species which suggest different roles for eDNA. Variation in the structure of fibers containing eDNA in biofilms, bacterial cultures, and in twitching motility was also visualized by microscopy. The proposed roles for eDNA are as an adhesin {{in the early stages of}} biofilm formation, as an structural component of mature bacterial aggregates, and twitching motility structures...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{fingerprints}} of 148 {{strains of}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri originating from 24 countries and associated with {{various forms of}} <b>citrus</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> disease (CBCD) were obtained by using the Biolog substrate utilization system. Metabolic profiles were used to attempt strain identification. Only 6. 8 % of the studied strains were correctly identified when the commercial Microlog 2 N data base was used alone. When the data base was supplemented with data from 54 strains of X. campestris pv. citri (40 CBCD-A strains, 8 CBCD-B strains, and 6 CBCD-C strains) and data from 43 strains of X. campestris associated with citrus bacterial spot disease, the percentage of correct identifications was 70 %. Thus, {{it is recommended that}} users supplement the commercial data base with additional data prior to using the program for identification purposes. The utilization of Tween 40 in conjunction with other tests can help to differentiate strains associated with CBCD and citrus bacterial spot disease. These results confirmed the separation of X. campestris pv. citri into different subgroups (strains associated with Asiatic citrus canker [CBCD-A], cancrosis B [CBCD-B], and Mexican lime canker [CBCD-C]). The utilization of l-fucose, d-galactose, and alaninamide can be used as markers to differentiate strains associated with these groups. A single strain associated with bacteriosis of Mexican lime in Mexico (CBCD-D) was closely similar to CBCD-B strains...|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> in plum trees (Prunus domestica) is {{a serious}} and recent problem in plum production. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>canker,</b> caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) and pv. morsprunorum (Psm), {{is a serious}} disease of stone fruit, and occurs in all major stone fruit {{producing}} areas of the world. The trunks of the affected plum trees are girdled by <b>bacterial</b> <b>cankers</b> resulting in sudden death of infected trees. Rapid tree death has been observed in several orchards 2 - 4 years after planting. Disease incidences can be very high, and sometimes complete orchards have to be removed. Recently, plum cultivation in the Netherlands has changed from a relatively extensive into an intensive cultivation. This {{was made possible by}} the use of a weak rootstock, Krymsk® 1 (VVA- 1). The lack of chemicals to fight bacterial diseases in the orchards created a need for alternative methods of disease control. To achieve this, methods such as prevention, biological control and plant resistance must be explored and control strategies to manage plum decline have to be developed. In 2010 a project was started to study the epidemiology and possible control of plum declin...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a model, termed D-PSA-K, {{to estimate the}} accumulated potential damage on kiwifruit canes caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> during the growing and overwintering seasons. The model consisted of three parts including estimation {{of the amount of}} necrotic lesion in a non-frozen environment, the rate of necrosis increase in a freezing environment during the overwintering season, and the amount of necrotic lesion on kiwifruit canes caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker</b> during the overwintering and growing seasons. We evaluated the model’s accuracy by comparing the observed maximum disease incidence on kiwifruit canes against the damage estimated using weather and disease data collected at Wando during 1994 – 1997 and at Seogwipo during 2014 – 2015. For the Hayward cultivar, D-PSA-K estimated the accumulated damage as approximately nine times the observed maximum disease incidence. For the Hort 16 A cultivar, the accumulated damage estimated by D-PSA-K was high when the observed disease incidence was high. D-PSA-K could assist kiwifruit growers in selecting optimal sites for kiwifruit cultivation and establishing improved production plans by predicting the loss in kiwifruit production due to <b>bacterial</b> <b>canker,</b> using past weather or future climate change data...|$|R
