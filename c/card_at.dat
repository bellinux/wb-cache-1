At any dock, riders may {{purchase}} a single trip ($2), a 24-hour pass ($8), or a 3-day pass ($17), swiping a credit <b>card</b> <b>at</b> the station's kiosk {{to receive a}} code to unlock a bike. Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if paid in one lump; $96 if paid in monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID key that can unlock bikes without a code.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a <b>card</b> <b>at</b> a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care <b>card</b> <b>at</b> the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1991, a {{local group}} in Albany, New York, fought the government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (<b>CARD)</b> <b>at</b> the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission.

5|$|Seattle {{replaced}} Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th {{minute in}} an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match. Casey received a yellow <b>card</b> <b>at</b> the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a shot that was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, {{a little more}} than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the <b>card</b> <b>at</b> each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|E

5|$|Within the books, {{the nature}} of the character's {{political}} opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the circle-A as a character gimmick. The character's tools often incorporate the circle-A motif into them. In his earliest incarnation, he would also use red spray-paint to leave the circle-A as a calling <b>card</b> <b>at</b> crime scenes. The circle-A has also been used to decorate the character's base of operations, either as graffiti or suspended from wall tapestries.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip <b>card</b> <b>at</b> Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Other {{minorities}} lack bumiputera status. 24.6 {{per cent}} of the population are of Chinese descent, while those of Indian descent comprise 7.3 per {{cent of the}} population. The Chinese have historically been dominant {{in the business and}} commerce community, and form a plurality of the population of Penang. Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils, began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and must carry the <b>card</b> <b>at</b> all times.|$|E

5|$|Sörenstam turned {{professional}} in 1992, but missed her LPGA Tour <b>card</b> <b>at</b> the final qualifying tournament by one shot, and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour (LET), {{formerly known as}} the WPGET. She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993, where she finished T38th, 4th, and T9th, earning more than $47,000. She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year. By tying for 28th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non-exempt status for the 1994 season. Sörenstam's first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women's Australian Open on the ALPG Tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a <b>card</b> <b>at</b> random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the trump <b>card</b> <b>at</b> the bottom of the deck is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the bombs}} failed to explode as planned, because the battery had expired due to {{long periods of}} storage. Determined the {{operation}} would remain a secret, the commandos snuck back to Core and retrieved the explosive devices. Not long afterwards, Core and its crew sailed out of Saigon, intact without any damage. Nao, on the other hand, reported the failure of his mission to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters; his superiors did not express disappointment in {{the failure of the}} operation, but instead they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy <b>Card</b> <b>at</b> all costs. Finally on May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as the ship sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River, so they immediately reported the information to the 65th Special Operations Group in Saigon. As usual, Card docked at the commercial port district in the city to unload another shipment of cargo and military helicopters, as well as upload a batch of helicopters scheduled to be returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding home advantage, had to fly nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted a daunting task to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red <b>card.</b> <b>At</b> half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2007 TNA {{held the}} third annual Bound for Glory event, which {{featured}} nine professional wrestling matches on the <b>card,</b> <b>at</b> the Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Georgia. This year's show did not feature a thirty-minute pre-show unlike previous events. The maximum {{capacity of the}} Gwinnett Center is 13,000, however only 4,000 were in attendance for the event. All three of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event, with a new championship being unveiled and the first champion being crowned at the event. Sting defeated Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. Samoa Joe defeated Christian Cage with Matt Morgan as Special Outside Enforcer in another featured contest. The first TNA Women's Knockout Champion was crowned in Gail Kim, who defeated ten other female wrestlers in a Gauntlet match. The TNA X Division and the TNA World Tag Team Championships were defended on the event's undercard. TNA X Division Champion Jay Lethal defeated Christopher Daniels to retain the championship, while A.J. Styles and Tomko defeated Ron Killings and Rasheed Lucius Creed, who were accompanied by Adam Jones—collectively known as Team Pacman—to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Like previous events, another Monster's Ball match was also included on the card, with Abyss defeating Raven, Rhino, and Black Reign in the encounter.|$|E
