The most representative one with such requirement are gas pipelines. Therefore {{to ensure that}} the pipeline materials has adequate toughness to arrest a {{ductile fracture}}, the pipe material must be designed and tested in accordance with the specific procedures, such as one specified in ASME B 31. 8, e. g. supplementary requirements SR 5 of API 5 L.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microstructure}} on the fracture characteristics of high carbon hypo eutectoid steel was studied {{under conditions of}} quasistatic and dynamic loading. Experimentally determined sets of fracture toughness and <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> values were statistically treated. A relationship was found between fracture toughness and <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy.</b> In the very brittle domain, the fracture toughness increases slightly with increasing <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy.</b> In the domain where the fracture toughness is higher, the rise in fracture toughness with increasing <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> is more pronounced. Detailed SEM examination of fractured compact tension (CT) and Charpy V-notch (CVN) specimens showed that the fracture at ambient temperature occurred almost exclusively by cleavage. There were no visible differences in the morphology of cleavage facets on the fracture surfaces of Charpy and CT specimens.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{distance}} between the notch tip and the position of the middle phase in the FGSs on the <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> is investigated in the present paper. The results show that when the notch apex is close to the middle layer, the <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> reaches its maximum value. This is due to the increment of the absorbed energy by plastic deformation ahead of the notch tip. On the other hand, when the notch tip is far from the middle layer, the <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> strongly decreases. Another fundamental motivation of the present work is that for crack arrester configuration, no accurate mathematical or analytical modelling is available up to now. By considering the relationship between the <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> and the plastic volume size, a new theoretical model has been developed to link the <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>energy</b> with the distance from the notch apex to the middle phase. This model is a simplified one and the effect of different shapes of the layers and the effect of microstructure on the mechanical properties and plastic region size will be considered in further investigation.

40|$|Welded steel {{components}} in the primary circuit in nuclear power plants (NPP) like pressure vessels and piping in service are exposed to long-term thermal loads, fatigue cycles and, {{as far as the}} pressure vessel is concerned, also to neutron irradiation. All of the influences change the microstructure states of the steels involved resulting in a possible material degradation or ageing. The paper reports to research results obtained in the nuclear safety program of the German Ministry of Economy and Technology in the last 5 years period. In the case of the steel WB 36 which is in service in some NPP components by Cu precipitation there is a risk of thermal ageing and degradation in toughness and a shift in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (dbt). In the case of austenitic stainless steel components produced of Nb or Ti stabilized material as X 6 Cr Ni Ti 1810 under fatigue loads a phase transformation from the fcc austenitic phase to the bcc alpha'-martensitic phase is observed which can - depending on the mechanical load amplitude and service temperature - influence the material with secondary hardening before the softening phase to the fatigue break. Neutron irradiation influences the pressure vessel material in core-near mainly in the welds by generation vacancy clusters and precipitation of (Cu, Cr, Ni) -rich precipitates in 1 - 3 nm size which are coherent in the bcc lattice producing high residual stresses of the 3 rd kind which can enhance the dbt tremendously and reduce the <b>Charpy</b> <b>energy.</b> For non-destructive characterization of the degradation the 3 MA-technology is applied (Micromagnetic - Multiparameter - Microstructureand Stress Analysis [1]) which allows the prediction of the microstructure changes in terms of hardness increase, shift in dbt or upper shelf value of the <b>Charpy</b> <b>energy...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Fatigue Ductile–Brittle Transition (FDBT) is a {{phenomenon}} similar to the fracture ductile to brittle transition, in which the fracture mode of the fatigue cracks changes from ductile transgranular to cleavage and/or grain boundary separation.

In an attempt to give practical guidance {{as to whether or}} not the FDBT is relevant for design, this paper compares a FDBT curve to the much more common Charpy and CTOD transition curves for an S 460 structural steel.

The operating temperature range for these components is 623 - 823 K, which is the range for the so-called “ 748 K embrittlement”, noticed in cast duplex stainless steel. Therefore, a study was taken up to assess the degradation, if any, in the mechanical properties of this weld due to long term service exposure.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the dynamic loading rate on the tensile failure properties {{of a series of}} tungsten alloys and an austenitic stainless steel were investigated by evaluating the flexural strength with unnotched and notched Charpy specimens. These data were generated with a newly developed Hopkinson pressure bar technique. The technique consists in impacting with a striker, at velocities ranging from 25 to 160 m/s, a round bar specimen placed against two incident Hopkinson pressure bars. Through the recording of the striker velocity before and after impact, failure energy is deduced. At impact velocities greater than 30 m/s, the results reveal a surprising increase of the <b>Charpy</b> <b>energy</b> with the increase of the impact velocity for both types of metallic materials. The results have been interpreted through numerical simulations of the Charpy test, the dependence of the material flow stress with the strain rate, and observations of the failure mechanisms.

40|$|The Charpy {{upper shelf}} energy {{is widely used}} to assess the {{toughness}} requirements of gas pipeline steels. It has been suggested that the <b>Charpy</b> <b>energy</b> associated with crack propagation can be split in two parts. One is related to flat fracture at the centre of a typical Charpy fracture surface and the other corresponds to slant fracture at the edges. As the dominant failure mechanism in gas linepipes is fast propagating ductile shear, the latter is the most important portion of the fracture energy which can be reasonably attributed to the real failure mode of the pipe. Proper specimens with different flat and slant fracture characteristics are needed for a comprehensive failure analysis of the Charpy specimen. This paper describes recent results from an experimental and computational set of studies on high-toughness gas pipeline steel of grade API X 100. The test matrix consisted of three sets of specimens with different fracture characteristics. It included standard C(T) specimens and tensile bars, a novel slant C(T) specimen and a modified double cantilever beam (DCB), and Charpy V-notch specimens. Each specimen type was associated with studies of flat, slant and mixed mode fracture, respectively. An attempt to use the Gurson ductile damage model to cross-correlate all the experimental data was qualitatively successful in general and was also quantitatively reliable for fracture dominated by flat tearing. However it was not quite accurate enough to transfer the slant C(T) data to the modified DCB test.
