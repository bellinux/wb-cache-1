5000|$|In 1994, {{the ballad}} [...] "Ostani kraj mene" [...] ("Stay With Me") went {{forward to the}} 39th Eurovision Song Contest, held on 30 May in Dublin. The {{performance}} is remembered primarily for the tumultuous and sustained <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> given by the audience when the pair walked on stage, in acknowledgement of the prevailing situation in Bosnia, which had the unintended effect of causing Dejan to stumble on the opening lines of the song as {{he was unable to}} hear the music properly.

5000|$|Although the {{information}} about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11 am there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides. But in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: [...] "...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies." [...] On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause,</b> but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the protesters}} {{had no other}} choice, they decided to storm into the {{parliament}} building where they founded the so-called [...] "Narodni parliament" [...] (People's parliament), and where they offered everybody to make a 2-minute speech on {{what should be done}} next in solving the siege problem. Many famous Sarajevans spoke to the full parliament main hall. The president of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović also appeared and presented himself more as a citizen, rather than a president which brought loud <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause.</b> The atmosphere was at its highest point when the commander of the Special forces unit of the Ministry of Interior, Dragan Vikić appeared and told the audience: [...] "To arm against the Serbian aggression".|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, Lee {{collapsed}} on camera {{due to an}} infection. His normal antics were so energetic that apparently the cameraman and the show's director assumed the fall an ad lib part of his performance. The [...] "Peanut Gallery", an audience usually composed almost entirely of pre-adolescent children who were coached by a staff member, continued their enthusiastic <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> from the on-stage bleachers. After as much as ten seconds of writhing by the stricken Lee, the camera abruptly panned to the still-cheering audience. The following afternoons Pinky Lee was not present. This effectively ended his leading role on the show, which continued without him until 1956. Rumors that he {{had died of a}} heart attack, prompted by the incident, persisted for decades. Occasionally, newspaper items mentioned the [...] "late" [...] Lee—even though he was performing at a dinner theater in the same city as one of the reporting newspapers. The incident also spawned rumors that Lee had been institutionalized after going insane on live television.|$|E
5000|$|The opera finally begins, and {{the singer}} playing Carmen {{walked onto the}} stage.

But Tom get onto the stage and catched Jerry, further enraging the conductor. This is the final straw for the conductor and he goes on the stage and blocks Tom's way, indicating that he has had enough of Tom's shenanigans and wants to harm him. Jerry gave a terrified Tom a red blanket, and the conductor started to charge him like a raging bull. The dignified opera thus devolved into a farcical bullfight between Tom and the conductor while Jerry took over the conducting duties. After the music finishes, Jerry bowed down to the audience, and the ants spelt the words [...] "THE END" [...] on the book pages, as Carmen Get It closes to thunderous <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Other {{highlights}} included David Bowie's opening tandem of Paul Simon's [...] "America" [...] {{and his own}} [...] "Heroes", {{dedicated to}} his local ladder company, and New York's own Billy Joel's [...] "Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)" [...] where Joel says after singing it, [...] "I wrote that song 25 years ago, I thought it was gonna be a science fiction song. I {{never thought it would}} really happen. But unlike the end of that song... we ain't going anywhere!" [...] Elton John's sentimental [...] "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" [...] was also well received, among other performances. After one performance by The Who, FDNY firefighter Mike Moran spoke to the audience, explaining that his brother was killed on 9/11, and that the victims would not be forgotten. He ended by saying [...] "In the spirit of the Irish people, Osama Bin Laden, you can kiss my royal, Irish ass!" [...] which was met with wild <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause.</b> Moran removed his cap and concluded with, [...] "This is my face, bitch!"

50|$|It was a {{critical}} and popular success - Williamson claimed the film recouped its budget from one cinema alone. One critic wrote that:There is hardly a moment but is associated with some exciting incident, and the audience last night followed the picture with repeated bursts of <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause,</b> which found echo in the unrestrained appreciation manifest at its termination. Sensational horsemanship and thrilling adventure have been woven into a plot plausible in its entirety and of absorb ing interest. The Sydney Morning Herald declared it:A splendid series of bushranging incidents... It might be wished that Australian reproductions of melodramatic subjects were less frequently identified with the murderous doings of ruffians whitewashed but being in such demand Captain Midnight will {{be recognized as a}} cleverly contrived example of its class. Miss Lily Dampier and Mr Alfred Rolfe figured to much advantage... a long series of beautiful bush spaces... gave realism and distinction to the story.Charles Cozens Spencer would later make three other films based on Alfred Dampier play adaptations of novels set in colonial Australia, Captain Starlight, or Gentleman of the Road (1911), The Life of Rufus Dawes (1911) and The Romantic Story of Margaret Catchpole (1912). The first two were directed by Alfred Rolfe, but the third was made by Raymond Longford, whose early career was sponsored by Spencer.|$|E
5000|$|On 10th June 1891 Leeds Borough PC William Moss {{discovered}} a bundle {{in an alley}} next to the police station. On closer inspection the officer noticed it was {{the body of a}} female child, approximately 5 years old. Inspector Sowerby was one of the principal investigators, and heard the testimony of Ann Turner, mother of Walter Turner. Walter was said to have brought home an object wrapped in linen and hid it underneath the stairs at their house, telling his mother not to worry about it. He later dumped the body in town next to the police station in Horsforth. The body was horribly mutilated and was covered with a white paste, determined by the coroner Mr J.C. Malcolm to be chloride of lime. Turner had inflicted forty-five stab wounds to the body and continued to mutilate the body after the child had died. The child was quickly identified as Barbara Whitham Waterhouse. Sowerby arrested Walter Turner, and gave evidence in court that led to his conviction and sentencing to death in August 1891. Turner's mother Ann was tried as an accessory to her son's crime but was acquitted. The judge Mr Justice Grantham is noted for giving a scathing closing speech to the court, suggesting that Turner was lucky to be in police custody for he would have been [...] "torn limb from limb" [...] by the townsfolk had he been free to walk. After sentence was passed, Mr Grantham presented a bouquet to the deceased child's mother and was met with rapturous <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> as he left the building.|$|E
5000|$|The welcome {{song was}} [...] "One under an Asian sun", the song's lyrics were beamed {{in a huge}} {{electronic}} board. The trio of Lydia de Vega-Mercado, Carlos 'Caloy' Loyzaga and golfer Gerard Cantada puts emphasis on the past, present and the future. Lydia lit the flame in the cauldron. The march-past of foreign athletes, sports officials and delegates from the participating {{countries in the region}} earned a lot of <b>cheers</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> from the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|The Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation {{began in}} 1990 at Wheeler Auditorium at UC Berkeley. This is an unrated, adult {{version of the}} regular program mainly {{featuring}} gross-out cartoons. In the Festival's early days, Spike and Mike would take the stage and introduce the films. Frequently Spike’s dog [...] "Scottie" [...] would take the stage and be driven to shred just about anything (up {{to the size of}} a two-man inflatable raft) by the audience <b>cheers</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|R
60|$|We went up, as before, into a {{dressing}} room, where I {{was presented to}} many gentlemen and ladies. When we go in, the <b>cheering,</b> clapping, <b>and</b> stamping at first strikes one with a strange sensation; but then every body looks so heartily pleased and delighted, and there is such an all-pervading atmosphere of geniality and sympathy, as makes one {{in a few moments}} feel quite at home. After all I consider that these <b>cheers</b> <b>and</b> <b>applauses,</b> are Scotland's voice to America, a recognition of the brotherhood of the countries.|$|R
5000|$|Arriving at {{the theater}} where he and Bugs are appearing, Daffy is furious to {{discover}} that the rabbit's name on the marquee is above his in much larger letters. Rebuffed by the unseen manager's claim that he gives his performers billing [...] "according to drawing power", Daffy is determined to prove that he is the star of the show. That evening, Bugs and Daffy are performing an on-stage number to [...] "Tea for Two". Daffy, tired of Bugs hogging up all the <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> (especially after the reception Bugs gets for his [...] "Shave and a Haircut" [...] bit), and convinced he is more talented, decides to try numerous numbers on his own in order to impress the audience. He begins on the spot with a time step to [...] "Jeepers Creepers". After failing to impress the audience, Daffy attempts to sabotage Bugs' xylophone act by rigging it to explode when a certain note is played, but Bugs avoids the trap by deliberately playing the final note wrong twice forcing Daffy to do it himself and Daffy explodes as a result. (this gag was also seen with pianos in Ballot Box Bunny and Rushing Roulette) Bugs does a sawing-in-half trick; Daffy volunteers in hopes of proving that the trick is fake, but ends up literally sawed in half. ("Good thing I got Blue Cross.") In a final attempt to impress the audience, Daffy performs a deadly stunt (which he refers as [...] "an act that no other performer has dared to execute!"), by drinking some gasoline, some nitroglycerin, some gunpowder, and some Uranium-238, [...] "shake well", and swallowing a lit match ("Girls, you better hold onto your boyfriends!"), causing him to explode. The audience loves the performance, but Daffy (now a transparent ghost and ascending to heaven) [...] "can only do it once".|$|E
5000|$|The fourth, {{and most}} {{controversial}} segue is the Neue Deutsche Härte style [...] "Die Eier von Satan". It is introduced by a distorted bassline {{giving way to}} a heavy industrial guitar, starting at the :23 mark and lasting only ten seconds, playing a single note in Drop C tuning over a reversed drum beat in compound triple meter. Its [...] time signature (3 quarter notes + 1 dotted quarter note) is expressed in alternating measures of [...] and [...] or combined [...] The lyrical component of the song is spoken in German by Marko Fox, bass player for ZAUM and SexTapes. He is backed by a sound that resembles a hydraulic press, and crowd <b>cheering</b> <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> that increase in volume as the lyrics are read with increasing ferocity. These combined effects make the song sound like a militant German rant or Nazi rally. While the shocking, aggressive tone and [...] "von Satan" [...] in the title may suggest {{having to do with}} the Church of Satan the speaker is merely reciting an innocuous cookie recipe. The band tried working titles like [...] "The Final Recipe" [...] (playing on Final Solution) and [...] "Holocaust in [...] ", an allusion to the 1972 Genesis epic [...] "Supper's Ready" [...] and its final sections [...] "Apocalypse in [...] " [...] and [...] "As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)". The song was originally translated by Gudrun Fox. According to Blair McKenzie Blake, the maintainer of the official Tool website, [...] "Die Eier von Satan" [...] originally were cookies that [...] "Marko Fox's grandmother used to bake for him as a child, without using eggs as an ingredient. The substitution for eggs is a magical incantation from the worm-eaten pages of some moldering grimoire." [...] This magical incantation ("sim salabim bamba sala do saladim") is taken from the German children's song [...] "Auf einem Baum ein Kuckuck" [...] and popularized by Harry August Jansen. According to the lyrics, the special ingredient besides this [...] "incantation" [...] is actually [...] "a knife-tip of Turkish hashish". The title is a play on deviled eggs, translating to [...] "The Eggs of Satan" [...] in English or [...] "The Balls of Satan", due to a German double entendre of [...] "Eier", which can either mean [...] "eggs" [...] or serve as slang for testicles. While there may not be eggs, [...] "balls" [...] do appear in the form of [...] "ground nuts" [...] (150 grams) while the dough itself is rolled into tiny balls before baking. So far the only time it has been performed live in its entirety was on December 19, 1996 at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. [...] The track has been compared to the work of industrial and experimental artists such as Einstürzende Neubauten, Rammstein and Tom Waits.|$|E
5000|$|The show's setlist {{consists}} of twenty-six songs, several band interludes and over twenty dance numbers, along with nine costume changes and four different sets, {{in addition to}} frequent pyrotechnics and theatrics. At {{the beginning of the}} show, burgundy curtains accented by golden tassels are drawn apart, exposing an enormous book. It is covered by an equally large quilt embossed with [...] "The Velvet Rope." [...] A master of ceremonies opens the book, revealed to be an LED screen.

25|$|Anticipating {{possible}} {{protests and}} demonstrations along the route, police mounted {{one of the}} largest security operations since the 2012 Summer Olympics.
