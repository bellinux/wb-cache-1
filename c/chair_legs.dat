This includes dragging <b>chair</b> <b>legs</b> in soft soil thereby unintentionally making furrows, or pouring water on arable land that is not saturated.

500|$|When Nevelson was {{developing}} her style, {{many of her}} artistic colleagues– Alexander Calder, David Smith, Theodore Roszak– were welding metal to create their large-scale sculptures. Nevelson decided {{to go in the}} opposite direction, exploring the streets for inspiration and finding it in wood. Nevelson's most notable sculptures are her walls; wooden, wall-like collage driven reliefs consisting of multiple boxes and compartments that hold abstract shapes and found objects from <b>chair</b> <b>legs</b> to balusters. Nevelson described these immersive sculptures as [...] "environments". The wooden pieces were also cast-off scraps, pieces found in the streets of New York. While Marcel Duchamp caused uproar with his Fountain, which was not accepted as [...] "art" [...] {{at the time of its}} release due to Duchamp's attempt to mask the urinals true form, Nevelson took found objects and by spray painting them she disguised them of their actual use or meaning. Nevelson called herself [...] "the original recycler" [...] owing to her extensive use of discarded objects, and credited Pablo Picasso for [...] "giving us the cube" [...] that served as the groundwork for her cubist-style sculpture. She found strong influence in Picasso and Hofmann's cubist ideals, describing the Cubist movement as [...] "one of the greatest awarenesses that the human mind has ever come to." [...] She also found influence in Native American and Mayan art, dreams, the cosmos and archetypes. A less known but very strong influence was that of Joaquín Torres García, a Uruguayan artist who [...] "in the United States was probably underrated precisely because he was so influential; Adolph Gottlieb's and Louise Nevelson's debt to his work has never been fully acknowledged".|$|E

Each arm was tied separately in such wise that she was unable to bring her hands together, and could not raise her wrists an inch from the chair. Next, with the aid of Mrs. Cameron, I looped a long piece of tape about Mrs. Smiley's ankles, knotted it to the rungs of the chair at the back, and nailed the loose ends to the floor. I then drew chalk marks on the floor about the <b>chair</b> <b>legs,</b> in order that any movement of the chair, no matter how slight, might show. Finally, I pushed the table about two feet away from the psychic's utmost reach.|$|E

60|$|The long {{windows were}} wide open, {{and the soft}} night air flowed in with the faint scent of flowers, and a murmur of voices from the {{specially}} invited audience Miss Earle had bestowed in the tennis green, which was sunk a few feet on one side {{below the level of}} the sweep of lawn. Tennis was not a game she was fond of, and she had pacified the gardener by placing the <b>chair</b> <b>legs</b> on boards. Tony could see the shadowy mass of humanity showing black against a dazzling glare, for the big oxyhydrogen lights he had provided were then blazing in front of the proscenium, which had been extemporized on the verge of the higher level. The path that led to it wound along the edge of a tall shrubbery where colored lights blinked here and there amidst the dusky leaves.|$|E
60|$|As she did so, a most {{extraordinary}} thing happened. The bed-clothes gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly {{into a sort}} of peak, and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail. It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside. Immediately after, the stranger's hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling flight in the air through {{the better part of a}} circle, and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall's face. Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger's coat and trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger's, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall, seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her. She screamed and turned, and then the <b>chair</b> <b>legs</b> came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door slammed violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything was still.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a large}} place, lighted only by {{a single}} candle set upon the floor. The mountebank {{lay on his back}} upon a pallet; a large man, with a Quixotic nose {{inflamed}} with drinking. Madame Tentaillon stooped over him, applying a hot water and mustard embrocation to his feet; and on a chair close by sat a little fellow of eleven or twelve, with his feet dangling. These three were the only occupants, except the shadows. But the shadows were a company in themselves; the extent of the room exaggerated them to a gigantic size, and from the low position of the candle the light struck upwards and produced deformed foreshortenings. The mountebank's profile was enlarged upon the wall in caricature, and it was strange to see his nose shorten and lengthen as the flame was blown about by draughts. As for Madame Tentaillon, her shadow {{was no more than a}} gross hump of shoulders, with now and again a hemisphere of head. The <b>chair</b> <b>legs</b> were spindled out as long as stilts, and the boy set perched atop of them, like a cloud, in the corner of the roof.|$|E

5000|$|Regardless {{of whether}} or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a {{surprisingly}} capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on Fred Christ). Like Channon, he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to make their own arms—to prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand - for example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken <b>chair</b> <b>leg,</b> which he dubbed [...] "The <b>Chair</b> <b>Leg</b> of Truth".|$|R
