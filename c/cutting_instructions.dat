50|$|For cutting {{irregular}} openings or non-uniform ends on dimensional (non-plate) elements, {{a cutting}} torch is typically used. Oxy-fuel torches {{are the most}} common technology and range from simple hand-held torches to automated CNC coping machines that move the torch head around the structural element in accordance with <b>cutting</b> <b>instructions</b> programmed into the machine.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} different mathematical approaches to buck-to-order log merchandizing. A new bucking-to-order planning model using mixed integer programming was developed to determine the optimal production from a stand given different market constraints and forest inventory data. Three different approaches: market prices, target cutting patterns and adjusted price list were tested for generating <b>cutting</b> <b>instructions</b> to fulfill the plan created by the new planning model. The three approaches were evaluated in four test stands. The market prices approach simply applied the market prices to each stand. The target cutting patterns approach applied the sample cutting patterns generated from the planning model to the stand. The adjusted price list used a dynamic programming algorithm embedded in a search heuristic to adjust both the prices and small end diameters of log products to achieve the production goals of the planning models. The results showed that developing a buck-to-order plan is important in obtaining good order fulfillment. The target cutting patterns and adjusted price list approaches certainly out performed the market prices approach. This paper shows that these two approaches are capable of achieving excellent order fulfillment. Further development and testing is needed to determine which method is the best at generating <b>cutting</b> <b>instructions</b> for buck-to-order merchandizing...|$|E
40|$|This poster {{introduces}} {{a method of}} designing and building atomically-accurate protein sculptures. The sculptures are {{in the style of}} artist Julian Voss-Andreae, who developed a technique of creating miter-cut backbone traces from protein databank (PDB) files. Featuring a user-friendly, web-based interface, our program downloads a structure from the PDB and creates an interactive model of the protein rendered as a miter-cut backbone structure. After the user adjusts properties to achieve the desired look, the program generates a list of <b>cutting</b> <b>instructions</b> necessary to create an atomically-accurate sculpture from a symmetrical piece of wood. For the undergraduate student involved in this project, the balance between the raw coding and creative design has helped enforce the idea that art and science are, contrary to popular belief, not polarizing fields. In this way, the experience in working on this project parallels {{one of the goals of}} the project overall: to explore the relationships between art and science. The protein sculptures this code allows you to build are fundamentally built from mutual inspiration from art and science. Through deploying this website, we hope to instill a sense of intrigue in these fields in artists and scientists alike...|$|E
