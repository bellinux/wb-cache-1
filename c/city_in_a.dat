5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of areas of the <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|Brandon overcame his {{hamstring}} {{problems to}} return {{before the start}} of the following season, at the start of which he maintained his goalscoring form, scoring twice within the space of three days, as Chesterfield drew 3–3 with Wycombe Wanderers, then 1–1 with Plymouth Argyle. He only managed another four goals all season, but they included two against Lincoln <b>City</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Football League Trophy defeat and one goal to help Chesterfield's fight to avoid relegation in a 3–1 victory over local rivals Sheffield Wednesday. He finished the season with six goals, which took his tally for Chesterfield to 16goals from 88games. Chesterfield again finished just one place above the relegation zone, and Brandon left in July 2004 to sign for Huddersfield Town under manager Peter Jackson on a free transfer.|$|E

The scheme was greatly divisive amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.|$|E

On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, {{took part in the}} Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to seize control of the <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coup d'état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly crushed by the local police and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route61 (NY61) is a {{state highway}} located almost entirely {{in the city of}} Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York, in the United States. The road runs across the <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> northwest–southeast direction, {{terminating}} at NY384 at its southern extent and NY104 at its northern tip. Conceptually, the road, known as Hyde Park Boulevard, forms the eastern border of downtown Niagara Falls. It is the second-shortest two-digit route in New York after NY71 in Columbia County. The NY61 designation was in 1958 after being approved by the Niagara Falls City Council.|$|E
5|$|Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was keen to sign Forster who he {{had seen}} play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers. Forster then signed for Norwich <b>City</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> one-month loan deal. It was then {{extended}} {{to the end of}} January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. He made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick going straight to Jermaine Beckford who scored.|$|E
5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Third Circuit, a three-judge panel of Judge Robert Cowen, Judge Morton Ira Greenberg and Judge Thomas I.

He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E

Arsenal eventually reached the final to play Galatasaray in Copenhagen – the match was overshadowed by altercations between both sets of supporters. Arsenal lost 4–1 on penalties after a goalless draw.|$|E
