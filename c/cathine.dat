25|$|Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and {{is closely}} related to the {{naturally}} occurring compounds, cathinone and <b>cathine.</b> It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the β-ketone substituent and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of cathinone {{is very similar}} to that of other molecules. By reducing the ketone, it becomes <b>cathine</b> if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted. <b>Cathine</b> is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating and younger ones. Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group. [...] Cathinone is structurally related to methcathinone, {{in much the same way}} as amphetamine is related to methamphetamine. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a ketone oxygen atom (C=O) on the β (beta) position of the side chain. The corresponding alcohol, <b>cathine,</b> is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to <b>cathine</b> is to blame for the depotentiation of khat leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to <b>cathine</b> than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.|$|E

Namen diplomskega dela je predstaviti nove sintetične substance, s ciljem izpostaviti vlogo medicinske sestre pri zdravstveni obravnavi uživalcev teh drog. Vsak dan na trg drog prihajajo nove substance. Med najpogostejše štejemo sintetične kanabinoide, katinone in halucinogene. Najpogostejše sintetične substance, ki se pojavljajo pri nas, so sintetični katinoni, takoj za njimi pa druge nove sintetične substance. Problem teh substanc je predvsem to, da so zaradi konstantnega spreminjanja kemijske sestave legalne in zato predstavljajo velik javnozdravstveni problem. Ogroženi so predvsem mladi, ki v fazi eksperimentiranja preizkušajo te droge, ki se na trgu prodajajo pod privlačnimi imeni in s privlačnimi embalažami in ne poznajo stranskih učinkov. Redna raba teh substanc vodi mlade do odvisnosti. Vloga medicinske sestre pri obravnavi pacientov odvisnih od psihoaktivnih substanc je predvsem motiviranje pacienta in vzpostavljanje odnosa, ki temelji na zaupanju. Poznati mora znake in simptome uživanja teh substanc in znati pravilno odreagirati. Pri delu z odvisnim mora biti dobro teoretično in praktično usposobljena, imeti mora posebna znanja in veščine, saj je delo z odvisniki večkrat lahko nepredvidljivo predvsem zaradi sprememb v njihovem mišljenju in vedenju. One of {{the major}} issues we face today is the {{increasing}} use of new artificial drugs, synthetic psychoactive substances. The purpose of my thesis and diploma work is to present new synthetic substances and their effect, with the aim of highlighting the role of the nurse in the medical treatment of these drug users. New substances are introduced to the drug market every day. The most common substances are synthetic cannabinoids, cathinone’s and hallucinogens. The most common and most used synthetic substances that occur in our country are synthetic <b>cathines,</b> followed by other new synthetic substances. The problem of these substances is that they are legal, due to constant changes in the chemical composition, therefore represent a major public health problem. The most affected demographic are young people. They are experimenting with these drugs, which are sold on the market under attractive names and attractive packaging and they do not know the side effects. Regular use of these substances leads the addiction. The role of the nurse is treating patients who are dependent on psychoactive substances. The main purpose of the nurse is to gain a patients trust and maintain it. As a nurse you have {{to be aware of the}} signs and symptoms that present upon the consumption of these substances, and be able to properly react to them. When working with addicts, nurses must be theoretically and practically trained, and must have specific knowledge and skills. Work with addicts can often be unpredictable, mainly due to dramatic changes in their thinking and behaviour...|$|R
50|$|Ephedra {{was used}} 5000 {{years ago in}} China as a {{medicinal}} plant; its active ingredients are alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) and norpseudoephedrine (<b>cathine).</b> Natives of Yemen and Ethiopia have {{a long tradition of}} chewing khat leaves to achieve a stimulating effect. The active substances of khat are cathinone and, to a lesser extent, <b>cathine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The World Anti-Doping Agency's list of {{prohibited}} substances (used for the Olympic Games among other athletic events) bars <b>cathine</b> in concentrations of over 5 micrograms per milliliter in urine. <b>Cathine</b> is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

50|$|L-Norpseudoephedrine, or (−)-norpseudoephedrine, is a {{psychostimulant}} drug of the amphetamine family. It {{is one of}} {{the four}} optical isomers of phenylpropanolamine, the other three being <b>cathine</b> ((+)-norpseudoephedrine), (−)-norephedrine, and (+)-norephedrine; as well as one of the two enantiomers of norpseudoephedrine (the other, of course, being <b>cathine).</b> Similarly to <b>cathine,</b> L-norpseudoephedrine acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 30 nM) {{and to a lesser extent}} of dopamine (EC50 = 294 nM). Due to the 10-fold difference in its potency for inducing the release of the two neurotransmitters however, L-norpseudoephedrine could be called a modestly selective or preferential norepinephrine releasing agent, similarly to related compounds like ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stimulant}} {{effect of}} the plant was originally attributed to [...] "katin", <b>cathine,</b> a phenethylamine-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than <b>cathine.</b> In 1975, the related alkaloid cathinone was isolated, and its absolute configuration was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce <b>cathine</b> and norephedrine. These chemicals belong to the PPA (phenylpropanolamine) family, {{a subset of the}} phenethylamines related to amphetamines and the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In fact, cathinone and <b>cathine</b> have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine. Khat is sometimes confused with methcathinone (also known as cat), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Discovery=== Khat {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula {{region of the}} world for thousands of years. It is most commonly chewed for the euphoric effect it produces. The active ingredient was first proposed in 1930, when <b>cathine</b> was identified as a predominant alkaloid in the plant. <b>Cathine</b> was thought to be the main active ingredient in khat until the 1960s, when {{it was found that the}} amount of <b>cathine</b> in the khat leaves is insufficient to produce the effects observed. In 1975, the United Nations Narcotic Laboratory analyzed khat leaves from Yemen, Kenya and Madagascar and found the presence of a different alkaloid, cathinone. Cathinone is a similar molecule to <b>cathine,</b> but is much more abundant in younger plants. This finding caused scientists to speculate about whether cathinone was the true active ingredient in khat. [...] A study was conducted in 1994 to test the effects of cathinone. Six volunteers who had never chewed khat were given an active khat sample and a cathinone-free placebo sample. The researchers analyzed the participants’ moods, activity levels and blood pressure before and after consuming the khat or placebo. This analysis showed that cathinone produced amphetamine-like symptoms, leading the researchers to confirm that cathinone, not <b>cathine,</b> is the active ingredient in khat leaves.|$|E

50|$|Ali {{accepted}} a voluntary indefinite suspension on November 22, 2007. However, he maintained his innocence and {{appealed to the}} International Boxing Association ("AIBA") to overturn the test results, Ali hired an attorney to challenge the findings and allegations. Ali argues he had taken <b>Cathine</b> inadvertently after contracting a cold in China, but widespread use of stimulant drug Khat is known among the Yemeni American community. His doctor later admitted medicines he had given Ali, when mixed together could have created the positive test for <b>Cathine.</b> The Olympic Games Committee bars <b>cathine</b> in concentrations of over five micrograms per milliliter in urine. In February 2008, Ali agreed to drop his challenges {{in exchange for a}} three-month ban retroactive to the date on which he had originally accepted his voluntary suspension.
