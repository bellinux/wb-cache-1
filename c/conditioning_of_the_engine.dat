40|$|Propulsion {{system tests}} were {{conducted}} on a full scale Centaur vehicle to investigate system capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed D-lT configuration for a three-burn mission. This particular mission profile requires that <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> be capable <b>of</b> restarting and firing for a final maneuver after a 5 - 1 / 2 -hour coast to synchronous orbit. <b>The</b> thermal <b>conditioning</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and propellant feed system components for engine start under these conditions were investigated. Performance data were also obtained on the D-lT type computer controlled propellant tank pressurization system. The test results demonstrated that <b>the</b> RL- 10 <b>engines</b> on <b>the</b> Centaur vehicle could be started and run reliably after being thermally conditioned to predicted engine start conditions for a one, two and three burn mission. Investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal margins also indicated that engine starts could be accomplished at the maximum predicted component temperature conditions with prestart durations less than planned for flight...|$|R
