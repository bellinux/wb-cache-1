5|$|The E <b>class</b> <b>were</b> ordered {{as part of}} the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class {{following}} in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F <b>class</b> <b>were</b> repeats of the E's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The G <b>class</b> <b>were</b> ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H <b>class</b> <b>were</b> repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of story {{characters}} who possess derivative classes from one of these basic types with slightly different stat growth (Garlot's <b>class</b> <b>is</b> Rabid Knight, Siskier's <b>class</b> <b>is</b> Assault, etc.), Baretreenu's <b>class</b> <b>is</b> based on Yggdra Union character Mistel, and Nessiah and Eater's <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> entirely unique.|$|R
50|$|In Simula, <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> {{defined in}} a block in which attributes, methods and <b>class</b> {{initialization}} <b>are</b> all defined together; thus all the methods {{that can be}} invoked on a <b>class</b> <b>are</b> defined together, and {{the definition of the}} <b>class</b> <b>is</b> complete.|$|R
5|$|Between 1907 and 1910, {{the ships}} of the <b>class</b> <b>were</b> heavily rebuilt, with the {{exception}} of Kaiser Karl der Grosse. During the modernization, the ships had their superstructures cut down. Four 15cm guns and one torpedo tube were also removed. The ships' 8.8cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15cm guns had been located. Also, the smoke stacks were lengthened.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the <b>class</b> <b>were</b> modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The Merchant Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} of land capability classification survey is {{held on the}} area of water capturing (DTA) of Danau Toba. Land capability classification is fulfilled by using scoring methods based on the land unit in DTA of Danau Toba. The scorring of limitation factor of each land unit is held to obtain land capability <b>class.</b> Here <b>are</b> the limitation factors of each land unit: the depth of effectivity land, texture, drainage, permeability, slope, erotion, flood and surface stone. The research outcome shows that there are totally 36 land units which are divided into 8 land capability classes. Land width of the first <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 26. 484. 59 ha, the second <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 73. 422. 64 ha, the third <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 32. 912. 79 ha, the fourth <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 28. 442. 06 ha, the fifth <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 21. 751. 94 ha, the sixth <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 2. 749. 55 ha, the seventh <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 618. 26 ha and the eight <b>class</b> <b>is</b> 30. 155. 78 ha...|$|R
30|$|We {{explored}} {{whether any}} particular drug <b>class</b> <b>was</b> associated with decreased binding. Among the total MDD group, {{the number of}} drug <b>classes</b> prescribed <b>was</b> not related to TSPO binding (p[*]=[*]. 40). No individual drug <b>class</b> <b>was</b> associated with TSPO binding (all p[*]>[*]. 10). However, {{because the number of}} participants prescribed any given drug <b>class</b> <b>was</b> small (see Additional file  1), the power to detect an effect of a given <b>class</b> <b>was</b> low.|$|R
5|$|In 1940 {{some of the}} <b>class</b> <b>were</b> reallocated to Crewe North (5A) and Glasgow Polmadie (27A, 66A from 1950). As {{the numbers}} grew, Crewe North was {{generally}} the beneficiary, but in 1946 Carlisle Upperby (12B, 12A from 1958), received an initial allocation of six locomotives. At various times locomotives were also seconded to Liverpool Edge Hill (8A). A typical allocation of the 1950s was Camden 15, Crewe North 10, Polmadie 9 and Upperby 4.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was further}} memorialised in 1937 when the newly {{launched}} destroyer Z10 was christened Hans Lody. Other {{ships in the}} same <b>class</b> <b>were</b> also given the names of German officers {{who had died in}} action. The ship served throughout the Second World War in the Baltic and North Sea theatres, survived the war and was captured by the British in 1945. After a few years in Royal Navy service she was scrapped in Sunderland in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the most}} {{successful}} features of the <b>class</b> <b>were</b> used by Drummond on his other designs. Thus the boiler, cylinders and motion were identical and interchangeable with those used on his 700 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives of 1897 and the same boiler was used on his C8 4-4-0 passenger class.|$|E
50|$|In some languages, <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> only a compile-time feature (new <b>classes</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{declared}} at runtime), {{while in}} other languages <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> first-class citizens, and are generally themselves objects (typically of type Class or similar). In these languages, a class that creates <b>classes</b> <b>is</b> called a metaclass.|$|R

In each case intrinsic {{properties of}} these classes and relationship between these <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> given. Then three ways of relativizing complexity <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> examined. Finally, the space complexity of RAMs is defined {{and its relation to}} usual <b>classes</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
5|$|The Chacal-class destroyer, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Jaguar <b>class,</b> <b>were</b> a group of six large destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) built for the French Navy during the 1920s. Their primary role was scouting for the battleline. All were named for predators: Chacal means jackal, and the other five were named for big cats.|$|E
5|$|The Colossus <b>class</b> <b>were</b> deemed {{obsolete}} {{by the end}} of the war in 1918 {{and were}} reduced to reserve the following year. Hercules was sold for scrap in 1921, although Colossus was briefly used as a training ship. She was hulked in 1923 and sold for scrap five years later.|$|E
5|$|The Evstafi <b>class</b> <b>were</b> {{a pair of}} pre-dreadnought battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy {{built before}} World War I for the Black Sea Fleet.

50|$|A <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{stationary}} {{if it has}} a nonempty intersection {{with every}} closed unbounded class. All superclasses of closed unbounded <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> stationary, and stationary <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> unbounded, but there <b>are</b> stationary <b>classes</b> that <b>are</b> not closed and stationary classes that have no closed unbounded subclass (such as the class of all limit ordinals with countable cofinality). Since the intersection of two closed unbounded <b>classes</b> <b>is</b> closed and unbounded, the intersection of a stationary class and a closed unbounded <b>class</b> <b>is</b> stationary. But the intersection of two stationary <b>classes</b> may <b>be</b> empty, e.g. the class of ordinals with cofinality ω with the class of ordinals with uncountable cofinality.|$|R
