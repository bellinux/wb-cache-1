Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cooperation}} of agents in <b>competitive</b> <b>environments</b> {{is more complicated}} than in collaborative ones. Both the replanning and reconfiguration play the crucial role in the cooperation and introduce a means for an implementation of a system flexibility. The concepts of commitments, decommitments with the penalties and subcontractions may facilitate effective reconfiguration and replanning. Agents in <b>competitive</b> <b>environments</b> are fully autonomous and selfinterested. Therefore the setting of penalties and the profit computation cannot be provided centrally. Both the costs and gain differ from agent to agent with respect to contracts already agreed and resources load. This paper proposes an acquaintance model for contracting in <b>competitive</b> <b>environments</b> and introduces possibilities of a reconfiguration in <b>competitive</b> <b>environments</b> as a means of a decommitment optimization with respect to resources load and profit maximization. The presented algorithm for contract price setting does not use any centralized knowledge and provides results corresponding to a realistic environment. Simple customerprovider scenario proves this algorithm in competitive contracting.

The results show that: (1) CRM resources improve firm performance mainly through creating strategic benefits (e. g. increased customer retention, improved product and service), although there are significant operational benefits (e. g. efficiency gains and cost reduction in customeroriented business processes); (2) in different <b>competitive</b> <b>environments,</b> the same resources play different roles in creating strategic benefits: technological resources have a weaker impact on strategic benefits in more <b>competitive</b> <b>environments,</b> while organizational alignment has a stronger impact in such environments; (3) operational benefits tend to be “competed away”, while strategic benefits sustain to generate performance advantage in spite of competition. These findings provide important implications for understanding how CRM value is shaped by various resources in <b>competitive</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

25|$|Many {{credit card}} {{customers}} receive rewards, such as frequent flyer points, gift certificates, or cash back {{as an incentive}} to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, {{which may or may}} not include balance transfers, cash advances, or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers. With a fractured and <b>competitive</b> <b>environment,</b> rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable portfolio. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the breakage in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.|$|E
25|$|Fisheries {{research}} {{was interrupted by}} the U.S. participation in World War II from 1941 to 1945, when manpower was short and many fishing vessels were commandeered {{for the support of}} the war effort. Sette nonetheless remained influential in U.S. West Coast fisheries management, serving as a paid consultant for the San Francisco Sardine Association and the California Sardine Products Institute from 1942 to 1947 and as Area Coordinator of Fisheries for California from 1943 to 1945. He commanded such respect in his paid consultancy that the sardine organizations followed his advice without question even when he refused to endorse their proposals for increased catches, and in his area coordinator role he succeeded in strictly controlling all fishing vessels and fish processing plants operating in California and off its coast, assigning fishing boats to plants and then shifting them around to ensure that all plants would remain in operation and no waste would occur – all despite a fiercely <b>competitive</b> <b>environment</b> in the California fishing industry. Throughout the period, he held that proper management of fisheries required an understanding of the causes of fluctuation in fish populations and in 1943 published a paper that emphasized the need to understand the causes of mortality of fish early in their life cycle to truly understand fishery fluctuations.|$|E
