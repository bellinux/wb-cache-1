5|$|In Spain {{there are}} several traditions about beings with vampiric tendencies. In Asturias {{highlights}} the Guaxa, which is described as an old vampire who sticks his single tooth and sucks the blood of its victims. <b>Cantabria</b> equivalent exists in the name Guajona. Catalonia is {{the legend of the}} Dip, an evil vampire dog.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of flags {{that could be}} confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions: <b>Cantabria,</b> Spain; Kranj, Slovenia; Thuringia, Germany; Upper Austria and Tyrol, Austria; as well the city of Honda, Colombia. Furthermore, the Dutch city of Maastricht used a similar design between 1938–1994 but reinstitated its old flag to avoid confusion. There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal bicolors of red and white, reversing the Polish flag. The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades of the colors (see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco).|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), <b>Cantabria</b> (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, <b>Cantabria</b> and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and <b>Cantabria</b> (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

25|$|Favila was {{succeeded by}} Alphonse I, who {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Asturias thanks to his marriage to Pelayo's daughter, Ermesinda. The Albeldensian Chronicle narrated how Alphonse arrived in the kingdom some time after the battle of Covadonga to marry Ermesinda. Favila's death made his access to the throne possible {{as well as the}} rise to power {{of one of the most}} powerful families in the Kingdom of Asturias: the House of <b>Cantabria.</b> Initially, only Alphonse moved to the court in Cangas de Onís, but after the progressive depopulation of the plateau and the Middle Valley of the Ebro, where the main strongholds of the Duchy of <b>Cantabria</b> such as Amaya, Tricio and City of <b>Cantabria</b> were located, the descendants of Duke Peter withdrew from Rioja towards the Cantabrian area and in time controlled the destiny of the Kingdom of Asturias.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} decades, the Asturian {{dominion}} over the {{different areas of}} the kingdom was still lax and so it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelayo's daughter, was married to Alfonso, Dux Peter of <b>Cantabria's</b> son. Alphonse's son Fruela married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the first}} decades, Asturian control over {{part of the}} kingdom was weak, {{and for this reason}} it had to be {{continually}} strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula.

Alphonse's children, Froila and Adosinda, married Munia, a Basque from Alava, and Silo, a local chief from the area of Pravia, respectively."

50|$|Pelagius' kingdom {{initially}} {{was little more}} than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius' daughter, was married to Alfonso, Dux Peter of <b>Cantabria's</b> son. Alfonso's son Fruela married Munia, a Basque from Álava, after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be Alfonso II, while Alfonso I's daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.|$|R
50|$|The Astures were {{vigorous}} hunter-gatherer highlanders who raided Roman outposts in the lowlands; {{a reputation}} enhanced by ancient authors, such as Florus ("Duae validissmae gentes, <b>Cantabriae</b> et Astures, immunes imperii agitabant") and Paulus Orosius ("duas fortissimas Hispaniae gentes"), but archeological evidence confirms {{that they also}} engaged in stock-raising in mountain pastures, complemented by subsistence farming on the slopes and in the lower valleys. They mostly reared sheep, goats, a few oxen and a local breed of mountain horse famed in Antiquity, the Asturcon, which still exists today. According to Pliny the Elder, these were small-stature saddle horses, slightly larger than ponies, of graceful walk and very fast, being trained for both hunting and mountain warfare.|$|R
50|$|At around 11.30 am on 2 November, Argüelles was {{concerned}} that his freighter was being shadowed by a smaller ship. He {{had good reason to}} have concerns as the Spanish Nationalist navy had been given the use of German North sea harbours by Hitler, to act as bases for them to raid Spanish shipping in the North Sea and the English Channel areas. With this situation in mind, the captain ordered his vessel to change course a degree or two to see if the following ship was following them. To Argüelles' concern, the vessel followed <b>Cantabrias</b> new course. His officers studied the following vessel with binoculars, but the vessel appeared to be of no threat and looked like an ordinary passenger steamer of around 1500 tons.|$|R

25|$|Under Pelayo's leadership, {{the attacks}} on the Berbers increased. Munuza, feeling {{isolated}} in a region increasingly hostile, decided to abandon Gijón and headed for the Plateau (Meseta) through the Mesa Trail. However, he was intercepted and killed by Astures at Olalíes (in the current district of Grado). Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked León, the main city in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and secured the mountain passes, isolating the region from Moorish attack. Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers who remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew, but mostly deserted their garrisons at the wider rebellion against Arab control from Cordoba. He then married his daughter, Ermesinda, to Alfonso, the son of Peter of <b>Cantabria,</b> the leading noble at the still-independent Visigothic dukedom of <b>Cantabria.</b> His son Favila was married to Froiliuba.|$|E

40|$|Fossorial water voles, Arvicola scherman, feed on {{tree roots}} causing {{important}} damages in European apple orchards. Since {{the intensity of}} crop damage produced by rodents ultimately depends on their inherent capacity to increase their population, the main goal {{of this study was}} to determine the reproductive potential of the subspecies A. scherman <b>cantabriae</b> in apple orchards from Asturias (NW Spain), where voles breed over the whole year. Our results were compared with those reported for the subspecies A. scherman monticola from the Spanish Pyrenees (where reproduction ceases in winter). Sexual characteristics, body condition, relative age class and number of embryos were recorded from 422 females caught in apple orchards along two years. We found pregnant females all along the year, which were able to produce a high number of litters per year (7. 30) although litter size was relatively moderate (first year: 3. 87 embryos/female; second year: 3. 63 embryos/females). The potential number of pups per female and year (first year: 28. 25; second year: 26. 50) was substantially higher than that reported for Pyrenean voles, what is probably related with differences in the length of the breeding season and in life histories between subspecies. In our population, the number of implanted embryos correlated positively with the body condition of the mother. Our results reveal that management efforts should not be seasonal as they used to be so far and invite to explore the physiological consequences of management practices...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{calcareous}} nannofossils from the Maastrichtian-Early Eocene from Egypt {{has resulted in}} the recognition of four Maastrichtian and seven Early Tertiary biostratigraphic zones. These nannoplankton zones are based upon local ranges and compared with the zones proposed by Martini (1971), Sissingh (1977), Verbeek (1977) and Romein (1979). A new zone, the Fasciculithus ragaae Zone is described and the E 1 lipsolithus macellus Zone and the Fasciculithus tympaniformis Zone are emended. Study of the vertical ranges of the species provided many markers (including the zonal markers) with distinctive first and/or last occurrence levels. The uppermost Maastrichtian and Lower Danian are missing in the study sections. There is no change in the lithology at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary as observed in the Esh Mellaha area, but biostratigraphic evidence shows that there is a time gap and the boundary missing. This boundary is, however, marked by a conglomerate band at Gebel Urn El Ghanayem, a thin bed of black non-calcareous shale at Gebel Duwi and a change in the lithology from chalky limestone (upper part of Sudr Chalk Formation) of Maastrichtian age to shale (lower part of Esna Shale Formation) of Early Palaeocene age at Wadi Tarfa. No continuous Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sequence was analysed. The palaeoenvironment during the Maastrichtian-Early Eocene according to the nannofossil assemblages, was a warm open marine inner to outer shelf, although the absence of late Maastrichtian and early Danian age sediments limits observation and comment. One hundred and sixty five species have been identified. Descriptions, remarks and figures as well as schematic drawings of many species are presented. A new family RHOMBOASTERACEAE, a new genus Diadochiastozygus, five new species Fasciculithus ragaae, F. gelelii, Discoaster atefii, D. duwiensis and D. amrii are described. New combinations for Bomolithus megastypus, B. <b>cantabriae,</b> Diadochiastozygus imbriei, D. saepes, D. eosaepes, Tranolithus tarboulensis, Vekshinella dorfii and V. compacta are proposed. The evolution of some Cretaceous and Early Tertiary nannofloral groups is discussed and a link between the Bomolithus and Discoaster groups proposed...|$|R
