SEM figures showed that Zn doped Barium M-Hexaferrite (BaFe 12 -xZnxO 19) have a hexagonal structure, similar to BaM structure. Doping of Zn has changed the magnetic properties of Barium M-Hexaferrit (BaM), from hard magnetic become soft magnetic. Barium M-Hexaferrit (BaM) has a value of <b>Coercivity</b> Field (<b>Hc)</b> <b>and</b> Remanence Magnetization (Mr) is 0. 03734 T and 8. 334 emu/g. At variation x = 0. 3, the Remanence Magnetization (Mr) reaches the highest value. At this point, a value of <b>Coercivity</b> Field (<b>Hc)</b> <b>and</b> Remanence Magnetization (Mr) is 0. 0506 T and 14. 782 emu/gram respectively...|$|R
3000|$|In this article, we {{proposed}} a facile one-step synthesis of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes by co-precipitation of FeCl 2 with piperidine. A careful investigation of TEM micrographs shows that the shape and size of nanoparticles can be tuned by varying the molarity of piperidine. XRD patterns match the standard phase of the spinal structure of Fe 3 O 4 which confirms the formation of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that molar concentration of FeCl 2 solution {{plays a significant role}} in determining the shape and size of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Changes in the shape and sizes of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles which are influenced by the molar concentration of FeCl 2 can easily be explained with the help of surface free energy minimization principle. Further, to study the magnetic behavior of synthesized Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, magnetization vs. magnetic field (M-H) and magnetization vs. temperature (M-T) measurements were carried out by using Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). These results show systematic changes in various magnetic parameters like remanent magnetization (Mr), saturation magnetization (<b>Ms),</b> <b>coercivity</b> (<b>Hc),</b> <b>and</b> blocking temperature (T [...]...|$|R

XRD, IR and TEM techniques {{were used to}} obtain structural and morphological characterizations. XRD and IR spectra confirmed the formation of spinel structure. Stoichiometry of the samples was confirmed with EDS spectral analysis. Nanocrystalline nature {{of the sample was}} observed in HRTEM of the samples and formation of the nanoparticles was confirmed by measuring crystallite size using XRD pattern and TEM. Magnetic properties of the nanosample obtained with VSM give values ranging between 45. 25 – 50. 92 emu/gm; 0. 0009 - 0. 0055 Tesla, and 2. 77 – 9. 4 emu/gm for saturation magnetization, coercivity and retentivity, respectively. Curie temperature values ranging between 380 0 C – 540 0 C were obtained for the powdered samples. Magnetic measurements like saturation magnetization <b>Ms,</b> <b>coercivity</b> <b>Hc,</b> <b>and</b> retentivity Mr, carried out on the bulk samples obtained at 900 0 C show that the samples lose the magnetic properties and behaved as paramagnetic material...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{of barium}} ferrite (BaFe 12 O 19) have been synthesized using a microemulsion mediated process. The aqueous cores of water-in-oil microemulsions {{were used as}} constrained microreactors for the precipitation of precursor carbonate and hydroxide particles. These precursors were then calcined at 925 °C for 12 hours, during which time they were transformed to the hexagonal ferrite. The pH of reaction was varied between 5 and 12, and {{it was found that}} the fraction of non-magnetic hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) in the particles varied with the pH of reaction, thus affecting the magnetic properties of the particles. The same precursor particles were also prepared by bulk co-precipitation reaction for comparison. It was found that the microemulsion derived nanoparticles of barium ferrite had both higher intrinsic <b>coercivity</b> (<b>Hc)</b> <b>and</b> saturation magnetization (σs) than the particles derived from bulk co-precipitation. Particles were analyzed by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The best barium ferrite particles produced by the microemulsion synthesis method yielded an intrinsic coercivity of 4310 Oe and a saturation magnetization of 60. 48 emu/g...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} double perovskite ruthenate compound Sr 2 YRuO 6 are reported here. Magnetization measurements {{as a function of}} temperature in low magnetic fields show clear evidence for two components of magnetic order (TM 1 ∼ 32 K and TM 2 ∼ 27 K) aligned opposite to each other with respect to the magnetic field direction even though only Ru 5 + moments can order magnetically in this compound. The second component of the magnetic order at TM 2 ∼ 27 K results only in a magnetization reversal, and not in the negative magnetization when the magnetization is measured in the field cooled (FC) mode. Isothermal magnetization (M-H) measurements show hysteresis with maximum <b>coercivity</b> (<b>Hc)</b> <b>and</b> remnant magnetization (Mr) at T ∼ 27 K, corroborating the presence of the two oppositely aligned magnetic moments, each with a ferromagnetic component. The two components of magnetic ordering are further confirmed by the double peak structure in the heat capacity measurements. These anomalous properties have significance to some of the earlier results obtained for the Cu-substituted superconducting Sr 2 YRu 1 −xCuxO 6 compounds. 1...|$|R
