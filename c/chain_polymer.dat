50|$|The {{production}} of maltose {{is based on}} the hydrolysis of starch, compound by glucose units α(1→4) and α(1→6) linked, meaning that the carbon number 1 is linked by a glycosidic bond to the carbon number 4 or 6 of the other glucose. The 1→4 linked starch part is called amylose and it is a linear polymer while the 1→4 and 1→6 linked part is the amylopectin, a branched <b>chain</b> <b>polymer,</b> being 1→6 the branching point linkages.|$|E
50|$|Cellulose is a polymer made {{of repeating}} glucose {{molecules}} attached end to end. A cellulose molecule may be from several hundred to over 10,000 glucose units long. Cellulose {{is similar in}} form to complex carbohydrates like starch and glycogen. These polysaccharides are also made from multiple subunits of glucose. The difference between cellulose and other complex carbohydrate molecules is how the glucose molecules are linked together. In addition, cellulose is a straight <b>chain</b> <b>polymer,</b> and each cellulose molecule is long and rod-like. This differs from starch, which is a coiled molecule. A result of these differences in structure is that, compared to starch and other carbohydrates, cellulose cannot {{be broken down into}} its glucose subunits by any enzymes produced by animals.|$|E
5000|$|The additive, ICI's FM-9, a high molecular-weight long <b>chain</b> <b>polymer,</b> when {{blended with}} Jet-A fuel, forms antimisting {{kerosene}} (AMK). AMK had demonstrated {{the capability to}} inhibit ignition and flame propagation of the released fuel in simulated impact tests. AMK cannot be introduced directly into a gas turbine engine due to several possible problems such as clogging of filters. The AMK must be restored to almost Jet-A before being introduced into the engine for burning. This restoration is called [...] "degradation" [...] and was accomplished on the 720 using a device called a [...] "degrader". Each of the four Pratt & Whitney JT3C-7 engines had a [...] "degrader" [...] built and installed by General Electric (GE) to break down and return the AMK to near Jet-A quality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We have {{investigated}} conformational properties of a linear semiflexible homopolymer chain in the bulk and {{adsorption desorption behaviour}} {{in the presence of}} an attractive impenetrable curved surface using lattice models. Since, it is understood that the essential physics associated with the conformational behavior of such <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> can be derived from a model of a self avoiding walk (SAW) or directed self avoiding walk (DSAW) on a suitable lattice. Therefore, DSAW model on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice has been solved analytically to study the phase transitions occurring in the semiflexible <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b> We have found that the persistent length of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> is independent of its bending energy and its value is found to be unity for directed walk models for hexagonal lattice. Results obtained in presence of an attractive impenetrable curved surface show that adsorption of stiffer <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> take place at a smaller value of monomer surface attraction than the flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> in the case when adsorbed parts of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> do not contribute Boltzmann weight to partition function of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> due to bending of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b> However, when adsorbed parts of the semiflexible <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> contribute Boltzmann weight due to bending of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> critical value of monomer surface attraction required for adsorption of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> on curved impenetrable surface is found to be independent of bending energy of the semiflexible <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b> [Academia Arena, 2009; 1 (6) : 1 - 7].

50|$|Cyanoacrylate is {{the generic}} name for {{cyanoacrylate}} based fast-acting glues such as methyl-2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names like Superglue and Krazy Glue) and n-butyl-cyanoacrylate. Skin glues like Indermil and Histoacryl {{were the first}} medical grade tissue adhesives to be used, and these are composed of n-butyl cyanoacrylate. These worked well but had the disadvantage of having to be stored in the refrigerator, were exothermic so they stung the patient, and the bond was brittle. Nowadays, the longer <b>chain</b> <b>polymer,</b> 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, is the preferred medical grade glue. It is available under various trade names, such as LiquiBand, SurgiSeal, FloraSeal, and Dermabond. These have the advantages of being more flexible, making a stronger bond, and being easier to use. The longer side chain types, for example octyl and butyl forms, also reduce tissue reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} fluoroplastic is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), {{which is}} a simple linear <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> with the repeating structural unit:-CF2-. PTFE has a backbone of carbons single bonded in a long chain, with all side bonds to fluorines. It contains no hydrogens and {{can be thought of}} as the perfluoro analog of polyethylene (structural unit: -CH2-). PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. Its resistance to van der Waals forces makes PTFE the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. The compound, however, lacks an ability to transform upon melting, which is not a problem for various PTFE deratives, namely FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene, with some fluorines replaced with the-CF3 group) or PFA (perfluoroalkoxy, some fluorines replaced with -OCF3). They share most properties with PTFE, but there are still differences, namely maximum usage temperature (highest for the non-flexible PTFE).|$|E
5000|$|PBI {{has been}} used as the {{membranes}} for various separation purposes. Traditionally, PBI was used semi-permeable membranes for electrodialysis, reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration. Recently PBI is also used for gas separations. due to its close chain packing since PBI has rigidity structure and strong hydrogen bonding. PBI membranes are dense, with very low gas permeability. To be proton conductive, PBI usually is doped with acid. The higher level of the acid doping, the more conductive PBI is. But one problem raised is the mechanical strength of PBI decreases at the same time. The optimum doping level is thus a compromise between these two effects. Thus, multiple methods such as ionic cross-linking, covlant cross-linking and composite membranes [...] have been researched to optimize the doping level at which PBI has an improved conductivity without sacrificing mechanical strength. Kerres et al. recently have recently synthesized sulphonated partially fluorinated arylene main <b>chain</b> <b>polymer.</b> Their blend membranes with PBI demonstrate high level acid-doping levels with thermal and extended stability, high proton conductivities, less acid swelling, reasonable mechanical strength.|$|E

50|$|Persistence length {{measurement}} of single stranded DNA is viable by various tools. Most {{of them have}} been done by incorporation of wormlike chain model. For example, two ends of single stranded DNA were tagged by Donor and acceptor dye to measure average end to end distance which is represented as FRET efficiency. The FRET efficiency were converted to persistence length by comparing the FRET efficiency with calculated FRET efficiency based on wormlike chain model. The recent attempts to obtain persistence length is combination of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) with HYDRO program. HYDRO program is simply noted as the upgrade of stoke's Einstein equation. The stoke's Einstein equation calculate diffusion coefficient (which is inversely proportional to diffusion time) by assuming the molecules as pure sphere. However, the HYDRO program has no limitation regarding to the shape of molecule. For estimation of single stranded DNA persistence length, the diffusion time of number of wormlike <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> was generated and its diffusion time is calculated by the HYDRO program which is compared with the experiment diffusion time of FCS. The polymer property was adjusted to find the optimal persistence length.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the looping {{kinetics}} {{of a long}} {{polymer chain}} in solution has been investigated by using two state model, where one state represents open <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> molecule and the other represents closed <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> molecule.

The coupling between these two potentials {{are assumed to be}} a Dirac Delta function in our model. We evaluate two rate constants, the long term and the average rate constant. We have also incorporated the effect of all other chemical reactions involving at least one end of the open <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> molecule - on rate of end-to-end loop formation. The closed <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> molecule can be converted to a open chain molecule by breaking of any bond - the effect of this reaction on the rate of end-to-end loop formation is also considered in our model...|$|E

Our model is more general than the model proposed by Wilemski and Fixman, in the sense that our model considers the motion of both close and open <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> explicitely. It is quite unlikely that the motion of close <b>chain</b> <b>polymer</b> do not play any role in the loop formation dynamics, but unfortunately this fact was not considered in any of the earlier studies...|$|E
50|$|The trans double bonds formed during {{polymerization}} {{allow the}} <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> to stay rather straight, allowing sections of <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> to align to form microcrystalline {{regions in the}} material. The cis double bonds cause {{a bend in the}} <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> preventing <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> from aligning to form crystalline regions, which results in larger regions of amorphous polymer. It has been found that a substantial percentage of cis double bond configurations in the polymer will result in a material with flexible elastomer (rubber-like) qualities. In free radical polymerization, both cis and trans double bonds will form in percentages that depend on temperature. The catalysts influence the cis vs trans ratio.|$|R
