To {{speed up}} the virtual {{development}} of the automobile, Using VC++ 6. 0 programming environment and the function of ADAMS could execute the batch files; the simulation and analysis of automotive system are developed. A friendly convenient and the flexible man-machine conversation interface are developed by VC++ foreground. The parameters input by users and ADAMS operating <b>commands</b> <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in acar. cmd file. ADAMS will automatically calculate and simulate after executing the acar. cmd file.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} pattern for minimal object {{oriented}} communication middleware. The motivation comes from the strong requirements of high performance data acquisition systems, like for the CMS experiment at CERN. We explain why such an approach is appropriate, by comparing it {{to the performance of}} common solutions such as object request brokers. The main sources of overhead are highlighted and approaches for overcoming them are presented in our proposal. Finally a proof of concept implementation is shown. 1 Introduction As the use of object oriented programming becomes more common in the high energy physics community, the need for high performance inter object communication grows. Tools for distributed object oriented computing are available, but they are not able to meet the performance requirements of future experiments. Remote object invocation is especially suited for control applications, as <b>commands</b> <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in methods which are invoked by simple upcalls from re [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the IPv 6 networking in IEEE 802. 15. 4 sensor networks, using IEEE 1451 standardization, increases the interoperability of low-power smart sensor devices in IP networks. This paper explains the design and implementation of IPv 6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6 loWPAN) and it uses the IEEE 1451 standard over IEEE 802. 15. 4 sensor networks. We propose an application of API IEEE 1451 that uses web services to transmit IEEE 1451 commands between Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP) and Wireless Transducer Interface Module (WTIM) using the client-server architecture. In addition the design of 6 loWPAN Physical Transducer Electronic Datasheet (PHYTEDS) IEEE 1451. 5 is explained. All TEDS were analyzed in terms of memory size. Each IEEE 1451 <b>command</b> <b>is</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in an UDP socket to establish NCAP-to-WTIM communication in an environmental monitoring application.

5000|$|The {{two most}} widely used {{strategy}} design patterns in Pharmaceutical and other Batch Industrial Automation higher level systems (SCADA, Batch and MES [...] ) are ISA S88 & ISA S95. These patterns can be implemented such that the action behaviours (e.g., read/write method or Valve <b>command</b> on/off method) <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> as interfaces using languages such C#, or Java. Commercial Control System software development is biased towards inheritance and subtyping, and the other OOP tenets (Encapsulation, Polymorphism) are not exposed to the programmer to the same extent. This incomplete OOP implementation increases the amount of design effort required. Even Commercial Proprietary DCS systems such as Emerson DeltaV are biased towards subtyping and inheritance without {{an easy way to}} implement a behaviour through an interface or similar construct. (There is no way to implement multiple inheritance.) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristics}} of AVS video data, a RTP encapsulation method based on frame type is proposed. When the video data <b>is</b> <b>encapsulated</b> by the RTP protocol, different types of video data such as sequence header, sequence end, I frame, P frame and B frame <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> with different method. Under the limit of maximum transmission unit (MTU), sequence headers, sequence ends and I frames <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> individually to reduce the packet length and protect the important data. While multiple P frames and B frames <b>are</b> <b>encapsulated</b> into one RTP packet to reduce the quantity of the RTP packets and decrease the overload of link. Simulation results show that, compared to the frame-based encapsulation method, the proposed method can reduce the packet loss rate of the video data effectively and {{improve the quality of}} video service...|$|R
