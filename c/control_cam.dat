The <b>cam</b> <b>controlled</b> walker was first theorized in the Master's Thesis of Xiaonan Wan of Northern Illinois University. The principle of a <b>cam</b> <b>controlled</b> is to combine the advantages of both wheels and legs into one manipulator. The robot is constructed 'of a body with four motor driven walking pods. Each pod consisted of three cam-controlled members. The robot is capable of walking in a smooth, strait and level line, when it is activated. The robot is designed to be less than 69 centimeters and less than 2 kg in mass. The basic pod design involves a rotating slider and a cam shaped track, which causes a rotating member to have an end path that is a level strait line. This design is advantageous because it allows for the level motion of a wheel and the small footprint and rough terrain navigation ability of a leg. Analysis of motion shows that the robot does not move at constant speed. This creates a dynamic loading problem along with a dynamic control problem. The robot is built to be structurally sound and stable under the dynamic conditions. In order to conserve weight a light motors were used in conjunction with gearboxes. The robot showed it was physically capable of moving but it has problems power issues. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a <b>control</b> <b>cam</b> riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting <b>control</b> <b>cam)</b> has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

CaM mRNA levels increased rapidly and transiently following incubation of aleurone layers in H 2 O, CaCl 2, or GA 3. The increase in CaM mRNA was prevented by ABA. This increase in CaM mRNA was brought about by physical stimulation during removal of the starchy endosperm from the aleurone layer.

(Montiaceae), {{an annual}} {{succulent}} herb endemic to Australia, is an exemplary facultative {{crassulacean acid metabolism}} (CAM) plant as demonstrated by continuous whole-plant lifetime CO 2 exchange measurements under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Reduced soil water availability induced a shift from solely daytime CO 2 fixation to dark CO 2 fixation. The shift from C 3 photosynthesis to CAM was reversible either upon rewatering alone, or upon a combination of rewatering and addition of nutrients.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{elongation}} factor 2 kinase (eEF 2 K), an atypical calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates and inhibits eEF 2, slowing down translation elongation. eEF 2 K contains an N-terminal catalytic domain, a C-terminal ?-helical region and a linker containing several regulatory phosphorylation sites. eEF 2 K is expressed {{at high levels}} in certain cancers, where it may act to help cell survival, e. g., during nutrient starvation. However, it is a negative regulator of protein synthesis and thus cell growth, suggesting that cancer cells may possess mechanisms to inhibit eEF 2 K under good growth conditions, to allow protein synthesis to proceed. We show here that the mTORC 1 pathway and the oncogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway cooperate to restrict eEF 2 K activity. We identify multiple sites in eEF 2 K whose phosphorylation is regulated by mTORC 1 and/or ERK, including new ones in the linker region. We demonstrate that certain sites are phosphorylated directly by mTOR or ERK. Our data reveal that glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling also regulates eEF 2 phosphorylation. In addition, we show that phosphorylation sites remote from the N-terminal calmodulin-binding motif regulate the phosphorylation of N-terminal sites that <b>control</b> <b>CaM</b> binding. Mutations in the former sites, which occur in cancer cells, cause the activation of eEF 2 K. eEF 2 K is thus regulated by a network of oncogenic signaling pathways...|$|E

TOC 1 and LHY/CCA 1 are under reciprocal circadian control {{in a manner similar}} to their regulation in Arabidopsis. ELF 4, FKF 1, ZTL, GIGANTEA, and ELF 3 are under circadian control in C 3 and CAM leaves. ELF 4 transcripts peak in the evening and are unaffected by CAM induction. FKF 1 shows an abrupt transcript peak 3 h before subjective dusk. ELF 3 transcripts appear in the evening, consistent with their role in gating light input to the circadian clock. Intriguingly, ZTL transcripts do not oscillate in Arabidopsis, but do in M. crystallinum. The transcript abundance of the clock-associated genes in M. crystallinum is largely unaffected by development and salt stress, revealing compensation of the central circadian clock against development and abiotic stress in addition to the well-known temperature compensation. Importantly, the clock in M. crystallinum is very similar to that in Arabidopsis, indicating that such a clock could <b>control</b> <b>CAM</b> without requiring additional components of the central oscillator or a novel CAM oscillator...|$|E

Analysis of proximate and Van Soest’s fiber fraction were performed on the respective treatments. The pods were then subjected to an in vitro digestibility evaluation by incubation in rumen fluid-buffer medium, employing a randomized complete block design (n = 3 replicates). Further, an in vivo evaluation of the pods (35 % inclusion level in total mixed ration) was conducted by feeding to young Holstein steers (average body weight of 145 ± 3. 6 kg) with a 5 × 5 latin square design arrangement (n = 5 replicates). Each experimental period lasted for 30 d; the first 20 d was for feed adaptation, the next 3 d was for sampling of rumen liquid, and the last 7 d was for measurements of digestibility and N balance. Results revealed that lignin content was reduced significantly when cocoa pod was treated with urea, molasses, rumen content or P. chrysosporium (p CAm>CRu>CMo. Among all treatments, CAm and CPh treatments significantly improved the in vitro dry matter and organic matter digestibility (p< 0. 05) of cocoa pod. Average daily gain of steers receiving CAm or CPh treatment was significantly higher than that of control (p< 0. 01) with an increase of 105 % and 92 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies on}} the effects of the {{epichlorohydrin}} (ECH) epoxide demonstrated this compound's toxicity and mutagenicity and suggested a carcinogenic activity also in humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} ECH effects in vivo, the substance was tested on developing tissues utilizing the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. MATERIAL/METHODS: Gelatin sponges adsorbed with ECH were implanted onto nine-day CAMs. After five days the membranes were fixed, cut in serial sections, and stained with toluidine blue. Sections of the ECH-treated CAMs were also submitted to immunocytochemistry for the basal lamina glycoprotein laminin and the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx 43). <b>Control</b> <b>CAMs</b> were treated with saline solution and submitted to identical procedures. RESULTS: ECH-treated CAMs displayed proliferation of both the epithelial layers and the mesenchyme cells and vessels. The laminin immunolabeling was interrupted beneath the ectoderm thickenings, which penetrated the mesenchyme. The endoderm showed papilloma-like formations and its laminin-positive basal membrane protruded toward the mesenchyme, together with clusters of endodermal cells. The mesenchyme showed increased numbers of cells and microvessels. These reactions were restricted to regions corresponding to the implant. Cx 43 expression was strongly decreased in the ECH-treated CAMs compared with the controls, where the connexin punctate pattern regularly decorated the epithelial cell contours. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that ECH elicits tissue proliferation at the contact site and corroborates the suggestion of an ECH carcinogenic effect due to hallmarks of tumoral growth, such as angiogenesis, basal membrane alterations, and loss of intercellular communication via gap junctions...|$|R

CaM and its target proteins form an integrated signaling network believed to be tuned spatially and temporally to <b>control</b> <b>CaM's</b> ability to appropriately pass signaling events downstream. Here, we report the spatial diffusivity and availability of CaM labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) -CaM, at basal and elevated Ca 2 +, quantified by the novel fluorescent techniques of raster image scanning spectroscopy and number and brightness analysis. Our results show that in basal Ca 2 + conditions cytoplasmic eGFP-CaM diffuses at a rate of 10 μm 2 /s, twofold slower than the noninteracting tracer, eGFP, indicating that a significant fraction of CaM is diffusing bound to other partners. The diffusion rate of eGFP-CaM is reduced to 7 μm 2 /s when a large (646 kDa) target protein Ca 2 + /CaM-dependent protein kinase II is coexpressed in the cells. In addition, the presence of Ca 2 + /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can bind up to 12 CaM molecules per holoenzyme, increases the stoichiometry of binding to an average of 3 CaMs per diffusive molecule. Elevating intracellular Ca 2 + did not have a major impact on the diffusion of CaM complexes. These results present us with a model whereby CaM is spatially modulated by target proteins and support the hypothesis that CaM availability is a limiting factor in the network of CaM-signaling enzymes. © 2008 by the Biophysical Society...|$|R
40|$|Genotypic, developmental, and {{environmental}} factors converge to determine the degree of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) expression. To characterize the signaling events <b>controlling</b> <b>CAM</b> expression in young pineapple (Ananas comosus) plants, this photosynthetic pathway was modulated through manipulations in water availability. Rapid, intense, and completely reversible up-regulation in CAM expression was triggered by water deficit, {{as indicated by the}} rise in nocturnal malate accumulation and in the expression and activity of important CAM enzymes. During both up- and down-regulation of CAM, the degree of CAM expression was positively and negatively correlated with the endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins, respectively. When exogenously applied, ABA stimulated and cytokinins repressed the expression of CAM. However, inhibition of water deficit-induced ABA accumulation did not block the up-regulation of CAM, suggesting that a parallel, non-ABA-dependent signaling route was also operating. Moreover, strong evidence revealed that nitric oxide (NO) may fulfill an important role during CAM signaling. Up-regulation of CAM was clearly observed in NO-treated plants, and a conspicuous temporal and spatial correlation was also evident between NO production and CAM expression. Removal of NO from the tissues either by adding NO scavenger or by inhibiting NO production significantly impaired ABA-induced up-regulation of CAM, indicating that NO likely acts as a key downstream component in the ABA-dependent signaling pathway. Finally, tungstate or glutamine inhibition of the NO-generating enzyme nitrate reductase completely blocked NO production during ABA-induced up-regulation of CAM, characterizing this enzyme as responsible for NO synthesis during CAM signaling in pineapple plants...|$|R
