30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a method for evaluating test data obtained in kiln-drying lumber. Experimental data on radio-frequency drying of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) beams without pith were used to present a data evaluation method for the length of internal checks of kiln-dried lumber based on a hierarchical model. Occurrence of the internal check phenomenon was determined with the underlying data-generating process, and the length of internal checks was modeled in relation to heating temperature, initial moisture content, final moisture content, and basic density. The diagnosis of the posterior model parameters revealed that heating temperature, initial moisture content, and basic density have a positive influence on the occurrence of internal checks, while final moisture content has a negative influence. A comparison between the developed hierarchical model and conventional statistical analysis used in research on lumber drying showed that a much more detailed analysis of internal <b>check</b> <b>length</b> could be performed by the hierarchical model.|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive {{testing for}} drying defects in Eucalyptus grandis utility poles {{would be highly}} advantageous. These defects can {{negatively}} affect creosote preservative treatment and in-service performance. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess correlations between drying defects such as surface checking, honeycombing, collapse, their parameters and moisture content (MC) gradient in poles, to possibly find a simple and quick but reliable method to assess internal and external drying defects. Defects and moisture content gradients were measured in 39 kiln-dried E. grandis poles. After measuring surface <b>check</b> <b>length,</b> width and depth using a measuring tape, a ruler and a depth gauge, destructive sampling at the theoretical ground line (TGL) was done to measure the MC gradient between the shell and core of poles. Digital image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure honeycomb check width, length and area, as well as counting individual closed surface checks. Collapse was assessed using qualitative methods. Results showed that honeycombing and collapse were positively, and surface checking and MC gradient were negatively correlated. Surface check width, length and depth were also correlated. Honeycomb count, check width, length and area were strongly correlated. It was concluded that measuring any of these surface check and/ or honeycomb parameters may give meaningful deductions about the extent of surface checking and honeycombing respectively...|$|E
40|$|On our planet, {{there are}} {{probably}} more buildings such as residential, commercial industrial or farming constructed with wood and wood-based composites than any other structural materials. The widespread use of wood and wood-based composites {{in the construction of}} buildings has both an economic and aesthetic basis. The natural beauty of these products is difficult to match with other materials. The weathering durability of wood, wood products and wood - based composites is an important quality factor, essential for environmental friendly exterior uses in buildings. Weathering produces unfavorable quality changes such as discoloration, roughening and checking of surface or modification of physical and mechanical properties. Weathering of wood depends on many environmental factors and among them the ultraviolet component of sunlight is responsible for cell wall lignin depolymerization. This effect is amplified by reining water which erodes the surfaces exposed to weathering. The erosion process id very slow and was estimated to be of about 5 mm thickness decreasing of a board during 100 years of exposure in Northern Hemisphere. The erosion of the earlywood is always greater than that of latewood. The checks and delaminations at wood surface can be detected visually or automatically. Visual detection refers to the <b>check</b> <b>length,</b> width, depth or number. Modern methods use reflection of laser and fluorescent light to detect cracks at wood surface. The width of cracks has been determined with stylus profilometry. Automatic detection of checks at wood surface was performed using waveform analysis of the reflected digital image.

40|$|Abstract In {{specific}} cases, kiln drying {{prior to}} preservative treatment is the prescribed method of utility pole seasoning in South Africa. The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface checking, honeycomb and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length pole drying was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. Surface <b>check</b> <b>length</b> of each pole was measured after drying. Cross-sections cut at the theoretical ground line (TGL), 1. 5 m from the butt end, were {{used to measure the}} moisture content (MC) gradient between the shell and core of poles. Digital image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure the area of honeycomb and disc cross-section. Collapse was assessed qualitatively. With all three schedules, MC’s in the pole cores at the end of drying were still very high. Some poles were above 25 % in the outer 25 mm of the treatable zone. The 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days schedule generated the highest surface check total length. A reduction in the wet bulb depression o...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} extent to which variation in sawn-board quality traits of plantation-grown Eucalyptus nitens is under genetic control and amenable to genetic improvement. Five hundred and sixty trees from 129 families and three central Victorian races were sampled from an open-pollinated progeny trial in Tasmania, Australia. Acoustic wave velocity (AWV) was assessed on standing-trees and sawlogs. Wedges from disks extracted from sawlogs were assessed for basic density and checking. Processed boards from 496 of the trees were assessed for board stiffness (static modulus of elasticity, MOE), and internal and surface checking. Genetic differences among races were significant for AWV and MOE traits. The Southern race had the highest mean values for these traits. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens boards could be improved through breeding. Estimated narrow-sense heritabilities were 0. 85 for standing-tree AWV, 0. 71 for log AWV, 0. 37 for board MOE, and ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 52 for checking traits. A strongly positive genetic correlation (rg = 1. 05) was observed between standing-tree AWV and board MOE, indicating that AWV {{could be used as a}} selection trait to improve E. nitens board stiffness. The genetic correlation between basic density and board MOE was also positive (rg = 0. 62). However, a significant and adverse genetic correlation (rg = 0. 61) was identified between basic density and surface <b>check</b> <b>length.</b> Wood stiffness and checking traits were more-or-less genetically independent, and genetic correlations between surface and internal checking were positive but only moderate (rg = 0. 48 - 0. 52) ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the generation of}} the minimum <b>length</b> <b>checking</b> sequences for FSM-based protocol conformance testing. The discussion focuses on finding the minimal <b>length</b> of resulting <b>checking</b> sequences for an FSM under different conditions. Without interleaving state identification and transition verification sequences, four methods (D-method, W-method, Wp-method and UIOv-method) of generating minimum length test sequences for FSMs with reliable reset feature are reviewed and provided to construct checking sequences. These four methods are then improved to generate minimum <b>length</b> <b>checking</b> sequences for FSMs without reliable reset feature and provided to construct checking sequences. Moreover, the effects of interleaving the state identification and transition verification sequences on the <b>length</b> of the <b>checking</b> sequences are studied. An algorithm for interleaving the state identification and transition verification sequences generated by the above four methods with reliable reset feature is proposed. It is observed that {{the reduction in the}} <b>length</b> of <b>checking</b> sequences due to interleaving is significant. Finally, the two general models for constructing minimal <b>length</b> <b>checking</b> sequences using distinguishing sequences with interleaved state identification and transition verification sequences are proposed.
