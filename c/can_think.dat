5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects {{is known as}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E

25|$|So we <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of the {{category}} of real vector bundles on X as sitting inside {{the category}} of sheaves of OX-modules; this latter category is abelian, so {{this is where we}} can compute kernels and cokernels of morphisms of vector bundles.|$|E
25|$|So {{following}} a rule is a practice. And furthermore, since one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> one is {{following a}} rule and yet be mistaken, thinking one is following a rule {{is not the}} same as following it. Therefore, following a rule cannot be a private activity.|$|E

25|$|By {{commutativity}} and associativity one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of join {{and meet}} as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, {{rather than on}} elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.|$|E
25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of each row {{operation}} as {{the left}} product by an elementary matrix.

On the right, we kept a record of BI = B, which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.|$|E
