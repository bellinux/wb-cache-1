5|$|During the Company Raj {{and later}} the British Raj, Tiruchirappalli {{emerged as one of}} the most {{important}} cities in India. According to the 1871 Indian census—the first in British India—Tiruchirappalli had a population of 76,530, making it the second largest city in the presidency after the capital of Madras. It was known throughout the British Empire for its unique variety of <b>cheroot,</b> known as the Trichinopoly cigar. Tiruchirappalli was the first headquarters for the newly formed South Indian Railway Company in 1874 until its relocation to Madras in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The group filmed a third {{video in}} an attempt to appeal to a broader audience. It was {{directed}} by Rattle and Hum director Phil Joanou and was primarily filmed in early March 1992 at Nell's, a Manhattan nightclub. The video depicts Bono sitting at a table smoking a <b>cheroot</b> and drinking beer, interspersed with footage of the band performing in concert. While Bono was filmed, the rest of the band, along with models and transvestites, attended a party in the basement, awaiting their turns to be filmed. However, they were never called to the set and by 3 a.m., they realised that the video was to focus on Bono.|$|E
500|$|The look of {{the older}} Padayappa— bearded, with sunglasses— is based on Rajinikanth's look as the {{character}} Manik Baashha in Baashha (1995); Ganesh Nadar of Rediff commented, [...] "Give [...] a <b>cheroot</b> and that's Padayappa." [...] Sivaji Ganesan was cast as the protagonist's father; Padayappa was the last film he worked on {{before his death in}} 2001, although Pooparika Varugirom (1999) was his final release. His character's appearance, with a mutton-chop moustache, is based on a similar role he played in Thevar Magan (1992).|$|E

500|$|The city is an {{important}} educational centre {{in the state of}} Tamil Nadu, and houses nationally recognised institutions such as the Indian Institute of Management (IIMT), Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) and National Institute of Technology (NITT). Industrial units such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Golden Rock Railway Workshop, Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli (OFT) and Heavy Alloy [...] Penetrator Project (HAPP) have their factories in the city. The presence {{of a large number of}} energy equipment manufacturing units in and around the city has earned it the title of [...] "Energy Equipment and Fabrication Capital of India".

2500|$|Supayalat {{never lost}} her composure, and {{was said to}} have asked a British soldier by the wayside for a light to smoke a Burmese <b>cheroot.</b> She was {{pregnant}} and accompanied by her husband, their two daughters, her two sisters, and her mother; the rest of their party followed on foot. The troops had nicknamed her [...] "Soup Plate", and in the commotion and haste that attended their abduction, some of the crown jewels disappeared including a large ruby called Nga Mauk that Colonel Sladen had insisted on being handed over for safekeeping. [...] Thibaw saw an opportunity in 1911 when King George V visited India, and wrote for the return of the Burmese crown jewels, but only received a reply that Col. Sladen had died in 1890. Nga Mauk was believed to have subsequently turned up as the largest ruby on the British crown; it was recognised by [...] Princess of Kyundaung in whose charge the ruby used to be.|$|E

60|$|When {{the curtain}} rises, the {{circular}} platform is deserted.

40|$|AbstractEight manuscripts have {{specifically}} {{examined the}} effects of areca (betel) nut use in pregnant women, seven of which have documented adverse effects on birth weight, newborn neurological status, gender ratio and pregnancy outcomes such as anaemia and miscarriage following areca nut use during pregnancy. A retrospective cohort analysis of migrant and refugee pregnant women attending antenatal clinics along the Thai–Myanmar border (July 1997 to November 2006) was conducted to examine the adverse effects of areca nut use routinely recorded on enrolment. Of 7685 women, 2284 (29. 7 %) never used areca or smoked (<b>cheroots),</b> 2484 (32. 3 %) only used areca, 438 (5. 7 %) only smoked <b>cheroots</b> and 2479 (32. 3 %) used both areca and <b>cheroots.</b> Pieces of ripe areca nut in a leaf with lime, without tobacco, were used particularly among older multigravid women. Adverse pregnancy effects were not observed in areca nut users compared with non-users. Smoking, but not areca nut use, had a dose-related effect on miscarriage. Areca nut use in conjunction with smoking reduced the adverse effects of smoking on birth weight, further supporting a lack of effect of areca nut. Areca (betel) nut-related adverse pregnancy outcomes were not observed in this population, whereas smoking was clearly harmful. Differences from previous reports may result from the amount or types of areca nut, or quid content, consumed between countries. Smoking, but not areca nut, reduction is likely to improve pregnancy outcomes on the Thai–Myanmar border...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} lasura are broad, ovate, {{alternate}} and stalked with the spread being 7 to 15 cm x 5 to 10 cm. In matter of external appearance these are glabrous above and pubescent below.
