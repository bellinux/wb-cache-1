25|$|The {{combination}} of this turnaround cycle and {{the requirement to}} drive a control line high for one cycle before ceasing to drive it means {{that each of the}} main <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> must be high for a minimum of two cycles when changing owners. The PCI bus protocol is designed so this is rarely a limitation; only in a few special cases (notably fast back-to-back transactions) is it necessary to insert additional delay to meet this requirement.|$|E
25|$|Both {{airplanes}} {{were destroyed}} in the collision. All 248 passengers and crew aboard the KLM plane died, as did 335 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am plane, primarily due to the fire and explosions resulting from the fuel spilled and ignited in the impact. The other 61 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am aircraft survived, including the captain, first officer and flight engineer. Most of the survivors on the Pan Am walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. The Pan Am's engines were still running {{for a few minutes}} after the accident despite first officer Bragg's intention to turn them off. The top part of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been {{destroyed in the}} collision, and all <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> were severed, leaving no method for the flight crew to control the aircraft's systems. Survivors waited for rescue, but it did not come promptly, as the firefighters were initially unaware that there were two aircraft involved and were concentrating on the KLM wreck hundreds of meters away in the thick fog and smoke. Eventually, most of the survivors on the wings dropped to the ground below.|$|E

40|$|Selection for lean {{growth rate}} (LGR) was {{conducted}} for four generations in a synthetic line of YorkshireMeishan pigs. In the select line, seven boars and 20 gilts {{with the highest}} LGR were selected from each generation to produce the subsequent generation. A contemporaneous <b>control</b> <b>line</b> was maintained by randomly selecting five boars and 15 gilts to produce the next generation. Inbreeding coefficients averaged. 198 and. 207 for the select and <b>control</b> <b>line</b> pigs and. 173 and. 162 for the select and <b>control</b> <b>line</b> dams, respectively, in the fourth generation. LGR was estimated from ultrasound measures of 10 th -rib backfat thickness and longissimus muscle area from 1, 057 pigs. These pigs were sired by 58 boars and out of 133 sows. The generation interval was 13 months and the average selection differential per generation was 1. 1 phenotypic standard deviation units for LGR. Heritability and response were estimated from the deviation of select <b>line</b> from the <b>control</b> <b>line</b> and multiple trait derivative free restricted maximum likelihood (MTDFREML) on the same material. Realized heritability was. 29 ±. 12 for LGR in the <b>control</b> <b>line.</b> Corresponding estimates from MTDFREML were. 32 and. 37. The estimate of direct genetic change per generation using the deviation from the <b>control</b> <b>line</b> was 9. 4 g/day for LGR. Corresponding estimates from MTDFREML were similar but were more precisely estimated...|$|R
500|$|After {{the seizure}} of power, {{hundreds}} of VNQDD members returned from China, only to be killed at the border by the Vietminh. Nevertheless, the VNQDD arrived in northern Vietnam with arms and supplies from the KMT, {{in addition to its}} prestige as a Vietnamese nationalist organisation. Nationalist China backed the VNQDD in the hope of gaining more influence over its southern neighbour. Ho tried to broaden his support in order to strengthen himself, in addition to decreasing Chinese and French power. He hoped that by co-opting VNQDD members, he could shut out the KMT. The communists had no intention of sharing power with anyone in the long term and regarded the move as purely a strategic exercise. Giap, the Vietminh's military chief, called the VNQDD a [...] "group of reactionaries plotting to rely on Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang and their rifle barrels to snatch a few crumbs". The VNQDD dominated the main <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> between northern Vietnam and China near Lào Cai. They funded their operations from the tribute that they levied from the local populace. Once the majority of the non-communist nationalists had returned to Vietnam, the VNQDD banded with them to form an anti-Vietminh alliance. The VNQDD and the Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang (DVQDD, Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) started their own military academy at Yên Bái to train their own military recruits. Armed confrontations between the Vietminh and the nationalists occurred regularly in major northern cities. The VNQDD were aided by the KMT, who were in northern Vietnam as the result of an international agreement to stabilise the country. The KMT often disarmed local Vietminh bands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{question}} of whether selection experiments ought to include a <b>control</b> <b>line,</b> as opposed to investing all facilities in a single selected line, is addressed using a likelihood perspective. The consequences of using a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> are evaluated under two scenarios. In the first one, environmental trend is modeled and inferred from the data. In this case, a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> is shown to be highly beneficial {{in terms of the}} efficiency of inferences about eheritability and response to selection. In the second scenario, environmental trend is not modeled. One can imagine that a previous analysis of the experimental data had lent support to this decision. It is shown that in this situation where a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> may seem superfluous, inclusion of a <b>control</b> <b>line</b> can result in minor gains in efficiency if a high selection intensity is practiced in the selected line. Further, if there is a loss, it is moderately small. The results are verified to hold under more complicated data structures via Monte Carlo simulation. For completeness, divergent selection designs are also reviewed, and inferences based on a conditional and full likelihood approach are contrasted. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The RB26DETT engine {{actually}} produced ~320PS, {{but it was}} unstated due to the Japanese car makers' [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] not {{to exceed}} 280PS (276hp). The engine was designed for ~500hp in racing trim, and then muzzled by the exhaust, boost restriction, and ECU. The electronic boost control had a small physical restriction in the <b>control</b> <b>lines.</b> It was marked in yellow so the new owner could remove it and enjoy a safe factory boost increase. After this increase the car would put out ~310hp (~230kW) and could do 0–100km/h in 4.7 seconds and quarter mile in 12.8 seconds.|$|E

The state of other <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> is not relevant. The effect of this signal is actually delayed by one clock cycle. [...] That is, the current clock cycle proceeds as usual, but the following clock cycle is ignored, except for testing the CKE input again. Normal operations resume on the rising edge of the clock after the one where CKE is sampled high.Put another way, all other chip operations are timed relative to the rising edge of a masked clock. The masked clock is the logical AND of the input clock {{and the state of}} the CKE signal during the previous rising edge of the input clock.|$|E
2500|$|Rodents {{have been}} {{specifically}} bred for exercise behavior or performance {{in several different}} studies. [...] For example, laboratory rats have been bred for high or low performance on a motorized treadmill with electrical stimulation as motivation. The high-performance line of rats also exhibits increased voluntary wheel-running behavior {{as compared with the}} low-capacity line. In an experimental evolution approach, four replicate lines of laboratory mice have been bred for high levels of voluntary exercise on wheels, while four additional <b>control</b> <b>lines</b> are maintained by breeding without regard to the amount of wheel running. These selected lines of mice also show increased endurance capacity in tests of forced endurance capacity on a motorized treadmill. [...] However, in neither selection experiment have the precise causes of fatigue during either forced or voluntary exercise been determined.|$|E
