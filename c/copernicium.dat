5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt to deposit <b>copernicium</b> atoms on a selenium surface to form <b>copernicium</b> selenide, CnSe. Reaction of <b>copernicium</b> atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for <b>copernicium</b> than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down the group for the group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>copernicium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict <b>copernicium</b> to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of <b>copernicium</b> and flerovium. The atomic radius of <b>copernicium</b> {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element, {{that can only be}} created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 29seconds. <b>Copernicium</b> was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
500|$|The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) {{assessed}} {{the claim of}} <b>copernicium's</b> discovery by the GSI team in 2001 and 2003. In both cases, they {{found that there was}} insufficient evidence to support their claim. This was primarily related to the contradicting decay data for the known nuclide rutherfordium-261. However, between 2001 and 2005, the GSI team studied the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs, and were able to confirm the decay data for hassium-269 and rutherfordium-261. It was found that the existing data on rutherfordium-261 was for an isomer,Rf ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. <b>Copernicium</b> has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize <b>copernicium</b> from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{approximately}} 75 {{atoms of}} <b>copernicium</b> {{have been prepared}} using various nuclear reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at <b>copernicium.</b> This and the closed-shell configuration of <b>copernicium</b> result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but {{was found to have}} been based on data fabricated by Ninov) of <b>copernicium</b> was produced with a mass number of 277.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence <b>copernicium</b> may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. <b>Copernicium</b> is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid <b>copernicium</b> and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. <b>Copernicium</b> has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of <b>copernicium</b> have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, <b>copernicium</b> shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} <b>copernicium</b> were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5minutes. Analysis {{of the data}} indicated that <b>copernicium</b> was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April–May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR–PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that <b>copernicium</b> is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold, placing it firmly in group 12.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only <b>copernicium</b> (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the <b>copernicium</b> is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Flerovium is {{currently}} the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical investigations have so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of <b>copernicium.</b> The first experiment involved the reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl and the second the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,4n)288Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose <b>copernicium</b> daughters would then be studied. The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were {{compared with those of}} radon, as it was then expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour. Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group 12. The chemistry of <b>copernicium</b> is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.|$|E
5|$|The table {{below is}} {{a summary of the}} key {{physical}} properties of the group 12 elements. Very little is known about <b>copernicium,</b> and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its boiling point (tentative).|$|E
5|$|<b>Copernicium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Seven different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 281 to 286, and 277. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} <b>copernicium</b> has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so {{that it may be}} a gas at standard conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, <b>copernicium</b> is a d-block transactinide element. During reactions with gold, {{it has been shown}} to be an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element, so much so that it is probably a gas at standard temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if any {{synthetic}} elements with atomic number above 99 are gases. If it transpires that <b>copernicium</b> and flerovium are gaseous metals at or near room temperature, as some calculations as well as preliminary experimental results have suggested, the category of elemental gases {{may need to be}} sub-divided into metallic and nonmetallic gases.|$|E
5|$|The first {{experiment}} allowed {{detection of}} three atoms of 283Cn but also seemingly detected 1 atom of 287Fl. This {{result was a}} surprise given the transport time of the product atoms is ~2s, so the flerovium atoms produced should have decayed to <b>copernicium</b> before adsorption. In the second reaction, 2 atoms of 288Fl and possibly 1 atom of 289Fl were detected. Two of the three atoms displayed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile, noble-gas-like element, which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations. These experiments provided independent confirmation for the discovery of <b>copernicium,</b> flerovium, and livermorium via comparison with published decay data. Further experiments in 2008 to confirm this important result detected a single atom of 289Fl, and supported previous data showing flerovium having a noble-gas-like interaction with gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} known group 12 element, <b>copernicium,</b> {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. It was then officially {{named by the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus' birth.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{most other}} d-block groups, the {{abundance}} in Earth's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant. <b>Copernicium,</b> as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only {{be present in the}} laboratories where it was produced.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since <b>copernicium</b> (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (<b>copernicium)</b> {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium is {{the ninth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since <b>copernicium</b> (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, <b>copernicium</b> (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may turn out to be a noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|The three group 12 {{elements}} that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all {{widely used in}} electric and electronic applications, {{as well as in}} various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As <b>copernicium</b> does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Unbinilium, {{also known}} as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element in the periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120. Unbinilium and Ubn are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second element in the eighth period. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to <b>copernicium</b> and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|All <b>copernicium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 29seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4seconds, and the unconfirmed 286Cn has a half-life of about 8.45seconds. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 0.1seconds. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives of 97ms, {{and the other two}} isotopes have half-lives slightly under one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few decades, and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10−12 times as abundant as lead.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of <b>copernicium</b> and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} {{a report on}} the discovery of <b>copernicium</b> in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn. This implied the discovery of flerovium, from the acknowledgement of the data for the synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv, which decay to 283Cn. The discovery of the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium, {{also known}} as eka-actinium or element 121, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Ubu and atomic number 121. Unbiunium and Ubu are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be the first of the superactinides, and the third element in the eighth period: analogously to lanthanum and actinium, it could be considered the fifth member of group 3 and the first member of the fifth-row transition metals. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to <b>copernicium</b> and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and <b>copernicium,</b> which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|In {{a quantum}} {{tunneling}} model with mass estimates from a macroscopic-microscopic model, the alpha-decay half-lives of several unbinilium isotopes (292–304Ubn) have been predicted {{to be around}} 1–20 microseconds. Some heavier isotopes may be more stable; Fricke and Waber predicted 320Ubn {{to be the most}} stable unbinilium isotope in 1971. Since unbinilium is expected to decay via a cascade of alpha decays leading to spontaneous fission around <b>copernicium,</b> the total half-lives of unbinilium isotopes are also predicted to be measured in microseconds. This has consequences for the synthesis of unbinilium, as isotopes with half-lives below one microsecond would decay before reaching the detector. Nevertheless, new theoretical models show that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f7/2 (filled at element 114) and 2f5/2 (filled at element 120) is smaller than expected, so that element 114 no longer appears to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell, and this energy gap may increase the stability of elements 119 and 120. The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around the spherical 306Ubb (element 122), but the expected low half-life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a transactinide element in the p-block. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and is the heaviest known member of the carbon group; it is also the heaviest element whose chemistry has been investigated. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases. More recent results show that flerovium's reaction with gold is similar to that of <b>copernicium,</b> showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, that it would show metallic properties, consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead, and that it would be the least reactive metal in group 14. The question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low boiling point, and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for <b>copernicium,</b> which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a boiling point of around −60°C.|$|E
