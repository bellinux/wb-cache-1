40|$|Botulinum toxin is {{the most}} potent toxin known. It is readily absorbed from mucosal surfaces. If {{dispersed}} as an aerosol or mixed in the food or water {{it can lead to}} a large outbreak of botulism. The disease presents as a symmetric descending paralysis in an afebrile patient. Cranial nerve involvement with diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia and respiratory paralysis is seen after a variable incubation period. The treatment is mainly supportive. The source of the toxin is Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive spore-forming organism. Some other species of <b>Clostridium</b> like C. <b>butyricum</b> and C. baratii also produce the toxin. The toxin is heat labile and can be inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The toxin acts at the peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junctions, postganglionic parasympathetic ganglia, etc, and affects neurotransmitter release by inhibiting exocytosis.

40|$|Botulism {{is caused}} by botulinum toxin, a potent neurotoxin {{produced}} by Clostridium botulinum and a few strains of C. baratii and C. <b>butyricum.</b> <b>Clostridium</b> botulinum is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming rod. Botulism can result from the ingestion of preformed toxin or the growth of C. botulinum in anaerobic tissues. Seven types of botulinum toxin, designated A through G, have been identified. Types A, B, E and F cause illness in humans. Type C {{is the most common}} cause of botulism in animals. Type D is sometimes seen in cattle and dogs, and type B can occur in horses.

The control group was given conventional therapy combined with Ribavirin. The observation group {{was treated with}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>butyricum</b> powder {{on the basis of}} control group.

After treatment, the levels of serum CD 3 +, CD 4 + and CD 4 +/CD 8 + in both groups were higher than those before treatment, while CD 8 + level was lower than that before treatment. The levels of serum CD 3 +, CD 4 + and CD 4 +/CD 8 + in the observation group were higher than those in the control group after treatment, while the CD 8 + level was lower than that in control group in the corresponding period.
