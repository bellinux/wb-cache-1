25|$|<b>Control</b> <b>surface</b> {{reversal}} is {{the loss}} (or reversal) of the expected response of a <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> due to deformation of the main lifting surface. For simple models (e.g. single aileron on an Euler-Benouilli beam), control reversal speeds can be derived analytically as for torsional divergence. Control reversal {{can be used to}} aerodynamic advantage, and forms part of the Kaman servo-flap rotor design.|$|E

5000|$|The Wright {{brothers}} are credited with developing the first practical <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It is a {{main part of}} their patent on flying. [...] Unlike modern <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> they used wing warping. [...] In an attempt to circumvent the [...] Wright patent, Glenn Curtiss made hinged <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> {{the same type of}} concept first patented some four decades earlier in the United Kingdom. Hinged <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> have the advantage of not causing stresses that are a problem of wing warping and are easier to build into structures.|$|R
25|$|A V-shaped pelikan tail {{could be}} implemented, {{replacing}} conventional vertical tail fins and horizontal stabiliser structures. This {{would be beneficial}} for reduction of radar signature, weight and aerodynamic drag, since <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> area and corresponding control mechanisms are reduced. Problems faced by this type of design are flight control system complexity and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> loading. If the pelikan tail is adopted, use of engines with thrust vector control may alleviate these problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydraulic}} circuit, {{which has}} hydraulic pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and actuators. The actuators are {{powered by the}} hydraulic pressure generated by the pumps in the hydraulic circuit. The actuators convert hydraulic pressure into <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> movements. The electro-hydraulic servo valves control {{the movement of the}} actuators.|$|E
50|$|A {{gust lock}} on an {{aircraft}} is a mechanism that locks <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and keeps open aircraft doors in place while the aircraft is {{parked on the}} ground and non-operational. Gust locks prevent wind from causing unexpected movements of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and their linked controls inside the aircraft, as well as aircraft doors on some aircraft. Otherwise wind gusts could cause possible damage to the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and systems, or nearby people, cargo, or machinery. Some gust locks are external devices attached directly to the aircraft's <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> while others are attached to the flight controls inside the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|To {{keep the}} {{analysis}} (relatively) simple, the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> are assumed fixed throughout the motion, this is stick-fixed stability. Stick-free analysis requires the further complication {{of taking the}} motion of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> into account.|$|R
50|$|A further feature {{will be a}} {{so-called}} 'Self Repairing Flight Control Capability' (自己修復飛行制御機能), which will allow the aircraft to automatically detect failures or damage in its flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and using the remaining <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> calibrate accordingly to retain controlled flight.|$|R
25|$|The Boeing Model 247 was {{an early}} United States airliner, {{considered}} the first such aircraft to fully incorporate advances such as all-metal (anodized aluminium) semimonocoque construction, a fully cantilevered wing and retractable landing gear. Other advanced features included <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> trim tabs, an autopilot and de-icing boots for the wings and tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{movement}} of a control causes the mechanical circuit {{to open the}} matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the servo valve is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage - one that stops {{movement of}} the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> at the desired position.|$|E
25|$|A new {{generation}} of digital consoles {{was developed in the}} early years of the 21st Century starting with the C100 and C200 Broadcast consoles. C100 was designed for On-Air applications and based around an assignable 'channel tile' <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> C200 was configured for production applications and features a knob-per-function channel strip approach based on earlier consoles and so familiar to thousands of SSL experienced mixing engineers.|$|E

5000|$|From December 1955 to March 1956, Albacore {{underwent}} stern renewal. Until this time, her propeller {{had been}} {{surrounded by the}} rudder and stern plane <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> With her [...] "new look", she resembled a blimp, with her propeller aft of all <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
25|$|Trim tabs {{are small}} {{surfaces}} {{connected to the}} trailing edge of a larger <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> such as a rudder, on an aircraft, used to control the trim of the controls, i.e. to counteract aerodynamic forces and stabilise the aircraft in a particular desired attitude without the need for the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> area {{required}} by large aircraft or higher loads caused by high airspeeds in small aircraft {{lead to a}} large increase in the forces needed to move them, consequently complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage {{in order to reduce}} the forces required from the pilots. This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder missile uses small control {{surfaces}} {{placed at the}} rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surfaces and these are known as rollerons. Airflow over the disks spins them to a high speed. If the missile starts to roll, the gyroscopic force of the disks drives the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus, the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with a simple mechanical solution.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of simultaneously stabilizing a civil flying wing aircraft and optimizing the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> physical parameters, such as <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> sizes and actuators bandwidth. This flying wing configuration is characterized by unstable longitudinal modes, badly damped lateral modes, {{and a lack of}} control efficiency despite large movables. The question is then to determine the energy penalty associated to the control of these unstable modes, and more pre- cisely to optimize the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> architecture in order to minimize the control-associated energy. Our approach uses latest nonsmooth optimization techniques, which allows more possibilities on requirements specifications and controller structure compared to other approaches such as LMI-based optimizations. Results show a consistent behaviour for tuned parameters of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Thermal <b>Control</b> <b>Surfaces</b> Experiment (TCSE) is {{the most}} complex system {{retrieved}} after long term space exposure. The TCSE {{is a microcosm of}} complex electro-optical payloads being developed and flown. The objective of the TCSE on the LDEF was {{to determine the effects of}} the near-Earth orbital environment and the LDEF induced environment on spacecraft thermal <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The TCSE was a comprehensive experiment that combined in-space measurements with extensive post-flight analyses of thermal <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> to determine the effects of exposure to the low Earth orbit space environment. The TCSE was the first space experiment to measure the optical properties of thermal <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> the way they are routinely measured in the lab.

25|$|For example, the {{assumption}} that mass is conserved means that for any fixed control volume (for example, a spherical volume) – enclosed by a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> – {{the rate of change}} of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from outside to inside, minus the rate at which mass is passing from inside to outside. This can be expressed as an equation in integral form over the control volume.|$|E
25|$|A {{fly-by-wire}} (FBW) system replaces {{manual flight}} control of an aircraft {{with an electronic}} interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems {{are part of the}} field known as avionics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Dr Paul B. MacCready and Dr Peter B. S. Lissaman, both of AeroVironment Inc., took {{a fresh look}} at the {{challenge}} and came up with an unorthodox aircraft, the Gossamer Condor. He took his inspiration from hang gliders, increasing wing area so that the drag of the wire bracing needed would be reduced. The Gossamer Condor is built around a large wing with a gondola for the pilot underneath and a canard <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on a fuselage extension in front, and is mostly built of lightweight plastics with aluminum spars.|$|E

25|$|Boelcke had to swerve {{to avoid}} a mid-air {{collision}} in the dogfight and Böhme's Albatros briefly collided with that of Boelcke. The wheels of Böhme's plane barely brushed {{the fabric of the}} top wing of Boelcke's craft, enough to start the fabric unraveling. Boelcke struggled for control as his plane's <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> shredded in the turbulence. He skillfully crashlanded after the entire upper wing tore loose. However, in his haste to be airborne he had not fastened his seat belt. Boelcke was killed by his relatively mild impact. Böhme survived the accident, as he had suffered only a landing gear damage.|$|E
25|$|Production Phantoms {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} design improvements. These included provisions for a flush-fitting centerline drop tank, an improved gunsight, {{and the addition of}} speed brakes. Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with 1,600lbf (7.1kN) of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used to resolve problems with <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by 19in (48cm). The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.|$|E
25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|E
