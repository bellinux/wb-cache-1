40|$|Organelle {{translocation}} in {{a number}} of cell types in tissue culture as seen by high-resolution Zeiss-Nomarski differential interference contrast optics was filmed and analyzed by computer. Principal cell types studied included primary chick spinal cord, chick dorsal root ganglion, rat brain, and various clones of <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Organelle translocations in all cell types studied exhibited frequent, large changes in velocity during any one translocation. The appearance of particles as seen with Nomarski optics was correlated with their fine structures in one dorsal root ganglion neurite by fixing the cell as it was being filmed and obtaining electron micrographs of the region filmed. This revealed the identity of several organelles as well as the presence of abundant neurotubules but no neurofilaments. Primary cell cultures exhibited more high-velocity organelle movements than <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> The net progress of an organelle in a given direction was greater in primary neuronal cells than in fibroblasts or <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> These findings are correlated with the literature on organelle translocation and axoplasmic transport...|$|R

LT- 3 is more effective than either LT or TNF in inducing destruction of <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> in vitro. LT- 3 induces destruction of <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> that are resistant to both TNF and LT, and much less LT- 3 is required to destroy cells that are LT and/or TNF sensitive. In contrast, none of these mediators had any measurable negative effects when tested on primary human fibroblasts. Additional studies revealed that LT- 3 is also active in vivo and can cause necrosis of cutaneous Meth A tumors when administered intraperitoneally or intratumorally on BALB/c mice.

40|$|MY COPLASMAS {{were first}} {{isolated}} from tissue-culture cells by Robinson, Wichelhausen and Roizman (1956). Since that {{time they have}} been isolated {{from a variety of}} tissue cultures, particularly <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> (Macpherson, 1966). T-mycoplasmas were first isolated from the human genital tract by Shepard (1954), and since then from various animal specimens also (Taylor-Robinson, Williams and Haig, 1968; Taylor-Robinson et al., 1971). In man they are primarily associated with the genital tract (Shepard et al., 1964; Taylor-Robinson et al., 1969), but are present also in the mouth of about 5 per cent. of persons (Taylor-Robinson and Purcell, 1966; Purcell et al., 1967; Ford, 1967; Shepard, 1970). There would, therefore, seem to be opportunities for contamination of tissue cultures by T-mycoplasmas to occur. Nevertheless, there are no reports of this having happened; this could be due to an inability of T-mycoplasmas to survive or to a failure to examine cultures adequately for such contamination. We have examined cultures, and also <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> experimentally infected with T-mycoplasmas and compared the growth of these organisms with that of other mycoplasmas...|$|R

40|$|OBJECT Human {{lactoferrin}} (HLF) is {{a natural}} protein with antitumor activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of HLF alone and in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), a conventional chemotherapeutic, on human glioblastoma (GBM) cells. METHODS The authors cultured fresh human primary cell lines NMD and FN and the <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> U 87 MG to evaluate proliferation in the presence of HLF alone at different doses (1, 10, and 100 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml) and in combination with TMZ. In in vivo experiments they assessed tumor size reduction in CD 1 nude mice carrying an orthotopic GBM xenograft and orally treated with HLF. RESULTS Lactoferrin causes growth inhibition in the NMD and FN primary cell lines and in the U 87 MG <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> This inhibition seemed to be modulated by the downregulation of cyclin D 1 and D 4. Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed inhibition of the cell cycle in G 0 /G 1 and G 2 phases. When administered in nude mice, HLF (60 mg/kg/day) decreased tumor size about 30 %, as shown in both histological analyses and high-field brain MRI. Administration of HLF with TMZ enhanced the effect of chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that HLF can inhibit GBM cell growth, suggesting that this nontoxic substance may have a role in potentiating the effect of current TMZ treatment of GBM...|$|E

The B[a]P-treated populations consistently contained cells displaying a longer period of active growth in culture compared to the untreated control cells. Widespread heterogeneity in morphology and growth patterns was evidenced in these "extended life" (EL) cultures, with multiple sequential changes in these parameters occurring during the course of their life in culture.

40|$|Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV- 1) can infect {{the nervous}} system, {{resulting}} in a disease known as herpes encephalitis (HSE). Herpes encephalitis affects thousands of people each year; many cases are fatal or permanently debilitating. Approximately two thousand known cases occur in the United States each year alone (Neuroland online source). Acyclovir has been the drug of choice used to treat herpes encephalitis. Even after the administration of acyclovir, permanent neurological damage and/or death often results. Thousands of individuals would benefit by the discovery of drugs that are more effective at preventing lasting HSE damage and death. Knowledge concerning HSE infection of the brain could be advanced {{with the development of}} co-culture systems that allow for the study of one specific cell type or a subpopulation of cells during an active infection. Additional models are needed to test therapies against HSE. The majority of models that currently exist are in-vivo or primary <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> models. Even though many of these models can be used to mimic what actually occurs during herpes encephalitis infection in humans, these systems have several weaknesses. The usage of in-vivo models requires a great deal of time, preparation, funding, and care by a veterinarian staff. Primary <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> can be difficult to isolate and maintain for long lengths of time in cell culture. Unlike primary <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> are able to be used for longer periods of time.

The use of a <b>continuous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> prevents animal suffering and death.
