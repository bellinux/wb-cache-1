5|$|HIT may be {{suspected}} if {{blood tests}} show a falling platelet count in someone receiving heparin, {{even if the}} heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (which includes a platelet count) {{on a regular basis}} while receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (<b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (with {{examination}} of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
50|$|These {{are used}} to perform <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> {{erythrocyte}} sedimentation rates (ESRs), or coagulation tests.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>counts</b> {{of various}} types {{have been used for}} {{clinical}} purposes since the 19th century. Automated equipment to carry out <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> was developed in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
30|$|Follow-up {{assessments}} included physical examination, <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> <b>blood</b> chemistry every 2 – 4 {{weeks and}} tumor assessment by computed tomography were done every 1 – 2 months.|$|R
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count.</b> While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E

50|$|In small case series, routine {{chemistry}} and <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> have been normal in most patients. A few {{have been reported}} to have mild leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases.|$|R
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
25|$|Thalassemia can be {{diagnosed}} via a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count.</b>|$|E

50|$|Following {{observation}} of the symptoms, the patients need to get <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and a bone marrow examination. If the patient has leukemia, the morphology and immunopehnotype check is needed {{to make sure the}} type of leukemia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> {{are done}} to monitor overall health, {{to screen for}} some diseases, to confirm a {{diagnosis}} of some medical conditions, to monitor a medical condition, and to monitor changes in the body caused by medical treatments.|$|R
50|$|Azacitidine causes anemia (low red <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts),</b> {{neutropenia}} (low white <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts),</b> and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), {{and patients}} should have frequent monitoring of their <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> at least prior to each dosing cycle.

25|$|In medicine, the {{concentration}} of various blood cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, can give crucial information regarding the health situation of a person (see: <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other tests {{routinely}} {{performed in}} suspected SLE are complement system levels (low levels suggest consumption by the immune system), electrolytes and kidney function (disturbed if the kidney is involved), liver enzymes, and <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Complete</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>Count</b> (CBC): {{a test of}} {{the white}} blood cells, red blood cells and {{platelets}} used to assess the presence of various disorders such as leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytosis and anemia which may result from malnutrition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and serum {{chemistry}} profiles may {{be normal}} in affected horses. Persistent hyperglycemia and glucosuria are very commonly seen. Hyperlipidemia may be present, especially in ponies. Other abnormalities {{associated with the}} disease include mild anemia, neurophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and increased liver enzymes.|$|R
50|$|Dependant {{on their}} scope of {{practice}} and training, {{they may also be}} called upon to operate diagnostic screening equipment, including electrocardiographic, radiographic and ultrasonographic instruments, including complex machines such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imagers and gamma cameras. In veterinary hospitals, veterinary technicians can perform <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> differential counts, and morphologic examinations of blood.|$|R
2500|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} based on {{repeated}} <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and {{a bone marrow}} examination following observations of the symptoms. [...] Sometimes, blood tests may not show that a person has leukemia, especially {{in the early stages}} of the disease or during remission. [...] A lymph node biopsy can be performed to diagnose certain types of leukemia in certain situations.|$|R

25|$|Patients with {{a history}} of leukopenia: a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> should be {{monitored}} frequently during {{the first few months of}} therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells.|$|E
25|$|ITP is {{diagnosed}} by a low platelet count in a <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (a common blood test). However, since the diagnosis {{depends on the}} exclusion of other causes of a low platelet count, additional investigations (such as a bone marrow biopsy) may be necessary in some cases.|$|E
40|$|Two patients, {{one female}} one male, applied to our {{hospital}} with fever, weakness and fatigue complaints at different times. Because of a cytopenia being observed on <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> bone marrow aspiration {{was performed on}} both of the patients. The aspirates showed an increase in histiocytes, the cells phagocytizing erythrocytes and/or platelets; therefore hemophagocytic syndrome was diagnosed...|$|R
30|$|Physical examination, <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and {{biochemical}} {{tests were}} carried out before each cycle of therapy. A chest and abdomen CT scan was performed every four cycles and when disease progression was clinically suspected to document the extent of disease and to evaluate the response to treatment. The response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.0.|$|R
25|$|A {{lymphocyte}} count is usually {{part of a}} peripheral <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> and is expressed {{as the percentage of}} lymphocytes to the total number of white <b>blood</b> cells <b>counted.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pica in dogs {{may be a}} sign of Immune-mediated {{hemolytic}} anemia, {{especially when}} it involves eating substances such as tile grout, concrete dust, and sand. Dogs exhibiting this form of pica should be tested for anemia with a <b>Complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> including Hematocrit levels, or Packed cell volume.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} testing, such as blood tests (e.g., <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count)</b> {{radiology}} examinations (e.g., X-rays), pathology (e.g., biopsy results), or specialized testing (e.g., pulmonary function testing) are included. Often, {{as in the}} case of X-rays, a written report of the findings is included in lieu of the actual film.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate can {{be given}} by mouth or by {{injection}} (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal). Doses by mouth are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every 2 months.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of PHF is {{accomplished}} by measuring antibody titers or PCR testing {{to look for the}} bacterium in the blood and feces. However, most veterinarians opt to initiate treatment right away, as the disease can progress quite quickly. Veterinarians may also run <b>complete</b> <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and chemistry and electrolyte panels to determine the course of care. Radiographs may be taken to track the progress of laminitic horses.|$|R
