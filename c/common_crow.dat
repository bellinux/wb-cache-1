5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the <b>common</b> <b>crow</b> (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E

60|$|Formerly, the raven and magpie {{came first}} as pets. The raven {{vanished}} as a pet, because like the goshawk, kite, and buzzard, he was extirpated {{in the interests}} of the game-preserver and hen-wife. The magpie was then first, and has only been recently ousted from that ancient, honourable position. The pie was a superior bird as a feathered pet in a cage; he is beautiful in shape and colour in his snow-white and metallic dark-green and purple-glossed plumage, and his long graduated tail. Moreover, he is a clever bird. To my mind there is no more fascinating species when I can find it in numbers, in places where it is not persecuted, and is accustomed to congregate at intervals, not as rooks and starlings do merely because they are gregarious, but purely for social purposes--to play and converse with one another. Its language at such times is so various as to be a surprise and delight to the listener; while its ways of amusing itself, its clowning and the little tricks and practical jokes the birds are continually playing on each other, are a delight to witness. All this is lost in a caged bird. He is handsome to look at and remarkably intelligent, but he distinguishes between magpies and men; he doesn't reveal himself; his accomplishments, vocal and mental, are for his own tribe. In this he differs from the daw; for the daw is less specialized; he is an undersized <b>common</b> <b>crow,</b> livelier, more impish than that bird, also more plastic, more adaptive, and takes more kindly to the domestic or parasitic life. Human beings to him are simply larger daws, and unlike the pie he can play his tricks and be himself among them as freely as when with his feathered comrades. We like him best because he makes himself one of us.|$|E

50|$|Sanoor, {{being in}} the Sahyadri hill range, is a home for several {{hundreds}} of birds, many reptiles and mammal species.

Other birds such as Kingfisher, Pipt, Asian Koel, Parakeet, Black kite, Falcon, Brahmini kite, Treepie, Black woodpecker, whistling thrush, Rock pigeon, Eagle etc. are seen almost wherever and whenever you pass by.

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, many species of {{waterfowl}} and <b>common</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were found dead in Phelps County, Nebraska. About 25, 000 waterfowl and at least 3, 000 crows died in the epornitic. Few waterfowl were seen dying, but the crows experienced a chronic illness during which they became debilitated and were lethargic and dyspneic. Gross and microscopic lesions in the waterfowl were typical for acute avian cholera. The crows had dank, firm areas within the lungs, a loosely adhered yellow fibrous material in the pericardial sac and air sacs and, occasionally, liver abscesses. Microscopically, focal punulent pneumonia was present and a fibrinopurulent exudate overlaid a granulomatous reaction on the heart and lung surfaces. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 confirmed the diagnosis of acute and chronic avian cholera in the waterfowl and crows, respectively...|$|R
