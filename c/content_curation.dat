5|$|In 2012, Booker and tech {{executives}} Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson formed Waywire, {{a company}} focused on video sharing technology. Early investors included Oprah Winfrey, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Weiner, and Troy Carter. After Booker's relationship to Waywire was discussed in a front-page New York Times story, board member Andrew Zucker {{stepped down from}} his position. Shortly thereafter, Waywire CEO Nathan Richardson departed the business as the company shifted its focus from content creation to <b>content</b> <b>curation.</b> In August 2013, Booker told NBC News he intended to resign from the Waywire board and put his holdings in a trust if elected to the Senate; by September, he had resigned his place {{on the board and}} donated his share of the company to charity. Waywire was sold to another video curation business the following month.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{curation}} is {{an extension}} of <b>content</b> <b>curation,</b> and involves the collecting, preserving, and archiving of digital assets associated with digitized collections. Digital assets include both those items that originated in a digital form and are considered born-digital (i.e. websites, wikis, and digitally created sound and photographs), as well as analog items that have been digitized (i.e. cataloged in digital form, while still maintaining the original physical/analog form). Digital curation, like <b>content</b> <b>curation,</b> also involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, which in this case, often involves website maintenance for online exhibits.|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} focusses on {{the role}} of digital content repositories and the role they may have in filtering <b>content</b> for <b>curation,</b> and how they can help deal with the problem of scale. My particular interest is institutional digital repositories, where the institutions are typically involved in research and higher education. The examples used come from the JISC KeepIt project. From this project we know something about the emerging types of repositories – from science data and the arts to teaching and learning content, as well as research papers – and how they are adapting to the needs of preservation and curation of vast amounts of digital data...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} study of Wikipedia in which we use a mixed-methods {{approach}} to understand how participation in specialized workgroups called WikiProjects {{has changed over the}} life of the encyclopedia. While previous work has analyzed the work of WikiProjects in supporting the development of articles within particular subject domains, the collaborative role of WikiProjects that do not fit this conventional mold has not been empirically examined. We combine content analysis, interviews and analysis of edit logs to identify and characterize these alternative WikiProjects and the work they do. Our findings suggest that WikiProject participation reflects community concerns and shifts in the community’s conception of valued work over the past six years. We discuss implications for other open collaborations that need flexible, adaptable coordination mechanisms to support a range of <b>content</b> creation, <b>curation</b> and community maintenance tasks.

40|$|Libraries {{are often}} {{hailed as the}} {{cultural}} and learning hub of their communities. To deepen community engagement and social inclusion, libraries are adopting new technologies to facilitate a participatory and learning culture. With market saturation of smartphones and tablets and their associated apps, new affordances for <b>content</b> creation, <b>curation</b> and sharing show great potential to enhance participatory culture. The typical smartphone or tablet now incorporates digital technologies such as geo-location, audio, video, photo and web technologies. Bringing these technologies into a single device has enabled the development of apps such as Instagram, HistoryPin and SoundCloud. It has also changed the way users engage with established social networks and photo-sharing sites. Users can now create and share content on an unprecedented scale from any accessible Wi-fi or mobile phone network. Libraries are embracing these technology-rich apps to interact with their customers in many different ways. Examples in this article examine how libraries are taking up opportunities enabled by the convergence of technologies into mobile devices in the participatory culture context – tapping into new communities, engaging with their stakeholders in meaningful ways, enhancing their social impact and transforming their essential roles in today’s knowledge society...|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} long-term <b>curation</b> {{of digital}} <b>content</b> requires expert analysis, policy setting, and decision making, and a robust technical infrastructure that can effect and enforce curation policies and implement appropriate curation activities. Since the number, size, {{and diversity of}} <b>content</b> under <b>curation</b> management will undoubtedly continue to grow over time, {{and the state of}} curation understanding and best practices relative to that content will undergo a similar constant evolution, one of the overarching design goals of a sustainable curation infrastructure is flexibility. In order to provide the necessary flexibility of deployment and configuration in the face of potentially disruptive changes in technology, institutional mission, and user expectation, a useful design metaphor is provided by the Unix pipeline, in which complex behavior is an emergent property of the coordinated action of a number of simple independent components. The decomposition of repository function into a highly granular and orthogonal set of independent but interoperable micro-services is consistent with the principles of prudent engineering practice. Since each micro-service is small and self-contained, they are individually more robust and collectively easier to implement and maintain. By being freely interoperable in various strategic combinations, any number of micro-services-based repositories can be easily constructed to meet specific administrative or technica...|$|R
