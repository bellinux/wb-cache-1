5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps. In 1975 the A W Chesterton Company designed the first <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> that fit pumps with varying stuffing box bore sizes and gland bolt patterns. To accomplish this the seal utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and slotted bolt holes. This [...] "generic" [...] <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in a <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping the seal's hardware (gland, sleeve, bolts).Cartridge seals can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 17 Since the {{introduction}} of noncontacting, gas lubricated, dual pressurized mechanical seals for process pumps over five years ago, and they have primarily been applied to ANSI pumps and other applications where the barrier pressure was below 300 psig. This pressure limit was not due to a limitation in material strength or face pattern technology as noncontacting seals have been applied in compressors at pressures well above this. The challenge came in fitting a dual pressurized <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> into the limited size seal cavity available in most process pumps. The radial and axial dimensions of a pump seal chamber limit {{the size and shape}} of the seal faces as well as the supporting hardware needed to make a convenient <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> design. A pressure responsive primary sealing ring geometry has been developed to allow a dual pressurized sealing arrangement to routinely handle pressures up to 600 psig. This pressure capability enables the dual pressurized gas seal to be utilized in applications generally found in the API market where contacting liquid lubricated seals are commonly used options. Discussed herein are the design, theoretical results obtained through the use of finite element analysis modelling and test results. Also discussed are the results of a modified API 682 qualification test and details of field installations...|$|E
40|$|Remotely {{operated}} vehicles (ROVs) {{are used}} for an increasing amount of underwater applications, ranging from being hobby-related to having military and scientific interests. ROVs may incorporate automatic control strategies, making them capable of carrying out complex missions single-handedly, in a safe and efficient manner. This master's thesis describes {{the development and implementation}} of several systems and functionalities for a Videoray Pro 4 ROV. In the thesis, "Videoray Pro 4 ROV", "Videoray ROV", "the ROV" and the like may all be used interchangeable, and it should be clear from the text what it refers to. The most significant scientific contribution made by this master's thesis is the presentation of experimental testing of successful underwater path-following for a Videoray Pro 4 ROV. The methodology is based on a set of predefined waypoints in 3 -D space, and generates paths between each consecutive waypoint location. The ROV uses a technique called lookahead-based line-of-sight steering to follow the path segments and traverse the waypoints. When the distance to the current waypoint is within some radius of acceptance, a switching controller will command the ROV to follow the path leading to the next waypoint location. The force produced by the propellers can easily be controlled with a Dualshock 3 hand-held controller, i. e., the user interaction unit. Occasionally, there are problems with the hand-held controller freezing for about three seconds, due to a problem with the software managing this system. The issue seems to occur when the buffer storing the joystick input commands is filled up faster than it is being read. If the buffer is full, it will initialize a process that forces it to empty completely. The controller will then stop taking input, and will freeze at the final command received. This means that the thrusters will freeze at the last command received for about three seconds as well. When the thrusters freeze, if the previous command given was " 0 ", the ROV will simply stand still. However, if the command was, say, "give 30 % force in surge", the thrusters will give 30 % thrust for about three seconds. This may have hazardous consequences to the ROV and nearby equipment. Attempts have been made to change the buffer size, but without luck. It is difficult to make the ROV move with a very low velocity, due to physical limitations in the thruster system. In the later stages of the experimental work, the cause of the restrictions on the thrusters was identified. One of the cartridge seals has less oil than what is needed to properly lubricate the propeller shaft, meaning that the thrusters cannot produce forces below certain limits. The physical explanation to this is that the propeller is unable to overcome the static friction force in the shaft. Much oil is still left in the port-thruster <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal,</b> but this is not the case for the starboard thruster. An air-bubble indicates how much oil is left, and when the air bubble is 3 / 4 full, the <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> should be replaced. Not only does this capsule ensure proper lubrication of the propeller shaft, but it also keeps water out of the pressure hull and prevents oxidation. The starboard <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> has an air bubble that stretches throughout the whole capsule, meaning that it should have been replaced a while ago. The Videoray ROV therefore experience difficulties when controlling the heading, and is bound to have a velocity greater than desired in order to move forward. This forces the ROV to move slightly beyond the desired location. The magnitude of this overshoot depends on the radius of acceptance and the ROV's velocity at the waypoint. Using a radius of acceptance equal to 10 cm, the ROV will move past the waypoint with about 5 - 10 cm. Replacing the existing <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> with a new one will allow the ROV to move at lower speeds, implying better path-following performance. The Qualisys Motion Tracking system has been used to receive position and orientation data for the ROV. This system captures a set of markers using optical tracking technology. Markers are attached to a rig, which is fastened to ROV's bottom side. A lot of time and experimental work was dedicated to make rig, markers and Qualisys work together to receive measurements consistently. Difficulties were experienced with receiving position data for an area large enough to perform path-following. Eventually, it was concluded that improvements had to be made for the rig. Extending arms were created and attached to the rig. In addition to adjusting the camera settings and turning off ceiling light to reduce light reflection, acceptable response from the Qualisys camera system was achieved. Position and orientation data could now be extracted at a reliable rate, but random data drop-outs for tenths of a second still occurred. The data loss that lasts for shorter durations than a second are handled by a simple algorithm, which uses the previously measured position data directly. In the beginning of the thesis work, a lateral thruster was mounted on the ROV, and code was developed to make this thruster work. Unfortunately, it communicated in a different manner than the other thrusters, with a method called round-robin or 1 / 2 duplex. Lacking documentation and difficulties communicating with the manufacturers of this thruster prolonged simultaneous control of all thrusters. Contact was made with Andrew Goldstein, Director of Software Engineering, Videoray LCC, in the beginning of January. In the later stages of the thesis work, Andrew found the time to help out with the documentation, and all the thrusters can now be controlled in a satisfactory manner. Therefore, future work with the Videoray ROV can benefit from a fully actuated underwater vehicle. Along with the successful implementation of waypoint guidance and path-following, the ROV may in the future be used to carry out a great variety of underwater control objectives...|$|E

The carbine used a special brass cartridge, also invented by Burnside. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block and allowed the user to insert a cartridge. When the trigger was pulled, the hammer struck a percussion cap and caused a spark; {{a hole in the}} base of the cartridge exposed the black powder to this spark.

40|$|Sealing of a {{microfluidic}} cartridge is a challenge, {{because the}} cartridge commonly contains heat-sensitive biomolecules that {{must also be}} protected from contamination. In addition, the objective is usually to obtain a sealing method suitable for mass production. Laser welding is a rapid technique that can be accomplished with low unit costs. Even though the technique has been widely adopted in industry, the literature on its use in microfluidic applications is not large. This paper {{is the first to}} report the effects of laser welding on the performance of the heterogeneous immunoassay in a polystyrene microfluidic cartridge in which biomolecules are immobilized into the reaction surface of the <b>cartridge</b> before <b>sealing.</b> The paper compares the immunoassay performance of microfluidic <b>cartridges</b> that are <b>sealed</b> either with an adhesive tape or by use of laser transmission welding. The model analyte used is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The results show that the concentration curves in the laser-welded cartridges are very close to the curves in the taped cartridges. This indicates, first, that laser welding does not cause any significant reduction in immunoassay performance, and second, that the polystyrene cover does not have significant effect on the signal levels. Interestingly, the coefficients of variance between parallel samples were lower in the laser-welded cartridges than in the taped cartridges...|$|R

5000|$|When {{the firing}} pin in a firearm strikes the primer, it ignites the powder inside the case, {{creating}} an explosion that generates {{a large amount of}} pressure, often exceeding 50,000 PSI. [...] This pressure in turn pushes the bullet out of the case mouth and into the barrel. During this explosion, the brass walls of the <b>cartridge</b> expand and <b>seal</b> against the inner walls of the chamber. This expansion is what creates chamber pressure, or the amount of force applied {{to the inside of the}} chamber by the case.

50|$|Another {{important}} function {{provided by the}} <b>cartridge</b> is to <b>seal</b> {{the rear of the}} chamber.

Without the case to provide this seal, the firearm design must account for this and provide a means of sealing the rear of the chamber.

40|$|Lecturepg. 11 A {{mechanical}} seal improvement program was initiated {{at a major}} oil refinery. The program was intended to improve seal reliability, reduce emissions, improve safety, and reduce costs. A partnership agreement was reached between the refinery and a major {{mechanical seal}} manufacturer. In preparation for the program, extensive research was conducted {{to ensure that all}} relevant information was readily available. A computer database was set up to organize the information and document changes as they were implemented. A document was generated detailing preferred seal designs and piping plans for various classifications of operating conditions, based on past experience and established engineering principle. The actual program focused on several areas. All mechanical seal failures were closely investigated {{in order to determine the}} root cause of failure and to make recommendations for changes that would improve seal reliability. Additionally, a list was generated of the pumps with the worst history of seal reliability. At least two of these ?worst seals? were addressed each month in an attempt to identify and correct the cause of premature failure. Pumps that were determined to be current or future environmental emissions problem were addressed at the rate of at least two per month in a similar fashion. As much as possible, all seal designs were standardized such that each seal was capable of being installed in the greatest number of pumps possible. In conjunction with this standardization, an attempt was made to identify and eliminate obsolete warehouse stock items. Additional training was provided to mechanics and unit operators to ensure that seals were being installed and operated properly. Over the course of 32 months, 191 pumps out of a population of over 12000 were converted to cartridges. During the same period of time, the seal mean time between failures for the entire population increased by 54 percent, and the average monthly maintenance cost associated with mechanical seal failures decreased by 17 percent. In addition, due to standardization and consolidation efforts, the net value of warehouse stock of seals and seal parts was reduced by 11 percent and the number of warehouse stock items was reduced by 34 percent. Several important conclusions were reached as a result of the success of the program. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>seals,</b> when properly applied, have an inherent advantage over noncartridge designs in terms of reliability and ease of installation.

Either arrangement makes servicing the bottom bracket a simple matter of removing the old cartridge from the bottom bracket shell, and installing a new one in its place. Cartridge bottom brackets generally have seals to prevent the ingress of water and dirt.

5000|$|While {{much less}} common than {{revolver}} speedloaders, speedloaders for tubular magazines, called quickloaders, {{have been around}} for many years and offer many of the same quick reloading ability benefits. The simplest quickloader of this type is the one used for rimfire rifles with front loading tubular magazines. In this case, the quickloader is simply a tube that contains a magazine-capacity number of <b>cartridges,</b> with a <b>seal</b> at one end and a gate at the other. To load the magazine, the follower is removed, the rifle is pointed upwards, the tube is placed over the end of the magazine, and the gate is opened. Gravity then pulls the cartridges from the quickloader into the magazine, the quickloader is set aside, and the follower is replaced. Any length of tubing or pipe of the right diameter can be used in this way, with a simple pin through the middle serving as a gate. Commercial rimfire quickloaders often have multiple tubes joined together in parallel, with a single rotating gate. This allows multiple reloads to be carried, with reloading accomplished by simply rotating the gate in line with the next full tube of ammunition.|$|R

The first run of the seals on the test stand seemed successful, until the disassembly of the unit revealed the faces were severely overheated and heat checked. The face design was changed and the second test was successful. A major concern was to maintain a low seal leakage rate, so this was measured and was within the specified range. However, the third test resulted in a catastrophic failure of the rotating faces and collateral damage to the entire <b>seal</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Detailed investigation of the failure revealed several interesting problem areas. All of these were addressed in a new design which was implemented, built, and shipped in only one week! The fourth test was successful, but still showed a problem in which the very high velocity oil in the seal chamber was able to dislodge the stationary face retaining ring. A solution to this final problem was implemented and tested successfully. At {{the time of this}} abstract, the seals appear to be successful. Both plants (all six machines) have been placed on line successfully. Two seals experienced damage in the field due to problems with the lube oil filter housings. These problems will be discussed during the presentation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have greatly increased both {{the speed and}} throughput of genome and transcriptome sequencing. The pace of sequencing has further increased with target-enrichment and library barcoding techniques that allow multiplexing of sequencing runs. However, current manual methods for creating libraries do not scale well, limiting the practical investigation {{of large numbers of}} samples. To ease the library-creation bottleneck, we describe here a set of protocols, robotics scripts, bulk reagents and instrumentation developed to automate the production of up to 96 DNA fragment sequencing libraries at once. Current protocols for creating sequencing libraries are lengthy, laborious, and not amenable to automation. We describe here new magnetic bead based methods that produce libraries with yield, purity, and size-selection comparable or superior to current column and gel-based protocols. Using these bead-based methods we developed a unique combination of optimized adaptor concentrations and clean-up techniques which increase the yield of libraries from small amounts of DNA by several fold. We also describe robotic scripts for producing 1 – 96 libraries simultaneously on two commonly used robotic platforms. These protocols accept 10 – 8000 ng of sheared DNA, calculate and dilute barcode adaptors for each library as necessary, automate all intermediate processing steps, and deliver purified libraries ready for amplification off-instrument. An additional script for post-PCR purification of the libraries is also provided. We further describe the Library Builder™ System, comprising a bench top device and kits of plastic tips, tubes and <b>sealed</b> <b>cartridges</b> prefilled with reagents necessary for producing 1 to 13 DNA fragment libraries either with or without size selection. Our analysis of sequencing data shows that libraries produced by all of the above methods are free of excess adaptors which interfere with quantitation, are unbiased, of high complexity, and free from cross-contamination. The protocols herein are provided to the community for use or customization...|$|R
5000|$|The same {{principles}} apply to artillery ammunition; guns are traditionally categorized (in English-speaking countries) as [...] "BL" [...] and [...] "QF" [...] guns, or [...] "Breechloading" [...] and [...] "Quick firing" [...] guns. [...] "BL" [...] guns are the older style, and typically use propellant {{stored in a}} number of fabric bags, the number of which can be adjusted to vary the range in some cases, as well as a separate shell that is rammed before the powder charge is placed into the breech. Large-caliber naval guns are traditionally of the [...] "BL" [...] type. Lacking a <b>cartridge</b> case to <b>seal</b> the breech, these guns require a complex and strong breech mechanism to safely seal the breech during firing. [...] "QF" [...] guns were a later development, usually of small to medium caliber, and came about from the need for rapid firing guns to counter torpedo boats and other small, nimble threats. A QF gun fires metallic-cased ammunition, generally with the shell fixed to it, as a single unit, just like a firearm cartridge. This allows a simpler breech mechanism, such as a sliding block breech, which when coupled with the easier ammunition handling and ramming procedures, allows a much higher rate of fire. Larger guns are most often BL guns, because the ammunition is so large and heavy, that even adding a metallic cartridge case would add a great deal of weight and make handling more difficult, even if you still loaded the shell and propellant separately. There have been exceptions, however; some German naval guns during WWII used fabric powder bags with just thin brass base section, to provide obturation to the breech without adding too much weight, similar to a modern plastic shotshell with a [...] "low-brass" [...] base for sealing and extraction.|$|R
