Tip length of up to several microns, tip diameters between 100 and 400 nm and cone half- angles of 3 degree - 50 degree are achieved with typical radii of curvature between 20 and 40 nm. The influence of the major deposition parameters, i. e. electron energy, beam current, deposition time and working distance on the growth rate and shape (length, cone angle and <b>cone</b> <b>length)</b> of the tip, are investigated systematically. It is found that increasing beam current leads to a decrease in length growth probably due to enhanced thermal desorption of adsorbates and reduced sticking coefficients.

40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, <b>cone</b> <b>length</b> and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing <b>cone</b> <b>length</b> increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|E

Wide variations were observed in cone weight (28. 16 - 46. 0 g), number of seeds/cone (41. 6 - 90. 6) and 1000 seed weight (42. 0 - 67. 0 g). Genetic coefficient of variation, phenotypic coefficient of variation, heritability estimates and genetic advance were higher for <b>cone</b> <b>length,</b> cone width, cone weight, seed length and seed thickness. Genotypic correlation in all the traits was greater than the phenotypic correlation.

Examples of specialized pre-dispersal seed predators adapted to feeding on closed cones include vertebrate species like Crossbills, Squirrels, Nutcrackers and Woodpeckers. Seed predation selects against certain phenotypic features of cones and favors another phenotypic features. In this study, we document preferences of the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) for specific traits in the cones of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). We found that the Great Spotted Woodpecker prefers to feed on medium sized Norway spruce cones. The results suggest a disruptive selection that favors the extreme <b>cone</b> <b>lengths</b> in Norway spruce. In Scots pine, the woodpeckers avoided cones with large apophyses. Further, the selectivity for the specific characteristics of the cones is probably related to {{the configuration of the}} anvil, a place at which woodpeckers extract seeds from the cones.

40|$|ABSTRACT In the teleost retina, the photoreceptors and retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) undergo extensive movements (called retinomotor movements) in response to changes in light conditions and to an endogenous circadian rhythm. Photoreceptor movements serve to reposition the light-receptive outer segments and are effected by changes in inner segment length. Melanin granule movements within the RPE cells provide a movable melanin screen for rod outer segments. In the dark (night), cones elongate, rods contract, and pigment granules aggregate {{to the base of}} the RPE cell; in the light (day), these movements are reversed. We report here that treatments that elevate cytoplasmic cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate (CAMP) provoke retinomotor movements characteristic of nighttime dark adapation, even in bright light at midday. To illustrate this response, we present a quantitative description of the effects of cyclic nucleotides on <b>cone</b> <b>length</b> in the green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Cone elongation is induced when light-adapted retinas are exposed to exogenous CAMP analogues accompanied by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (either by intraocular injection or in retinal organ culture). Cone movement is not affected by cyclic GMP analogues. Dose-response studies indicate that the extent, but not the rate, of cone elongation is proportional to the concentration of exogenous CAMP and analogue presented. As has been reported for other species, we find that levels of CAMP are significantly higher in dark- than in light-adapted green sunfish retinas. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that CAMP plays a role in the light and circadian regulation of teleost <b>cone</b> <b>length.</b> ...|$|E

Cone morphology also changes—small, immature cones have a closed structure of imbricate scales forming a dense shell, resulting in higher bulk density.

These changes in cone morphology alter cone surface area to volume ratio, an important determinant of fuel combustion (van Wagtendonk 2006) for which our cone bulk density measurements serve as a proxy.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study conducted to determine the relative role of genotypic and environmental control over characters of cone morphology and seed weight in black spruce (Picea mariana (MILL.) B. S. P.) A three-stage cluster sampling scheme was adopted with the sampling stages of populations, trees within populations and cones within trees. Nine characters of cone morphology were measured on each cone and mean 1, 000 -seed weight was determined for each tree. Statistical analyses comprised (1) calculation of popula­ tion {{means and standard deviations for}} each character, (2) cone length-cone diameter correlations at the populations and tree levels, (3) hierarchical analyses of variance and (4) comparison of the cone length-cone diameter correlations with similar values obtained six years earlier. Genetic ana­ lyses consisted of (1) calculation of repeatibility with stand­ ard error and confidence limits for each character at the population level as estimates of heritability; and (2) multiple regression analysis for each character. The latter was con­ ducted using the stepwise zig-zag procedure with cone character as the dependent variable and 12 environmental factors together with their squares and first order inter­ actions as independent variables to identify the subset which contributes most to the variation in the character. Though the means and repeatabilities of all characters vary with populations, no geographic trends can be dis­ cerned. Repeatability values have been shown to be good estimates of heritability. All characters are under statisti­ cally significant genotypic as well as environmental con­ trol and the most important subset of the latter has been identified. <b>Cone</b> <b>length,</b> diameter, and oven dry weight as well as dimensions of the middle scale are under strong, and length and width of the base and tip scale, under weak genotypic control.
