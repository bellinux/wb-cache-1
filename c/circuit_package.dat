50|$|The {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> <b>package</b> {{is responsible}} for keeping the chip safe from all sorts of potential damage. The package must resist physical breakage, provide an airtight seal to keep out moisture, and also provide effective heat dissipation away from the chip. At the same time, it must have effective means of connecting to a PCB, which can change drastically depending on the package type. The materials used for {{the body of the}} package are typically either plastic (thermoset or thermoplastic) or ceramic.

Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size. Sector sizes were set as powers of two (most common 512 bytes or 4096 bytes) for convenience in processing. It was a natural extension to give the capacity of a disk drive in multiples of the sector size, giving a mix of decimal and binary multiples when expressing total disk capacity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} integrated <b>circuits</b> were <b>packaged</b> in ceramic flat packs, which {{continued to}} be used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years. Commercial <b>circuit</b> <b>packaging</b> quickly moved to the dual in-line package (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to pin grid array (PGA) and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages. Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the small-outline integrated <b>circuit</b> (SOIC) <b>package</b> - a carrier which occupies an area about 30-50% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner.

5000|$|Amplifiers {{operate in}} the active region, where both device current and voltage are non-zero. Consequently power is {{continually}} dissipated and its design {{is dominated by the}} need to remove excess heat from the semiconductor device. Power amplifier devices can often be recognized by the heat sink used to mount the devices. Multiple types of power semiconductor amplifier device exist, such as the bipolar junction transistor, the vertical MOS field effect transistor, and others. Power levels for individual amplifier devices range up to hundreds of watts, and frequency limits range up to the lower microwave bands. A complete audio power amplifier, with two channels and a power rating on the order of tens of watts, can be put into a small integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>package,</b> needing only a few external passive components to function. Another important application for active-mode amplifiers is in linear regulated power supplies, when an amplifier device is used as a voltage regulator to maintain load voltage at a desired setting. While such a power supply may be less energy efficient than a switched mode power supply, the simplicity of application makes them popular, especially in current ranges up to about one amp.|$|E

40|$|Market {{demand for}} thin, small and light {{electronic}} packaging {{is on the}} increase in recent years. This is primarily driven by space limitation in portable computing and consumer products. Fine pitch ball grid array (fpBGA™) offers competitive alternative in package miniaturization to true chip scale packaging to meet such demands. This paper outlines encapsulation technique selection, characterization and reliability for fpBGA™. Both transfer molding and liquid encapsulation techniques were evaluated. Transfer molding technique was selected due to better encapsulation thickness control and lower array warpage. Mold simulation followed by actual mold process characterization was performed. Package reliability equivalent to or surpassed existing PBGA was achieved. The reliability results are outlined in this paper.
