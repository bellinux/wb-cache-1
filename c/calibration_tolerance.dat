50|$|Maintaining a 4:1 {{accuracy}} ratio {{with modern}} equipment is difficult. The test equipment being calibrated {{can be just}} as accurate as the working standard. If the accuracy ratio is less than 4:1, then the <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be reduced to compensate. When 1:1 is reached, only an exact match between the standard and the device being calibrated is a completely correct calibration. Another common method for dealing with this capability mismatch is to reduce the accuracy of the device being calibrated.|$|E
50|$|For example, a gage with 3% manufacturer-stated {{accuracy}} can {{be changed}} to 4% so that a 1% accuracy standard can be used at 4:1. If the gage is used in an application requiring 16% accuracy, having the gage accuracy reduced to 4% will not affect {{the accuracy of the}} final measurements. This is called a limited calibration. But if the final measurement requires 10% accuracy, then the 3% gage never can be better than 3.3:1. Then perhaps adjusting the <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the gage would be a better solution. If the calibration is performed at 100 units, the 1% standard would actually be anywhere between 99 and 101 units. The acceptable values of calibrations where the test equipment is at the 4:1 ratio would be 96 to 104 units, inclusive. Changing the acceptable range to 97 to 103 units would remove the potential contribution of all of the standards and preserve a 3.3:1 ratio. Continuing, a further change to the acceptable range to 98 to 102 restores more than a 4:1 final ratio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we examine}} the problem of {{extrinsic}} calibration of multiple LIDARs on a mobile vehicle platform. To achieve fully automated and on-line calibration, the original non-linear calibration model is reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP). This provides an advantage over more standard linearized approaches in that a priori information such as a default LIDAR <b>calibration,</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerances,</b> etc., can be readily modeled. Furthermore, in contrast to general non-linear methods, the SOCP relaxation is convex, returns a global minimum, and can be solved very quickly using modern interior point methods (IPM). This enables the calibration to be estimated on-line for multiple LIDARs simultaneously. Experimental results are provided where the approach is used to successfully calibrate a pair of Sick LMS 291 -S 14 LIDARs mounted on a mobile vehicle platform. These showed the SOC...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of more {{sophisticated}} techniques for control of tokamak plasmas comes the requirement for increasingly more accurate models of plasma processes and tokamak systems. Development of accurate models for DIII-D power systems, vessel, and poloidal coils is already complete, while work continues in development of general plasma response modeling techniques. Increased accuracy in estimates of parameters to be controlled is also required. It is important to ensure that errors in supporting systems such as diagnostic and command circuits do not limit the accuracy of plasma parameter estimates or inhibit the ability to derive accurate plasma/tokamak system models. To address this issue, we have developed more formal power systems change control and power system/magnetic diagnostics calibration procedures. This paper discusses our approach to consolidating the tasks in these closely related areas. This includes, for example, defining criteria for when diagnostics should be re-calibrated along with required <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerances,</b> and implementing methods for tracking power systems hardware modifications and the resultant changes to control models...|$|R

The kinematic model of a 6 -DOF AACMM with DH method was established, and from the kinematic model the coordinate systems and joint structural parameters of the AACMM are obtained. The Jacobian matrix was deduced by differential transformation from the kinematic model of the AACMM, {{and according to the}} Jacobian matrix, the error transfer coefficients of the joint structural parameters were calculated.

40|$|Many big {{companies}} today have already solid Six Sigma infrastructures. However, {{all over the}} world SMEs are only now approaching the methodology. In this presentation we expose an industrial application of a Six Sigma Black Belt project. It shows how Six Sigma was introduced and successfully implemented in a Swedish small-medium sized company. The project was carried out within the Six Sigma Black Belt course run at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. This case study is included in the book “Statistical and Managerial Techniques for Six Sigma Methodology, Theory and Application” (Wiley, 2012). The company is Structo Hydraulics AB, a manufacturing firm, located in Storfors, which produces steel tubes, mainly for the hydraulic industry. The project focused on the improvement of the warehouse activities, specifically the cutting processes. A high yield is always desirable in an industrial process, maximizing the utilization of materials and reducing costs. This was the project main objective. The argumentations follow the DMAIC framework. The main finding was that the planning for cutting processes was mostly based on operators’ knowledge and it was not structured in the optimum way. Four main improvement recommendations were given concerning: maintenance, <b>calibration,</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis, tools for short and long term planning. The case ends with the implementation of the recommendations and a control plan designed for the future activities. General considerations concerning the implementation of Six Sigma in SMEs will be also provided...|$|E

5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high chroma levels can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerances</b> in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|R
40|$|Triggered {{by recent}} {{criticism}} from parties outside the clinical chemistry community on poor analytical {{accuracy of measurement}} procedures used for evaluating the calcium-parathyroid hormone-vitamin D axis, I argue, in this opinion paper, strongly in favor of prioritizing the establishment of accuracy. I make a proposal on how the clinical chemistry profession could tackle the challenges focused at the conceptual, technical, and organizational level. The profession should "rehearse'' the basic concepts of measurement, because {{they need to be}} understood before one can look for pragmatic solutions when a purist's approach cannot be realized in a foreseeable time. This is illustrated for the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). To solve problems encountered at the technical level of establishing reference measurement systems, in particular when this is not possible according to {{the point of view of}} purism, the profession should have the courage to agree on pragmatic solutions, without neglecting, however, the technical progress. This is exemplified by way of a solution for measurement of FT 4 in serum water and TSH. Because the technical question is also inseparably connected to the specification of the analytical quality required for measurements, I propose that the profession sets realistic specifications for <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerance,</b> limits for batch acceptance, linearity, etc. Last but not least, I call upon organizing and implementing the accuracy process with utmost care, i. e., in a concerted action with all parties involved in patient care. The driving force towards accuracy should come from the test developers, while the lead should be taken by the clinical chemistry community, itself being guided by the clinical professions...|$|E

40|$|Currently in the United States, {{periodic}} sensor recalibration {{is required}} for all safety-related sensors, typically occurring at every refueling outage, and it {{has emerged as a}} critical path item for shortening outage duration in some plants. Online monitoring can be employed to identify those sensors that require calibration, allowing for calibration of only those sensors that need it. International application of calibration monitoring, such as at the Sizewell B plant in United Kingdom, has shown that sensors may operate for eight years, or longer, within <b>calibration</b> <b>tolerances.</b> This issue is expected to also be important as the United States looks to the next generation of reactor designs (such as small modular reactors and advanced concepts), given the anticipated longer refueling cycles, proposed advanced sensors, and digital instrumentation and control systems. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted the general concept of online monitoring for sensor calibration monitoring in 2000, but no U. S. plants have been granted the necessary license amendment to apply it. This report presents a state-of-the-art assessment of online calibration monitoring in the nuclear power industry, including sensors, calibration practice, and online monitoring algorithms. This assessment identifies key research needs and gaps that prohibit integration of the NRC-approved online calibration monitoring system in the U. S. nuclear industry. Several needs are identified, including the quantification of uncertainty in online calibration assessment; accurate determination of calibration acceptance criteria and quantification of the effect of acceptance criteria variability on system performance; and assessment of the feasibility of using virtual sensor estimates to replace identified faulty sensors in order to extend operation to the next convenient maintenance opportunity. Understanding the degradation of sensors and the impact of this degradation on signals is key to developing technical basis to support acceptance criteria and set point decisions, particularly for advanced sensors which do not yet have a cumulative history of operating performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Goldmann {{applanation}} tonometer (GAT) is {{the current}} Gold standard tonometer. However, its calibration error is common and can go unnoticed in clinics. Its company repair has limitations. The purpose of this report is to describe a self-taught technique of rectifying calibration error of GAT. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine slit-lamp-mounted Haag-Streit Goldmann tonometers (Model AT 900 C/M; Haag-Streit, Switzerland) were included in this cross-sectional interventional pilot study. The technique of rectification of calibration error of the tonometer involved cleaning and lubrication of the instrument followed by alignment of weights when lubrication alone didn′t suffice. We followed the South East Asia Glaucoma Interest Group′s definition of <b>calibration</b> error <b>tolerance</b> (acceptable GAT <b>calibration</b> error within ± 2, ± 3 and ± 4 mm Hg at the 0, 20 and 60 -mm Hg testing levels, respectively). Results: Twelve out of 29 (41. 3 %) GATs were out of calibration. The range {{of positive and negative}} calibration error at the clinically most important 20 -mm Hg testing level was 0. 5 to 20 mm Hg and - 0. 5 to - 18 mm Hg, respectively. Cleaning and lubrication alone sufficed to rectify calibration error of 11 (91. 6 %) faulty instruments. Only one (8. 3 %) faulty GAT required alignment of the counter-weight. Conclusions: Rectification of calibration error of GAT is possible in-house. Cleaning and lubrication of GAT can be carried out even by eye care professionals and may suffice to rectify calibration error in the majority of faulty instruments. Such an exercise may drastically reduce the downtime of the Gold standard tonometer...|$|R
40|$|Wire-bond {{lift-off}} and Solder fatigue are degradation {{mechanisms that}} dominate the lifetime of power semiconductor packages. Although their lifetime is commonly estimated at the design stage, based on mission profiles and Physics-of-Failure models, there are many uncertainties associated with such lifetime estimates, emerging, for example, from model <b>calibration</b> errors, manufacturing <b>tolerances,</b> etc. These uncertainties, combined with the diverse working environments of power semiconductor packages result in inaccurate lifetime estimates. This paper presents an approach for estimating the extent of degradation in power semiconductor packages based on online monitoring of key parameters of the semiconductor, namely, the thermal resistance Rthja and the electrical resistance RCE. Using these two parameters, solder fatigue and wire-bond lift-off can be detected during normal converter operation. In order to estimate these two parameters, two techniques are introduced: a residual obtained from a Kalman filter which estimates {{the change in the}} thermal resistance Rthja and a Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) algorithm which is used to estimate the electrical resistance. Both methods are implemented online and validated experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Automated close-range photogrammetric network {{orientation}} {{has traditionally}} {{been associated with the}} use of coded targets in the object space to allow for an initial relative orientation (RO) and subsequent spatial resection of the images. Over the past decade, automated orientation via feature-based matching (FBM) techniques has attracted renewed research attention in both the photogrammetry and computer vision (CV) communities. This is largely due to advances made towards the goal of automated relative orientation of multi-image networks covering untargetted (markerless) objects. There are now a number of CV-based algorithms, with accompanying open-source software, that can achieve multi-image orientation within narrow-baseline networks. From a photogrammetric standpoint, the results are typically disappointing as the metric integrity of the resulting models is generally poor, or even unknown, while the number of outliers within the image matching and triangulation is large, and generally too large to allow relative orientation (RO) via the commonly used coplanarity equations. On the other hand, there are few examples within the photogrammetric research field of automated markerless camera <b>calibration</b> to metric <b>tolerances,</b> and these too are restricted to narrow-baseline, low-convergence imaging geometry. The objective addressed in this paper is markerless automatic multi-image orientation, maintaining metric integrity, within networks that incorporate wide-baseline imagery. By wide-baseline we imply convergent multi-image configurations with convergence angles of up to around 90 °. An associated aim is provision of a fast, fully automated process, which can be performed without user intervention. For this purpose, various algorithms require optimisation to allow parallel processing utilising multiple PC cores and graphics processing units (GPUs) ...|$|R
