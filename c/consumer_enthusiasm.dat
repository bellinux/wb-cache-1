50|$|There are {{currently}} over 200 microbreweries in Japan, although {{many in this}} number are financially tied to larger sake producers, restaurant chains, resort hotels or similar. Microbreweries in Japan produce various styles of beer including ales, IPAs, stout, pilsner, weissbier, kölsch, fruit beers and others. After the relaxation of the Liquor Tax Law in 1994, there was an initial boom in microbrewing, but the quality of regional microbrews were often mixed and initial <b>consumer</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> leveled off. The popularity of low-cost happoshu (low-malt beer), compared to the high cost microbrews, forced a number of early microbreweries out of business. The dominance of the major industrial brewers and the relative high cost and low volume involved in producing micros led to their only being known to {{a small number of}} beer enthusiasts.|$|E

40|$|Purpose It is {{generally}} accepted that {{the launch of}} a new product is critical to its success. Key to this is that manufacturers understand the market segment which is targeted for the launch. However, recent research and criticism suggest that modern segmentation strategies, aligning products with lifecycle typologies do not work. It {{is no longer possible}} to align consumers and products into neat and stable lifecycle segments. It is suggested that more importance should be attached to products having a familiarity fit with consumers ? what they know and expect from a particular product. These views are moderated by a <b>consumer's</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> or involvement with the product as well as their level of expertise in understanding complex products. This paper aims to look at these issues. Design/methodology/approach This research looks at consumer perceptions to the changes to two automotive models launched by one of the major manufacturers at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Germany, held in September 2005, to discover which changes had the most appeal and to identify correlations with consumer lifecycles. Findings Results revealed that consumer lifecycles had no correlation with any of the data, whereas familiarity, expertise and product involvement will provide manufacturers with more accurate segmentation tools in the launch and marketing of new automotive products. Practical implications These findings suggest that a customer's expertise, product involvement and familiarity with the product are likely to provide more appropriate market segmentation tools. Originality/value This paper reveals useful information on consumer lifestyles and market segmentation tools. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the expectations of}} a wide range of stakeholders for environmental assurance in the pastoral industries and agriculture generally. Stakeholders consulted were domestic consumers, rangeland graziers, members of environmental groups, companies within meat and wool supply chains, and agricultural industry, environmental and consumer groups. Most stakeholders were in favour of the application of environmental assurance to agriculture, although supply chains and <b>consumers</b> had less <b>enthusiasm</b> for this than environmental and consumer groups. General public good benefits were more important to environmental and consumer groups, while private benefits were more important to consumers and supply chains. The 'ideal' form of environmental assurance appears to be a management system that provides for continuous improvement in environmental, quality and food safety outcomes, combined with elements of ISO 14024 eco-labelling such as life-cycle assessment, environmental performance criteria, third-party certification, labelling and multi-stakeholder involvement. However, market failure prevents this from being implemented and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. In the short term, members of supply chains (the people that must implement and fund environmental assurance) want this to be kept simple and low cost, to be built into their existing industry standards and to add value to their businesses. As a starting point, several agricultural industry organisations favour the use of a basic management system, combining continuous improvement, risk assessment and industry best management practice programs, which can be built on over time to meet regulator, market and community expectations...|$|R

The contribution of the industry to the economy was estimated at R 29. 2 billion in 2008. Golfers in South Africa spent R 1. 7 billion on golf club brands in 2008. The competition in the {{industry has}} become fierce and golf club brand marketers need to focus on how to grow this spend and increase their market share and one way of doing this is to build a strong brand. This study focuses primarily on one of the building blocks of a brand, namely brand resonance. Brand resonance refers to the relationship between the brand and <b>consumers,</b> including the <b>enthusiasm</b> these <b>consumers</b> have to purchase and recommend the brand to others. The purpose for this study is to determine the brand resonance among golfers with respect to golf club brands. The study furthermore focuses on the four categories of brand resonance namely behavioural loyalty, attitudinal attachment, sense of community and active engagement. Information regarding the brand resonance among golfers with respect to golf club brands was gathered from 200 golfers who play golf at two golf clubs, using a self-administered questionnaire. The sampling units (golf clubs) were selected based on the judgement of the researcher and the sampling elements (golf players) were selected based on convenience sampling. The research study was descriptive in nature and quantitative methods were used to execute the empirical part of the research. The findings indicated that the majority of respondents play with TaylorMade golf clubs, and have been playing golf for five years or longer, have a handicap of between 11 and 15, and play golf on a weekly basis. Golfers do perceive a significant difference in the importance of the four categories of brand resonance with respect to golf club brands. Behavioural loyalty and attitudinal attachment realised the highest mean score, followed by active engagement and sense of community.

40|$|Taking as {{its point}} of {{departure}} the historical processes of mediatization and reflexive modernization, this dissertation examines the circuits of promotion, expertise, and meaning that mutually constitute the production and consumption of the smartphone. Through {{a focus on the}} online media practices of manufacturers, technology publishers, and consumers, the research maps the sociocultural mediation of this ubiquitous communication technology and considers the material aspects of this mediation in light of global environmental risk. As privileged media producers, manufacturers signify smartphones as revolutionary achievements of technoscience: powerful artefacts that expand user capacity for agency, enjoyment, and sociability. Within a context of networked individualism, smartphones are positioned as shape-shifting devices that may be continually adapted to fluid tastes, social settings, and evolving life scripts. Although technology obsolescence and production are primary contributors to overall environmental impact, manufacturers shift attention to e-waste disposal and consumer responsibility. In their role as observers of the consumer electronics industry, technology publishers expand manufacturer promotion in time and space. As technology experts, authors circulate a collective taste for novelty, distinction, and performance. While published articles may be understood as practical resources for consumers navigating a complex space of artefacts and promotion, this expertise excludes considerations of long-term ownership, repair, and the environmental aspects of technology consumption. This circuit of promotion and expertise provides a foundation for consumer sociability that both enlivens and undermines the activities of manufacturers and industry experts. While avid <b>consumers</b> express collective <b>enthusiasm</b> for new technologies, they are cynical towards promotion as a practice, question the predominant smartphone ideal, and attempt to influence manufacturer design strategies. This popular discourse broadens the scope of cultural resources available to users, but simultaneously reproduces dominant consumption norms that legitimize rapid technology obsolescence. These findings suggest that despite increased public sensitivity to global environmental risks, the production and consumption of new communication technologies represents a continuation of first modernity processes. The disconnection between general environmental risk awareness and its specific manifestation in everyday life points towards the need for an expanded popular expertise and green citizenship as a basis for democratic rationalization and governance of media technology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConcern {{about the}} limited natural {{resources}} of the planet and an interest in careful stewardship of those resources continue to influence the decisions of both firms and consumers. Firms are building environmentally friendly supply chains, including recycled material in their products, and developing manufacturing methods that avoid polluting their surrounding environments. Consumers' reactions to firms' investments have been mixed. While some <b>consumers</b> espouse <b>enthusiasm</b> for more environmentally-friendly offerings, a recent Gallup poll suggests that many stop short of actually purchasing such products (Dunlap 2010). Customers {{have been found to}} suffer from "green fatigue" (Platt and Retallack 2009), to be suspicious of "green washing" (www. greenwashingindex. com), and to be unwilling to pay extra for environmentally-conscious products (Bhattacharya and Sen 2004). However, a more fundamental question underlies these reactions: What makes a consumer perceive a product as green or not green to start with? Before a product's environmental friendliness can have any influence on a consumer's purchase decision, the consumer must see the product as green - or not. Consider a consumer looking at two brands of paper towels in a supermarket. The information provided indicates that the environmental savings achieved by including recycled material in both brands is exactly the same, but one brand includes recycled materials in the packaging of the towels, while one includes recycled materials in the towels themselves. Do consumers perceive these two products as equally green? Or consider two laptop computers, one with an environmentally friendly motherboard and the other with an environmental friendly power cord. The use of recycled materials in the two products saves the same amount of plastic material from entering landfills, but do consumers perceive a green peripheral element (the power cord) as contributing as much "greenness" to a product as a green component that is more essential to the product (the motherboard) ? In this research, we look at factors that influence a consumer's perception of the environmental friendliness or greenness of a product. We explore this from the perspective of centrality theory (Sloman, Love, and Ahn 1998) which states that certain features of a product are more central - more essential, more integral - to defining what a product (or natural object) is and to what category it belongs. One facet of centrality involves high- versus low-level construals (Trope, Liberman and Wakslak 2007) and so we examine the role construal plays in the consumer's evaluation process and the consumer's categorization of a product as green or not green. We also look at how different elements of a product are presented to the consumer (holistically or separately) and also examine where in the supply chain the "greenness" of a product occurs. We test the effect of these variables across multiple experiments that span four different product categories - mattresses, paper towels, laptop computers, and washing machines. The results of our four studies suggest that products with identical reductions in their environmental impact may have their environmental friendliness evaluated very differently by consumers depending on the centrality or non-centrality of the product features that are green. We find that differences in green perceptions between products with central or peripheral green attributes are attenuated when a high-level or distant construal is triggered. The implications of this for public policy makers and firms are potentially significant. From a public policy perspective, our results suggest that consumers' evaluation process of green claims may be influenced by factors which are not related to green outcomes. In our study, the green claims were very specific and clearly identical, yet the "peripheralness" or centrality of the green feature had a significant effect on the consumers' assessment of greenness. This suggests that consumers' ability to assess environmental impact is influenced by factors not related to environment outcomes. From the perspective of firms, they may wish to consider carefully their green investments and their communication of these efforts. If the same environmental impact can be achieved through both a central feature and a non-central feature, our findings suggest that for positive consumer evaluations, the investment is best made in the central feature. If that is not possible, then encouraging a more abstract construal may alter the consumer's processing and achieve positive results from an investment in a peripheral feature...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The rapid {{integration}} of genomics into clinical care, {{growing interest in}} offering genetic results to research participants, and <b>consumer</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for personalized genomics requires greater understanding of how individuals conceptualize and communicate about genetic information, preferences for genetic information, and individual genetic results. At stake are the potential {{benefits and harms of}} accurate communication versus miscommunication. Metaphors such as the "genome as a blueprint" have been well studied in public discourse as a vehicle for conceptualizing genetics; however, the applicability of these metaphors to the translation of personal genetic information is largely unknown. We performed a qualitative analysis of metaphorical language in 40 interviews and 13 focus groups in which participants (n= 109) were asked to discuss their preferences for and expectations about receiving genetic results from whole genome or exome sequencing. We identified several salient conceptual metaphors in which participants compared genetic information to physical objects such as tools, weapons, and goods in boxes. Dichotomies and tensions within these metaphors suggest the importance of agency and different loci of control. In some cases, genetic information empowered the individual to act (e. g., a weapon in their arsenal) while in other cases it overpowered them (e. g., they are bombarded by genetic information). Participants used metaphors such as storing results in a "lockbox" or unintentionally opening "Pandora's box" to describe the potential benefits and harms of incidental sequencing results. Metaphors comparing whole genome sequences to formal documents or reports (e. g., credit report) raised questions of authorship, ownership, and interpretability, and resonated with well-known genetics metaphors in the public domain (e. g., blueprint, recipe, book of life). These results have practical implications for understanding and perhaps influencing how research participants and patients perceive the desirability, utility, and actionability of genetic information. Our findings suggest that increased awareness of and attention to metaphorical language may serve to improve communication between stakeholders when discussing genetic information...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The 1990 {{contract}} requires general {{practitioners to}} offer all their patients aged 75 years and over an annual health check. Increasing importance is {{being placed on}} consumers' views of service provision. AIM. A study was undertaken in June 1992 to investigate elderly patients' views and experiences of the annual health check, and to compare these with the previously reported views of general practitioners and practice nurses who had also been surveyed {{as part of the}} study. METHOD. Twenty family health services authorities wrote to a sample of 1500 elderly patients asking if the patient's name could be passed to researchers. Patients who agreed were then interviewed. RESULTS. A total of 664 elderly patients (44 %) were interviewed. Only 64 % of respondents were aware of their entitlement to a health check. Vulnerable patients, such as those in poor health or who lived alone, were less likely to know about the health checks than other patients. Only 31 % of respondents thought they had had a health check. Of these, fewer than half recalled the doctor or nurse discussing the findings with them, although 80 % of doctors reported that they always or mostly discussed results with patients. Elderly patients were more likely to recall the physical aspects of the health check rather than discussion about particular health aspects. However, doctors and nurses felt that routine checks were useful for giving advice rather than detecting medical problems. Of those who had had a health check, 82 % reported no improvement in their health as a result, but 93 % thought that they were a good idea. Only 7 % of doctors thought they were of value, compared with the majority of nurses. CONCLUSION. It appeared that the inverse care law was operating, with those more in need of the service being less likely to have known about it. Discrepancies were found between general practitioners' and practice nurses' reports of service provision and those of elderly patients. Evidence about the cost-effectiveness of regular health checks may help the conflict between professional scepticism and <b>consumer</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for these assessments...|$|E

40|$|Prepaid cards, cash cards, {{electronic}} purses, {{smart cards}} these {{are but a}} few of the elements inthe revolution now taking place in monetary systems around the world. At that movement's heart is the emergence of a new value transfer system where alternative monies are offered toconsumers through the miracle of electronics. There are many stories in the business press about the general enthusiasm for these new forms of money. According to the hyperbole from marketing reps from this side of the financial community, currency and demand deposits soon will be endangered species. Consumer acceptance is alleged to be high, and cost efficiency associated with the new technology is expected to be substantial. Yet, as Wenninger and Laster (1995) suggest, "to succeed, an electronic purse system will need to offer enough features of value to its three constituencies consumers, merchants, and issuers to induce them to bear the cost. " Most arguments in favorof these media of exchange can be viewed as a reaction to the rising costs associated with current check clearing and on-line credit systems. Data are scare. However, the cost advantages to the banking system of a movement from paper check to debit cards is alleged to be in the range of 50 %. Off-line pre-paid cards are expected to reduce the cost of clearing transactions, handling cash and reducing fraud for merchants. To read the press, the consumer is equally enthusiastic. However, the economic rationale for this <b>consumer</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> is a bit unclear. Each application of the emerging electronic technology has been different in important ways. The universal receptivity to alternative monies may be more a good marketing ploy than good economics. To understand consumer reaction requires a careful analysis of the desirability of any one of these alternative technologies in terms of its impact on consumer cash management costs through changes in transaction patterns, average money holdings, and total transaction costs. The authors attempt this analysis by investigating the effect of variations in the number and type of monies on consumer transactions demand using a Baumol-Tobin type model of moneydemand. They investigate the behavior of a representative consumer facedwith a choice ofmonies with which to transact, and ask how variations in the characteristics of these monies will affect the consumer choice of transaction vehicle, transactions frequency, and average balance in various media. The results are surprising. Variations in the cost of transfer, interest rates, and the acceptabilityof alternative media have surprising effects on consumer choice. In general, the cost of using amedium of exchange determines whether it will be used and for which goods it will be traded. The choice of medium of exchange, then, has a direct effect on both the average holdings ofdifferent types of money and their transition frequencies. It suggests that efforts by banks to alter the costs of using a particular form of money may cause consumers to change their exchange behavior, shifting it sometimes rather dramatically. The authors demonstrate the impact of these results with an example of a stored value card, and its competitive position vis-a-vis the two most common media of exchange. This transfermedium offers some of the features of demand deposits such as ease of transfer and generalacceptability. At the same time, it avoids the fixed costs of a checking account while offering noreturn on average balances. The authors have observed that households tend to use the high-interest medium of exchange to buy the good that constitutes the larger share of its income. Given the relative rates of return on stored value cards and checking account balances, the former is unlikely to dislodge the use of checks for purchases. On the other hand, the stored value card represents a credible threat for cash transactions. Here, rates of return are both zero, although it can be argued that cash may have a negative return due to theft. Given their new ease of use, smart cards could also be competitive from a transfer fee perspective. In fact, given the lower cost of transfer into the card, it may dominate cash in the near future. While the foregoing results apply to the individual household, aggregate results often are moredifficult to prove. For example, an increase in the cost of obtaining a medium of exchange,reduces the number of households using the exchange, but raises average balances for thosehouseholds that continue to use it. Therefore, efforts by banks to lower the costs of using aparticular form of medium of exchange may well reduce the average holding of that medium. Also, interest rates generally have ambiguous effects on money holdings. Determining whetheran increase in a particular interest rate will raise or lower holdings of a particular form of money requires a case by case analysis, and the conclusions can change from one day to the next with changes in other parameters of concern to the household. The authors conclude that affecting monetary behavior is no simple matter. As providers ofdifferent monies move from experimentation to implementation, these results offer a warning. The choice of money or monies to be used for transactions purposes is a complex decision. Itdoes not lend itself to simple extrapolation from consumer surveys, and, in fact, may result insubstantially different outcomes than had been presumed. ...|$|E
