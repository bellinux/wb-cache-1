GaP layers were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on vicinal Si (001). The strong effect of the Si substrate <b>chemical</b> <b>preparation</b> is first demonstrated by studying structural properties of both Si homoepitaxial layer and GaP/Si heterostructure. It is then shown that choosing adequate <b>chemical</b> <b>preparation</b> conditions and subsequent III-V regrowth conditions enables the quasi-suppression of micro-twins in the epilayer. Finally, the abruptness of GaP/Si interface is found to be very sensitive to the Si <b>chemical</b> <b>preparation</b> and is improved by the use of a bistepped Si buffer prior to III-V overgrowth...|$|R
