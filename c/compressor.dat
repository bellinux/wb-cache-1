5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal <b>compressor</b> turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial <b>compressor</b> turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP <b>compressor</b> driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP <b>compressor</b> driven by a single-stage HP turbine.

50|$|Rotary-screw <b>compressors</b> {{tend to be}} {{compact and}} {{smoothly}} running with limited vibration, thus not requiring spring suspension. Many rotary-screw <b>compressors</b> are, however, mounted using rubber vibration-isolating mounts to absorb high-frequency vibrations, especially in rotary-screw <b>compressors</b> that operate at high rotational speeds. Rotary-screw <b>compressors</b> are produced in sizes that range in pumping speeds from 10 cubic feet per minute to several thousand CFM.

5|$|<b>Compressor</b> diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air <b>compressor</b> on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure <b>compressor)</b> evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the <b>compressor,</b> combustor and turbine sections.|$|E

5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure <b>compressor</b> blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure <b>compressor,</b> of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the high-pressure <b>compressor,</b> but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to <b>compressor</b> fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the <b>compressor,</b> reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E

An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the <b>compressor</b> stalls.|$|E
