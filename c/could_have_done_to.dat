25|$|On 13 October 2011, Dr. Andrew Reid, the Coroner of St. Pancras, {{announced}} that he would hold an inquest into Litvinenko's death, which would include the examination of all existing theories of the murder, including possible complicity of the Russian government. The inquest, held by Sir Robert Owen, a High Court judge acting as the coroner, originally scheduled to start on 1 May 2013, was subject to a series of pre-hearings: firstly, the coroner agreed that a group representing Russian state prosecutors could be accepted as a party to the inquest process; secondly, the British Government submitted a Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificate. Under Public Interest Immunity (PII) claims, the information at the disposal of the UK government relating to Russian state involvement, as well as how much British intelligence services <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent the death, would be excluded from the inquest.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} of the song was {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars, and was released February 5, 2013. The video portrays the taping of a TV special, in which Mars is playing a lonely balladeer on the ivories while {{sitting in front of}} a piano with sunglasses donned and a half-full glass of whiskey atop his instrument, wearing a suit with a carnation boutonnière, while he keeps reminding himself of what he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> keep his lover.

500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how." ...|$|E
500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} many of the councils were understaffed, underfunded, and poorly managed. The chief {{executive}} of Brent council said its social services department was [...] "seriously defective". The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate, that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that children in need were turned away. The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993. Haringey and Brent councils diverted £18.7 million and over £26 million, respectively, in the two years 1997/98 and 1998/99, from its social services department into services such as education, for other purposes; both underspent their budgets for children's services, totalling £28m, by more than £10m in 1998–99, causing a deteriorating of child protection services. The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign social workers to 109 children in May 1999, a short period before they took on Climbié's case. Again in January 2002, Haringey council failed to assign social workers to about 50 children. Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming that social workers who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses. Laming condemned the letter, saying [...] "I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence {{the way in which the}} inquiry is conducted." [...] Mary Richardson, the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000, had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which, according to the union UNISON, had [...] "virtually paralysed" [...] the child protection service. She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as [...] "potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people to whom we offer a service". Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum. She did, however, say in the inquiry that the blame lay on [...] "part of all of the line management responsibility". Gurbux Singh, the former chief executive of Haringey council (before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality), said that there was nothing he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent Climbié's death. Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter's willingness to accept responsibility, saying, [...] "that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root, is it not, of progress?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The third {{reason was}} the {{weakening}} North American economy. Productivity levels were falling throughout the United States and Canada during this period, and were likely worsened in Ontario and other jurisdictions {{by the recent}} passage of a Free Trade Accord involving the two countries. [...] While there was little that Peterson, or any other Ontario Premier, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent this downturn, it weakened his government's reputation for fiscal competence. [...] (Indeed, the government's projected surplus budget for 1990–91 ultimately yielded a deficit {{of at least three}} billion dollars.) ...|$|E

Near {{the end of the}} season, Cobb's Tigers had a long series against Jackson's Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly {{both on and off the}} field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried to say anything to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to [...] "fall off" [...] to a final average of [...]408, twelve points lower than Cobb's [...]420, a twentieth-century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with [...]424, the record since then except for Hugh Duffy's [...]438 in the nineteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|In 1949 Marcel Duchamp {{commented on}} Paul Klee: [...] "The first {{reaction}} {{in front of}} a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>to</b> try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [...] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became an other Klee." ...|$|E

Soon after this, they are joined by an , who orders them to leave the planet, warning that a Warp Storm- a great space-based storm that would make all travel impossible -is approaching the planet and will consume the planet in 3 days time. Toth orders a complete evacuation of the planet, but Gabriel refuses, stating his desire to investigate the possible threat of Chaos. Toth then implies that Gabriel's actions on Cyrene have clouded his judgement, making him [...] "see Chaos where it doesn't exist". On further investigation, it is revealed that the Eldar are also operating on the planet. The Blood Ravens find an altar dedicated to Chaos, confirming Gabriel's suspicions, and resolve to destroy the traitors, unknowing that Isador is already under the influence of Sindri Myr, the Chaos Sorcerer of the Alpha Legion.|$|E
