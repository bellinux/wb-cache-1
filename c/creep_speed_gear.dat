It is shown that use of the double-fed machine as the actuating motor in the <b>creeping</b> <b>speed</b> mode increases the working off accuracy of the motion law. A mathematical model of the double-fed machine to study various modes of the CNC machine including the <b>creeping</b> <b>speed</b> mode is developed. The method to estimate the load parameters of the double-fed machine is presented. Practical implication {{of the study is}} confirmed by the results obtained in the evaluation of the influence of load parameters on the dynamic indicators of actuating electromotor...|$|R

A growing number of high <b>speed</b> <b>gears</b> with ratings up to 70, 000 kW are already in service. For such gears, the failure mode of scoring can become the limiting constraint.

40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a conditioned short glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6 was studied {{and the effect of}} the cyclic frequency investigated. Load controlled fatigue tests were performed, and the strains and surface temperature of specimens were recorded continuously. The number of cycles to failure was found to be dependent upon cyclic creep rate, as is typical for short glass fiber reinforced polyamides in the conditioned state. A strong reduction of fatigue strength was observed for increasing cyclic load frequency. This was mainly related to the specimen temperature increase due to hysteretic self heating and its effect on the cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>speed.</b> A frequency superposition method is proposed, expressing the relationship between temperature rise, applied stress, and cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> in terms of a parameter derived from the Larson–Miller steady creep parameter...|$|R
50|$|From 1955 {{the little}} A106 started to {{accumulate}} {{a succession of}} victories, and various performance enhancing options were offered such as “Mille Miles (Mille Miglia) suspension” following A106 participation in the eponymous race. The Mille Miles specifications involve using four shock absorbers at the back, and was the suspension system later used for the Renault 8 Gordini. Also offered was a five <b>speed</b> manual <b>gear</b> box manufactured under license: a five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> box in a road car of this class was almost unheard of, and since the gearbox option alone came with a price tag sufficient to purchase 35% of a Renault 4CV, Alpine A106s incorporating the five <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> box option remained rare.

40|$|PaperPg. 157 - 163. The most {{effective}} methods for monitoring {{the health of}} high <b>speed</b> <b>gearing</b> is currently generating more interest and discussion than any other aspect of machinery health monitoring.

This paper describes the dynamics of high <b>speed</b> <b>gears</b> that apply to and influence health monitoring. Various types of monitoring systems that have been proposed and utilized are discussed, followed by the advantages and limitations of each system.
