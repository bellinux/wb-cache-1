5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a <b>chocolate</b> <b>cake</b> stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

40|$|Ranking {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{evaluation}} methods in deciding the best food that is available in today’s competitive market. However, ranking is not always a straight forward process especially when dealing with fuzzy linguistic of multi-attributes evaluation. This paper presents a method of ranking fuzzy numbers to ranking of four selected <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> according to five attributes. Data in the form of linguistic terms from a sensory experiment were collected from thirty judges in Terengganu. Judges evaluate the <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> according to five major sensory attributes, i. e. colour, sweetness, texture, humidity and flavour on a 5 -point linguistic terms. Sensory data were transformed into fuzzy numbers using linguistic values. Decisions are made based on the centroid point (x(A), y(A)), where x(A) and y(A) indicate the distance values from the centroid point to original point on horizontal axis and vertical axis for a fuzzy number. These points permit to characterise the evaluation behaviour of the attributes of <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes.</b> It is found that no single cake was dominating the first ranking in all the five attributes. The analyses of sensory evaluation using a method of ranking fuzzy numbers successfully ranked the <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> with multi-attributes...|$|R

25|$|Halloween cake is {{prepared}} with Halloween symbols and themes. It may be prepared with orange and black coloration in {{the cake and}} icing, because orange is a traditional color associated with Halloween, such as the color of pumpkins, which are used to create jack-o'-lanterns.

Carrot cakes are sometimes prepared as Halloween cakes, per their orange coloration.

25|$|Dahl also {{features}} in his books characters {{who are very}} fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins {{are a few of}} these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in James and the Giant Peach and the nasty farmer Boggis in Fantastic Mr Fox is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka's chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In Matilda, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic <b>chocolate</b> <b>cake</b> in front of the school. Featured in The Witches, Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in The BFG, the fox family in Fantastic Mr Fox and the trolls in The Minpins.|$|E
40|$|Karkade (Hibiscus sabdariffa) powder {{was used}} a crude fiber, calcium, and iron {{supplement}} in <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 % supplement levels based on wheat flour weight. Cakes {{were evaluated by}} baking tests. Karkade which was not pH-controlled, caused a real reduction in cake volume, cake specific volume, and cake crumb pH, which increased with increasing concentration of karkade. However, <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> containing 5 % karkade with the pH of cake batter is controlled to 7. 0 {{by the addition of}} soda just before making cakes were similar to the control cakes, containing wheat flour alone, in all aspects. In addition, the crude fiber, calcium, and iron contents in these cakes approximately increased 5, 4, and 2 fold respectively. Physical tests were used to study the effect of karkade on wheat flour properties. Karkade had a little effect on flour properties such as volume sedimentation, alkaline water retention capacity, and amylograph peak viscosity. The unsatisfactory use of karkade in <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> is attributable at least in part to organic acids in karkade which lower the pH value of cake crumb. With the pH value of cake crumb controlled to the optimum level, karkade powder at up to 5 % level of supplementation can be used in the production of <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes...</b>|$|R

50|$|A loosely related cake is the {{red velvet}} cake. It {{is very popular}} {{throughout}} the US, but is a particular favorite in the south. Most red velvet cakes today use red food coloring, but the unrelated addition of “red” to a <b>chocolate</b> <b>cake’s</b> name initially arose because of the chemical reaction of acid in unsweetened bar chocolate and natural (non-alkalized) cocoa powder in conjunction with an acidic liquid (generally buttermilk or sour milk) with an alkali (baking soda), which reveals the red anthocyanin, a water-soluble vacuolar pigment. (In contrast, <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> made with baking powder and a non-acidic liquid turn out blackish in color.) Near {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, these <b>chocolate</b> <b>cakes</b> became known as “red cake,” “red regal cake,” “red feather in light-as-a-feather cake,” “feather devil’s food cake,” and “red devil’s food cake.” However, their slightly reddish-dark brown hue was quite different from and much duller than food coloring-enhanced red velvet.|$|R
