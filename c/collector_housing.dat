40|$|Assuming that {{solar dryer}} system using the green {{house as a}} solar {{collector}} is incorporated into the mechanized rice cropping operation system most popular in our country, studies were made to determine the facility scale of dryer system required for performing grain drying smoothly. The salient points obtained are as follows: 1) First, study was made concerning how much holding capacity {{is required for the}} grain dryer utilizing solar energy. Formula (2 - 2) was proposed with which the optimum holding capacity of the dryer can be calculated on the basis of daily harvesting amount of grain by combine. Next, required drying quantity per day was determined from the standpoint of full use of the drying the proper harvesting period. Then formula (2 - 5) was derived as a calculation formula to obtain that holding capacity of a dryer which is calculated on the basis of above required drying quantity. 2) By picking up factors having effects on the area of a solar <b>collector</b> <b>house,</b> all of those characteristics are made clear. From these date, formula (2 - 11 & 2 - 12) were proposed to calculate adequate area of the <b>collector</b> <b>house.</b> House area (㎡) /Grain (100 ㎏) and Air volume (m 3 /sec) House area (㎡), required for calculation of adequate house area, in relation to the collector efficiency of the house, air temperature rise within the house and drying rate, were represented graphically {{based on the results of}} experiments conducted up to the present.

Furthermore, Influenza A/H 5 NI is considered to threat human health when the human first case was detected in Indonesia in July 2005 and until May 2008, the number of human cases is increasing. The study to determine risk factor of exposure to Influenza A/H 5 N 1 virus in collector-house workers was conducted in 34 locations in Jakarta in April 2007. Interview and collection of blood samples was performed in 216 person.

A dense surface composed of multilayered grains of films was obtained with the crystal size around 37. 67 nm. The optical properties of these films have been studied and show that PbS thin films have allowed direct transition and the values of energy gap varied between (1. 88 - 1. 55 eV) with increasing film thickness, The large optical band gap in the films is attributed to the quantum coefficient effect.

5000|$|When it {{was first}} {{opened to the public}} in 2001, Kalkin House was named the <b>Collector's</b> <b>House,</b> envisioned as a 21st-century {{historic}} house museum. In order to tie the contemporary architecture to the rest of Shelburne Museum, interior designer Albert Hadley was commissioned to outfit the building with folk art from the museum's collection and furniture. That interior remained intact until 2006 when the structure was renamed Kalkin House and converted into a space for temporary exhibitions highlighting contemporary design, without removing the kitchen or bathroom fixtures from the structure. The 2006 Kalkin House exhibition, Homey and Hip consisted of twenty pieces of household furniture on loan from Knoll with the stipulation that visitors could sit on the pieces. The interior was not portrayed as a domestic interior again until 2009 when Queens, New York-based textile artist Richard Saja re-imagined the space with his installation The Bright and Shining Light of Irreverence: Richard Saja and the Historically Inaccurate School.|$|R

40|$|The ER- 2 {{condensation}} nuclei counter (CNC) {{has been}} modified {{to reduce the}} diffusive losses of particles within the instrument. These changes {{have been successful in}} improving the counting efficiency of small particles at low pressures. Two techniques for measuring the size distributions of particles with diameters less than 0. 17 micrometers have been evaluated. Both of these methods, the differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and the diffusion battery, have fundamental problems that limit their usefulness for stratospheric applications. We cannot recommend either for this application. Newly developed, alternative methods for measuring small particles include inertial separation with a low-loss critical orifice and thin-plate impactor device. This technique is now used to collect particles in the multisample aerosol <b>collector</b> <b>housed</b> in the ER- 2 CNC- 2, and shows some promise for particle size measurements when coupled with a CNC as a counting device. The modified focused-cavity aerosol spectrometer (FCAS) can determine the size distribution of particles with ambient diameters as small as about 0. 07 micrometers. Data from this instrument indicates the presence of a nuclei mode when CNC- 2 indicates high concentrations of particles, but cannot resolve important parameters of the distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} goals were {{to identify a}} spacial pattern in craftsmen house and to see its relevance to the social-cultural life of the craftsmen. The existence of domestic and economic activity in craftsmen house creates a spacial pattern with particular characteristics. Data were collected through direct observation, interviews, and visual documentation to record productive house, settlement condition, and sequences of pottery production. The in-depth interview focused {{on the use of}} time, space, and house modification in craftsmen house. House in the craftsmen settlement was growing gradually by adjusting to the inhabitant's needs. This research was included in qualitative research that described observation results and then analyzed spacial pattern formed in craftsmen house. Research results show that in this settlement beside the mixed, balanced, and separated type of productive house, there is also pottery <b>collectors</b> <b>house</b> type. The changes in the productive house are related to housing adaptation or house adjustment to accommodate production process. The settlement orientation is along the streets, but the existence of open space in the form of pottery kiln and hay storage become the main orientation for productive spaces inside the craftsmen house. Pottery kiln and hay storage have become open cultural space that characterizes the pottery craftsmen settlement.  </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1996, the Old Thomas {{might have}} lost his sword, {{when the old}} tower was lifted down. The Old Thomas’ {{fastenings}} were almost completely unfixed and the water dripped from the tower sphere underneath the vane. Apparently, the sword could have fallen down with a storm on the Town Hall's roof or gotten into some souvenir <b>collector's</b> <b>house.</b> In Tõnu Lauk’s opinion, the Old Thomas decayed quickly because in 1952, the statue was left unpainted. In addition, nothing was done against rusting of fixing details. In addition, the wooden structure was done wrong. The water flowed in and the tower rotted quickly. During {{the making of the}} new tower and a vane, these mistakes were kept in mind. Old Thomas was primed with red tin, painted and partly gilded. Light-green vane is allegedly exactly so similar as the original. Old Thomas’ face, neck, feet, sword, flag and the tower sphere, on which the statue stands, are golden. It took about 4 grams of golden plates for all of this. The amendment came in 1992 from Teddy Böckler from AS Vana Tallinn. He said that there was no complete gilding habit before. The first Old Thomas from the year 1530 was also partly gilded. The original of Old Thomas and the dragon-head-shaped gargoyles, that are also partly gilded, confirm that saying.|$|R

5000|$|Known {{locally as}} Kemp's House in Burns's {{time it was}} the {{property}} of Sir William Miller in 1857 and was occupied by his tenant Alexander Kerr. It was described in 1855 as [...] "A good Cottage at the North end of the County Bridge on the Turnpike Road from Mauchline to Ayr."The two storey house may have been contemporary with Barskimming Old Bridge that dates from the 17th century, originally thatched but later slated. Steps beside it led into the woods where a path led through the Sandwalk Platantion down towards Barskimming House. Kate's home {{seems to have been}} built in conjunction with the bridge as a sort of lodge or toll <b>collectors</b> <b>house.</b> Considerable trouble had been expended in building a substantial level stone plinth for the house in this awkward and space restricted position. The 1841 Census records a 'Barskimming Bridge End' with James Reid, gardener and a family of four living at the property. The 1881 census does not record the property. An unusual feature at the site is an artificial cave with a door that has been cut into the red sandstone. Several other caves exist in the area and it is recorded that it was in use as a dairy in 1879. Next to the bridge on the southern bank was the Bridge or Miller's Holm where those who lived at the restricted site of Kemp's House nestling under the red sandstone cliffs kept their cows.|$|R

25|$|Kersal {{remained}} {{a rural area}} until about 1840 when the Clowes family, who owned {{most of the land}} in the area, began to sell it off for development, and merchants and manufacturers began to build their mansions in the green fields of Higher Broughton and Kersal. In keeping with their own ideas of social engineering they imposed strict covenants on how the land was used, reserving the higher ground for more well-to-do residents and the lower ground for workers' cottages. The number of public houses was severely restricted and then, only beer houses that didn't sell spirits were allowed. Singleton Road and Moor Lane were the only roads connecting Bury Old Road and Bolton Road and there was a toll bar on the corner of Bury Old Road. When Bury New Road was built in 1831 a gate or bar was erected and travellers had to pay a toll to the turnpike trust to pass through. A toll house was erected on Bury New Road with a bay window projecting out so that the toll collector had {{a clear view of the}} road. By 1848 the local authority had taken over the road, the tolls were abolished and the toll <b>collector's</b> <b>house</b> became a newsagent's. This was the only shop in an area where the landowner's restrictive covenants prevented commercial development. The exterior of the house remains largely unchanged to this day, although it was renovated in 2007 with a two-storey extension being added to the rear. The Toll House is now a Grade II listed building.|$|R
