5|$|Johnson was {{appointed}} as captain {{ahead of the}} 2011–12 season having previously captained the club in a friendly match against Nottingham Forest, but was stripped of the post following the arrival of Clarke Carlisle. Johnson retained his first team place, making 48 appearances and scoring twice in two consecutive games against Morecambe and Southend. During a 3–2 loss against Burton Albion on 26 December 2011, Johnson received a straight red <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th minute, for fouling John McGrath.

5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a yellow <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first yellow <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2013, Pogba {{made his}} debut for the French senior {{team in a}} 2014 World Cup {{qualifier}} against Georgia. He played the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 win.

He scored his first international goal against Belarus on 10 September 2013 in a 4–2 victory, once again during a 2014 World Cup qualifier.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E

5|$|The teams then {{faced each}} other once more in the FA Cup Final {{at the end of}} the season. The match was largely uneventful as it {{finished}} 0–0 after normal and extra time thus taking it to a penalty shoot-out, the first in cup final history. Scholes missed his penalty for Manchester United, and Vieira converted the decisive kick to win the cup for Arsenal. Reyes became the second player to be sent off in the Cup Final, after his second yellow <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 120th minute.|$|E

5|$|United {{were without}} first-choice central midfielders Keane and Scholes, as both were {{suspended}} {{after receiving a}} second yellow <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competition. Ferguson reorganised the team, with Blomqvist and Butt replacing Keane and Scholes, Beckham moving from right-wing to centre-midfield and Giggs moving from the left to the right wing.

5|$|With a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma {{became the}} only challengers to Inter {{in the last three}} rounds for the league title that season, {{ultimately}} finishing runners-up after the final game. Despite suffering several injury problems, he surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta, Giuseppe Signori, and Kurt Hamrin, putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records. Totti also played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing minutes of the second half for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0–1, thus failing to bring home a record tenth Coppa Italia title.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 World Cup, Lokvenc {{replaced}} the injured Jan Koller {{as a substitute}} in the first group match, against the USA. He didn't score but received a yellow card as his nation won 3–0. He started the second group match, against Ghana, {{in the absence of}} fellow strikers Koller and Baroš due to injury. He received another yellow <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match, which Ghana won 2–0. Due to having received two yellow cards, he was suspended for his country's final group match, against Italy. The Czech Republic lost to Italy and therefore failed to progress to the next stage of the competition. Lokvenc announced his retirement from international football in September 2006, becoming the third player from the World Cup team to retire after Karel Poborský and Pavel Nedvěd. He finished his international career with figures of 14 goals in 74 matches.|$|E

5|$|Bokhary was {{involved}} in a second altercation at around 3am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered her credit card. When the taxi driver refused, Bokhary angrily flung her credit <b>card</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driver's face; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene. The police were called. As she was being questioned by the two officers, Bokhary struck one of them. She {{was arrested and charged with}} common assault and assaulting a police officer. She was on medication and had taken wine prior to the incident. Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008, she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK$1,000 in compensation.|$|E

He made 41 appearances during the campaign but was not deemed a first-choice player by new manager Eddie Howe, and in July 2011 he joined his hometown club Preston North End on loan {{for the duration of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} first chance of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.

Twice {{in the next few}} minutes, Liverpool had chances from moves down the {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the left-hand side of the pitch.
