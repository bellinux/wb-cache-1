60|$|But, {{on turning}} the matter {{over in my}} mind, I began to fear that a formal {{dedication}} {{at the beginning of}} such a volume would look like a grand lodge in front of a set of cottages; while a <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> of any of my old papers would simply amount to writing a new one--a labour for which I am, at present, by no means fit.|$|E
60|$|The River Colne, which {{passes through}} this town, {{compasses}} {{it on the}} north and east sides, and served in those times for a <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> on those sides. They have three bridges over it, one called North Bridge, at the north gate, by which the road leads into Suffolk; one called East Bridge, {{at the foot of the}} High Street, over which lies the road to Harwich, and one at the Hythe, as above.|$|E
60|$|To gainsay these {{assumptions}} was imperative on the Syndicate's forces. To firmly establish {{the prestige of}} the instantaneous motor was the object of the war. Crabs were of but temporary service. Any nation could build vessels like them, and there were many means of destroying them. The spring armour was a <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> against ordinary artillery, {{but it was not a}} defence against submarine torpedoes. The claims of the Syndicate could be firmly based on nothing but the powers of absolute annihilation possessed by the instantaneous motor-bomb.|$|E

His announcement will not affect any of the 15 service members who already have talked to media, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the great}} and serious evil which he {{complains}} of, as being occasioned by our delay, is of so extraordinary a nature that I must request your Lordships to examine it with extraordinary strictness and attention. In the petition before your Lordships, the prisoner asserts that he was under the necessity, through his counsel and solicitors, [...] "of collecting and collating from the voluminous records of the Company {{the whole history of}} his public life, in order to form a <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> to every allegation which the Honorable House of Commons had preferred against him, and that he has expended upwards of thirty thousand pounds in preparing the materials of his defence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet, even {{apart from}} Beardsley, {{we were a}} {{sufficiently}} distinguished body: Max Beerbohm, Bernard Shaw, Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Symons, Charles Conder, Charles Shannon, Havelock Ellis, Selwyn Image, Joseph Conrad; but nothing counted but the one hated name. I think that had we been challenged we might have argued something after this fashion:--"Science through much ridicule and some persecution has won its right to explore whatever passes before its corporeal eye, and merely because it passes: to set as it were upon an equality the beetle and the whale though Ben Jonson could find no justification for the entomologist in The New Inn, {{but that he had}} been crossed in love. Literature now demands the same right of exploration of all that passes before the mind's eyes, and merely because it passes." [...] Not a <b>complete</b> <b>defence,</b> for it substitutes a spiritual for a physical objective, but sufficient it may be for the moment, and to settle our place in the historical process.|$|E
6000|$|Congress {{assembled}} on the 2d of December (1793), {{with various}} causes of exasperation at work; the intrigues of Genet and the aggressions of England, uniting to aggravate {{to a degree}} of infatuation the partiality for France, and render imminent {{the chance of a}} foreign war. Washington, in his opening speech, after expressing his deep and respectful sense of the renewed testimony of public approbation manifested in his re-election, proceeded to state the measures he had taken, in consequence of the war in Europe, to protect the rights and interests of the United States, and maintain peaceful relations with the belligerent parties. Still he pressed upon Congress the necessity of placing the country in a condition of <b>complete</b> <b>defence.</b> One part of his speech conveyed an impressive admonition to the House of Representatives: [...] "No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt; in none can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable." [...] The necessity of augmenting the public revenue in a degree commensurate with the objects suggested, was likewise touched upon.|$|E

6000|$|Poor Captain Mohammed of the Mukhbir, who {{had already}} escaped one shipwreck, was in mortal terror: he at once got up steam, and kept his weary vigil all night. He was {{perfectly}} safe, as the northern reef, under which the Sambúk Musahhil rode easily as if in smooth water, and the headland, Ras el-Tárah, formed a <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> against the Aylí, while the natural pier to the south would have protected him from its complement, the Azyab or [...] "south-easter." [...] But {{it would have been}} very different had the storm veered to the west, and the terrible Gharbi set in. The port of Makná, which has been described in [...] "The Gold-Mines of Midian,"[EN#113] can hardly be called safe; on the other hand, its floor has not been surveyed, and a single brise-lame seawards would convert it into a dock. I should propose a gallegiante, a floating breakwater, tree-trunks in bundles strongly bound together with iron cramps and bands, connected by stout rings and staples and made fast by anchors to the bottom. And, at any rate, on the Sinaitic shore opposite, at the distance of thirteen knots, there is, as will appear, an admirable harbour of refuge.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first the}} magistrates {{refused to accept}} these forms, but after a while, when they found how {{impossible}} it was to dive into a man's conscience and to decide what was or what was not [...] "conscientious objection," [...] they received them as sufficient evidence, provided only that they were sworn before some one entitled to administer oaths. Many of the objectors did not even take the trouble {{to do as much}} as this, for within five years of the passing of the Act, in practice the vaccination laws ceased to exist. The burden of prosecution rested with Boards of Guardians, popularly elected bodies, and what board was likely to go to the trouble of working up a case and to the expense of bringing it before the court, when, to produce a <b>complete</b> <b>defence,</b> the defendant need only declare that he had a conscientious objection to the law under which the information was laid against him? Many idle or obstinate or prejudiced people would develop conscientious objections to anything which gives trouble or that they happen to dislike. For instance, if the same principle were applied to education, I believe that within a very few years not twenty-five per cent. of the children belonging to the classes that are educated out of the rates would ever pass the School Board standards.|$|E
6000|$|By these attentions, that veteran rake, Rawdon Crawley, {{found himself}} {{converted}} into a very happy and submissive married man. His former haunts knew him not. They asked about him once or twice at his clubs, but did not miss him much: in those booths of Vanity Fair people seldom do miss each other. His secluded wife ever smiling and cheerful, his little comfortable lodgings, snug meals, and homely evenings, had all the charms of novelty and secrecy. The marriage was not yet declared to the world, or published in the Morning Post. All his creditors would have come rushing on him in a body, had they known that he was united to a woman without fortune. [...] "My relations won't cry fie upon me," [...] Becky said, with rather a bitter laugh; and she was quite contented {{to wait until the}} old aunt should be reconciled, before she claimed her place in society. So she lived at Brompton, and meanwhile saw no one, or only those few of her husband's male companions who were admitted into her little dining-room. These were all charmed with her. The little dinners, the laughing and chatting, the music afterwards, delighted all who participated in these enjoyments. Major Martingale never thought about asking to see the marriage licence, Captain Cinqbars was perfectly enchanted with her skill in making punch. And young Lieutenant Spatterdash (who was fond of piquet, and whom Crawley would often invite) was evidently and quickly smitten by Mrs. Crawley; but her own circumspection and modesty never forsook her for a moment, and Crawley's reputation as a fire-eating and jealous warrior was a further and <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> to his little wife.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Victor Smirnov is in Moscow. He {{is sent to}} {{a nearly}} <b>completed</b> <b>defence</b> line [...] Receiving reports of German forces nearby, he is forced to hold out with a chain of dugouts and foxholes. Repelling German attacks and even a {{flanking}} attack on the nearby dam, the light defences look ready to collapse. Fortunately, Smirnov is given the order to retreat, as the main line of <b>defence</b> is <b>completed.</b> Facing a fully manned enemy force, the German force fails to break through and falls back.|$|R

50|$|The Special Rapporteur {{indicated}} {{that there had been}} contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in Brazil, and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela and the Palestinian National Authority.|$|E
50|$|Self-defence in English {{law is a}} <b>complete</b> <b>defence</b> to all non-sexual {{offences}} {{involving the}} unlawful use of force (i.e. anything from battery to murder).
