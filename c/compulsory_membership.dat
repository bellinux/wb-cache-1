25|$|Thebes {{had been}} under Macedonian {{occupation}} since the battle of Chaeronea, which had resulted in the defeat and deposition of Thebes as the pre-eminent city-state of Southern Greece. The Thebans had reluctantly accepted this, {{as well as their}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>membership</b> in the League of Corinth, which had been previously imposed by Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander's father.|$|E
25|$|The Uppsala Student Union {{was founded}} in 1849 as a {{corporation}} representing all students except those attending the faculty of Pharmacy, irrespective of nation. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the <b>compulsory</b> <b>membership</b> in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one. However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union {{at the rest of}} the university.|$|E
50|$|The {{collapse}} of AUS {{coincided with a}} hardening of attitudes {{on the right of}} politics towards student unionism.

25|$|The <b>compulsory</b> <b>membership</b> in {{a student}} union was {{abolished}} 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. In {{a decision by the}} university board February 20, 2013, there will be four student unions at the university during July 2013 – June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland).|$|E
2500|$|NUS {{was formed}} as the {{successor}} of the AUS {{in the late}} 1980s. The ALSF then changed to focusing on lobbying state and federal Liberal Party governments to abolish <b>compulsory</b> <b>membership.</b> A case concerning James Cook University {{was brought to the}} Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, claiming that compulsory union membership was anti-competitive. The Commission eventually rejected the case on the basis that student organisations had a positive social impact. [...] In Western Australia, VSU was partially enacted by the state Liberal Party government, only to be rescinded when the ALP regained power.|$|E

50|$|The {{first wave}} of {{referendum}}s were held in 1999, in which several Polytechnics and two Universities (the University of Waikato and the University of Auckland) elected to become voluntary. In 2002 a second referendum {{was held at the}} University of Waikato and students choose to return to <b>compulsory</b> student <b>membership.</b> Similar referendums at Auckland University in 2001, 2003 and 2005 have all elected to retain voluntary student membership.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the workers could not be {{compelled}} to join the union since they were not fully-fledged state employees, as they are hired or fired by individual patients {{even if they are}} paid by Medicaid. The ruling did not invalidate <b>compulsory</b> union <b>membership</b> for the larger population of public employees, but Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion argued that Abood v. Detroit Board of Education was erroneously decided.|$|R

50|$|Salient {{has argued}} that {{although}} VSM has meant student associations are more stringent and careful in spending student money, the post-VSM environment has reduced financial accountability from the magazine's perspective. This is because the VUWSA Executive is able to move into committee when discussing contracts with the university, thereby barring the magazine from publishing any information about those proceedings. In contrast, under <b>compulsory</b> student <b>membership,</b> Salient was able to criticise and publicise any misspending or financial misdeeds.|$|R
5000|$|Proposition 18, {{also known}} as the [...] "right-to-work" [...] law, was a California ballot measure in the 1958 election. This {{proposition}} was an initiative to amend Article I of the California Constitution by adding Section 1-A, stating voluntarily, instead of <b>compulsory,</b> union <b>membership</b> as a condition for holding one's job. [...] This amendment would have made labor contracts compelling workers to join a union as a condition to hold their jobs illegal. [...] The proposition did not pass.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>compulsory</b> union <b>membership</b> in 50 highly unionized companies between 1979 and 1991. One hundred {{per cent}} membership has collapsed among non-manuals Post-entry 100 % membership {{remains in the}} majority of manual units, as does the pre-entry closed shop among craft workers. Fewer written union membership agreements, and more unwritten verbal agreements and unofficial understandings, were evident. This pattern is accounted for by the interplay of four factors: product market competition, managerial indulgency, workplace collective organization and labour turnover...|$|R

50|$|In 1966, the {{military}} {{overthrow of the}} CPP government was welcomed by many workers discontent with the TUC's loyalty to the government. The new government's repeal of <b>compulsory</b> TUC <b>membership</b> for civil servants led the TUC to shrink from 700,000 to 300,000 members. The years between 1966 and 1969 saw {{a large number of}} unauthorized strikes. Relations between the TUC and the National Liberation Council government were also rocky. In 1967, a government-appointed commission recommended an increase in wages, which was then implemented by the government.|$|R

He also took up several other positions, {{including}} ministerial responsibility for Justice, Industries and Commerce, and Overseas Trade, Immigration, and Customs.

Marshall also supported the abolition of <b>compulsory</b> union <b>membership,</b> which had been a National Party election policy - when the government eventually decided not to push forward with the change, Marshall's relations {{with some of his}} colleagues were strained.|$|R

5000|$|Warren Stanford Stone (1 February 1860 - 12 June 1925) was {{a railway}} worker who rose {{to head the}} Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in the United States from 1903 to 1925. He was unusual as a labor leader in {{that he did not}} believe in <b>compulsory</b> union <b>membership</b> and was {{comfortable}} with [...] "labor capitalism". He supported a radical plan in which workers in an industry would take one-third of the profits, the other thirds going to capital and the public. By the end of his tenure the Brotherhood controlled investments worth over $100 million.|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution {{allows for}} [...] "union {{security}} arrangements contained in collective agreements." [...] There is no firm {{definition of the}} term [...] "union-security arrangements," [...] but it is generally viewed as a generic term for a collective agreement between an employer or employers’ organisation and a trade union or trade unions, in terms of which union membership, or alternatively the payment of trade union subscriptions, is a condition of employment for all employees. Clearly this infringes upon an employee's right to freedom of association. Union security arrangements therefore require <b>compulsory</b> union <b>membership,</b> or <b>compulsory</b> payment of a union subscription.|$|R
25|$|<b>Compulsory</b> student {{organisation}} <b>membership</b> {{was initially}} accepted as uncontentious by all political persuasions. By the 1970s, the overtly political {{nature of the}} Australian Union of Students, which ran a number of overtly progressive campaigns (for example, {{in support of the}} Palestine Liberation Organization), led to a significant conservative minority within that organisation to call for voluntary student organisation membership.|$|R

In Hamburg the local branch sought to {{challenge}} the Social Democratic Party by campaigning for improved housing, education and trade union rights, {{as well as an}}tisemitism. Rhetoric condemning capitalism and the upper classes was also a regular feature of the party's appeal. Its 1895 programme called for the reorganisation of the labour force on a national basis as well as an extensive reformation of the legal system aimed at [...] "displacing the capitalist excesses of the present laws". In 1895 they added a call for <b>compulsory</b> guild <b>membership</b> for all craftsmen to their party programme.|$|R
