5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total <b>cardiovascular</b> disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce <b>cardiovascular</b> disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests play an {{important}} role in the diagnosis and treatment of many <b>cardiovascular</b> conditions.|$|E

5|$|MFGM {{may also}} play a role in {{supporting}} <b>cardiovascular</b> health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake. Clinical trials in adult populations have shown that MFGM could positively affect markers associated with <b>cardiovascular</b> disease including lowering serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Roger R. Williams, an {{accomplished}} and internationally recognized <b>cardiovascular</b> geneticist {{and professor of}} internal medicine, {{and the founder of}} the <b>Cardiovascular</b> Genetics research clinic at the University of Utah, was traveling from New York to Geneva where he was to chair a Medical Pedigrees (MEDPED) meeting at the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|USFDA-commissioned {{studies from}} 2011 {{indicate}} that in children, young adults, and adults {{there is no}} association between serious adverse <b>cardiovascular</b> events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with <b>cardiovascular</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of <b>cardiovascular</b> surgery in India, the annual {{scientific}} meeting of the thoracic and <b>cardiovascular</b> surgeons was held independently in 1985 under the new title Association of Thoracic and <b>Cardiovascular</b> Surgeons of India. In 1990 the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons was registered at Bombay. On 15 June 1991, the Association of Thoracic and <b>Cardiovascular</b> Surgeons of India was dissolved through a unanimous resolution passed by its general body during its annual meeting in Bombay, and its entire membership, funds, and assets were transferred to the new Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons. Panday was elected as {{the first president of}} the latter society on 15 June 1991. The following year, the Fellowship of the Association (F.I.A.C.S) was instituted and regular biannual publication of the Journal of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons commenced.|$|E
5|$|A 2000 review {{reported}} that vitamin E supplementation provided no benefits to physical performance among athletes. Antioxidant supplementation {{may reduce the}} <b>cardiovascular</b> benefits of exercise.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its effects on thrombosis, hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies myocardial infarction {{and other forms of}} <b>cardiovascular</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} {{may play}} a role in supporting <b>cardiovascular</b> health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake.|$|E
5|$|Research has {{indicated}} that MFGM, or components thereof, may potentially play roles in brain development and cognitive function, immunity and gut health, and <b>cardiovascular</b> health.|$|E
5|$|Studies are {{suggesting}} {{that the impact of}} refined carbohydrates or high glycemic load carbohydrates are more significant than the impact of saturated fatty acids on <b>cardiovascular</b> disease.|$|E

5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and <b>cardiovascular</b> disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect <b>cardiovascular</b> disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|Women and {{men have}} {{different}} {{experiences of the}} same illnesses, especially <b>cardiovascular</b> disease, cancer, depression and dementia, and {{are more prone to}} urinary tract infections than men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa. In 2008, 30% of all global death was attributed to <b>cardiovascular</b> diseases. Death caused by <b>cardiovascular</b> {{diseases are}} also higher in low- and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global deaths caused by <b>cardiovascular</b> diseases occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from <b>cardiovascular</b> diseases each year.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the <b>cardiovascular</b> system are called <b>cardiovascular</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Oxidative stress {{following}} PAH exposure {{could also}} result in <b>cardiovascular</b> disease by causing inflammation, {{which has been}} recognized as an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and <b>cardiovascular</b> disease. Biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in humans have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers that are recognized as important predictors of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease, suggesting that oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PAHs may be a mechanism of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease in humans.|$|E
25|$|Niacin is {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} other lipid-lowering medication. Systematic reviews do not find that taking niacin affected either <b>cardiovascular</b> disease or risk of death in those already taking a statin, in spite of raising HDL cholesterol. Niacin alone appears to reduce the rate of <b>cardiovascular</b> events as well as coronary or <b>cardiovascular</b> deaths.|$|E

25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review found {{replacing}} {{saturated fat}} with polyunsaturated fat {{resulted in a}} small decrease in <b>cardiovascular</b> disease by decreasing blood cholesterol. Other reviews have not found an effect from saturated fats on <b>cardiovascular</b> disease. Trans fats are recognized as a potential risk factor for cholesterol-related <b>cardiovascular</b> disease, and avoiding them in an adult diet is recommended.|$|E
25|$|A diet high in {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} decreases the risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease and death. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve <b>cardiovascular</b> results. There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to <b>cardiovascular</b> risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure).|$|E

25|$|Dr. Iván González Cancel is a <b>Cardiovascular</b> and {{thoracic}} {{surgeon who}} {{is credited with}} {{the realization of the}} first heart transplant in Puerto Rico. He participated in his first heart transplant at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. González Cancel returned to Puerto Rico in 1993 and was named Director of the Department of Surgery of the <b>Cardiovascular</b> Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean (Centro <b>Cardiovascular</b> de Puerto Rico y el Caribe). Dr. González Cancel implemented a <b>cardiovascular</b> program in the institution and on June 27, 1999, with the help of Dr. Hector Banchs Pieretti performed the first heart transplant in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{exposure}} to PAHs {{has been linked}} to <b>cardiovascular</b> disease. PAHs are among the complex suite of contaminants in cigarette smoke and particulate air pollution and may contribute to <b>cardiovascular</b> disease resulting from such exposures.|$|E
25|$|Particularly, <b>cardiovascular</b> {{function}} {{appears to}} be lateralized and tied to emotional stress. Intense emotional stimuli that cause stress can lead to alterations in <b>cardiovascular</b> function. The right insular cortex probably plays the most significant role in these phenomena. Similar lateralization is probably involved in <b>cardiovascular</b> malfunction in patients with head injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, meningitis and encephalitis, migraine, cluster headache and neurosurgical procedures.|$|E
25|$|CKD {{increases}} the risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood lipids. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is <b>cardiovascular</b> disease rather than kidney failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> {{disease is}} treatable with initial {{treatment}} primarily focused on diet and lifestyle interventions. Influenza may make {{heart attacks and}} strokes more likely and therefore influenza vaccination may decrease the chance of <b>cardiovascular</b> events and death in people with heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Individuals in {{excellent}} physical and <b>cardiovascular</b> shape {{may have more}} effective compensatory mechanisms before experiencing <b>cardiovascular</b> collapse. These patients may look deceptively stable, with minimal derangements in vital signs, while having poor peripheral perfusion. Elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions may have less tolerance to blood loss, less ability to compensate, and may take medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the <b>cardiovascular</b> response. Care must be taken in the assessment.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies found that {{positive}} emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on <b>cardiovascular</b> health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known {{to be associated with}} changes in immune and <b>cardiovascular</b> response.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{complications that}} may arise include: pericarditis, endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel {{when they have}} angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce <b>cardiovascular</b> risk, {{it is crucial to}} maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which may be involved in causing the <b>cardiovascular</b> risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other <b>cardiovascular</b> risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to <b>cardiovascular</b> risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.|$|E
25|$|People with CKD {{suffer from}} {{accelerated}} atherosclerosis {{and are more}} likely to develop <b>cardiovascular</b> disease than the general population. Patients afflicted with CKD and <b>cardiovascular</b> disease tend to have significantly worse prognoses than those suffering only from the latter.|$|E
