40|$|As one of {{the areas}} covered by plenty of primeval forests, Northeast China {{contributes}} a lot for the conservation of water and land resources, produces timber production, and provides habitats for a huge number of wild animals and plants. With changes of socio-economic factors as well as the geophysical conditions, there are dramatic shrinkage trends of <b>forestry</b> <b>area.</b> Therefore, it is of significance to find the underlining reasons for the changes of <b>forestry</b> <b>area.</b> To grasp the determinants of <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> change in Northeast China, an econometric model is developed which is composed of three equations identifying forest production, conversion from open forest to closed forest and conversion from other land uses to closed forest, and then to explore the impacts on the changes of <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> from demographic, social, economic, location and geophysical factors. The research results provide meaningful decision-making information for conserving and exploiting the forest resources and for making out the planning for forest production in the Northeast China region. </span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Polarimetric SAR Interferometry can be {{used for}} {{parameter}} inversion of ground. An appropriate model is of most importance for parameters inversion. This paper derives a series of scattering model that {{can be used}} for parameter inversion of <b>forestry</b> <b>area,</b> such as RV, RVoG, OV and OVoG. These models can reveal the characteristics of <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> as well as establish the relationship between observed data and parameters of test area. Finally, a multi-layer random scattering model that {{can be used for}} parameter inversion of <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> containing a man-made target is derived. An improved model is examined by the simulated data of the single-baseline polarimetric SAR interferometry. The result turns out that the improved RVoG scattering model is correct. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Community {{forestry}} is pursued as {{rural development}} strategy in many tropical forest regions worldwide. In Tropical America, rich experiences have been accumulated with community forestry support initiatives and this chapter summarizes published and the author’s hands on experiences. The chapter is divided in two parts. The first half {{focuses on the}} actual contribution of forests and trees to rural livelihoods, evidence that allows a more precise identification of the actual potential of <b>communal</b> <b>forestry</b> for rural development. The {{second half of the}} chapter reviews some of the challenges faced by community forestry development initiatives. The chapter critically reflects on generating profits, inserting communities in forest product value-chains, setting up community forestry enterprises and the challenge to adequately deal with complex regulations. By exploring the experiences of a handful of current community forestry initiatives in Amazonia, and with some reference to Central America, the potentials, limitations and challenges of <b>communal</b> and smallholder <b>forestry</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{official}} government statistics, during 1980 s until 2000 China's forest cover and the forest quality has been improved steadily. Despite this is a seemingly optimistic trend, however, China's leaders have been introducing new forest policies to restrict timber harvest and increase forest cover. In light of this seemingly contradictory setting, we adopt another methodology to measure the increase or decrease of the <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> by providing the first detailed statistics for changes in <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> for the entire China using remote sensing data (Landsat TM/ETM digital images), and attempt to complement {{the official}} government statistics. We tracked the changes in forest cover from late 1980 s through 2000 and estimated rates of forest cover changes and conversions between <b>forestry</b> <b>areas</b> and other land uses during this period. Our results reveal that during this period, the forest cover in China continued to decrease by approximately 1. 15 million ha, or 0. 5 %. This result is in stark contrast with the official government statistics which reveal that the <b>forestry</b> <b>area</b> increased during this period. Importantly, {{we find that the}} two data sets are more consistent for provinces with large areas of forests, while the discrepancy is larger for provinces with small forest areas. We analyzed that some reasons identified may explain this discrepancy. Our results suggest that the two data sources are complementary for future monitoring of forest cover in China...|$|R
