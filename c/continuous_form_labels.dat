5000|$|There is no strict {{distinction}} between simple and <b>continuous</b> <b>forms</b> in Spanish {{as there is}} in English. In English, [...] "I do" [...] is one thing (a habit) and [...] "I am doing" [...] is another (current activity). In Spanish, hago can be either of the two, and estoy haciendo stresses the latter. Although not as strict as English, Spanish is stricter than French or German, which have no systematic {{distinction between}} the two concepts at all. This optionally continuous meaning that can be underlined by using the <b>continuous</b> <b>form</b> is a feature of the present and imperfect. The preterite never has this meaning, even in the <b>continuous</b> <b>form,</b> and the future has it only when it is in the <b>continuous</b> <b>form.</b>|$|R

50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part <b>continuous</b> <b>form</b> paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed <b>continuous</b> <b>form</b> paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while feed rollers grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The <b>continuous</b> <b>form</b> paper then advances into the feed rollers to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the <b>continuous</b> <b>form</b> paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R
