40|$|We studied how {{the failure}} {{to take into account}} gendered roles in the {{management}} of a <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> can affect the resilience of this social-ecological system. Data were collected using qualitative methods, including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and participant observations from one community in the highlands of Ethiopia. The results show that women are excluded from the informal institution that defines the access and use rules which guide the management of the <b>communal</b> <b>pasture.</b> Consequently, women’s knowledge, preferences, and needs are not taken into account. This negatively affects the resilience of the <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> in two ways. Firstly, the exclusion of women’s knowledge leads to future adaptation options being overlooked. Secondly, as a result of {{the failure to}} address women’s needs, they start to question the legitimacy of the informal institution.

30|$|The individualization or {{spread of}} privately owned ranches in {{northern}} Tanzania would have significant costs {{in relation to}} the tourism industry, due to the impacts on wildlife of rangeland fragmentation. When private ranches are carved out of <b>communal</b> <b>pastures,</b> the private parcels tend to be much smaller and are often demarcated through fencing. It is debatable if the development of smaller, privately held landholdings out of larger scale, <b>communal</b> <b>pastures</b> would lead to more commercial production of livestock in northern Tanzania. However, it is indisputable that such changes would have major costs in terms of wildlife populations and tourism enterprises, as Kenya's experience with rangeland fragmentation illustrates (Norton-Griffiths 2007). Rather than promoting private ranch-based livestock sector development models, policymakers should focus on measures that enable pastoralist livestock producers to improve their production and profit margins, such as enhanced market information or veterinary services.|$|E

Province and herd size were considered potential confounders and kept in the model regardless of significance. Only 4 variables remained significant in the final model. Risk factors associated with prevalence included the use of dry lots/corrals as pre-calving area (OR= 2. 8; 95 % CI = 1. 3 ¨C 6. 2), the use of natural standing water in summer (OR= 3. 2; 95 %CI= 1. 31 ¨C 8. 0), and leaving abortions/stillbirths for dogs or wild canids (OR= 2. 5; 95 %CI= 1. 0 ¨C 5. 9). As the frequency of sighting coyotes and foxes increased so did herd seroprevalence to N. caninum. Risk factors suggested the likely role of horizontal transmission in the transmission of N. caninum in these beef cow-calf herds. Beef herd managers might consider biosecurity practices such as preventing the access of wild canids to fetuses and stillbirths thereby preventing pasture contamination and controlling contamination of water source with oocyst of N. caninum thereby reducing chances of infection. 	Aherd was considered positive for Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) if ¡Ý 1 animal tested positive. Estimates of cow-level seroprevalence was 1. 01 % (95 % CI= 0. 73 % ¨C 1. 29 %) while herd seroprevalence was 12. 4 % (95 % CI= 7. 57 ¨C 17. 23).

In the County, fodder is grown by agro-pastoral communities organized in groups as well as individuals who mainly plant the African foxtail grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) in enclosures meant to keep off grazing animals. The enclosures provide fodder banks for the owners’ herds during the dry periods, feedlots for fattening livestock for sale and fodder and grass seed for sale to other farmers for income (KRDP/ASAL DM 2012; Meyerhoff 2012; Channer 2013; Odunga 2013). <b>Communal</b> <b>pasture</b> development has been embraced by pastoral communities in the same county, with promising benefits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Overgrazing {{was assumed}} to {{increase}} the population density of small mammals that are the intermediate hosts of Echinococcus multilocularis, the pathogen of alveolar echinococcosis in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. This research tested the hypothesis that overgrazing might promote Echinococcus multilocularis transmission through increasing populations of small mammal, intermediate hosts in Tibetan pastoral communities. METHODS: Grazing practices, small mammal indices and dog Echinococcus multilocularis infection data were collected to analyze the relation between overgrazing and Echinococcus multilocularis transmission using nonparametric tests and multiple stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: In the investigated area, raising livestock was a key industry. The <b>communal</b> <b>pastures</b> existed and the available forage was deficient for grazing. Open (common) pastures were overgrazed and had higher burrow density of small mammals compared with neighboring fenced (private) pastures; this high overgrazing pressure on the open pastures measured by neighboring fenced area led to higher burrow density of small mammals in open pastures. The median burrow density of small mammals in open pastures was independently associated with nearby canine Echinococcus multilocularis infection (P = 0. 003, OR = 1. 048).

30|$|A {{key issue}} {{for the future of}} Tanzanian savannah {{ecosystems}} will be the ability of local pastoralist communities to continue managing rangelands at the communal scale, rather than fragmenting rangelands into individually owned properties. Converting rangeland from <b>communal</b> <b>pastures</b> to individual properties will likely prevent the movements across large areas of land that both livestock and wildlife in semi-arid landscapes depend upon. Tanzania needs look no further for a possible future scenario than Kenyan Maasailand to the north, where the former Group Ranches have been extensively subdivided into individual land holdings which are of insufficient size to support pastoralist production (Kimani and Pickard 1998; Western et al. 2009 b). These processes of subdivision have been driven by weaknesses in the governance and design of the Group Ranches as collective entities, resulting in progressive loss of communal land through decisions made by local elites on the Group Ranch governing bodies (Mwangi 2007). This process of rangeland fragmentation, driven by past policy design choices by the Kenyan state, has dire implications for wildlife in key areas such as the Maasai Mara and Amboseli - also the country's most valuable wildlife tourism sites - and there is evidence of declining wildlife populations due to these land use changes (Homewood et al. 2001).|$|E

30|$|Chapter 4 {{examines}} {{shifts in}} thinking regarding {{the role of}} livestock production in the Indian subcontinent. The environmental role of livestock {{is central to the}} arguments. The authors argue that the emphasis on the negative environmental impact of livestock needs to be re-examined in the light of changing livestock production systems. The main drivers of these changes are population increase and urbanization. However, the chapter argues that the consumption of livestock products, such as milk and eggs, is far larger in the rural areas than in the urban areas. General increases in production over the years, particularly with regard to poultry, are highlighted. The Indian data shows greater concentration of livestock production in the rural areas reflecting the close links between crop cultivation and the need for draught power. In India, in contrast with Africa, livestock feed is supplemented by concentrate feeds. This has socio-economic consequences: the authors argue that livestock production has not reduced the risk of poverty in rural areas. A second consequence relates to the <b>communal</b> <b>pastures</b> where most livestock production takes place. The shrinking communal resource base has forced a shift in animal farming in favour of small ruminants. The limited grazing areas are placed under greater pressure as extensive systems breaks down and are replaced by mixed systems, where farmers are forced to maintain small herds. The greatest disadvantage of this is that in a mixed system, integration between livestock and crop systems is not well established. The result of this is loss of nutrient recycling in the system. The main shift has been towards intensive poultry production in the urban areas. The main environmental consequences are greater green house emissions from the intensive urban based livestock production. The chapter outlines some of the policies that governments are adopting, such as improved natural resource management. The case studies show the inter-linkages between changing productions and the environment and the implications for policy improvements.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{a chronic}} debilitating disease {{and is a}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in livestock, wildlife and humans. This study estimated the prevalence and risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis transmission in indigenous cattle at the human-animal interface in the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania. RESULTS : A total of 1, 103 indigenous cattle from 32 herds were investigated for the presence of bTB using the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test. Epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing system were also collected. The apparent individual animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors was 2. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 7 – 3. 5 %), whereas the true prevalence was 0. 6 % CI, 0. 6 – 0. 7 % as indicated by a reaction to avian tuberculin purified protein derivatives (PPD) which is more than 4 mm greater than the reaction to avian tuberculin PPD. The results showed that 10. 6 % (117 / 1, 103) showed non-specific reactions (atypical mycobacterium). The herd prevalence of 50 % (16 / 32) was found. Tuberculin skin test results were found to be significantly associated with age, location, size of the household and animal tested. Of 108 respondents, 70 (64. 8 %) individuals had not heard about bovine tuberculosis at all. Thirty five percent (38 / 108) of respondents at least were aware of bTB. About 60 % (23 / 38) of respondents who were aware of bTB had some knowledge on how bTB is spread. Eighty one percent (87 / 108) of respondents were not aware of the presence of bTB in wildlife. There is regular contact between cattle and wild animals due to sharing of grazing land and water sources, with 99 % (107 / 108) of households grazing cattle in <b>communal</b> <b>pastures.</b> CONCLUSION : The study has demonstrated a high reported interaction of livestock with wildlife and poor knowledge of most cattle owners concerning bTB and its transmission pathways among people, livestock and wildlife. Although the overall proportion of animals with bTB is relatively low, herd prevalence is 50 % and prevalence within herds varied considerably. Thus there is a possibility of cross transmission of bTB at wildlife-livestock interface areas that necessitates use of genetic strain typing methods to characterize them accurately.

One hundred dairy herds with a mean YCHSCC between 200, 000 and 300, 000 cells/mL in 2010 were recruited and each farm was visited once during milking. A standardized protocol investigating demography, mastitis management, cow husbandry, milking system, and milking routine was completed during the visit. A bulk tank milk (BTM) sample was analyzed by real-time PCR for the presence of Staph. aureus GTB to classify the herds into 2 groups: Staph. aureus GTB-positive and Staph. aureus GTB-negative. Moreover, quarter milk samples were aseptically collected for bacteriological culture from cows with a somatic cell count ≥ 150, 000 cells/mL on the last test-day before the visit. The culture results allowed us to allocate the Staph. aureus GTB-negative farms to Staph. aureus non-GTB and Staph. aureus-free groups. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with the herd-level presence of Staph. aureus GTB and Staph. aureus non-GTB. The prevalence of Staph. aureus GTB herds was 16 % (n= 16), whereas that of Staph. aureus non-GTB herds was 38 % (n= 38). Herds that sent lactating cows to seasonal <b>communal</b> <b>pastures</b> had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (odds ratio: 10. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 56. 6), compared with herds without communal pasturing. Herds that purchased heifers had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (rather than Staph. aureus non-GTB) compared with herds without purchase of heifers. Furthermore, herds that did not use udder ointment as supportive therapy for acute mastitis had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (odds ratio: 8. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 58. 4) or Staph. aureus non-GTB (odds ratio: 6. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 27. 8) than herds that used udder ointment occasionally or regularly. Herds in which the milker performed unrelated activities during milking had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (rather than Staph. aureus non-GTB) compared with herds in which the milker did not perform unrelated activities at milking. Awareness of 4 potential risk factors identified in this study guides implementation of intervention strategies to improve udder health in both Staph. aureus GTB and Staph. aureus non-GTB herds...|$|E

Die Untersuchungen in den drei Untersuchungsgebieten bezogen sich bei den Dauerbeobachtungen (= Vegetationsmonitoring) auf die Deckungsgrade der Vegetation sowie edaphische Faktoren und waren auf die Erfassung der Weideerträge, die Qualität des verfügbaren Futters und die Besatzstärken ausgerichtet. Bei den Farmen  als Vertreter der beiden kommerziellen Weidemanagementsysteme, und zwar das Holistic Resource Management und das Controlled Selective Grazing  wurden Managementanalysen durchgeführt. Äquivalent dazu wurde im Kommunalgebiet eine Agrarsystemanalyse vorgenommen. Um Eindeutigkeit bei der Weidebeurteilung zu erreichen, wurden bestehende Weidebeurteilungsmethoden überprüft, bewertet und weiterentwickelt. Verallgemeinerungsfähige Ergebnisse wurden erzielt, in dem die Untersuchungen so geplant wurden, dass auch Informationen zu wichtigen Interaktionen, sozio-ökonomischen Rahmenbedingungen und zu der Umsetzung von Untersuchungsergebnissen (= Perzeption und Akzeptanz) bei den einzelnen Nutzergruppen anfielen. Die erzielten Resultate lassen sich wie folgt zusammenfassen: 1. Mit der Punkttransekte konnten Daten über den aktuellen Weidezustand erhoben werden, die Rückschlüsse auf die Nutzungsintensität zuließen. Die Flächentransekte war mit der Einbeziehung edaphischer Faktoren aussagekräftiger und weniger zeitaufwendig und eignete sich daher für die Dauerbeobachtung (= Weidemonitoring). 2. Hohe Deckungsgrade unter hohem Nutzungsdruck nach HRM Kriterien wurden bei ausreichenden Niederschlägen (> 300 mm)  nahe am ortsüblichen Mittel und einem überwiegenden Anteil perennierender Gräser erzielt. Bei unterdurchschnittlichen Niederschlägen und überwiegend annuellen Gräsern wurden höhere Deckungsgrade nur bei geringerem Beweidungsdruck erreicht. 3. Die Persistenz der Arten von Kommunalweiden zeigte sich darin, dass unter kontinuierlicher Beweidung die Deckungsgrade der Standorte mit geringerem Deckungsgrad in der Ausgangslage relativ weniger abnahmen als Standorte mit höherem Deckungsgrad in der Ausgangslage. 4. Die Elastizität der ariden- und semiariden Weideflächen stellte sich als größer dar, als den Berechnungen der konventionellen Weidemanagementpraxis (=Controlled Selective Grazing) zugrunde gelegt wird. 5. Bei der geregelten Beweidung im kommerziellen Farmgebiet unter unterschiedlichen Managementsystemen hatten die Witterungseffekte den größeren Einfluss auf die Weideerträge. Ertragsrückgang und Artenverarmung im Kommunalgebiet waren jedoch auf die Wechselwirkungen zwischen der Variabilität der Niederschläge und der ungeregelten Beweidung zurückzuführen. 6. Das Holistic Resource Management war durch intensivere Nutzung der Weide produktiver als das System des Controlled Selective Grazing. Die intensive Nutzung blieb kurzfristig ohne erkennbare Beeinträchtigung der Weideerträge nachfolgender Vegetationsperioden. 7. Bei dem Methodenvergleich zur Bewertung der Weidefutterqualität wurde mit der enzymatischen Methode im Vergleich zur in-vitro Pansensaft Methode die Verdaulichkeit organischer Substanz um etwa 10 % unterschätzt. Die Ursache dafür liegt offenbar in dem hohen Ligningehalt des Futters bei ADF-Werten bis zu > 50 % und ADL Werten bis zu > 4 %. 8. Die Futterqualitätsanalyse ergab, dass sich die Dynamik der Gerüstsubstanzen  ADF- und ADL-Konzentrationen  sowie die Rohproteinkonzentrationen als Indikatoren zur Bewertung der Intensität der Beweidung heranziehen lassen. 9. Die Relevanz des HRM für kommunale Weidegebiete wurde als relativ hoch eingestuft, da durch den holistischen Ansatz dieser Beweidungsform die Verringerung der Besatzdichten untergeordnete Bedeutung hatte und dadurch die traditionellen Zwänge der kommunalen Beweidungsform Berücksichtigung fanden. In {{order to}} assess determination factors and development options of <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> grounds in North-Central Namibia research {{was carried out in}}to the relevant effects of two commercial pasture management systems and the <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> utilisation practice simultaneously. Research was carried out in three research areas and comprised monitoring of the coverage rates of the vegetation and edaphic factors as well as recording of pasture yields, the quality of available feeds and stocking rates. The management systems of two farms, representing two commercial pasture management systems  Holistic Resource Management and Controlled Selective Grazing were analysed. In the communal area a farming system analysis was carried out as an equivalent. In order to obtain definiteness on pasture assessment existing pasture assessment methods were examined, evaluated and developed further. In order to achieve results of general validity the research was planned in a way that further information could be obtained on important interactions, socio-economical conditions and on the application of research results (= perception and acceptance) by the different user groups. The results can be summarized as follows: 1. With the pasture assessment method of the Point Transect data on the current condition of the pasture allowing conclusions on the intensity of utilisation were ascertained. The Area Transect was less time consuming but more meaningful through the inclusion of edaphic factors and therefore suitable for long-term monitoring. 2. High vegetation coverage rates subject to high grazing pressure according to HRM criteria were achieved with sufficient precipitation (> 300 mm)  close to the local average rainfall  and with perennial grass species as predominant part of the grass coverage rate. In terms of rainfalls below average and predominant annual grass species relatively high vegetation coverage rates were subject to low grazing pressure. 3. Grass species of <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> grounds were persistent since coverage rates of locations with an initially low coverage rate decreased relatively less in coverage than locations with an initially higher coverage rate. 4. The elasticity of the arid and semi arid pasture grounds was evidently higher than the one on which calculations for stocking rates were based by representatives of the conventional pasture management practise (= Controlled Selective Grazing). 5. In the commercial sector under controlled grazing independent from different management systems weather conditions influenced pasture yields to a larger extent. In the communal sector, however, causes of yield decline and of decrease in species diversity were found in interactions between the variability of rainfalls and uncontrolled grazing. 6. Holistic Resource Management was more productive than the system of Controlled Selective Grazing because of the more intensive utilization of the pasture. On short term yield reduction through the intensive utilization by HRM was not evident in the following vegetation periods. 7. The comparison of methods to assess pasture forage quality showed that with the enzymatical method compared to the in vitro rumen fluid method the digestibility of organic substance was underestimated by approx. 10 %. The cause is evidently to be found in high contents of lignin in the feed leading to ADF figures up to > 50 % and ADL figures up to > 4 %. 8. It was concluded from the forage quality analysis that the dynamic of the fibre concentrations  ADF and ADL concentrations  as well as the crude protein concentrations are valid indicators to evaluate the intensity of grazing. 9. The relevance of HRM for <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> grounds turned out to be relatively high, since the holistic approach of the grazing system paid minor attention to the decrease of stocking rates and thereupon allowed to take traditional constraints of communal grazing practice into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} on overland flow (OF) generation and its dynamics (i. e. {{spatial and temporal}} variations) is essential to understand catchment hydrology, a prerequisite for better water resources and soil management. In this study, our main objective was to quantify the dynamics of OF during rainfall events and to assess its main factors of control. The research study was undertaken in an agricultural 23 -ha catchment of a <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) experiencing Mediterranean climate and with variations of soil, topography and vegetation conditions. The dynamics of OF was evaluated during three rainfall seasons (2007 to 2010) by using 1 x 1 -m(2) microplots (n= 15) located at five landscape positions. At each location, a microplot was equipped with an automatic tipping bucket linked to a logger to estimate the delay between {{the start of the}} rain and the start of OF [i. e. the time to runoff initiation (TRI) ]. Multivariate analysis was applied to the total OF and TRI data and the information on selected environmental factors (rainfall characteristics; soil type; soil clay content, Clay; proportion of the soil surface covered by vegetation, Cov; proportion of the soil surface covered by crusting, Crust; mean slope gradient, S; soil bulk density, (b); soil water tension at different depths, SWT). The average OF rate over the 3 -year study period varied 2. 3 -fold across the catchment (from 15 % footslope to 35 % backslope), whereas the average TRI varied by a 10. 6 -fold factor (between 0. 6 min at bottomland and 6. 4 min at footslope). TRI temporal variations correlated the most with event duration (r= 0. 8) and cumulative amount of rainfall since the onset of the rainy season (r=- 0. 47), whereas TRI spatial variations were controlled the most by Crust (- 0. 97 <r<- 0. 77). Ultimately, TRI spatial variations were modelled and mapped in an attempt to model OF dynamics over the entire microcatchment...|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} in wealth and living {{standards of the}} peasantry between the central agricultural region and the surrounding agricultural areas were rooted in two factors, that is 'local {{differences in}} the quality of the soil', and 'historic legacies stretching {{back to the days of}} serfdom'. Villages composed of former serfs were also less rich in land than those consisting of 'state peasants', i.e. peasants settled on land owned by the state. Orlando Figes cites the basic problem of the central agricultural zone being that 'the peasantry's egalitarian customs gave them little incentive to produce anything other than babies'; the birth rate in Russia at the second half of the 1800s were almost twice that of the European average, at about 50 to a 1000, with the highest rates in the lands with communal tenure, where the size of the family determined the size of land. This population boom were due to land shortage: the population density of Central Russia matched Western Europe, with the average peasant allotment similar in size to those in Germany and France (at about 2,6 desyatina, roughly 1,1 hectare in 1900), but with only half the grain yield; this sharp difference from the rest of Europe was caused by the heavily outdated methods used by the Russian peasants in Central Russia: instead of the heavy iron plough low pulled by four to six horses in Western Europe, central Russian farmers often used a light wooden plough pulled by one horse or two oxen; they also used a small hand-sickle compared to the scythe or reaping hook which had been in use in Western Europe for over 50 years; sowing, winnowing and threshing was still done by hand compared to mechanised production in the rest of Europe; the use of chemical fertilisers were greatly below European standards; and advanced field rotations (alternative between cereals and root crops) were still largely unknown, while having been introduced in Western Europe in the mid-eighteenth century during the agricultural revolution. To feed themselves more land was cultivated as few peasants had the money to modernise their farms, and this was accomplished by reducing the amount of <b>communal</b> <b>pasture</b> lands in the three-field system, which had the effect of reducing the livestock size and therefore also the main source of fertiliser, and exhausting the soil. By the end of the century one in three households did not own a horse, and had to either rent one or attach it to themselves and pull the plow themselves.|$|R
