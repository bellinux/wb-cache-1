Coal traffic, averaging 40 wagons daily, was generally taken down to Bullo sidings in the afternoon, and on to Swindon next morning by two trains.

The opening of Trafalgar, Foxes Bridge, East Slade and Stapledge collieries led to a down-going traffic of nearly 100 wagons.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{predicted}} properties of fractional quantum Hall states are fractionally charged quasiparticles and conducting edge-states described as chiral Luttinger liquids. In {{a system with}} a narrow constriction, tunneling of quasi-particles between states at different edges can lead to resistance and to shot noise. The ratio of the shot noise to the backscattered current, in the weak scattering regime, measures the fractional charge of the quasi-particle, which has been confirmed in several experiments. However, the non-linearity of the resistance predicted by the chiral Luttinger liquid theory was apparently not observed {{in some of these}} cases. As a possible explanation for these discrepancies, we consider a model where a smooth edge profile leads to formation of additional edge states. Coupling between the current <b>carrying</b> <b>edge</b> mode and the additional phonon like mode can lead to nonuniversal exponents in the current-voltage characteristic, while preserving the ratio between shot noise and the back-scattered current, for weak backscattering. For special values of the coupling, one may obtain a linear I-V behavior. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|Schrödinger {{equation}} for {{an electron}} {{confined to a}} two-dimensional strip is considered {{in the presence of}} homogeneous orthogonal magnetic field. Since the system has edges, the eigenvalue problem is supplied by the boundary conditions (BC) aimed in preventing the leakage of matter away across the edges. In the case of spinless electrons the Dirichlet and Neumann BC are considered. The Dirichlet BC result in the existence of charge <b>carrying</b> <b>edge</b> states. For the Neumann BC each separate edge comprises two counterflow sub-currents which precisely cancel out each other provided the system is populated by electrons up to certain Fermi level. Cancelation of electric current is a good starting point for developing the spin-effects. In this scope we reconsider the problem for a spinning electron with Rashba coupling. The Neumann BC are replaced by Robin BC. Again, the two counterflow electric sub-currents cancel out each other for a separate edge, while the spin current survives thus modeling what is known as pure spin current [...] spin flow without charge flow.

40|$|Web {{wrinkling}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} common web handling problems, caused by shear forces, resulting from in-plane misaligned rollers. Several analytical models have been derived, mainly based on the theory of beams or membranes and isotropic material properties. Paper is a highly anisotropic material but can be assumed orthotropic for thin structures as paper web. For this reason, an orthotropic plane stress model based on the von Kármán theory of plates have been derived. Further, an investigation has been performed on the mechanics that is the origin of the shear forces due to misaligned rollers. It is believed that the differential equation proposed by von Kármán does not have a simple solution in closed form for the proposed problem. Therefore, energy methods and double Fourier series are used to calculate the critical load by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem. It is then shown that the use of an isotropic material model to estimate the critical load could be as much as thirty percent wrong. Thus, it is concluded that orthotropy should not be neglected in the analysis of buckling of paper webs. The shear force causes the web to deflect from its original path in the machine direction according to the normal entry law. Thus, the web tension becomes non-uniform and the stresses are redistributed so that only a small part of the web caries the load. The highest stresses are then found near the load <b>carrying</b> <b>edge.</b> Because high stresses causes permanent deformation, it has been assumed that misalignment causes the characteristic waviness that often can be seen on paper web edges in manufacturing plants. In this licentiate thesis, a model has been derived that is based upon difference in material properties across machine direction. The model shows that above mentioned waviness, not necessarily is caused by misaligned rollers, but may very well be the result of the differences in material properties, such as yield strength and Young’s modulus...|$|E

Especially, the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) without an external magnetic field is realized in the two-dimensional ferromagnet on a three-dimensional TI which supports the dissipationless edge current. Here we demonstrate theoretically that the domain wall of this ferromagnet, which <b>carries</b> <b>edge</b> current, is charged and can be controlled by the external electric field. The chirality and relative stability of the Neel wall and Bloch wall depend on {{the position of the}} Fermi energy as well as the form of the coupling between the magnetic moments and orbital of the host TI. These findings will pave a path to utilize the magnets on TI for the spintronics applications. Comment: 17 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{two dimensional}} systems in which edge states coexist with a gapless bulk. Such systems may be constructed, for example, by coupling a gapped two dimensional {{state of matter}} that <b>carries</b> <b>edge</b> states to a gapless two dimensional {{system in which the}} spectrum is composed of a number of Dirac cones. We find that in the absence of disorder the edge states could be protected even when the two systems are coupled, due to momentum and energy conservation. We distinguish between weak and strong edge states by the level of their mixing with the bulk. In the presence of disorder, the edge states may be stabilized when the bulk is localized or destabilized when the bulk is metallic. We analyze the conditions under which these two cases occur. Finally, we propose a concrete physical realization for one of our models on the basis of bilayer Hg(Cd) Te quantum wells. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The instances of this problem are edge-weighted graphs G and {{the objective is to}} find a subgraph of G that has maximal total edge weight, under the condition that the subgraph has a homomorphism to H; note that for H=K_k this problem is equivalent to MAX k-CUT. To this end, we introduce a metric structure on the space of graphs which allows us to extend previously known approximability results to larger classes of graphs. Specifically, the approximation algorithms for MAX CUT by Goemans and Williamson and MAX k-CUT by Frieze and Jerrum can be used to yield non-trivial approximation results for MAX H-COL. For a variety of graphs, we show near-optimality results under the Unique Games Conjecture. We also use our method for comparing the performance of Frieze & Jerrum's algorithm with Hastad's approximation algorithm for general MAX 2 -CSP. This comparison is, in most cases, favourable to Frieze & Jerrum. Comment: 19 page...|$|R
