25|$|CP/M, {{originally}} {{standing for}} Control Program/Monitor and later <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> <b>for</b> <b>Microcomputers,</b> is a mass-market operating system created for Intel 8080/85-based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc. Initially confined to single-tasking on 8-bit processors {{and no more}} than 64 kilobytes of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to 16-bit processors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first major}} {{operating}} system for microcomputers was CP/M (Originally standing for Control Program/Monitor, but renamed {{to the less}} technical <b>Control</b> <b>Program</b> <b>for</b> <b>Microcomputers,</b> presumably for marketing reasons, despite this causing the forward slash to make relatively little sense). This operating system was compatible with Altair 8800-like Microcomputers, made by Gary Kildall {{in conjunction with the}} programming language PL/M, and was licensed to computer manufacturers by Kildall's company Digital Research after it was rejected by Intel. The Intel 8080 used by these computers was an 8-bit processor, with 16-bit address space, which allowed it access up to 64kB of memory; [...]COM executables used with CP/M have a maximum size of 64kB due to this, as do those used by DOS operating systems for 16-bit microprocessors.|$|E

40|$|Educators who are {{responsible}} for selecting micro-computer software for classroom use are faced with a difficult task. The dramatic increase of microcomputers in schools {{in recent years has been}} mirrored by a tremendous proliferation of educational software. There are now more than 7, 000 commercially produced educational soft-ware <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> <b>microcomputers</b> on the market (EPIE, 1986), and about 100 new programs are published each month (" New Releases, " 1985 - 1986).

In this article we describe the current state of evaluation research with educational software, and discuss how popular software review methods fall short of meeting our need to know how well specific programs work.

40|$|The {{technique}} of linear programming (LP) {{is illustrated by}} developing a harvest schedule for an industrial forest ownership in northwestern Pennsylvania.

Sensitivity analysis provided additional information the manager could use to make decisions. In order to successfully apply LP, the forester {{must be able to}} define the management objective of the harvest schedule and the resource and managerial constraints that will influence its attainment.

40|$|Abstract- Cyclic genetic {{algorithms}} {{were developed to}} evolve single loop <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> robots.

In all of these applications the cyclic genetic algorithm learned the cycle of actuator activations that could be continually repeated to produce the desired behavior. Although very successful for these applications, it was not applicable to control problems that required different behaviors in response to sensor inputs. <b>Control</b> <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> this type of behavior require multiple loops with conditional statements to regulate the branching.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> <b>microcomputer</b> aided {{assessment of}} the performance of robot manipulators. The first program automatically generates robot models based on user-supplied kinematic parameters. The program also derives a kinematic model that relates the motion of manipulator end-effector to the motion of the joints using the inverse kinematic approach. The approach uses a robust inversion technique that can handle singular conditions as well as joint redundancy. A user can optionally select evaluation of kinematic capabilities of the robot manipulator, such as the ability of the end-effector to reach a specified position and orientation in space or the evaluation of the work space. The second program generates dynamic variables, such as forces and torques, based on user-supplied dynamic parameters and equations of motion of the various joints. Both <b>programs</b> are written <b>for</b> implementation on personal computers. Several runs were carried out to demonstrate the capability and execution times of the two program...|$|R

This study was designed to determine whether the utilization of a spelling program that had been <b>programmed</b> <b>for</b> use by students on a microcomputer differed in student spelling achievement from the same spelling program taught in a traditional classroom. The study also investigated whether there was a significant relationship between the method of instruction (microcomputer or traditional classroom) and spelling achievement when analyzed by gender, ethnic origin, reading levels and spelling levels. Students represented in this study were of diverse ethnic, minority, and socioeconomic levels. If microcomputerized instruction was effective with these students, instruction <b>programmed</b> <b>for</b> <b>microcomputers</b> might be effective with students elsewhere. The size of the study was limited to second grade students in West Aurora public schools in Aurora, Illinois. The district second grade spelling <b>program</b> was <b>programmed</b> <b>for</b> <b>microcomputers.</b> In each school second grade students were selected through randomization to participate in the experimental microcomputer study group. The remaining second graders served as the control group. All students took the teacher-given pretest on Monday and the final test on Friday. Students in the experimental group studied individually with the microcomputer on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in the learning center. The study began in November when the second grade program started and continued into March. A sixty-word posttest was composed from the spelling word lists using a table of random numbers. The posttest was administered to both the experimental and control groups by the regular classroom teachers at the termination of the study. One teacher who was not involved in the study graded all of the posttests. Twelve hypotheses were tested in the study: method and gender, method and ethnic classification, and method and reading level were tested for each of four spelling levels. A factorial analysis of variance was used to test hypotheses. The results of this study indicated that either teachers or programmed microcomputers may be effective for spelling instruction. A example of the microcomputer program is included...|$|R
