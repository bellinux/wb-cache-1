5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural <b>crops.</b> <b>In</b> weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E

The most severe damage was caused in Florida — the state suffered more than $420,000 in damage and {{more than two hundred}} people were killed. Of the people killed in Florida, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway, and more than 70 people were drowned near Elliott Key after two steamers sank.

5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread {{infection of}} several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|E

5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of an}} ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E
5|$|In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6m (12ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36people were killed due to Josie, {{although there were}} initial reports of 500people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (81mph), with gusts to , before blowing the anemometer away.|$|E

5|$|Its first {{association}} with the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) was not made until about 1859 when it began destroying potato <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> the region of Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans {{about the potential for}} an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid infestation by L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|No {{impact was}} {{reported}} in the Florida Keys. Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills.

Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas, with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings, houses, and <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> several cities, including Beaumont, New Sabine Pass, Orange, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur. The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875. Overall, the storm caused at least 29fatalities in Texas, with six died at Port Arthur, three offshore, four in Sabine Pass, and sixteen others at Beaumont. Damage in the state reached approximately $150,000.|$|E
