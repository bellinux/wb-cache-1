Thus, the crime also includes forced marriages, domestic servitude or other forced labor that ultimately involves forced sexual activity. In contrast to the crime of rape, which is a completed offence, sexual slavery constitutes a <b>continuing</b> <b>offence.</b> ... Forms of sexual slavery can, for example, be practices such as the detention of women in [...] "rape camps" [...] or [...] "comfort stations", forced temporary [...] "marriages" [...] to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women as chattel, and as such, violations of the peremptory norm prohibiting slavery.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008 The {{growth of}} {{industrialization}} has increased waste pollution, especially water pollution. Industries and individuals produce pollutants that are discharged into waters. Uncontrolled water pollution results in health hazards to human beings, animals and other living things. Thus {{there is a}} need to impose water pollution control measures which can reduce pollution to an extent where very little pollutants are discharged into waters. Many states have enacted statutes for controlling water pollution, as they believe this is the best way to impose measures to achieve the safety of waters. Legislations impose measures, such as a permit and its conditions, that must be respected to discharge pollutant or trade effluent into waters, otherwise the discharger becomes a polluter and liable to criminal sanctions. Statutes create offences and penalties for water polluters. They provide fines or imprisonment, or both, and severely punish a subsequent offender. In most countries, a <b>continuing</b> <b>offence</b> is criminalised. Corporations, as well as corporate officers, are punished for the offence of polluting waters or other environmental crimes. This is because environmental law does not allow corporate officers to hide behind the legal structure of the corporation. Some measures such as remediation or clean-up orders are implemented before a prosecution is engaged, in order to ensure the protection of the environment. Environmental audit or service orders emphasise the protection of the environment and may prevent future pollution of waters. Environmental service orders rectify one of the criticisms of fine or imprisonment, in that they fail to restore the environment to its previous condition. Most environmental crimes are caused not by a deliberate intention or negligence, but by poor or ineffective management systems. As a result, environmental audit orders may be used to detect and correct an inappropriate management system. Environmental law should be a user-friendly and prosecution must be used as a last resort. This dissertation examines offences and penalties for water pollution in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia and offers a comparative analysis and recommendations for South Africa. These countries have been selected not only because they are developed and tend to have best laws, but they are also located in different continents. The examination and analysis of how they provide offences and penalties for water pollution gives a chance to South Africa to find recommendations on how it may improve its legislation and maintain its water quality...|$|R

However, the touchdown was called back due to an inadvertent whistle, but Montreal running back, Avon Cobourne would run into the endzone to give the Alouettes a 26-13 lead. The other key moment in that drive for the Alouettes, was an injury to Eskimos defensive back, Jason Goss that forced Edmonton to {{make a couple of}} changes to their defensive setup, which the Alouettes offence were able to exploit.

50|$|In the new century, {{crime rates}} diminished in the metropolis, {{therefore}} {{the contribution of}} the Runners to the policing of property offences decreased considerably; they <b>continued</b> to investigate <b>offences</b> in London, but not as actively as they had before. Their incomes from London crime diminished as the position that Bow Street had once held in the commitment of felons to trial continued to erode with the expansion of the patrol and the creation of new police offices from 1792. By the early 1820s, Bow Street was responsible for just over 10% of the accused felons being committed to trial at the Old Bailey. After 1815, the Runners' most regular employment was to respond to help requests from prosecutors outside London. These were likely cases in which their skill and experience was thought to be useful in investigating offences in the provinces.|$|R

Staal enjoyed the first four-game point streak of his career (one goal and three assists). Though the Rangers would miss {{the playoffs for the}} first time in Staal's career, he would establish new career highs with eight goals, 19 assists, 27 points and a career-best +11 rating during the season. He saved his finest for late in the year, scoring a beautiful, coast-to-coast goal against Florida Panthers goaltender Scott Clemmensen on April 3, 2010, after receiving the puck from teammate Henrik Lundqvist in the defensive zone. For Staal, it capped a three-game goal-scoring streak and ignited a Rangers comeback in an eventual 4–1 victory that kept the Rangers' playoff hopes alive. The team missed the playoffs on the final day of the season, however, losing 2–1 in a shootout to the Philadelphia Flyers, who took the eighth and final playoff spot from the Rangers. Staal led all Ranger skaters in ice time during the final game, on-ice for 29:16 of the game's 65 minutes and finished at +1.|$|R
500|$|Inchoate {{offences}} in English law are offences in England and Wales {{that cover}} illegal acts which {{have yet to}} be committed, primarily attempts to commit crimes, incitement to commit crimes, and conspiracy to commit crimes.

Incitement, on the other hand, is an offence under the common law, and covers situations where an individual encourages another person to engage in activities which will result in a criminal act taking place, and intends for this act to occur.

40|$|The current {{discourse}} surrounding {{victims of}} online fraud is heavily premised {{on an individual}} notion of greed. The strength of this discourse permeates the thinking {{of those who have}} not experienced this type of crime, as well as victims themselves. The current discourse also manifests itself in theories of victim precipitation, which again assigns the locus of blame to individuals for their actions in an offence. While these typologies and categorisations of victims have been critiqued as “victim blaming” in other fields, this has not occurred with regard to online fraud victims, where victim focused ideas of responsibility for the <b>offence</b> <b>continue</b> to dominate. This paper illustrates {{the nature and extent of}} the greed discourse and argues that it forms part of a wider construction of online fraud that sees responsibility for victimisation lie with the victims themselves and their actions. It argues that the current discourse does not take into account the level of deception and the targeting of vulnerability that is employed by the offender in perpetrating this type of crime. It concludes by advocating the need to further examine and challenge this discourse, especially with regard to its potential impact for victim’s access to support services and the wider criminal justice system...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{public outrage}} over our global “rape culture,” sexual <b>offences</b> <b>continue</b> to be characterised by {{low levels of}} reporting, prosecution, and {{conviction}} in many countries. Attrition rates for sexual assault internationally, although varying in pattern, are consistently high. As a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW), the Indian Government acknowledges the need to afford better protection to victims of gender violence. Assessing the effect of rape law reform in India, using crime statistics and a survey of recent judgments from the Delhi District Courts, the author argues that the legislature has failed systematically to address the many injustices experienced by women who allege rape. The Indian Parliament responding to the moral panic generated by the Delhi gang rape case with knee-jerk reforms, focused mainly on increasing penalties, maintaining an outmoded view of rape as a crime against morality {{rather than as a}} violation of gender rights and human rights. By closely investigating the sociocultural context in which sexual crimes against women occur in India, the author reveals that India’s “cultural” arguments for rejecting further reform (such as repeal of the marital rape immunity) are merely entrenched gender biases, bearing strong parallels to nineteenth century English common law perceptions of women who allege rape as a class of false complainant...|$|R
