This strategy which implies assessing the semantic similarity between searching goals and hyperlink choices is inefficient if the semantic scents are not available to the user as happens, for instance, when they navigate a non native language website. This phenomenon affects especially to users of minority languages like the Sign Language (SL). While the technological advances have made possible the inclusion of the SL in the Web by means of videos, the usability and effectiveness of such innovations has not been tested empirically. We present the result of one study aimed to compare the performance of deaf signers when searching in Websites with textual hyperlinks versus textual hyperlinks supported by SL videos. The result showed that that deaf signer users became less disorientated (measured by the number of page visited per search) and were less dependent of their verbal <b>categorical</b> <b>reasoning</b> abilities in the SL supported than in the textual condition.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>categorical</b> <b>reasoning</b> in human cognition is well-established in psychology and cognitive science, {{and it is}} generally acknowledged {{that one of the}} most important functions of categorization is to facilitate prediction. This paper provides a model of optimal categorization. In the beginning of each period a subject observes a two-dimensional object in one dimension and wants to predict the object's value in the other dimension. The subject partitions the space of objects into categories. She has a data base of objects that were observed in both dimensions in the past. The subject determines what category the new object belongs to on the basis of observation of its first dimension. The average value in the second dimension, of objects in this category in the data base, is used as prediction for the object at hand. At the end of each period the second dimension is observed and the observation is stored in the data base. The main result is that the optimal number of categories is determined by a trade-off between (a) decreasing the size of categories in order to enhance category homogeneity, and (b) increasing the size of categories in order to enhance category sample size.

40|$|Decision {{theory and}} logical {{reasoning}} are both methods for representing and solving medical decision problems. We analyze {{the usefulness of}} these two approaches to medical therapy planning by establishing a simple correspondence between decision theory and non-monotonic logic, a formalization of <b>categorical</b> logical <b>reasoning.</b> The analysis indicates that categorical approaches to planning {{can be viewed as}} comprising two decision-theoretic concepts: probabilities (degrees of belief in planning hypotheses) and utilities (degrees of desirability of planning outcomes). We present and discuss examples of the following lessons from this decision-theoretic view of categorical (nonmonotonic) reasoning: (1) Decision theory and artificial intelligence techniques are intended to solve different components of the planning problem. (2) When considered in the context of planning under uncertainty, nonmonotonic logics do not retain the domain-independent characteristics of classical logical reasoning for planning under certainty. (3) Because certain nonmonotonic programming paradigms (e. g., frame-based inheritance, rule-based planning, protocol-based reminders) are inherently problem-specific, they may be inappropriate to employ in the solution of certain types of planning problems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} logic underlying category theory. In particular {{we present a}} formal calculus for reasoning about universal properties. The aim is to systematise judgements about functoriality and naturality central to <b>categorical</b> <b>reasoning.</b> The calculus {{is based on a}} language which extends the typed lambda calculus with new binders to represent universal constructions. The types of the languages are interpreted as locally small categories and the expressions represent functors. The logic supports a syntactic treatment of universality and duality. Contravariance requires a definition of universality generous enough to deal with functors of mixed variance. Ends generalise limits to cover these kinds of functors and moreover provide the basis for a very convenient algebraic manipulation of expressions. The equational theory of the lambda calculus is extended with new rules for the definitions of universal properties. These judgements express the existence of natural isomorphisms between functors. The isomorphisms allow us to formalise in the calculus results like the Yoneda lemma and Fubini theorem for ends. The definitions of limits and ends are given as representations for special Set-valued functors where Set is the category of sets and functions. This establishes the basis for a more calculational presentation of category theory rather than the traditional diagrammatic one. The presence of structural rules as primitive in the calculus together with the rule for duality give rise to issues concerning the coherence of the system. As for every well-typed expression-in-context there are several possible derivations it is sensible to ask whether they result in the same interpretation. For the functoriality judgements the system is coherent up to natural isomo [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{magnetic}} resonance studies (fMRI) evolve, we will {{learn more about}} how the brain operates during consumer decision making. Until that time, social science research can assist with understanding consumers’ thought processes, {{as in the case}} of this report, which focuses on consumer decision making in connection with travel planning. This paper examines the application of a cognitive framework that is currently used in education to better understand, address, and improve thinking skills, which appears to apply to hospitality consumers’ decision making. Two pilot studies of trip planning, by graduate and undergraduate students, demonstrate the potential usefulness of this cognitive framework. Since so much of the cognitive processing involved in trip planning appears to occur unconsciously, bringing the thinking involved to our conscious awareness may improve the process for consumers. Using the pilot studies and personal experience, this report explains the framework’s use for consumer decision-making and suggests ways that may help us better understand and address the cognition that happens as consumers make complex travel decisions. After an early model developed in 1961 by Albert Upton, the model of eight forms of cognition examined here was formed more recently by David Hyerle. The eight forms of thinking are: (1) Defining in context, (2) Describing attributes, (3) Sequencing, (4) Causal reasoning, (5) Using analogies, (6) Comparing and contrasting, (7) <b>Categorical</b> <b>reasoning,</b> and (8) Spatial reasoning. Some of these forms of cognition appear to apply more strongly than others in trip planning, such as determining the context of the trip, describing and comparing attributes, and considering spatial or location issues. Not expressly included in the framework, but essential to an understanding of trip planning processes is the social context of the trip and those planning to travel. Moreover, since fMRI studies have shown that the brain is parsimonious and attempts to operate as efficiently as possible, any aid to decision making should be well received. A better understanding of these specific forms of thinking may allow those in the hospitality industry opportunities to create specific ways of streamlining and purposefully addressing consumer decision-making thinking processes more strategically. In particular, for example, those in the industry might consider ways to facilitate each of these forms of thinking at different stages of the trip-planning process...|$|E
40|$|Simplicial {{complexes}} {{store in}} discrete form key {{information on a}} topological space, and {{have been used in}} mathematics to introduce combinatorial and discrete tools in geometry and topology. They represent a topological space as a collection of ‘simple elements' (such as vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, and more general simplices) that are glued to each other in a structured manner. In the last 40 years, they have been a basic tool in computer visualization for storing and classifying different shapes of 3 d images, then in the early 2000 s these techniques were success- fully applied to more general data, not necessarily sampled from a metric space. The use of techniques borrowed from algebraic topology has been very successfull in analysing data from various fields: genomics, sensor analysis, brain connectomics, fMRI data, trade net- works, and new fields of application are being tested every day. Regrettably, topological data analysis has been used mainly as a qualitative method, the problem being the lack of proper tools to perform effective statistical analysis. Coming from well established techniques in random graph theory, the first models for random simplicial complexes have been introduced in recent years, none of which though can be used effectively in a quantitative analysis of data. We introduce a model that can be successfully used as a null model for simplicial complexes as it fixes the size distribution of facets. Another challenge is to successfully identify a simplicial complex which can correctly encode the topological space from which the initial data set is sampled. The most common solution is to build nesting simplicial complexes, and study the evolution of their features. A recent study uncovered that the problem can reside in making wrong assumption on the space of data. We propose a <b>categorical</b> <b>reasoning</b> which enlightens the cause leading to these misconceptions. We introduce a new category for weighted graphs and study its relation to other common categories when the weights are chosen in a poset. The construction of the appropriate simplicial complex is not the only obstacle one faces when applying topological methods to real data. Available algorithms for homological features extraction have a memory and time complexity which scales exponentially on the number of simplices, making these techniques not suitable for the analysis of ‘big data'. We propose a quantum algorithm which is able to track in logarithmic time the evolution of a quantum version of well known homological features along a filtration of simplicial complexes...|$|E

A novel cognitive test battery, the Verbal and Spatial Reasoning test for Children (VESPARCH 1), consisting of four matched (in terms of test-procedure and design) subtests assessing verbal [analogical (VA) and categorical (VC) ] and spatial [analogical (SA) and <b>categorical</b> (SC) ] <b>reasoning,</b> {{was administered to}} a population based sample of 12 -year old twins (169 pairs).

This shared genetic factor also explained almost the entire covariance between the domains, as environmental variance was largely specific to each subtest. The finding of no genetic influences specific to each subtest {{may be due to}} the uniquely matched design of the VESPARCH 1, reducing confoundment of different test modalities used in conventional tests.

40|$|International audienceImplementation of {{executive}} control over {{thought and action}} can only be guided by the goals that one desires to reach. Over the last decade, research has pointed out {{the central role of}} goal representation in executive control both during childhood and adulthood. The present paper reviews these findings, emphasizing the developmental dynamics observed during childhood. More precisely, it addresses the role of active goal maintenance in working memory, as it has been stressed by developmental and neurocognitive theoretical models. Beyond goal maintenance, the question as to how goal representations are formed in working memory has attracted research efforts lately. With age, children successfully process increasingly subtle environmental cues to infer the current task goal and when task goals need to be updated, as evidenced by the effect of cue transparency on switching and inhibition performance. In addition, the paper addresses how goal representation sheds light on the interplay between executive skills and conceptual knowledge, through the presentation of research in such domains as analogical <b>reasoning,</b> <b>categorical</b> flexibility, and class inclusion quantification. Taken together, these lines of research show that executive control development does not rely exclusively on a growing ability to implement appropriate actions, but it also depends largely on increasingly efficient identification of what such actions should be.

40|$|Deductive {{reasoning}} {{is a fundamental}} cognitive skill, and consequently {{has been the focus}} of much research over the past several decades. In the realm of syllogistic reasoning—judging the validity of a conclusion given two premises—a robust finding is the belief bias effect: broadly, the tendency for reasoners to judge as valid more believable than unbelievable conclusions. How the content believability of conclusions influences syllogistic reasoning has been the subject of hundreds of experiments and has informed several theories of deductive reasoning; however, how the content of premises influences the reasoning processes has been largely overlooked. In this thesis, I present 5 experiments that examine how premise content influences <b>reasoning</b> about <b>categorical</b> (i. e., statements with the words ‘some’ and ‘not’) and conditional (i. e., ‘if/then’ statements) syllogisms, which tend to be treated as interchangeable in deductive reasoning literature. It is demonstrated that premise content influences reasoning in these two types of syllogisms in fundamentally different ways. Specifically, Experiment 1 replicates and extends previous findings and demonstrates that for conditional syllogisms, belief bias results when premises are both believable and unbelievable; however, reasoners are more likely to judge that a conclusion is valid when it follows from believable than from unbelievable premises. Conversely, belief bias for categorical syllogisms results only when premises are believable; conclusion believability does not influence conclusion endorsement when premises are unbelievable. Based on these preliminary findings, I propose a theory that categorical and conditional syllogisms differ in the extent to which reasoners initially assume the premises to be true, and that this difference influences when in the reasoning process reasoners evaluate the believability of premises. Specifically, I propose that reasoners automatically assume that conditional, but not categorical, premises are true. It is proposed that, because the word “if” in conditional statements elicits hypothetical thinking, conditional premises are assumed to be true for the duration of the reasoning process. Subsequent to reasoning, premises can be “disbelieved” in a time-consuming process, and initial judgments about the conclusion may be altered, with a bias to respond that conclusions following from believable premises are valid. On the other hand, because categorical premises are phrased as factual propositions, reasoners initially judge the believability of categorical premises prior to reasoning about the conclusion. Unbelievable premises trigger the reasoner to disregard content from the rest of the syllogism, perhaps because the reasoner believes that the information in the problem will not be helpful in solving the problem. This theory is tested and supported by four additional experiments. Experiment 2 demonstrates that reasoners take longer to reason about conditional syllogisms with unbelievable than believable premises, consistent with the theory that unbelievable premises are “disbelieved” in a time-consuming process. Further, participants demonstrate belief bias for categorical syllogisms with unbelievable premises when they are instructed to assume that premises are true (Experiment 3) or when the word ‘if’ precedes the categorical premises (Experiment 4). Finally, Experiment 5 uses eye-tracking to demonstrate that premise believability influences post-conclusion premise looking durations for conditional syllogisms and pre-conclusion premise looking durations for categorical syllogisms. This finding supports the hypothesis that reasoners evaluate the believability of conditional premises after reasoning about the conclusion but that they evaluate the believability of <b>categorical</b> premises before <b>reasoning</b> about the conclusion. Further, Experiment 5 reveals that participants have poorer memory for the content of categorical syllogisms with unbelievable than believable premises, but memory did not differ for conditional syllogisms with believable and unbelievable premises. This suggests that unbelievable premise content in categorical syllogism is suppressed or ignored. These results and the theory of premise evaluation that I propose are discussed in the context of contemporary theories of deductive reasoning...|$|R
