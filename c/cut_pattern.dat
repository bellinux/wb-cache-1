40|$|A {{method of}} {{creating}} metallic micromolds with features that have high-aspect ratios {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed manufacturing process utilizes laser micromachining to cut the negative two-dimensional profiles of the desired microfeatures and fluidic network patterns on a 100 3 ̆bcm thick brass sheet. The positive relief of the <b>cut</b> <b>pattern</b> is then created by using electro-discharge micromachining (micro-EDM) die-sinking the metallic mask onto a brass substrate. The final substrate with the desired relief pattern becomes the molding tool used for either elastomer casting or thermoplastic hot embossing. To validate the proposed fabrication methodology and evaluate the quality of surface finishes, a brass mold master of a T-channel micromixer (50 3 ̆bcm width, 25 3 ̆bcm height) is developed and multiple replicated devices are cast on this mold using poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS).

O presente estudo compara indivíduos cujas coberturas decorrem do vínculo de trabalho, com aqueles cujos planos resultam de uma demanda {{individual}} às empresas que os comercializam e os que não têm acesso a esquemas assistenciais alternativos ao SUS. A elaboração de uma tipologia de planos de saúde, combinada com variáveis relacionadas com as condições de saúde, utilização de serviços e gastos com saúde, sugere a existência de falhas de mercado. A percepção de uma condição de saúde mais desfavorável parece estar associada à busca de cobertura e o tipo de cobertura com o maior uso de serviços de saúde. Quando analisadas através de dois modelos de regressão logística com múltiplos controles, onde a variável de desfecho é indicadora de seleção adversa ou moral hazard, essas diferenças se atenuam, com exceção dos gastos com saúde. Os resultados não evidenciam uma inquestionável assimetria de informações, mas sinalizam a necessidade de aprofundar o conhecimento sobre as relações entre morbidade, utilização de serviços de saúde, gastos com saúde e tipo de cobertura. The authors {{investigate the}} extent to which adverse selection and moral hazard influence private health insurance demand in Brazil, based on the 1998 National Socioeconomic and Health Survey. Three population groups were compared, namely the one whose private health insurance was acquired by their employers, a second group whose insurance was individually acquired directly from insurance providers, and finally the one without any type of private health insurance and exclusively assisted by public health services. A taxonomy of health insurance plans was developed, and other covariates were also considered in the analysis, namely health states, health care services use, and health insurance coverage. The results suggest the occurrence of both types of market failures. Private health insurance coverage was found to be associated with unfavorable self-reported health states while the type of coverage appears to be associated with a more frequent use of health services. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, with multiple controls, showed that only health care expenditures remained associated with both adverse selection and moral hazard. Although a clear <b>cut</b> <b>pattern</b> of asymmetric information was not observed, results point out the need to further investigate the relations among morbidity, health care services use, health care expenditures and the varying types of health insurance plans...|$|E
40|$|This is an open-access article {{distributed}} {{under the}} terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License. α- 1, 3 -Glucan is present as the outermost layer of the cell wall in the pathogenic yeastlike (Y) form of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Based on experimental evidence, this polysaccharide has been proposed as a fungal virulence factor. To degrade α- 1, 3 -glucan and allow remodeling of the cell wall, α- 1, 3 -glucanase is required. Therefore, the study of this enzyme, its encoding gene, and regulatory mechanisms, might be of interest to understand the morphogenesis and virulence process in this fungus. A single gene, orthologous to other fungal α- 1, 3 -glucanase genes, was identified in the Paracoccidioides genome, and labeled AGN 1. Transcriptional levels of AGN 1 and AGS 1 (α- 1, 3 -glucan synthase-encoding gene) increased sharply when the pathogenic Y phase was cultured in the presence of 5 % horse serum, a reported booster for cell wall α- 1, 3 -glucan synthesis in this fungus. To study the biochemical properties of P. brasiliensis Agn 1 p, the enzyme was heterologously overexpressed, purified, and its activity profile determined by means of the degradation of carboxymethyl α- 1, 3 -glucan (SCMG, chemically modified from P. brasiliensis α- 1, 3 -glucan), used as a soluble substrate for the enzymatic reaction. Inhibition assays, thin layer chromatography and enzymatic reactions with alternative substrates (dextran, starch, chitin, laminarin and cellulose), showed that Agn 1 p displays an endolytic <b>cut</b> <b>pattern</b> and high specificity for SCMG. Complementation of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe agn 1 Δ strain with the P. brasiliensis AGN 1 gene restored the wild type phenotype, indicating functionality of the gene, suggesting a possible role of Agn 1 p in the remodeling of P. brasiliensis Y phase cell wall. Based on amino acid sequence, P. brasiliensis Agn 1 p, groups within the family 71 of fungal glycoside hydrolases (GH- 71), showing similar biochemical characteristics to other members of this family. Also based on amino acid sequence alignments, we propose a subdivision of fungal GH- 71 into at least five groups, for which specific conserved sequences can be identified.
