40|$|International audienceAims: tissue defects, {{resulting}} from surgical resection of oral {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (OSCC), are routinely reconstructed with skin graft. OSCC arising from the grafted skin have been described, however, it is still unclear whether primary and second tumours have a common clonal origin. By screening mitochondrial DNA D-loop region (mtDNA), we evaluated the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the primary OSCC and the second neoplastic features appearing in the skin graft in three patients. Methods and Results: in all the three cases, the neoplastic lesions arising in the skin graft showed a <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> with the previous OSCC and, {{on the basis of}} the results obtained with the mtDNA analysis, could be considered a recurrence of the primary OSCC rather than a second primary OSCC. Conclusions: Starting from a field of genetically altered cells of the oral mucosa, the spreading of the clonal cell population to the cutaneous flap might be stimulated by cytokines produced by the grafted skin.

All the cases occurred within a time period of one month. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) primers (ERIC-PCR) was used to establish <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the different isolates. Results: ERIC-PCR disclosed 4 different patterns. Seventeen isolates showed an identical pattern, whereas 2 other strains were closely correlated with the former 17. Two other isolates, with identical ERIC-PCR pattern, were genetically similar, but to a lesser extent, to the first group. The remaining 3 isolates showed identical ERIC-PCR pattern, but they were less correlated with the other strains. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} indicate that the outbreak of postoperative P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis presented here was caused predominantly by isolates with identical or very similar genetic patterns, thus suggesting a common source of infection in most cases.

Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this work was to characterize a collection of 139 S. aureus isolates from bloodstream infections in two public hospitals in relation to their antimicrobial susceptibility profile, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types, and <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship.</b> Methicillin resistance and resistance to other 12 agents were accessed by the disk diffusion test. Minimum inhibitory concentration to mupirocin was also determined. The SCCmec types were accessed by multiplex PCR, and the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis method and restriction modification system characterization. Besides, multilocus sequence typing was performed for representative methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates. The military hospital showed a dissemination of the New York/Japan (USA 100 /ST 5 /CC 5 /SCCmecII) lineage associated to multidrug resistance, including mupirocin resistance, and the teaching hospital presented polyclonal and non-multidrug resistant MRSA isolates. Complete substitution of the Brazilian endemic clone by other lineages was found in both hospitals.

40|$|To {{study the}} genetic basis of tumor progression, we have {{screened}} 37 hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas for genetic changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). All recurrent tumors showed genetic aberrations, {{with a mean}} total number of changes per tumor of 11. 4 (range, 3 to 23). The most common genetic aberrations were losses of 8 p (72. 5 %), 13 q (50 %), 1 p (50 %), 22 (45 %), 19 (45 %), 10 q (42. 5 %), and 16 q (42. 5 %) and gains of 8 q (72. 5 %), 7 q (40 %), Xq (32. 5 %), and 18 q (32. 5 %). The CGH results were further validated with {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) using probes for pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 7, 8, and 18 as well as probes for caveolin (7 q 31), c-myc (8 q 24), and bcl- 2 (18 q 21. 3). In addition, the samples had previously been analyzed for androgen receptor gene copy number. CGH and FISH results were concordant in 78 % of cases. Seventeen of twenty-two tumors showed an increased copy number of c-myc by FISH. However, only 5 of 17 (29 %) of the cases showed high-level (more than threefold) amplification. Both CGH and FISH findings suggested that in most of the cases 8 q gain involves the whole q-arm of the chromosome. Four of seventeen (24 %) cases showed increased copy number of bcl- 2 by FISH; however, no high-level amplifications were found. To evaluate the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> of the primary and recurrent tumors, six primary-recurrent tumor pairs from the same patients were studied by CGH. In three of six cases (50 %), the recurrent tumor had more than one-half of the aberrations found in the corresponding primary tumor, indicating a close <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship.</b> In the rest of the cases, such a linear <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> was less evident. Altogether, these results suggest that recurrent prostate carcinomas are genetically unstable.

It {{is of utmost}} importance to know the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationships</b> between multiple tumor localizations, enabling differentiation between multiple primaries or metastatic disease with consequences for therapy and prognosis. We evaluated the value of targeted next generation sequencing in the diagnostic workup of BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers with ≥ 2 tumor localizations and uncertain tumor origins. Forty-two female BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers with ≥ 2 tumor localizations were selected. Patients with inconclusive tumor origin after histopathological revision were 'cases'; patients with certain tumor origin of ≥ 3 tumors served as 'controls'. Tumors of cases and controls were analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing using a panel including CDKN 2 A, PTEN and TP 53, hotspot mutation sites for 27 different genes and 143 single nucleotide polymorphisms for detection of loss of heterozygosity. Based on prevalence of identical or different mutations and/or loss of heterozygosity patterns, tumors were classified as 'multiple primaries' or 'one entity'. Conventional histopathology yielded a conclusive result in 38 / 42 (90 %) of patients. Four cases and 10 controls were analyzed by next generation sequencing. In 44 tumor samples, 48 mutations were found; 39 (81 %) concerned TP 53 mutations. In all 4 cases, the intra-patient <b>clonal</b> <b>relationships</b> between the tumor localizations could be unequivocally identified by molecular analysis. In all controls, molecular outcomes matched the conventional histopathological results.

We conducted a study of Escherichia coli isolates obtained from human and food samples to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and to determine the genotype and <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> of 84 E. coli isolates (48 from humans and 36 from foods). An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the disk diffusion method. Virulence factors were evaluated by multiplex PCR, and the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationship</b> among the resistant isolates was studied by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Overall, 26 %, 20. 2 %, 15. 4 % and 6 % of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and cephalotin, respectively. Twenty {{two percent of the}} isolates exhibited resistance to more than one antimicrobial agent. Multiple-drug resistance was mostly observed in the human isolates and involved the antibiotics ampicillin and tetracycline. None of the six virulence genes were identified among the isolates. Analysis of genetic diversity by PFGE of 31 resistant isolates, revealed 29 distinct restriction patterns. In conclusion, E. coli from humans and foods are resistant to commonly used antibiotics and are highly genetically diverse.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the molecular relationship between multiple tumour nodules in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within individual patients and to evaluate their clonality, which may bear prognostic significance. In 25 HCC nodules from 11 patients with multiple HCCs, the <b>clonal</b> <b>relationships</b> of the nodules within individual patients were determined using DNA fingerprinting with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assay, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration pattern. Both LOH assay and CGH indicated that in four (36 %) of the 11 patients, the multiple HCCs had different clonalities and hence were of multicentric origin, whereas in the remaining seven (64 %) patients, the multiple HCCs had similar <b>clonal</b> <b>relationships</b> and were intrahepatic metastases. In selected cases, the HBV integration pattern helped to confirm the clonality results. Gross appearance, size, location, and histology of the tumours could not accurately predict their clonal origin in every case. Assessment of DNA alterations allows precise determination of the clonality of multiple HCCs within one patient. Of these molecular methods, LOH analysis can be used to evaluate tumour clonality in most patients even before surgical resection, since this assay can be readily applied routinely to either liver biopsies or fine needle aspirates.

Genetically, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is characterized by t(12; 16) (q 13;p 11) or t(12; 22) (q 13;q 12), and various exon fusion transcripts are described with varying incidences, which permits their use as markers for clonality. Moreover, in solid tumors, analysis of loss of heterozygozity is valuable for clonality analysis. Therefore, fifteen multifocal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma patients with two to five metachronous (n = 12) or synchronous (n = 3) localizations were investigated. Using RT-PCR, the detailed molecular characteristics of the FUS-CHOP and EWS-CHOP breakpoints were determined.

The H. somni isolates appeared to be geographically clonal, with 27 / 53 (47 %) isolates grouping in one cluster from one Australian state. On the basis of disc diffusion, 34 / 53 (64 %) isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; there was intermediate susceptibility to tulathromycin in 12 isolates, tilmicosin in seven isolates and resistance to tilmicosin in one isolate. Using MIC, all but one isolate was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; the non-susceptible isolate was resistant to tetracycline, but this MIC result could not be compared to disc diffusion, {{since there are no}} interpretative guidelines for disc diffusion for H. somni against tetracycline. In this study, there was little evidence of antimicrobial resistance in H. somni isolates from Australian cattle. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing results were comparable to MIC results for most antimicrobial agents tested; however, results for isolates with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to tilmicosin and tulathromycin on disc diffusion should be interpreted with caution in the absence of MIC results.

In this study, we compared the ability to detect <b>clonal</b> <b>relationships</b> among VRE isolates by an automated repetitive-sequence-based PCR (Rep-PCR) system (DiversiLab system) to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the reference method for molecular typing of VRE. Two sets of VRE isolates evaluated {{in this study were}} collected by active microbial surveillance at a large teaching hospital in Taiwan during 2008. The first set included 90 isolates randomly selected from the surveillance cohort. The first set consisted of 34 pulsotypes and 10 Rep-PCR types. There was good correlation between the two methods (P < 0. 001). The second set included 68 VRE isolates collected from eight clusters of colonization.
