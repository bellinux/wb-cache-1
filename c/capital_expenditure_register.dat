A Reexamination of the Incremental Information Content of <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Abstract: Under generally accepted accounting principles, firms must postpone recognition of the earnings effects of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> until they realize the resulting revenues and expenses. However, if <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> change the profile of future profits, we expect share prices to impound that revision in profitability prior to its recognition under GAAP. This suggests that changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> should have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Prior research considered annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and detected incremental information only in restricted samples. However, we examine more general samples and observe that quarterly as well as annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> are informative beyond unexpected earnings. Furthermore, we predict greater incremental information content for fiscal fourth quarter changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> when considering all fiscal quarters simultaneously, because the effect of the earnings recognition delay under GAAP should be magnified for <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> made late in the fiscal year. Our results are consistent with this prediction and inconsistent with the prediction that changes in fiscal fourth quarter <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> reflect lower profitability that result from an inefficient bunching of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the fiscal fourth quarter.

However, there {{has long been an}} informational vacuum about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the current available literature can best be described as non-existent. This thesis focuses entirely on <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> to understand the future implications of <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditure</b> Spending, and to understand the co-relation between different property characteristics and <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The thesis uses contingency tables to understand the behavior of commercial properties over a span of nine years. The goal was to understand if <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends have an impact on future spends. If an investor invests high (low) <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the present do they keep spending high (low) all throughout their hold periods or their spending changes over time. Secondly, regression analyses is used to better understand the relationship between different property characteristics and <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and this exercise helps build an intuition about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends. The contingency tables and regression analyses revealed distinguishing trends about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and helped understand its behavior. It was revealed that investors currently spending high on <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> are not necessarily successful in saving <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends in the future. The regression analyses defined a positive correlation for <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> with respect to age, sq. ft, NOI and market value and it defined a negative co-relation with respect to cap rate and location considering the property was located in the top six markets in the country. by Mehul Chavada.

Municipalities in Czech Republic make up important part of public sector and influence the fiscal performance of Czech economy. Simultaneously, the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has {{a crucial role in}} shaping of the entrepreneurial environment and of an environment in the widest sense. The goal of this paper was to analyse the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities in Czech Republic from the national economy point of view and to analyse the financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> between 1994 and 2003. The emphasis was given to the relation between the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the indebtedness of municipalities. The analysis reveals that the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> make significant share of overall public <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the share exceeds 50 %. The <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities also participate considerably on gross fixed capital formation (10. 57 % in 2003) and therefore on GDP formation (2. 83 % in 2003). However, considering the economic cycle, <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has pro-cyclical effect. Analysis the structure of financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the operating surplus is very important resource. However, it is not sufficient one even considered together with capital incomes and capital subsidies. It results in using loans to finance the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> This happened between 1994 and 2003, with the exclusions of 1998 and 1999. Because of the future high need of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> it can be expected that municipalities will employ even more loans. The link between <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and indebtedness of municipalities can be identified. There is another factor in effect. The volume of operating (especially tax) incomes is not sufficient. The state decentralizes significant portion of activities without providing municipalities with corresponding income. Municipalities then are not able to generate adequate operating surplus to finance the deficit on capital budget. Consequently, the rate of growth of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities declines as well as the share of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> on overall municipal expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Under GAAP, {{recognition}} of the earnings impact of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> is postponed until the resulting revenues and expenses are realized. However, if current-period <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> change in the profile of profits, an efficient capital market will impound the revision in current-period share prices. This suggests that unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Kerstein and Kim (1995) document this effect for annual <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> when using different abnormal return accumulation periods for large and small firms. We observe such incremental information content in a more general setting on an annual basis, and we also detect the effect on a quarterly basis. Moreover, we find that fiscal fourth quarter unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> have greater incremental information content than those of earlier quarters when all fiscal quarters are considered simultaneously using an annual event window. We document that more <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{are made in the}} fiscal fourth quarter by our sample firms than in other quarters, which is consistent with anecdotal evidence about managers "bunching " <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> near year-end. However, further analysis indicates that the greater fiscal fourth quarter incremental information content of unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> is not due to such "bunching"; rather, it is due to accounting recognition rules.
