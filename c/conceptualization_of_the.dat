30|$|It is also {{important}} to note that the degree to which one can gain insight into students’ <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP using distractor analysis is somewhat limited compared to other approaches, such as qualitative analyses of engineering design notebooks and interviews with students. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that distractor analysis provides valuable initial insight into student <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP that can serve as a starting place from which to inform additional investigations. In future studies, we encourage researchers to consider other forms of mixed-methods designs in which they combine distractor analysis techniques with qualitative methods in order to more fully understand students’ <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP.|$|R

25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and {{identification}} with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} regarding the potential of applying virtual reality to different therapies. A systematic literature review published in 2012 analyzed 963 publications regarding virtual reality and rehabilitation from 1996 and 2010. Investigators found an increasing number of research done in the field yearly, from less than 10 articles per year in 1997 to more than 40 in 2010. More than the number of articles analyzed, this literature review found important issues to be addressed in future studies: i) the need to consider a greater number of participants in each study to best represent the target populations; ii) to improve the use of control groups; iii) to enhance the uniformity of the tests applied and iv) to execute more follow up studies in the field. These aspects would allow the comparison among different studies and the <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results from different studies. Lastly, this investigation cites the importance of research in the field of virtual reality and rehabilitation, once the potential of this technology is recognized to support the neural and cognitive rehabilitation of different patients.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{our results}} {{suggested}} that distractor analysis provides insight into students’ <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP across {{different levels of}} achievement.

500|$|Chuck E.

Bushnell’s experience in the amusement park industry, {{as well as his}} fondness of The Walt Disney Company, was influential in the <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pizza Time Theatre concept. The first location opened in San Jose, California in 1977, and was labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, cheap animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. In 1978, Bushnell purchased the Pizza Time Theatre concept from Atari's then-corporate parent, Warner Communications. Gene Landrum then resigned from Atari and was made President and Chief Operating Officer of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Varietys Andrew Barker {{called the}} film endearing and engagingly enthusiastic, {{and said it}} is [...] "more fun than it ought to be".

[...] Barker also praised the film's score, but was critical of the script's uneven tone. The New York Timess Manohla Dargis called it an erratically enjoyable product of a deep cinephile passion for the martial arts genre. Dargis praised Crowe's performance and Byron Mann's [...] "gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin", but considered RZA's central role a mistake, saying [...] "with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back... is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop, much less hold your interest".

40|$|Although many {{activities}} can jointly {{contribute to the}} climate change strategies of adaptation and mitigation, climate policies have generally treated these strategies separately. In recent years, {{there has been a}} growing interest shown by practitioners in agriculture, forestry, and landscape management in the links between the two strategies. This review explores the opportunities and trade-offs when managing landscapes for both climate change mitigation and adaptation; different <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> links between adaptation and mitigation are highlighted. Under a first <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> ‘joint outcomes,’ several reviewed studies analyze how activities without climatic objectives deliver joint adaptation and mitigation outcomes. In a second <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> ‘unintended side effects,’ the focus is on how activities aimed at only one climate objective—either adaptation or mitigation—can deliver outcomes for the other objective. A third <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> ‘joint objectives’ highlights that associating both adaptation and mitigation objectives in a climate-related activity can influence its outcomes because of multiple possible interactions. The review reveals a diversity of reasons for mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation separately or jointly in landscape management. <b>The</b> three broad <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> links between adaptation and mitigation suggest different implications for climate policy mainstreaming and integration...|$|R

From <b>the</b> synthesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four main points I identify and categorize the five main causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tyranny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority. The two root causes of majoritarian tyranny are the qualitative (social) causes of individual and group interests. The remaining quantitative (political) causes are the two-party system, winner-take-all districting, and the voting system.

2500|$|Shenhav {{argued that}} this Arab Jewish {{identity}} is a hybrid one, and is in part the result of dual consciousness - national and colonial - of Zionism. Yet he does not argue that contemporary Mizrahi identity is Arab-Jewish, but rather {{that it was a}} concept with a certain history that was cut off. So from a critical position, Shenhav accepts the <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mizrahi in the Israeli political and ethnic discussion since, according to him, the common experience of the various [...] "communities" [...] in Israel - in the education system, the IDF, the development towns and so forth - has blurred their distinctions and created a great deal of similarity between them.|$|E

Both of those options, according to Shenhav, conceals the Arab identities and culture and provides new cultural cultures from the Mediterranean. The book discussed the way in which two categories where juxtaposed in the Israeli discourse - one which distinguishes Jews from non-Jews, and another, which is perceived as an exclusively Jewish discourse, between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi. Shenhav seeks to undermine those categories, which he believes to be fixated and do not allow a description of Mizrahi history from a comparative perspective.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we used distractor {{analysis}} to explore students’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> an experimental engineering curriculum {{for middle school}} students. Specifically, we examined the alignment between students’ overall proficiency levels on a multiple-choice EDP assessment and the probability that they selected certain answer choices. Because the assessment items were developed such that the answer choices reflected alternative conceptions related to engineering in general or particular stages in the EDP that could be addressed with additional instruction, patterns of students’ responses over different levels of achievement provided insight into the relationship between students’ overall achievement and their <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP. We also considered differences in patterns of students’ responses between subgroups of students. In particular, for items on which we observed differences in student performance, we used distractor analysis techniques to explore further the differences in students’ <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EDP that {{may have contributed to}} different overall performance between subgroups.|$|R
