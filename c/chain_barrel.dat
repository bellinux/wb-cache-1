40|$|Five {{different}} types of feeders were designed and tested on goats to find out their effectiveness in reducing feed wastage and cost fabrication. Experiment was conducted at Agriculture Research Station (ARS) -Bandipur for two years. Tested feeders were hexagonal, rectangular, hay rack, <b>chain</b> <b>barrel</b> and conventional wooden Tatnu. Feeders were fabricated using iron bars and woods. They were tested with the adult goats for feed wastage and feed contamination. Experimental feeds were fodders twigs (Tanki), forage (Stylo, Napier), crop residue (straw from black bean) and commercial concentrate. <b>Chain</b> <b>barrel</b> type of feeder was also tested at farmer’s field at Baradi. Rectangular feeders have significantly lower (P< 0. 01) feed wastage (6. 61 % for fodders) compared to other tested feeders. The fabrication cost was NRs 3200, 1700, 700, 900, and 150 for hexagonal, rectangular; hay rack, <b>chain</b> <b>barrel</b> and conventional wooden Tatnu respectively. The rectangular feeder is suitable for goats feeding in Tarai and {{in the hills of}} Nepal. It has provision for feeding fodders, grasses, crop residues and concentrates together at the same time. <b>Chain</b> <b>barrel</b> type had comparatively higher wastage (10. 7 % for fodder) than the rectangular but was preferred by the farmers due to its low fabricating cost, portable in size, small space required and easy to handle. Therefore, the rectangular feeder is recommended for middle level farmers and <b>chain</b> <b>barrel</b> for small farmers who rear few goats...|$|E

60|$|For a {{month they}} laboured assiduously. The planks were {{successfully}} taken up, and then, after much consideration, preparations {{were made for}} blowing up the vessel. The powder barrels were brought up, fuses were made, each six feet long, passing from barrel to <b>barrel,</b> and the <b>chain</b> of <b>barrels</b> was laid from the stern {{to the point where}} the deck was level with the water. This plan was adopted in order that the whole fabric should be shaken and broken up, while, had the whole force of the explosion taken place at one point, it would have entirely destroyed the timber there, while perhaps leaving a considerable portion still standing above the water.|$|R

500|$|As a Southern-themed <b>chain,</b> Cracker <b>Barrel</b> serves {{traditional}} Southern {{comfort food}} {{often described as}} [...] "down-home" [...] country cooking and sells gift items including simple toys representative of the 1950s and 1960s, toy vehicles, puzzles, and woodcrafts. Also sold are country music CDs, DVDs of early classic television, cookbooks, baking mixes, kitchen novelty decor, and early classic brands of candy and snack foods. Breakfast is served all day, {{and there are two}} menus: one for breakfast, the other for lunch and dinner. Since the first restaurant opened, the menu has featured Southern specialties, including biscuits, fried chicken, and catfish; seasonal and regional menu items were added during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2007, Cracker Barrel announced plans to remove artificial trans fats from its menu items.|$|R

The {{pull of the}} fusee unwinds the <b>chain</b> off the <b>barrel</b> and back onto the fusee, turning the barrel and winding the mainspring. The presence of the fusee means that the force required to wind up the mainspring is constant; it does not increase as the mainspring tightens.|$|R

50|$|The {{military}} {{usefulness of}} chain shot died out as wooden sail-powered ships were replaced with armored steam ships—first among navies, and then among commercial fleets—which {{do not have}} rigging to serve as proper targets for chain-shot. Additionally, the conversion of naval armament from smoothbore, muzzle loaded, black powder cannons to rifled, breech loaded guns further slowed the production of new chain shot ammunition; the <b>chain</b> would damage <b>barrels</b> (degrading maximum range, and further degrading effective range by degrading accuracy), and the new breech loading guns and their ammunition {{were meant to be}} effective against armored vessels as well as wooden sailing vessels.|$|R
500|$|Both members {{stayed with}} Arista Nashville as solo artists after the split.

Dunn announced via Facebook on June 7, 2012 {{that he had}} exited Arista Nashville. Restaurant <b>chain</b> Cracker <b>Barrel</b> re-issued the album in late May with two bonus tracks; proceeds from the re-issue benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. In late 2013, Dunn sang duet vocals with Kelly Clarkson on a cover of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] from her Christmas album Wrapped in Red. Dunn's second solo album, Peace, Love, and Country Music, was released in 2014, followed by Tattooed Heart in 2016 on Valory Music Group's Nash Icon label. The latter features Brooks on the single [...] "Damn Drunk". Brooks released the solo single [...] "New to This Town", which features Joe Walsh on slide guitar. Brooks' first Arista album, also titled New to This Town, was released in September 2012.|$|R
50|$|Brunelleschi's {{solutions}} were ingenious, {{and he used}} a catenary arch,. The spreading {{problem was}} solved {{by a set of}} four internal horizontal stone and iron <b>chains,</b> serving as <b>barrel</b> hoops, embedded within the inner dome: one at the top, one at the bottom, with the remaining two evenly spaced between them. A fifth chain, made of wood, was placed {{between the first and second}} of the stone chains. Since the dome was octagonal rather than round, a simple chain, squeezing the dome like a barrel hoop, would have put all its pressure on the eight corners of the dome. The chains needed to be rigid octagons, stiff enough to hold their shape, so as not to deform the dome as they held it together.|$|R

25|$|Drake {{appeared}} off Cartagena {{during the}} afternoon of 9 February 1586 and as the Boca Grande passage was unfortified, his ships passed through it in a long column, with the Elizabeth Bonaventure in the lead. The English ships dropped anchor at {{the northern end of}} the Outer Harbour after sailing past the entrance, just beyond the range of the Spanish guns guarding the Boqueron Channel. Drake sent Martin Frobisher forward to probe the defences using small boats and pinnaces in the afternoon. Coming in by way of Bahía de las Animas they moved forward but they soon ran into a <b>chain</b> of floating <b>barrels</b> which closed their way and in addition intense fire from El Boqueron forced their eventual withdrawal. Drake concurred with Christopher Carleil commander of the English troops that the best chance of capturing the city was by advancing up La Caleta.|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} hemoglobin of Ascaris has {{an extremely}} high oxygen affinity (P 50 = 0. 004 mmHg). It consists of eight identical subunits of molecular weight 40, 600. Their sequence, determined by protein chemistry, shows two tandemly linked globin-like sequences and an 18 -residue C-terminal extension. Two N-linked glycosylation sites contain equal ratios of mannose/glucosamine/fucose of 3 : 2 : 1. Electron micrographs {{suggest that the}} eight subunits form a polyhedron of point symmetry D 4, or 42. The C-terminal extension contains {{a repeat of the}} sequence Glu-Glu-His-Lys, which would form a pattern of alternate glutamate and histidine side chains on one side and of glutamate and lysine side chains {{on the other side of}} a beta strand. We propose that this represents a polar zipper sequence and that the C-terminal extensions are joined in an eight-stranded beta barrel at the center of the molecule, with histidine and glutamate side chains inside and lysine and glutamate side <b>chains</b> outside the <b>barrel</b> compensating each other's charges. The amino acid sequence of Ascaris hemoglobin fails to explain its high oxygen affinity. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In {{car repair}} businesses, clients {{typically}} wait until their vehicle is repaired; the service manager can only give {{an estimate of}} the approximate waiting time. Clients waiting in the entrance or waiting area of a restaurant for a table normally are seated based on whether they have reservations, or for those without reservations, on a first-come, first served approach; however, important customers or celebrities may be put {{to the front of the}} line. In restaurants, customers may also be able to jump the line by giving a large gratuity or bribe to the maitre d'hotel or head waiter. Some restaurants which are co-located with or combined with a retail store or gift shop ask customers who are waiting for a table to browse in the merchandise section until their table's availability is announced on a PA system or via a pager; this strategy can lead to increased purchases in the retail part of the establishment. One combination restaurant/store is the US Cracker <b>Barrel</b> <b>chain.</b> Some restaurants ask customers who are waiting for a table to sit in the restaurant's bar or its licensed lounge area; this approach may lead to increased sales of alcoholic beverages.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacterial}} outer {{membrane protein}} OmpA {{is composed of}} an N-terminal 171 -residue β-barrel domain (OmpA 171) that spans the bilayer and a periplasmic, C-terminal domain of unknown structure. OmpA has been suggested to primarily serve a structural role, as no continuous pore {{through the center of}} the barrel can be discerned in the crystal structure of OmpA 171. However, several groups have recorded ionic conductances for bilayer-reconstituted OmpA 171. To resolve this apparent paradox we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on OmpA 171 to explore the conformational dynamics of the protein, in particular the possibility of transient formation of a central pore. A total of 19 ns of MD simulations of OmpA 171 have been run, and the results were analyzed in terms of 1) comparative behavior of OmpA 171 in different bilayer and bilayer-mimetic environments, 2) solvation states of OmpA 171, and 3) pore characteristics in different MD simulations. Significant mobility was observed for residues and water molecules within the β-barrel. A simulation in which putative gate region side <b>chains</b> of the <b>barrel</b> interior were held in a non-native conformation led to an open pore, with a predicted conductance similar to experimental measurements. The OmpA 171 pore has been shown to be somewhat more dynamic than suggested by the crystal structure. A gating mechanism is proposed to explain its documented channel properties, involving a flickering isomerization of Arg 138, forming alternate salt bridges with Glu 52 (closed state) and Glu 128 (open state) ...|$|R

60|$|In my schoolhouse, however, I {{seem to see}} {{the square}} most readily in the Scotch mist which so often filled it, {{loosening}} the stones and choking the drains. There was then no rattle of rain against my window-sill, nor dancing of diamond drops on the roofs, but blobs of water grew on the panes of glass to reel heavily down them. Then the sodden square would have shed abundant tears {{if you could have}} taken it in your hands and wrung it like a dripping cloth. At such a time the square would be empty but for one vegetable cart left in the care of a lean collie, which, tied to the wheel, whined and shivered underneath. Pools of water gather in the coarse sacks, that have been spread over the potatoes and bundles of greens, which turn to manure in their lidless barrels. The eyes of the whimpering dog never leave a black close over which hangs the sign of the Bull, probably the refuge of the hawker. At long intervals a farmer's gig rumbles over the bumpy, ill-paved square, or a native, with his head buried in his coat, peeps out of doors, skurries across the way, and vanishes. Most of the leading shops are here, and the decorous draper ventures a few yards from the pavement to scan the sky, or note the effect of his new arrangement in scarves. Planted against his door is the butcher, Henders Todd, white-aproned, and with a knife in his hand, gazing interestedly at the draper, for a mere man may look at an elder. The tinsmith brings out his steps, and, mounting them, stealthily removes the saucepans and pepper-pots that dangle on a wire above his sign-board. Pulling to his door he shuts out the foggy light that showed in his solder-strewn workshop. The square is deserted again. A bundle of sloppy parsley slips from the hawker's cart and topples over the wheel in driblets. The puddles in the sacks overflow and run together. The dog has twisted his <b>chain</b> round a <b>barrel</b> and yelps sharply. As if in response comes a rush of other dogs. A terrified fox-terrier tears across the square with half a score of mongrels, the butcher's mastiff and some collies at his heels; he is doubtless a stranger who has insulted them by his glossy coat. For two seconds the square shakes to an invasion of dogs, and then, again, there is only one dog in sight.|$|R
