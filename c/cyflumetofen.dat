40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Cyflumetofen</b> and cyenopyrafen are novel acaricides {{acting as}} complex II inhibitors. This new {{mode of action}} is {{extremely}} useful for devising efficient resistance management strategies for mite control. The authors determined the cross-resistance risk of both compounds, using a collection of well-characterised resistant strains of Tetranychus urticae, and also selected for <b>cyflumetofen</b> resistance in the laboratory. RESULTS: Cross-resistance to <b>cyflumetofen</b> and cyenopyrafen was detected in field strains, with LC 50 values exceeding the registered field dose. Synergism experiments suggested that P 450 monooxygenases are involved in resistance, and that the activation mechanism of the two compounds most likely differs. Laboratory selection with <b>cyflumetofen</b> resulted in a highly resistant T. urticae strain that displayed negative cross-resistance to cyenopyrafen. CONCLUSIONS: The cross-resistance risk of <b>cyflumetofen</b> and cyenopyrafen documented in this study needs to be integrated in resistance management strategies, especially in regions or crops {{with a history of}} frequent acaricide applications, in order to safeguard the efficacy of these compounds with a valuable new mode of action...|$|E
3000|$|... (Kumiai Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)] {{to prepare}} 100 – 5000  μg/ml samples in aqueous solution. The control was treated only with acetone {{in an aqueous}} solution. Three {{commercial}} pesticides, <b>cyflumetofen</b> flowable (OAT Agrio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), emamectin benzoate emulsifiable concentrate (Syngenta Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and pyridaben wettable powder (Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), were used as positive controls at each regulation concentration (cyflumetofen: 200  μg/ml, emamectin benzoate: 5  μg/ml, pyridaben: 200  μg/ml) in aqueous solutions. Leaf discs (20  mm in diameter) were prepared from kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Leaf discs were soaked in each solution {{for the application of}} samples covering the entire surface, and were picked up immediately. Then, each prepared leaf disc was placed on wet filter paper in a petri dish (40  mm diameter). Ten adult female mites were placed on each leaf disc. After 96  h, the numbers of dead mites were counted under a microscope. LC 50 was calculated based on concentration (μg/ml) of extract or compound in each sample aqueous solutions.|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin {{production}} inhibitors, {{which do}} not inhibit the growth of aflatoxigenic fungi, {{may be used to}} control aflatoxin without incurring a rapid spread of resistant strains. A respiration inhibitor that inhibits aflatoxin production was identified during a screening process for natural, aflatoxin-production inhibitors. This prompted us to evaluate respiration inhibitors as potential aflatoxin control agents. The inhibitory activities of four natural inhibitors, seven synthetic miticides, and nine synthetic fungicides were evaluated on aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus. All of the natural inhibitors (rotenone, siccanin, aptenin A 5, and antimycin A) inhibited fungal aflatoxin production with IC 50 values around 10 µM. Among the synthetic miticides, pyridaben, fluacrypyrim, and tolfenpyrad exhibited strong inhibitory activities with IC 50 values less than 0. 2 µM, whereas <b>cyflumetofen</b> did not show significant inhibitory activity. Of the synthetic fungicides, boscalid, pyribencarb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl demonstrated strong inhibitory activities, with IC 50 values less than 0. 5 µM. Fungal growth was not significantly affected by any of the inhibitors tested at concentrations used. There was no correlation observed between the targets of respiration inhibitors (complexes I, II, and III) and their IC 50 values for aflatoxin-production inhibitory activity. This study suggests that respiration inhibitors, including commonly used pesticides, are useful for aflatoxin control...|$|E
40|$|Among the pests {{that attack}} coffee plants (Coffea spp.), it stands out some species of {{phytophagous}} mites {{which can cause}} significant losses, such as, Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor, 1917) (Acari: Tetranychidae) and Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes, 1939) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae), vector of the coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV). Recent {{studies have indicated that}} stigmaeid mites, mainly of the genera Agistemus and Zetzellia, are important natural enemies of pest mites such as B. phoenicis and O. ilicis. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of various chemical compounds (insecticides, acaricides and fungicides) used in coffee and/or citrus plantations (or under registration) in Brazil on the mite pest B. phoenicis and the predator Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira, 2002 (Acari: Stigmaeidae). Various pesticides were tested, using the concentrations recommended for the control of pests on coffee or citrus plants. The applications were performed in a Potter spray tower. It was evaluated the toxicity of chemicals on the adults of both mite species, besides the effect of compounds on the instantaneous growth rates (ri) of the mites. Abamectin, profenophos + cypermethrin, deltamethrin + triazophos, diafenthiuron, fenpropathrin, spirodiclofen and etoxazole were harmfull to B. phoenicis and A. brasiliensis. <b>Cyflumetofen</b> and malathion caused population reductions in B. phoenicis, but did not affect the population growth of A. brasiliensis. Thiophanate-methyl affected the population growth of both species, but was more toxic to A. brasiliensis. Copper oxychloride reduced only the population growth of the predaceous mite...|$|E
40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae is an {{economically}} important pest in many agricultural crops worldwide. Its high reproductive potential and extremely short life cycle, combined with the frequent acaricide applications usually required to maintain the population below economic threshold, facilitates rapid resistance build-up. This {{has led to the}} development of resistance against almost all commercially used compounds. In this study we tried to unravel the mechanisms behind the resistance against a number of acaricides with different mode of action at the toxicological, biochemical, genetic and molecular level. In a first series of experiments, we investigated pyrethroid resistance in Greek T. urticae strains. Combined data from toxicological bioassays and biochemical and synergistic studies indicated that although enhanced P 450 mono-oxygenase activities were associated with resistance, target site insensitivity proved to be the major resistance component. In order to get a better insight in the latter, a 3. 3 kb cDNA fragment of the T. urticae para sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a degenerate PCR strategy. The T. urticae sequence showed highest identity (56 %) to the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, and was phylogenetically classified within the divergent group of Arachnida. Comparison of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point mutation F 1538 I in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to confer strong resistance to pyrethroids, along with a second mutation (A 1215 D) in the intracellular linker connecting domains II and III, which still has an unknown role. Also, three alternative splicing variants were identified, of which two correspond to the mutually exclusive k/l exon pair already identified in insects. The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed to be almost completely recessive, which is consistent with studies on the target site mechanism for pyrethroids in other organisms. In T. urticae, organophosphate and carbamate resistance is often caused by acetylcholinesterase insensitivity. By combining toxicological, biochemical and molecular data from three reference laboratory and three organophosphate resistant (OP) strains, the AChE 1 mutations associated with resistance in T. urticae were characterised. The resistance ratios of the OP strains varied from 9 to 43 for pirimiphos-methyl, from 78 to 586 for chlorpyrifos, from 8 to 333 for methomyl and from 137 to 4164 for dimethoate. Compared to the reference strains, the insecticide concentration needed to inhibit 50 % of the AChE 1 activity in the OP strains was at least 2. 7, 55, 58 and 31 times higher for the OP pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon and omethoate respectively, and 87 times higher for the carbamate carbaryl. By comparing the AChE 1 sequence between laboratory and OP strains, four amino acid substitutions were detected: (1) F 331 W which was present in all three OP strains; (2) T 280 A found in the three OP strains but not in all clones; (3) G 328 A, found in two OP strains; (4) A 201 S found in only one OP strain. F 331 W, G 328 A and A 201 S are possibly involved in resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. These findings were also confirmed by means of a structural model. F 331 W is probably the most important and the most common in T. urticae. It can be easily detected by a diagnostic PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study. We also evaluated the possible antagonism of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides on the toxicity of bifenazate in T. urticae when applied in mixtures. Bifenazate, a new and frequently used carbazate, is a pro-acaricide which needs to be activated by carboxylesterases. Two OP strains were used and several organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, azinphos methyl and phosmet) and carbamate (carbaryl and methomyl) insecticides were evaluated. Mixing chlorpyrifos with bifenazate strongly decreased bifenazate toxicity in both tested strains. However, in the strain with a higher esterase activity, antagonism decreased after 2 days. Of all other tested chemicals, only methomyl displayed an antagonistic effect 1 day after treatment. These findings indicate that mixing organophosphate and carbamate insecticides with bifenazate may inhibit bifenazate efficacy under field conditions, especially when resistant strains are present. Spirodiclofen, a recently developed and commercialized acaricide, is a selective, non-systemic tetronic acid derivative. In order to develop strategies to minimise resistance in the field to spirodiclofen, we selected a T. urticae population for spirodiclofen resistance in the laboratory. This selection yielded a strain with a resistance ratio of 274, determined on the larval stage. This strain was used to determine genetic, toxicological, biochemical and cross-resistance data. The egg stage of the resistant strain remained far more susceptible than the mobile stages. No cross-resistance was found against other acaricides, except for spiromesifen, another tetronic acid derivative. Based on synergist experiments and enzyme assays, it appeared that especially P 450 mono-oxygenases, but also esterases and glutathione-S-transferases, could be involved in the metabolic detoxification of spirodiclofen. Pre-treatment of the resistant females with the synergists PBO or DEF could increase the inhibitory effect of spirodiclofen on reproduction, again demonstrating the possible involvement of mono-oxygenases and esterases. Among the esterases of T. urticae, probably only a few are more expressed in spirodiclofen resistant strains, and these apparently prefer the purpose-designed substrate 1 -naphthyl 2, 2 -dimethylbutyrate. This was also confirmed by separating esterase isozymes by native isoelectric focusing. Because spirodiclofen interferes with lipid biosynthesis, total lipid content was measured in female adults. No significant differences between treated and non-treated female adults were found, both in the susceptible and resistant strain. However, the total lipid content in the resistant females was significantly higher than in susceptible females. The genetic analysis using crossing experiments showed that the resistance is inherited as an intermediate trait under control of more than one gene. Resistance to spirodiclofen in the laboratory selected strain exceeded by far the recommended field rate, showing the capacity for quick resistance development in the field. A good acaricide resistance management programme is necessary to prevent fast resistance build-up in the field. However, without selection pressure, resistance tends to be unstable and can decrease in the presence of susceptible individuals owing to the intermediate, polygenic inheritance mode. No evidence was found to support the existence of other resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target site (ACCase) or overproduction of the target enzyme. In order to facilitate designing new ACCase inhibitor insecticides and understanding mechanism of resistance to currently used ACCase inhibitors, we tried to clone and express T. urticae ACCase using different expression systems. The most promising results were achieved by a baculovirus expression system and also by heat-shocking Codon Rare E. coli cells with the pET-ACC vector. More efforts should be done to overcome several problems in expressing this enzyme e. g. by optimizing conditions to get higher levels of expression, protein solubility, activity and stability. We also performed a practical screening in Dutch cut rose glasshouses due the fact that growers complained on failing spider mite control. In order to check whether control failure was caused by resistance, the susceptibility of 15 strains, sampled from infested roses, was tested to 11 acaricides: tebufenpyrad, milbemectin, abamectin, <b>cyflumetofen,</b> bifenthrin, spiromesifen, hexythiazox, etoxazole, bifenazate, acequinocyl and chlorpyrifos. Three doses were used to discern between resistance and susceptibility: the recommended field dose (FD), FD/ 5 and FD x 5. Ten of these strains were screened for known resistance mechanism such as elevated detoxifying enzyme activities and previously reported resistance mutations using biochemical and molecular diagnostics. Potential cross-resistance between acaricides was estimated by correlation analysis. The strains showed different levels of resistance to tested acaricides. Twelve out of 15 strains showed resistance against hexythiazox, and 9 out of 15 against bifenthrin and tebufenpyrad. Two strains were found which showed high levels of resistance to most tested insecticides, even against one which has not been registered in Europe. A high correlation was found between some acaricides, e. g. between abamectin and milbemectin. Without selection pressure, resistance seemed to be unstable in most cases, after one year. All field strains had an increased metabolic activity, compared to the susceptible strains. A number of amino acid substitutions known to be involved in resistance to different groups were present in different strains. The best example was the presence of the F 331 W substitution in the acetylcholine esterase, which was present in all field strains tested. The results obtained in this research may all together lead to a better understanding of acaricide resistance in T. urticae, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient resistance management programs...|$|E
