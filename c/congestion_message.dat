40|$|Abstract — VANET (Vehicular Adhoc NETwork) is {{a special}} type of MANET in which moving {{vehicles}} {{are considered to be}} nodes. Vehicular nodes are allowed to forward the road related information like traffic condition, congestion in road, accident, weather condition etc to other vehicles. This information is very useful and valuable to nearby vehicles which will increase the road safety and hence it reduces the <b>congestion.</b> <b>Message</b> transmission will not be effective unless it is reliable. This paper demonstrates Reliable Fuzzy Reputation System (RFRS) which is reliable in terms of forwarding the information in vehicular network. Reliability is achieved by introducing RFRS and Universal Generating Function Techniques (UGFT) method in VANET. RFRS is used to find the selfish nodes from non-selfish nodes and gather the information from selfish nodes and finally forward to other ongoing vehicles effectively. Successful transmission of packets from source node to target node is calculated by using node UGF, UGF of FM (Forward Manager) and UGF of FRM (Fuzzy Reputation Manager). Also we projected an EMAP system- trusted authority, which is responsible for sharing secret keys to all OBUs in network that improves the security.

40|$|Overlay {{networks}} {{relying on}} traditional multicast routing approaches use {{only a single}} path between a sender and a receiver. This path is selected based on latency, {{with the goal of}} achieving fast delivery. Content is routed through links with low latency, ignoring slower links of the network which remain unused. With the increasing size of content on the Internet, this leads to <b>congestion,</b> <b>messages</b> are dropped and have to be retransmitted. A multicast multipath congestion-avoidance routing scheme which uses multiple bottleneck-disjoint paths between senders and receivers was developed, as was a linear programming model of the network to distribute messages intelligently across these paths according to two goals: minimum network usage and load-balancing. The former aims to use as few links as possible to perform routing, while the latter spreads messages across as many links as possible, evenly distributing the traffic. Another technique, called message splitting, was also used. This allows nodes to send a single copy of a message with multiple receivers, which will then be duplicated by a node closer to the receivers and sent along separate paths only when required. The model considers all of the messages in the network and is a global optimisation. Nevertheless, it can be solved quickly for large networks and workloads, with the cost of routing remaining almost entirely the cost of finding multiple paths between senders and receivers. The Gurobi linear programming solver was used to find solutions to the model. This routing approach was implemented in the NS- 3 network simulator. The work is presented as a messaging middleware scheme, which can be applied to any overlay messaging network. Open Acces...|$|R

30|$|For {{congestion}} mitigation, various {{methods are}} proposed. These methods are adapting data transmission rate, redirecting data traffic to different sensors, and using back-pressure techniques to inform neighbor sensor nodes not to forward data. The proposed method in [18] is adjusting the source traffic rates at the upstream nodes to achieve low packet loss probability. Adapting the data transmission rate, which is performed by CODA, Fusion, CCF and I 2 MR {{is the most}} commonly used method for mitigating congestion. In [20], as the <b>congestion</b> notification <b>message</b> is arrived, the non-congested links are marked with the inUse flag. Then the traffic is repartitioned to the non-congested link to prevent congestion and provide fairness. Siphon proposes a virtual sink concept. Virtual sinks are specialized nodes and they are different from the physical sink. They have both primary low power mote radio and secondary long-range radio. For congestion mitigation, instead of changing the event rate, Siphon redirects the packet to the virtual sinks. On the other hand, the SPEED protocol [22] uses a back-pressure re-routing scheme to reduce the congestion in the network.|$|R

This enables accurate high-level modeling of the behavior of the network fabric so that optimized network design, including placement and routing, can occur through high-level network synthesis tools. The chip also shows that when elastic interfaces are used at the boundary of clock synchronization points then efficient domain crossings can occur.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{broadcasting}} protocols {{suffer from}} network <b>congestion,</b> frequent <b>message</b> losses and corruption of broadcast messages {{due to a}} vast number of duplicate packets transmitting in the network. In this paper, we propose an efficient, scalable and reliable broadcast protocol to send a message in the entire network where every node is guaranteed to receive the message with low overhead and minimal cost. The scalability and reliability of broadcast transmission is ensured by composing the entire network in a hierarchy of grids/squares. A higher order square is made up of four lower order squares forming a quad tree architecture. With this grid architecture a node does not need to flood the broadcast packet to the entire network. Rather a node exploits the Geographic Forwarding mechanism to send the packet to a particular square. The rest of the work is done by the very first node receiving the packet destined for that particular grid. This node has now the responsibility to update its own grid with the broadcast packet. The whole procedure is repeated iteratively in every grid. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is reliable, scalable, robust and also outperforms some other promising broadcasting protocols that exist in the current literature...|$|R

30|$|After {{detecting}} the congestion, neighbor sensor nodes should be informed about it. Two common methods {{are used for}} this issue. Congestion can be informed explicitly or implicitly. Protocols which perform notification process explicitly {{send a message to}} the relevant sensor nodes. Other protocols perform this step implicitly by inserting a congestion notification flag into the header of outgoing packets as a piggyback. Explicit notification brings an extra communication overhead to the network. Implicit notification requires fewer packet transmissions, but takes longer to effect. CODA and Fusion use explicit notification to inform neighbor nodes, whereas Siphon [21] and senTCP inform neighbor nodes implicitly. In [18], congestion is also notified implicitly, but the message includes the new rate of each child node instead of the congestion level. In I 2 MR, if an intermediate node detects congestion, it removes all pending packets from its own data transmit buffer and then sends a congestion notification packet, which is relayed reliably by all the upstream nodes along the path, to inform the source explicitly. In [20], congestion is notified explicitly. When the congestion has occurred, a <b>congestion</b> notification <b>message,</b> which contains the node id and path id, is sent back to the sources for each path id known by the node. On the other hand, SUIT does not use either explicit or implicit congestion notification because both methods are too slow to react for preventing congestion in event-based target monitoring applications where targets leave the FoV of sensors within a short interval.|$|R

40|$|Energy-constrained {{wireless}} sensor networks {{often are}} designed to measure a spatio-temporal process that is correlated in space, time, or both. The goal of these datagathering networks is {{a description of the}} process that provides the required fidelity with a minimum expenditure of energy. Our approach combines (1) channel coding and estimation/decision processing of coded messages for innetwork data censoring with (2) estimation of the encoded and censored information at a fusion center where energy is plentiful. Nodes examine their own messages together with messages from preceding nodes, and compute the fidelity of the estimate at the next node as a function of data censoring proposals. Our algorithm exploits redundancy of two types: intra-message redundancy from channel coding, and inter-message redundancy due to spatio-temporal correlation of the samples. This redundancy is used to alleviate overall energy consumption and <b>message</b> <b>congestion</b> near the fusion center by allowing relaying nodes to censor messages that might otherwise be forwarded, if those messages can be inferred from other messages, given the correlation model.

40|$|We are {{witnessing}} a large increase of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments, used to sense, monitor {{and act on}} the environment, because cable-free solutions are easier to deploy. However, in industrial applications, WSNs still aren’t seen as a viable option because of the required fast sampling rates and the reduced time delay, particularly in a multi-hop deployment where traffic <b>congestion</b> may occur. <b>Message</b> losses are unacceptable, particularly in what concerns critical messages containing actuation instructions or other urgent data, which may have time-constraint requirements that cannot be guaranteed. Our research focuses on integrating traffic-aware data processing strategies and network traffic prioritization to overcome congestion states, in order to guarantee that urgent alarms and commands are enacted in time. Traffic is divided into urgent messages (alarms and actuation commands), that have time-delivery requirements; and the remaining periodic sensed data. In this paper we propose an integrated approach NetDP, which applies adaptable data processing strategies (DP) and traffic reduction (DP-Manager) policies to ensure that application requirements are satisfied with minimal message losses, while simultaneously guaranteeing timely delivery of alarms. We demonstrate that NETDP solution with different data processing strategies and levels of system stress can efficiently guarantee the timely delivery of alarms and actuation messages. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of an {{intelligent}} transportation {{system is to}} increase safety, convenience and efficiency in driving. Besides these obvious advantages, the integration of intelligent features and autonomous functionalities on vehicles will lead to major economic benefits from reduced fuel consumption to efficient exploitation of the road network. While giving this information to the driver can be useful, {{there is also the}} possibility of overloading the driver with too much information. Existing vehicles already have some mechanisms to take certain actions if the driver fails to act. Future vehicles will need more complex decision making modules which receive the raw data from all available sources, process this data and inform the driver about the existing or impending situations and suggest, or even take actions. Intelligent vehicles can take advantage of using different sources of data to provide more reliable and more accurate information about driving situations and build a safer driving environment. I have identified five general sources of data which is available for intelligent vehicles: the vehicle itself, cameras on the vehicle, communication between the vehicle and other vehicles, communications between vehicles and roadside units and the driver information. But facing this huge amount of data requires a decision making module to collect this data and provide the best reaction based on the situation. In this thesis, I present a data fusion approach for decision making in vehicles in which a decision making module collects data from the available sources of information and analyses this data and provides the driver with helpful information such as traffic <b>congestion,</b> emergency <b>messages,</b> etc. The proposed approach uses agents to collect the data and the agents cooperate using a black board method to provide the necessary data for the decision making system. The Decision making system benefits from this data and provides the intelligent vehicle applications with the best action(s) to be taken. Overall, the results show that using this data fusion approach for making decision in vehicles shows great potential for improving performance of vehicular systems by reducing travel time and wait time and providing more accurate information about the surrounding environment for vehicles. In addition, the safety of vehicles will increase since the vehicles will be informed about the hazard situations...|$|R

The processors and interconnect networks become faster, {{while the number}} of nodes grows exponentially. Problems of scale emerge, not least of which is collective performance. This thesis identifies and proposes solutions for two major scalability problems. Our first contribution is a novel algorithm for process-partitioning and remapping for exascale systems that has far better time and space scaling than known algorithms. Our evaluations predict an improvement of up to 60 x for large exascale systems and arbitrary reduction in the large temporary buffer space required for generating new communicators. Our second contribution consists of several novel collective algorithms for Clos and torus networks. Known allgather, reduce-scatter, and composite algorithms for Clos networks suffer the worst congestion when the largest messages are exchanged, damaging performance. Known algorithms for torus networks use only one network port, regardless of how many are available. Unlike known algorithms, our algorithms have a small amount of redundant communication. Unlike known algorithms, our algorithms can be reordered so that <b>congestion</b> hinders small <b>messages</b> rather than large, and all ports can be fully used on multi-port torus networks. The redundant communication gives us this flexibility. On a 32 k-node system, we deliver improvements of up to 11 x for the reduce-scatter operation, when the native reduce-satter algorithm does not use special hardware, and 5. 5 x for the allgather operation.

Our first contribution is a low-intrusive method for long-term hardware characteristic measurements of production nodes located at customer sites. Our second contribution is a technique to mimic the hardware usage of a production environment by creating a characteristics model. The cloned environment makes function test suites more realistic. The goal when creating the model is to reduce the system development time by moving late-stage performance testing to early design phases thereby improving the quality of the test environment. The third and final contribution is a network performance improvement where we dynamically trade computational capacity for a message round-trip time reduction when there are CPU cycles to spare. We have implemented an automatic feedback controlled mechanism for transparent message compression resulting in improved messaging performance between interconnected network nodes. Our mechanism continuously evaluates eleven compression algorithms on message stream content and network <b>congestion</b> level. The <b>message</b> subsystem will use the compression algorithm that provides the lowest messaging time. If the message content or network load change, a new evaluation is performed.

Hence, we have designed and implemented an object oriented simulation toolbox to facilitate the experimental studies of Quo Vadis. Our efforts to design such a simulation environment were driven by the need to evaluate heuristic routing strategies and knowledge representation as employed by Quo Vadis. The results of simulation experiments within a grid network clearly demonstrate the ability of Quo Vadis to avoid <b>congestion</b> and minimize <b>message</b> delay under a variety of network load conditions;In order to provide a theoretical framework for the design and analytical study of decision mechanisms as employed by Quo Vadis, we draw upon concepts from the field of utility theory. Based on the concept of reward and cost incurred by messages in the network, utility functions which bias routing decisions so as to yield routes that circumvent congested areas have been designed. The existence of utility functions which yield minimum cost routes in uniform cost networks with a single congested node has been proven rigorously...|$|R
