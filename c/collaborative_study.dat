5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a <b>collaborative</b> <b>study</b> between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E

Previous standards relied on prolactin from animal sources. Purified human prolactin was scarce, heterogeneous, unstable and difficult to characterize. A preparation labelled 81/541 was distributed by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization without official status and given the assigned value of 50 mIU/ampoule based on an earlier <b>collaborative</b> <b>study.</b> It was determined that this preparation behaved anomalously in certain immunoassays and was not suitable as an IS.|$|E

40|$|In 2000, two {{bacteriological}} <b>collaborative</b> <b>studies</b> {{were organized}} by the Dutch National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Salmonella among 23 laboratories participating in the Dutch national programme for control of Salmonella in the poultry sector. The main objective of these studies was to test the capacity of these laboratories to detect Salmonella {{in the presence of}} competitive micro-organisms. Reference capsules containing sublethally injured Salmonella Typhimurium had to be tested for the presence of Salmonella with and without the addition of chicken faeces. The method used in the studies was prescribed by the Product Boards for Livestock, Meat and Eggs. In this method the semi-solid medium MSRV had to be used as the selective enrichment medium. Depending on the results from previous <b>collaborative</b> <b>studies,</b> laboratories had to test 50 or 15 capsules. Only in the first study (study VI) one laboratory tested 50 capsules and this laboratory detected Salmonella from all Salmonella positive capsules. In this study VI 22 (of the 23) and in study VII 18 (of the 21) participating laboratores isolated Salmonella from all 10 Salmonella positive capsules.
