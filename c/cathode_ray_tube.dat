5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E

5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E

5|$|OXO or Noughts and Crosses is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts and crosses. It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. <b>Cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E
