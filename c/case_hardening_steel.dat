40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industry, {{variations in}} machinability are regularly observed when producing {{the same part}} out of different material batches of a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> However, material batches showing a decreased machinability often have properties within the material specification. Thus, for an increased machinability and a more robust production of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> parts, the relationship between microstructure and machinability needs to be further investigated. In this study, machinability has been evaluated for a specific <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> with respect to pearlite nodular size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing of pearlite. These variations in microstructure have been achieved by altering the annealing cycle, i. e. austenitizing temperature, holding time and temperature for pearlite formation. The criterions for machinability which are taken into consideration in this investigation are tool wear and chip formation. Furthermore, a comparison of cutting forces and surface integrity for the tested microstructures will be presented. The results from tests show a difference between material with larger pearlite nodules and a material with smaller pearlite nodules. For tool wear, the material with larger pearlite nodules has a decreased machinability. However, for chip formation the result is opposite, and a material with larger pearlite nodules has an increased machinability...|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} knowledge about how the material specification of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> should be modified in order to create a robust and predictable production process with focus on machinability. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying microstructure variations produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. A standardized milling test was used to assess machinability (with respect to tool wear) as this method has the advantage of only needing small diametrical samples and low material volumes. From the results of the test, it can be concluded that machinability is more influenced by pearlite nodular size than by pearlite morphology. Furthermore, it can be stated that hardness is not a suitable criterion for determining machinability of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> In the manufacturing process of transmission parts (such as gear milling/hobbing) high speed steel tools are commonly used.

The microstructural and mechanical properties of the 0. 05 mass% C- 2. 0 mass% Si- (0. 05 mass% Nb and 0. 05 mass% Ti) steels carburized at 1323 K for 10. 8 ks,quenched from 1123 K- 1223 K and then tempered at 423 K were studied. The maximumtensile and fatigue strength of the 2. 0 mass% Si steel and the 2. 0 mass%Si- (0. 05 mass% Nb and 0. 05 mass% Ti) steel were obtained after quenching from 1123 K and 1223 K, respectively.

40|$|Typical {{products}} made of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> are transmission parts like gear wheels, pinions and crown wheels. Case hardening produces a carbon-rich surface {{and provides the}} parts with both enhanced hardness and fatigue life. However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in case hardening steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for case hardening steels, it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|E

The aim was to determine their tribological behaviour at two different contact pressures. The weight loss of the samples (pins and discs) was determined when possible and the wear coefficient was calculated {{for all of the}} tests. In addition, optical microscopy observations of the wear scars were performed and hardness profiles of the pins were taken from underneath the worn surface into the bulk. The study has shown that, at the lower contact pressure of 50 MPa, ADI outperformed all of the other materials in showing the lowest total wear coefficient for all of the tribo-pairs (pin + disc), and also for all individual samples (pin or disc), except for the ferritic-pearlitic ductile iron pin when paired against quenched and tempered steel. At the higher contact pressure of 1 GPa, ADI outperformed bronze when paired against <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> and showed a valuable increase in wear resistance when paired against itself. At 50 MPa the increased wear resistance of ADI is attributed to a higher initial hardness and slightly larger deformation hardening, while at 1 GPa the better properties are attributed not only to a higher hardness but may also in a small part be due to the deformation induced transformation into martensite.

For that reason the Volvo Standard Machinability Test has been applied, as it allows ranking of materials with respect to their machinability by removing only small amounts of material (~ 800 mm of a bar with 50 mm diameter for each material). In addition to what is described in the standard of the test, a number of observations and experiences have been made. In this article the observations in connection with the Volvo Standard Machinability Test are critically discussed.

Continuous wear is observed to be low for all of the investigated inserts. However, some of the tools show discontinuous wear, like spalling of coating. The discontinuous wear is believed to be caused by unevenness of the forged scale of the machined component and not by variations in the material workpiece bulk properties. Since this wear mechanism may cause a premature tool breakage, it is very important to investigate this finding in more detail.

The cutting forces were monitored in-process, and the residual stress of the machined surface was determined using X-ray diffraction after the experiment. Surface roughness measurements also complemented the results. The results indicated that the cutting forces depend on existing distortion and therefore the volume material removed. It can also be seen that there is little influence on cutting forces with rising cutting speeds. Compressive residual stresses were present after heat treatment, but turned into tensile residual stress states after hard broaching.

In comparison to steels, whose behavior has been studied extensively in the past, titanium aluminides possess a much larger initial work hardening rate, a sharp peak stress and pronounced softening. The work hardening behavior of a TNB-V 4 (Ti– 44. 5 Al– 6. 25 Nb– 0. 8 Mo– 0. 1 B) alloy is studied using isothermal hot compression tests conducted on a Gleeble 3500 simulator, and compared to the typical <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> 25 MoCrS 4.
