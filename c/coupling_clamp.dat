40|$|Mechanical {{stretch and}} {{oxidative}} stress {{have been shown}} to prolong action potential duration (APD) and produce early afterdepolarizations (EADs). Here, we developed a simulation model to study the role of stretch-activated channel (SAC) currents in triggering EADs in ventricular myocytes under oxidative stress. We adapted our <b>coupling</b> <b>clamp</b> circuit so that a model ionic current representing the actual SAC current was injected into ventricular myocytes and added as a real-time current. This current was calculated as ISAC = GSAC * (Vm − ESAC), where GSAC is the stretch-activated conductance, Vm is the membrane potential, and ESAC is the reversal potential. In rat ventricular myocytes, application of GSAC did not produce sustained automaticity or EADs, although turn-on of GSAC did produce some transient automaticity at high levels of GSAC. Exposure of myocytes to 100 μM H 2 O 2 induced significant APD prolongation and increase in intracellular Ca 2 + load and transient, but no EAD or sustained automaticity was generated in the absence of GSAC. However, the combination of GSAC and H 2 O 2 consistently produced EADs at lower levels of GSAC (2. 6 ± 0. 4 nS, n = 14, P < 0. 05). Pacing myocytes at a faster rate further prolonged APD and promoted the development of EADs. SAC activation {{plays an important role in}} facilitating the development of EADs in ventricular myocytes under acute oxidative stress. This mechanism may contribute to the increased propensity to lethal ventricular arrhythmias seen in cardiomyopathies, where the myocardium stretch and oxidative stress generally coexist...|$|E

The {{structure}} of the E. coli clamp loader bound to DNA reveals {{the formation of an}} ATP-dependent spiral of ATPase domains that tracks only the template strand, allowing recognition of both RNA and DNA primers. Unlike hexameric helicases, in which DNA translocation requires distinct conformations of the ATPase domains, the clamp loader spiral is symmetric and is set up to trigger release upon DNA recognition. Specificity for primed DNA arises from blockage {{of the end of the}} primer and accommodation of the emerging template along a surface groove.

An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways.

50|$|Retinal wave {{activity}} {{has been found}} to coincide with the period in which eye-specific retinogeniculate projections are formed. This temporal overlap would be necessary for a causal relationship. TTX injections in fetal cats prevented the formation of eye-specific retinogeniculate projections, which indicates that neuronal activity is necessary for the formation of eye-specific layers. After treatment with epibatidine, the lack of correlated firing in the remaining half of retinal ganglion cells despite the robust firing as well as the lack of eye-specific layer formation can be indicated as proof that the waves play an instructional role. Calcium imaging observation following immunotoxin use showed that some correlated firing still remained where <b>coupled</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> recording showed significant reduction in correlated firing. The remaining correlated firing could explain the formation of eye-specific retinogeniculate projections that was found. Using calcium imaging and MEA recording these cells have shown to have no correlated firing. Instead, reduced firing rates have been observed, and depolarization in one cell seemed to inhibit surrounding cells. The altered firing pattern of the β2-nAChR-KO mice is also controversial as there has been some evidence that correlated firing still occurs in the knock-out mice, as detailed in the next section.|$|R

However, the precise mech-anism(s) by which GLP- 1 treatment renders cardioprotection during myocardial ischemia remain unresolved. Here we examined the role for GLP- 1 treatment on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in normal and ischemic rat hearts following a 30 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion injury, and in isolated cardiomyocytes (CM).

40|$|The {{striatum}} is a {{brain area}} {{implicated in the}} pharmacological action of drugs of abuse. To test the possible involvement of both cocaine and amphetamine in the modulation of synaptic transmission in this nucleus, we <b>coupled</b> whole-cell patch <b>clamp</b> recordings from striatal spiny neurons to the focal stimulation of glutamatergic or GABAergic nerve terminals. We found that neither cocaine (1 - 600 microM) nor amphetamine (0. 3 - 300 microM) significantly affected the glutamate-mediated EPSCs recorded from these cells. Conversely, both pharmacological agents depressed GABA-mediated IPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was mediated by the stimulation of dopamine (DA) D 2 receptors since it was prevented by 3 microM L-sulpiride (a DA D 2 -like receptor antagonist), mimicked by the DA D 2 -like receptor agonist quinpirole (0. 3 - 30 microM), and absent in mice lacking DA D 2 receptors. A presynaptic mechanism was likely involved in this action since both cocaine and amphetamine depress GABAergic transmission by increasing paired-pulse facilitation. Cocaine and amphetamine failed to affect GABAergic IPSCs after 6 -OHDA-induced nigral lesion, indicating that both drugs cause their effects through the release of endogenous DA. The modulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the striatum might underlie some motor and cognitive effects of psychostimulants in mammalians...|$|R

Investigations showed that it belonged to a flat-bottomed barge, at least 16 m long, with nearly vertical side planks connected by iron clamps. We present here the results of wood identification, dendrochronological dating and investigations of wood properties and preservation carried out on timbers from a portion of the vessel. The bottom and side planks of the barge were made of beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). The wood could be dendrochronologically dated using local reference chronologies with a post quem end date of AD 3. The high maximum water content of the wood (690 %), erosion of wood cell walls and degradation of the main cell-wall constituents observed under the microscope using various techniques, indicate poor preservation of the barge wood. Use of beech wood, which has good mechanical properties but very low resistance against decay organisms, and unique <b>coupling</b> with iron <b>clamps</b> indicate that the barge was solidly built.

40|$|A new 6 -degree {{of freedom}} {{dynamometer}} is presented. Six load cells measure the normal forces at the contact points of a three groove kinematic <b>coupling.</b> Three toggle <b>clamps</b> {{are used to}} preload the machine, {{so that it does}} not come apart. The device was designed, analyzed, built and tested. The error will mainly depend on frictional forces, load cells error and the toggle clamps. Frictional forces affect hysteresis, absorption and settlement of the coupling. Different solutions have been designed and tested to reduce friction. First, we tried direct contact between three stainless-steel rods and the stainless-steel load cells. The results were fully distorted due to the high friction of hard steel. We also tried three stainless-steels rods with flexures to contact the steel button cells. The results were much better and more repeatable, but absorption was not good enough. Finally, we tried using Teflon. Teflon is stuck to a steel plate that touches the contact points, leaving Teflon free of high stresses and allowing it to reduce friction between the contacts. The outcome was acceptable. In this case, hysteresis will be reasonably low, absorption is moderate and settlement-based problems are small for small preloads. Fortunately, settlement ability will be improved thanks to vibrations. Future investigations shall look towards low friction solutions, since the sturdiest and most user-friendly design will be the one that minimizes friction during the settlement process. by Jaime Moreu Gamazo.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{electrical}} coupling to be more ubiquitous than previously thought, and coupling through gap junctions is known to {{play a crucial role}} in neuronal function and network output. In particular, current spread through gap junctions may affect the activation of voltage-dependent conductances as well as chemical synaptic release. Using voltage-clamp recordings of two strongly electrically coupled neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion and conductance-based models of these neurons, we identified effects of electrical coupling on the measurement of leak and voltage-gated outward currents, as well as synaptic potentials. Experimental measurements showed that both leak and voltage-gated outward currents are recruited via gap junctions from neurons <b>coupled</b> to the <b>clamped</b> cell. Nevertheless, in spite of the strong coupling between these neurons (~ 23 %), the errors made in estimating voltage-gated conductance parameters were relatively minor (< 10 %). Thus, in many cases isolation of coupled neurons may not be required if a small degree of measurement error of the voltage-gated currents or the synaptic potentials is acceptable. Modeling results show, however, that such errors may be as high as 20 % if the gap junction position is near the recording site or as high as 90 % when measuring smaller voltage-gated ionic currents. Paradoxically, improved space clamp increases the errors due to electrical coupling because voltage control across gap junctions is poor for even the highest realistic coupling conductances. Furthermore, the common procedure of leak subtraction can add an extra error to the conductance measurement, the sign of which depends on the maximal conductance...|$|R
40|$|Several {{reports have}} shown that energy deprivation, {{as a result of}} hypoxia, {{hypoglycaemia}} or ischaemia, depresses excitatory synaptic transmission in virtually all brain areas. How this pathological condition affects inhibitory synaptic transmission is still unclear. In the present in vitro study, we <b>coupled</b> whole-cell patch <b>clamp</b> recordings from striatal neurones with focal stimulation of GABAergic nerve terminals in order to characterize the electrophysiological effects of combined oxygen and glucose deprivation (in vitro ischaemia) on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in this brain area. We found that brief periods (2 - 5 min) of in vitro ischaemia invariably caused a marked depression of IPSC amplitude. This inhibitory effect was fully reversible on removal of the ischaemic challenge. It was coupled with an increased paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting the involvement of presynaptic mechanisms. Accordingly, the ischaemic inhibition of striatal GABAergic IPSCs was not caused by a shift in the reversal potential of GABA(A) -receptor mediated synaptic currents, and was independ- ent of postsynaptic ATP concentrations. Endogenous adenosine, acting on A 1 receptors, appeared responsible for this presynaptic action as the ischaemic depression of IPSCs was prevented by CPT [8 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) adenosine] and DPCPX, two adenosine A 1 receptor antagonists, and mimicked by the application of adenosine in the bathing solution. Conversely, ATP-sensitive potassium channels were not involved in the inhibition of IPSCs by ischaemia, as demonstrated by the fact that tolbutamide and glipizide, two blockers of these channels, were ineffective in preventing this electrophysiological effect. The early depression of GABA-mediated synaptic transmission might {{play a role in the}} development of irreversible neuronal injury in the course of brain ischaemia...|$|R

However, {{it is not clear whether}} insulin resistance is an independent feature of NAFLD, and it remains to be determined which of the in vivo actions of insulin are impaired in this condition. Methods: We performed a twostep (1. 5 and 6 pmol min(- 1) kg(- 1)) euglycaemic insulin <b>clamp</b> <b>coupled</b> with tracer infusion ([6, 6 -H- 2 (2) ] glucose and [H- 2 (5) ] glycerol) and indirect calorimetry in 12 non-obese, normolipidaemic, normotensive, non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and six control subjects. Results: In NAFLD patients, endogenous glucose production (basal and during the clamp) was normal; however, peripheral glucose disposal was markedly decreased (by 30 % and 45 % at the low and high insulin doses, respectively, p< 0. 0001) at higher plasma insulin levels (p = 0. 05), due to impaired glucose oxidation (p = 0. 003) and glycogen synthesis (p< 0. 001). Compared with control subjects, glycerol appearance and lipid oxidation were significantly increased in NAFLD patients in the basal state, and were suppressed by insulin to a lesser extent (p< 0. 05 - 0. 001). The lag phase of the in vitro copper-catalysed peroxidation of LDL particles was significantly shorter in the patients than in the control subjects (48 +/- 12 vs 63 +/- 13 min, p< 0. 04). Lipid oxidation was significantly related to endogenous glucose production, glucose disposal, the degree of hepatic steatosis, and LDL oxidisability.

Studies in insulin resistant rodents show an improvement in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress following antioxidant supplementation. We therefore investigated the potential ameliorative effects of antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants with stable glucose control commenced a randomized cross-over study involving four months of AA (2 × 500 mg/day) or placebo supplementation. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic <b>clamp</b> <b>coupled</b> with infusion of 6, 6 -D 2 glucose. Muscle biopsies were measured for AA concentration and oxidative stress markers that included basal measures (22 ̆ 7, 72 ̆ 7 -dichlorofluorescin [DCFH] oxidation, ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione [GSH/GSSG] and F 2 -Isoprostanes) and insulin-stimulated measures (DCFH oxidation). Antioxidant concentrations, citrate synthase activity and protein abundances of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT 2), total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (ser 473) were also measured in muscle samples. RESULTS: AA supplementation significantly increased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (delta rate of glucose disappearance; ∆Rd) (p= 0. 009), peripheral insulin-sensitivity index (p= 0. 046), skeletal muscle AA concentration (p= 0. 017) and muscle SVCT 2 protein expression (p= 0. 008); but significantly decreased skeletal muscle DCFH oxidation during hyperinsulinaemia (p= 0. 007) when compared with placebo. Total superoxide dismutase activity was also lower following AA supplementation when compared with placebo (p= 0. 006). Basal oxidative stress markers, citrate synthase activity, endogenous glucose production, HbA 1 C and muscle Akt expression were not significantly altered by AA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In summary, oral AA supplementation ameliorates skeletal muscle oxidative stress during hyperinsulinaemia and improves insulin-mediated glucose disposal in people with type 2 diabetes. Findings implicate AA supplementation as a potentially inexpensive, convenient, and effective adjunct therapy {{in the treatment of}} {{insulin resistance}} in people with type 2 diabetes...|$|R

With this model {{is it possible to}} predict how intensive an inductive coupling affect a coaxial cable at his ends. Hence to draw conclusions from, if the device that is connected {{at the end of the}} cable, ensure the complete operability. Modelling Based on measurements of a coaxial cable over a ground plane an advanced model was build, that used an classical approach with T- equivalent circuit. The enhancements are described below. The internal- and external conductor described each with a classical conductor model. To ensuring the symmetry a T-equivalent circuit model is used. Rinnen and Raußen are the DC-resistance of the internal- and external conductor. Linnen and Laußen represent the inductance of the internal- and external conductor. Cinmasse and Cmasse are described the capacitive coupling of each conductor with the ground plane. Additionally to the already used conductor sizes of the coaxial cable the transfer impedance are also used. These transfer impedance was realised with a current-controlled-current-source, a coil, a resistor and a voltage-controlled-voltage-source. With the help of current-controlled-current-source the current through the external conductor are gripped and than routed through the resistor RS with the in series connected coil LS. The resistor RS and the coil LS together build the transfer impedance. Due to the current through the transfer impedance a voltage across the transfer impedance exist. With the voltage-controlled-voltage-source this voltage are given to the internal conductor. This transfer impedance described the complete coupling between internal- and external conductor. The model is shown in figure 1. Final BCI Model To model the complete coaxial cable repeated segments of the visualized equivalent circuit from figure 1 connected together. To complete the model, additionally the BCI clamp is modelled. It is adequate to measure the current at the input of the clamp. To model the clamp a voltage-source is used, that provide a voltage that are equivalent according to amount the lowest measured current. After that a frequency depending voltage-controlled-voltage-source is connected following of a coil. This coil is coupled with the coil of the external conductor at the <b>coupling</b> point (<b>clamp</b> position in reality) of the coaxial cable. figure 1 : Conductor segment of the BCI Modell Comparison between Simulation and Measurement In the frequency range between 10 MHz and 160 MHz measurements was made. In figure 2 is presented a comparison between measurements and simulation. figure 2 : Comparison between simulation and measurements The comparison shows, that the model warranted a good worst-case estimation. Conclusion In the future experiments and simulation with different cable lengths will be made and compared. Also a accurate analysis of the coupling between cable and Clamp is preferable. For that, the transfer impedance of the BCI clamp must be determined. Literature S. Caniggia; L. Vitucci, M. Acquaroli A. Giordano.

40|$|Opto{{mechanical}} system, {{a hybrid}} system where mechanical and optical {{degrees of freedom}} are mutually coupled, is a new platform for studying quantum optics. In a typical optomechanical setup, the cavity is driven by a large amplitude coherent sate of light to enhance the effective optomechanical coupling. This system can be linearized around its classical steady state, and many interesting effects arise from the linearized optomechanical interaction, such as the dynamical modification of {{the properties of the}} mechanical resonator and the modulation of the amplitude and phase of the light coming out the of cavity. When the single-photon optomechanical coupling is comparable to the optical and mechanical loss, we must also keep the nonlinear interactions in the hamiltonian, which make it possible to study optomechanically induced nonlinear phenomena such as photon-blockade, Kerr nonlinearity, etc. In this thesis, we study quantum optics with optomechanical systems both in the linear and nonlinear regime, with emphasis on its applications in force sensing and environmental engineering. We first propose a mirror-in-the-middle system and show that when driving near optomechanical instability, the optomechanical interaction will generate squeezed states of the output light. This system can be used to detect weak forces far below the standard quantum limit. Subsequently, we find that this particular driving scheme can also lead to enhanced optomechanical nonlinearity in a certain regime and by measuring the output field appropriately. We study the photon-blockade effect and discuss the conditions for maximum photon antibunching. We then focus on thermal noise reduction for mechanical resonators, by designing a system of two coupled resonators whose damping is primarily clamping loss. We show that optomechanical <b>coupling</b> to the <b>clamping</b> region enables dynamical control over the coupled mechanical resonator. This leads to the counterintuitive outcome: increasing optical power simultaneously reduces the temperature and linewidth of the mechanical mode, in contrast to direct optomechanical cooling. We also consider the Brillouin scattering induced optomechanical interaction in ring wave-guide resonators where phonon scattering via impurities is present. We find {{that it is possible to}} realize chiral transport behavior of phonons by modifying the phonon environment with optomechanics. We study a simple few-mode theory and it can explain experimental data well. Finally, we study a continuum multi-mode theory and calculate the phonon Green's function using a diagrammatic perturbative expansion, showing that a decrease in the phonon diffusion constant is possible with increasing optical pump power...|$|R
