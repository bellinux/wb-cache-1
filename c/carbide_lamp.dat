25|$|Carbide lamps, {{also known}} as {{acetylene}} gas lamps, are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene which is created by the reaction of calcium carbide with water. The first <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> was invented and patented in New York City on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin.|$|E
25|$|John D. Gill {{was another}} tanker; her cargo did not ignite on {{being hit by}} a torpedo. Instead, the {{surrounding}} water was turned into a blazing inferno after a seaman threw a life ring overboard and its built-in <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> malfunctioned. Almost half the crew died.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are still}} used for mining in some less wealthy countries, {{for example in}} the silver mines near Potosí, Bolivia. <b>Carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> are also still used by some cavers {{exploring}} caves and other underground areas, although they are increasingly being replaced in this use by LED lights.|$|R
50|$|After <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> were {{implicated in}} an Illinois coal-seam methane gas {{explosion}} that killed 54 miners, the 1932 Moweaqua Coal Mine disaster, <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> were less used in United States coal mines. They {{continued to be}} used in the coal pits of other countries, notably Russia and the Ukraine.|$|R
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was originally}} manned, {{and a small}} cottage accommodated the keeper and his family. The last keeper was John Albert Edward Lawson. In March 1920 John Lawson was lost at sea when a small fishing boat capsized. This led to the decision to automate {{the operation of the}} lighthouse, and it was demanned in 1920. The light was converted to an automatic acetylene gas burner (<b>carbide</b> <b>lamp).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{light source}} {{to be used}} should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light {{proceeding}} from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, Modern Conjuring For Amateurs, that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists {{is the use of}} acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp).</b> Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.|$|E

500|$|A {{mine fire}} {{known as the}} Laurel Run mine fire started burning in the {{watershed}} of Solomon Creek since 1915, when a miner accidentally left a <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> hanging from a timber support in the Red Ash Coal Mine. The lamp caused the support to catch fire. The fire may continue into the 22nd century. The fire was contained in 1973, but was not extinguished. Had the fire not been contained, it would have eventually spread under {{the entirety of the}} Wyoming Valley. The fire burns between [...] and [...] underground at a temperature of approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|It was {{constructed}} from concrete bottom (originally {{known as the}} [...] "gas house"), supported by twelve piles, with a copper top and a wooden stakes skirt. It was originally gas powered (probably a <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp),</b> and was later converted to solar power.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structures}} were almost identical, differing mainly in height. The {{structures were}} mostly installed on coral reefs or sandbars, with little natural support. The foundation was usually a flat concrete base with concrete piers supporting the structure. [...] The structure {{was a simple}} four-legged steel frame, manufactured in Brisbane, topped with simple lantern with a small balcony. The apparatus was a fully automatic Dalén light consisting of a <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> feeding on compressed acetylene gas, controlled by a sun valve.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century {{acetylene}} was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns. Most early automobiles used <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> before {{the adoption of}} electric headlights.|$|R
5000|$|Small <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> called [...] "carbide candles" [...] or [...] "smokers" [...] {{are used}} for {{blackening}} rifle sights to reduce glare. They are used because of the sooty flame produced by acetylene.|$|R
50|$|Calcium carbide {{is used in}} <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps.</b> Water {{dripping}} on carbide produces acetylene gas, which {{burns and}} produces light. While these lamps gave steadier and brighter light than candles, they were dangerous in coal mines, where flammable methane gas made them a serious hazard. The presence of flammable gases in coal mines led to miner safety lamps such as the Davy lamp, in which a wire gauze {{reduces the risk of}} methane ignition. <b>Carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> were still used extensively in slate, copper, and tin mines where methane is not a serious hazard. Most miners' lamps have now been replaced by electric lamps.|$|R

50|$|<b>Carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> were {{developed}} around 1900, and remained in use even as electric lamps appeared, {{because of poor}} battery life of the latter designs. The advent of high-efficiency LED lamps eventually displaced incandescent or combustion lamps.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from their}} use as cave {{surveying}} tools, many cavers favour <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> for their durability {{and quality of}} illumination. They were once favoured for their relative illumination per mass of fuel compared to battery powered devices, but this advantage was largely negated {{with the advent of}} high-intensity LED illumination.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>carbide</b> mining <b>lamp</b> {{developed}} in the United States was patented in New York on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin. [...] Another early lamp design is shown in a patent from Duluth, Minnesota on October 21, 1902. In the early 1900s, Gustaf Dalén invented the Dalén light. This combined two of Dalén's previous inventions: the substrate Agamassan and the Sun valve. Inventions and improvements to <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> continued for decades. On March 10, 1925 Andrew Prader of Spokane, Washington was granted a United States Patent, number 1,528,848 for certain new and useful improvements for Acetylene Lamps.|$|R
50|$|Early caving enthusiasts, not yet {{having the}} {{advantage}} of light-weight electrical illumination, introduced the <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> to their hobby. While increasingly replaced by more modern choices, a substantial percentage of cavers still use this method.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{light source}} was a <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp</b> (acetylene gas lamp). It was converted to electric power on 23 March 1966, with an acetylene gas standby. The current light source is a 1,000 watt tungsten-halogen lamp.|$|E
50|$|In 1920 {{the light}} source was {{replaced}} with a <b>carbide</b> <b>lamp,</b> automated and demanned. The characteristic was changed to a flashing one. In 1922, the keeper's house, no longer required, was relocated to Milton {{to be used as}} a doctor's office.|$|E
2500|$|Early road {{vehicles}} used fuelled lamps, before {{the availability of}} electric lighting. The Ford Model T used <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> for headlamps and oil lamps for tail lamps. It did not have all-electric lighting as a standard feature until several years after introduction. Dynamos for automobile headlamps were first fitted around 1908 and became commonplace in 1920s automobiles.|$|R
50|$|Early {{models of}} the Ford Model T {{automobile}} used <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> as headlamps. Acetylene lamps were also used on riverboats for night navigation. The National Museum of Australia has a lamp made in about 1910 that was used on board PS Enterprise, a paddle steamer which has been restored to working order {{and also in the}} museum's collection.|$|R
50|$|Miniger {{entered the}} {{automotive}} industry in 1911. At the time, automobile headlamps were <b>carbide</b> <b>lamps</b> powered by acetylene gas. Two men in Indiana had patented an electric headlamp which Miniger believed would replace gas-powered lamps on automobilies. Mininger purchased the patent rights to this new electric headlight in 1911. Moving back to Toledo, he formed the Auto-liter Company.|$|R
