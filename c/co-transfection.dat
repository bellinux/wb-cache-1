25|$|Scatchard {{analysis}} of radio ligand binding data from 125I-OSM binding {{to a variety}} of OSM responsive cell lines produced curvilinear graphs which the authors interpreted as the presence of two receptor species, a high affinity form with an approximate dissociation constant Kd of 1-10 pM, and a low affinity form of 0.4-1 nM. Subsequently it was shown that the presence of gp130 alone was sufficient to reproduce the low affinity form of the receptor, and <b>co-transfection</b> of COS-7 cells with LIFR and gp130 produced a high affinity receptor. However further experiments demonstrated that not all actions of OSM could be replicated by LIF, that is certain cells that are irresponsive to LIF would respond to OSM. This data hinted to the existence of an additional ligand specific receptor chain which led to the cloning of OSMR. These two receptor complexes, namely gp130/LIFR and gp130/OSMR, were termed the type I and type II Oncostatin-M receptors.|$|E

40|$|In mammals, {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) can mediate sequence-specific RNA interference, activate sequence-independent interferon response, or undergo RNA editing by adenosine deaminases. We {{showed that}} long hairpin dsRNA expression had negligible effects on mammalian somatic cells [...] expressed dsRNA was slightly edited, poorly processed into siRNAs, {{and it did}} not activate the interferon response. At the same time, we noticed reduced reporter expression in transient <b>co-transfections,</b> which was presumably induced by expressed dsRNA. Since transient <b>co-transfections</b> are frequently used for studying gene function, we systematically explored the role of expressed dsRNA in this silencing phenomenon. We demonstrate that dsRNA expressed from transiently transfected plasmids strongly inhibits the expression of co-transfected reporter plasmids but not the expression of endogenous genes or reporters stably integrated in the genome. The inhibition is concentration-dependent, it is found in different cell types, and it is independent of transfection method and dsRNA sequence. The inhibition occurs at the level of translation and involves protein kinase R, which binds the expressed dsRNA. Thus, dsRNA expression represents a hidden danger in transient transfection experiments and {{must be taken into account}} during interpretation of experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranscription of {{the human}} tissue-type {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) gene is regulated by a multi-hormonal responsive enhancer at − 7 kb. Transient <b>co-transfections</b> of Drosophila SL 2 and human HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells with t-PA reporter constructs showed that Sp 1 and Sp 3 activate the t-PA promoter. Moreover Sp 1 (but not Sp 3) binding to the promoter is involved in induction by retinoic acid (RA), a response mediated through the enhancer. The role of Sp 1 is specific, since mutation of the CRE element in the promoter did not affect response to RA. In contrast, the glucocorticoid induction mediated by the enhancer is independent of these Sp 1 and CRE elements...|$|R

We co-transfected four plasmids to test a histidine kinase signaling pathway and mapped the dose dependence of this network on the level of one of its constituents. The chip is readily integrated with high-content imaging, enabling the evaluation of cellular behavior and protein expression dynamics over time.

One important difference between the methods of action of polyplexes and lipoplexes is that polyplexes cannot directly release their DNA load into the cytoplasm. As a result, <b>co-transfection</b> with endosome-lytic agents such as inactivated adenovirus was required to facilitate nanoparticle escape from the endocytic vesicle made during particle uptake.

40|$|Purpose: Cationic {{polymers}} {{have been}} intensively investigated for plasmid-DNA (pDNA), but few studies addressed their use for messenger-RNA (mRNA) delivery. We analyzed {{two types of}} polymers, linear polyethylenimine (l-PEI) and poly-N, N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate P(DMAEMA), to highlight specific requirements {{for the design of}} mRNA delivery reagents. The effect of PEGylation was investigated using P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymer. Methods: The influence of polymer structure on mRNA binding and particle formation was assessed in a side-by-side comparison with pDNA by methods such as agarose-retardation assay and scanning probe microscopy. Transfection studies were performed on bronchial epithelial cells. Results: Binding of cationic polymers inversely correlated with type of nucleic acid. Whereas P(DMAEMA) bound strongly to pDNA, only weak mRNA binding was observed, which was vice versa for l-PEI. Both polymers resulted in self-assembled nanoparticles forming pDNA comple xes of irregular round shape; mRNA particles were significantly smaller and more distinct. Surprisingly, PEGylation improved mRNA binding and transfection efficiency contrary to observations made with pDNA. <b>Co-transfections</b> with free polymer improved mRNA transfection. Conclusions: Gene delivery requires tailor-made design for each type of nucleic acid. PEGylation influenced mRNA-polymer binding efficiency and transfection and may provide a method of further improving mRNA delivery...|$|R

To better understand mechanisms that regulate transcription of CFTR, we examined transcription factors that specifically bind a CFTR CArG-like motif we have previously shown to modulate CFTR expression. Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the CFTR CArG-like motif binds serum response factor both in vitro and in vivo. Transient <b>co-transfections</b> with various SRF expression vector, including dominant-negative forms and small interfering RNA, demonstrated that SRF significantly increases CFTR transcriptional activity in bronchial epithelial cells. Mutagenesis studies suggested {{that in addition to}} SRF other co-factors, such as Yin Yang 1 (YY 1) previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter, are potentially involved in the CFTR regulation. Here, we show that functional interplay between SRF and YY 1 might provide interesting perspectives to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of the basal CFTR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the identification of multiple CArG binding sites in highly conserved CFTR untranslated regions, which form specific SRF complexes, provides direct evidence for a considerable role of SRF in the CFTR transcriptional regulation into specialized epithelial lung cells...|$|R

Thus common biological activities of LIF and OSM are mediated through the type I receptor and OSM specific activities are mediated through the type II receptor.|$|E
50|$|The first protein {{partner of}} JADE1S has been {{identified}} in 2002 in a study searching for new partners of the pVHL, which is a tumor suppressor. A few follow up studies characterized binding and provided some insights on functional interactions of JADE1-pVHL.The human pVHL is mutated in von Hippel-Lindau hereditary disease, and in majority of sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas. Properties and function of pVHL have been investigated for many decades and extensive literature is available. One of the better known functions of pVHL is to mediate protein ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. As a component of ubiquitin ligase E3 complex pVHL binds and targets several known factors, including HIF1a and HIF2a for ubiquitination. Mechanism of HIF1a activation by hypoxia and role of pVHL in this pathway has been reported over a decade ago. The VHL protein has been intensely studied and the link of naturally occurring mutations to cancers established. Other causative HIF-1a-independent pVHL pathways have been considered. The pVHL-JADE1S physical interaction was identified by yeast-two hybrid screening analysis and was further confirmed biochemically. <b>Co-transfection</b> of pVHL increased JADE1S protein half-life and abundance, suggesting potential positive relationship. Certain pVHL cancer-derived truncations but not point mutations diminished pVHL-JADE1 stabilization function, suggesting link to pVHL-associated cancers.Molecular pathways and cellular significance of JADE1-pVHL interactions are not well understood. Single study describing JADE1S intrinsic ubiquitin-ligase activity and ubiquitination of beta-catenin {{has been reported in}} year 2008.

Their ability to be easily grown in culture in large amounts, their responsiveness to FcεRI-mediated triggers {{and the fact that they}} can be genetically manipulated,have provided advantages over primary MCs, in particular for molecular studies relying on genetic screening. Furthermore, the ability to generate clones that stably express proteins of interest, for example, a human receptor, have marked the RBL cells as an attractive MC model for drug screening.

Previously, we reported the preferential skipping of Tau exon 2 in DM 1 brains. In this study, we analyze the alternative splicing of Tau exon 6 which can be inserted in three different forms (c, p and d) depending on the 32 ̆ 7 splice site used. In fact, inclusion of exon 6 c decreases in DM 1 brains compared to control brains whereas inclusion of 6 d increases. Alteration of exon 6 splicing was not observed in DM 1 muscle although this exon was inserted in RNAs from normal muscle and DM 1 splicing alterations were first described in this organ.

Utrophin is transcribed by two independently regulated promoters about 50 kb apart. The upstream promoter is TATA-less and contains a functional GABP binding site which, in muscle, restricts the promoter activity to post-synaptic nuclei. Transient transfections analysis of mutant promoters in rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the upstream promoter contains three functional GC elements that are recognised by Sp 1 and Sp 3 factors in vitro. <b>Co-transfections</b> of the promoter with Sp 1, Sp 3 and GABP factors in Drosophila SL 2 Schneider cells, which lack of endogenous Sp factors, demonstrated that both Sp 1 and Sp 3 are positive regulators of the utrophin promoter and that they activate transcription synergistically with GABP.

Functional domain interaction analysis of Sp 1 and Sp 3 revealed that both factors interact with GABPalpha through their DNA binding zinc finger domain.

Very {{little is known}} about how molecular interplay of these components may determine tissue specificity of hormone action. We have shown previously that retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone (T 3) repress transcription of a specific group of epidermal keratin genes through a novel mechanism that utilizes receptors homodimers. In this paper, we have analyzed the epidermal specificity of RA/T 3 action by testing the role of co-repressors and co-activators in regulation of epidermal genes. Using transient <b>co-transfections,</b> northern blots, antisense oligonucleotides, and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, we found that in the context of specific keratin RE (KRE), co-activators and histone acetylase become co-repressors of the RA/T 3 receptors in the presence of their respective ligands. Conversely, co-repressors and HDAC become co-activators of unliganded T 3 Rα. The receptor–co-activator interaction is intact and occurs through the NR-box. Therefore, the role of co-activator is to associate with liganded receptors whereas the KRE–receptor interaction determines specific transcriptional signal, in this case repression.

To examine the functional difference of the two allelic variants on receptor activity, transient <b>co-transfections</b> were performed in human hepatoma HepG 2 cells activated with EPA, DHA and EPA:DHA mixtures. Results indicate that the addition of EPA or DHA demonstrate potential to increase the transcriptional activity by PPARα with respect to basal level in both variants. Yet, the EPA:DHA mixtures enhanced the transcriptional activity to a greater extent than individual FAs indicating possible additive effects of EPA and DHA. Additionally, the V 162 allelic form of PPARα demonstrated consistently lower transcriptional activation when incubated with EPA, DHA or EPA:DHA mixtures than, the wild-type variant.

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays show that Sp 1 and Sp 3, but not AP- 2, bind to the basal promoter of the human fibulin- 1 gene. The results demonstrate the functional importance of Sp 1 and Sp 3 in regulating {{the expression of the}} fibulin- 1 gene...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) approx. 4300 nucleotide upstream of the rat cytochrome P- 450 CYP 4 A 1 gene. Two members of the steroid-hormone-receptor superfamily, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) and the retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha), bind specifically to this element as a heterodimer, and this element confers responsiveness to the peroxisome proliferator Wyeth- 14, 643 when tested in <b>co-transfection</b> assays. A second element, located 35 nucleotides further upstream, fails to bind PPAR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimers and is unresponsive to Wy- 14, 643 in <b>co-transfection</b> assays. Both elements are, however, responsive to 9 -cis-retinoic acid {{in the presence of}} RXR alpha, when tested in the <b>co-transfection</b> assay. As RXR alpha fails to bind to either element as a homodimer, we suggest that RXR alpha interacts with PPAR alpha to regulate transcription via the proximal element, and interacts with some other cellular factor to regulate transcription via the more distal element. This is consistent with previous reports that a number of peroxisome proliferator-regulated genes contain PPRE-like elements as part of their regulatory sequences, which may be recognized by several receptor combinations. This provides further evidence that PPARs and their co-factors are important in mediating the pleiotropic action of peroxisome proliferators...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of transcription {{of the early}} and late classes of viral genes during infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) requires the prior expression of immediate-early (IE) gene products. The IE gene products can also activate certain cellular and heterologous viral promoters. This paper presents a thorough analysis of trans{{activation of}} the HSV- 1 glycoprotein gD and simian virus 40 early promoters, and two other promoters that are hybrids of both, {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions. Two methods of transactivation (superinfection with virus and <b>co-transfection</b> with isolated IE genes) have been used with all four target promoters in a variety of cell types. The conclusions are: (1) promoter sequence affects the efficiency of promoter activation by infectious HSV- 1 virus, but this activation is not restricted to HSV promoters; (2) cell type affects the efficiency of promoter activation by HSV- 1, and this can lead to a failure to activate a promoter in one cell type but not in others in which activation is generally more efficient; (3) a promoter can be activated to different extents in <b>co-transfection</b> experiments using plasmids carrying isolated IE genes that express Vmw 110 or Vmw 175 or when both are used together; (4) the pattern of activation of a promoter by the IE gene products in <b>co-transfection</b> experiments varies in different cell types; (5) changes in promoter sequence can alter the pattern of activation by the different IE polypeptides, and this pattern can again differ in different cell types; (6) other apparently minor experimental variables, as might exist between the standard methods used in different laboratories, can also affect the patterns of activation observed. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of action of the HSV- 1 IE gene products and the limitations of the <b>co-transfection</b> assay...|$|E
40|$|Haploid {{embryonic}} stem cells (ESCs) are useful for studying mammalian genes because disruption of only one allele can cause loss-of-function phenotypes. Here, we report the use of haploid ESCs and the CRISPR RNA-guided Cas 9 nuclease gene-targeting system to manipulate mammalian genes. <b>Co-transfection</b> of haploid ESCs with vectors expressing Cas 9 nuclease and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet 1, Tet 2, and Tet 3 resulted in the complete disruption of all three genes and caused a loss-of-function phenotype with high efficiency (50 %). <b>Co-transfection</b> of cells with vectors expressing Cas 9 and sgRNAs targeting two loci on the same chromosome resulted {{in the creation of}} a large chromosomal deletion and a large inversion. Thus, the use of the CRISPR system in combination with haploid ESCs provides a powerful platform to manipulate the mammalian genome...|$|E
40|$|The microtubule-associated protein tau is {{important}} to normal neuronal activity in the mammalian nervous system. Aggregated tau is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), structures present in the brains of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Tauopathies include Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP) and the early-onset dementia observed in Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21). Splicing misregulation of adult-specific exon 10 results in expression of abnormal ratios of tau isoforms, leading to FTDP. Positions + 3 to + 19 of the intron downstream of exon 10 define a hotspot: Point mutations in it result in tauopathies. All these mutations increase exon 10 inclusion except for mutation + 19, which almost entirely excludes exon 10. To investigate the tau connection between DS and AD, we examined splicing factors located on chromosome 21 for their effect on tau exon 10. By <b>co-transfections,</b> co-immunoprecipitations and RNAi constructs, we discovered that one of them, hnRNPE 3 (PCBP 3), modestly activates splicing of exon 10 by interacting with its proximal downstream intron around position + 19. These results, coupled with the developmental profile of hnRNPE 3, suggest a pathogenic role for splicing factors on chromosome 21 in neurodegenerative diseases with tangles and create a connection between tau splicing and the early-onset dementia of Down syndrome...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether altered IL 8 methylation status {{is associated with}} increased expression of IL 8 in human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes. MethodsIL 8 expression levels and the percentage CpG methylation in human chondrocytes were quantified by qRT-PCR and pyrosequencing in OA patients and in non-OA osteoporotic controls. The effect of CpG methylation on IL 8 promoter activity was determined using a CpG-free vector; <b>co-transfections</b> with expression vectors encoding nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), AP- 1 and C/EBP were subsequently undertaken to analyse for IL 8 promoter activity in response to changes in methylation status. ResultsIL 8 expression in OA patients was 37 -fold higher than in osteoporotic controls. Three CpG sites in the IL 8 promoter were significantly demethylated in OA patients. Multiple regression analysis revealed {{that the degree of}} methylation of the CpG site located at − 116 -bp was the strongest predictor of IL 8 expression. In vitro DNA methylation was noted to decrease IL 8 promoter basal activity. Furthermore, NF-κB, AP- 1 and C/EBP strongly enhanced IL 8 promoter activity whilst DNA methylation inhibited the effects of these three transcription factors. ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates the key role of DNA methylation status on the expression of IL 8 in human chondrocytes. We demonstrate a quantitative relationship between percentage methylation and gene expression within clinical samples. These studies provide direct evidence linking the activation of IL 8, DNA demethylation and the induction of the OA process with important therapeutic implications therein for patients with this debilitating disease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSerum {{response}} factor (SRF) gene expression in avian embryonic muscle lineages plays {{a central role}} in activating α-actin gene activity. In early stage HH 6 avian embryos, SRF mRNA expression showed strong localization to the neural groove, primitive streak, lateral plate mesoderm, and Hensen's node, while distinct SRF expression was seen later in the neural folds and the somites by HH stage 8. SRF transcripts appeared in the precardiac splanchnic mesoderm in stage HH 9 embryos and was detected at higher levels in the myocardium, somites, and lateral mesoderm of HH 11 embryos. SRF antibody staining demonstrated significant SRF protein accumulation in the myocardium of the developing heart and the myotomal portion of somites. During primary myogenesis in culture, SRF transcripts and nuclear SRF protein content increased about 40 -fold, as primary myoblasts withdrew from the cell cycle, reaching their highest levels prior to the upregulation of the skeletal α-actin gene. A dominant-negative SRF mutant, SRFpm 1, which inhibited DNA binding, but not dimerization of monomeric SRF subunits, blocked transcriptional activation of a skeletal α-actin promoter–luciferase reporter gene during myogenesis. Transcriptional blockade was reversed by <b>co-transfections</b> of a wild-type SRF expression vector, but was not rescued by the expression of other myogenic factors, such as MyoD and Mef- 2 C. Thus, SRF displayed an embryonic expression pattern restricted primarily to striated muscle cell lineages, in which increased mass of nuclear SRF was obligatory for α-actin gene transcription...|$|R
