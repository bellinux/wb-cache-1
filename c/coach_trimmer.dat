5000|$|Born in York, Pennsylvania, Roupas {{lettered}} {{his freshman}} and sophomore seasons for Head <b>Coach</b> Ron <b>Trimmer</b> in the Penn State Commonwealth Campus League at the Penn State York Campus in 1975 through 1977. At University Park, injuries {{at the start}} of his junior and senior years limited his playing. Not to be deterred from his injuries, Roupas helped the team out as a manager, record keeper, and practice body during his rehabilitation. Upon graduation in 1981, Roupas made a United States All-Star team composed of Greek-Americans sponsored by AHEPA. That team toured Greece in June 1982 where Roupas was spotted by Greek basketball coaches and asked to come back the following season and play professionally. [...] Roupas is the first Penn State Nittany Lions Basketball Player to play professional basketball in Greece.|$|R
50|$|By late in 1948, Burlingham {{was able}} to begin {{to move away from}} its {{enforced}} policy of rigid standardisation, helped by a couple of longstanding and influential customers. Local British Electric Traction subsidiary Ribble Motor Services was responsible for the largest share of inter-urban routes in Lancashire, and wished to make more efficient use of its crews on limited-stop services running from the great industrial conurbations in the South, Centre and East of the county, to the seaside resorts in the West. As a result, they commissioned a double-deck lowbridge coach body with 49 seats on 30 Leyland Titan PD1/3 chassis, to the newly authorised 8-foot width. These had full fronts, electrically operated platform doors and <b>coach</b> <b>trim,</b> as well as luxury seating; the outline was generously curved, as were the window outlines. These became famous as the first of Ribble's 'White Lady' coaches. Ribble also took the same outline but with a half cab and 53 bus seats for service duties {{over the next few years}}. Scottish Motor Traction, seeking to publicise the return of peacetime standards on its Edinburgh-London coach service, chose a special Burlingham body for display at the 1948 Commercial Motor Show. This was mounted on the new AEC Regal III coach chassis and had a full front, with the AEC radiator hidden behind a chrome grille arrangement, the whole front of the coach tapering in plan, so that a single full-width windscreen with opening upper section could be fitted, rather than the traditional vertically divided style (as on pre-war fully fronted designs). The ensemble was completed by bulbous front and rear wings and a pair of low-set rectangular headlights. No other bodies were quite like that show coach, but it pointed the way to the future. Incidentally, SMT took Ribble-style double-deck bodies from Burlingham on 20 AEC Regent III chassis in 1950, which incorporated Ribble's post-war style of destination and number-blind glazing, to an irregular hexagonal outline - basically a triangle with the corners chopped off. This style of destination glazing spread over the next few years to become the double-deck standard throughout the Scottish Bus Group until the 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>coach</b> <b>trimmer</b> {{derives from}} the days when car frames were {{produced}} by manufacturers and delivered to coach builders to add a car body and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, soft tops, and roof linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were often an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.|$|E
50|$|The Treasure House is a {{historic}} building located in Staten Island, New York City, New York, US. Samuel Grasset, a tanner and leather worker, built the original construction in approximately 1700. Additions were made in 1740, 1790 and 1860. Subsequent owners {{of the house in}} subsequent centuries include a cord wainer (shoemaker), innkeeper, stonemason, and <b>coach</b> <b>trimmer.</b> A number of local businesses have also occupied the structure. The house was named after a legend that a cache of American Revolutionary War era gold coins was discovered during renovation in about 1860.|$|E
6000|$|... "With mail-coaches, macadamised roads, security, {{ten miles}} an hour, and a vastly {{increased}} revenue, the Post-Office {{seemed to have}} reached the highest heights of prosperity. The heights from which we now look down upon these things ought to make us humble in our estimate of the future! We have far surpassed the wildest dreams of those days, {{but there were some}} points of picturesque interest in which we can never surpass them. Ah! boys," [...] said Solomon, looking up with a gleam of enthusiasm in his eyes, [...] "I mind the old mail-coaches well. They had {{for a long time before}} I knew them reached their best days. It was about the year 1820 that most of the post-roads had been macadamised, and the service had reached its highest state of efficiency. In 1836 there were fifty four-horse mails in England, thirty in Ireland, and ten in Scotland, besides forty-nine two-horse mails in England. Those who have not seen the starting of the mail-coaches from the General Post-Office can never understand the magnificence and excitement of that scene. The <b>coaches</b> were clean, <b>trim,</b> elegant, and glittering; the blood-horses were the finest that could be procured, groomed to perfection, and full of fire; the drivers and guards were tried and trusty men of mettle, in bright scarlet costume--some of the former being lords, baronets, and even parsons! It was a gay and stirring sight when the insides and outsides were seated, when the drivers seized their reins, and the bugles sounded, the whips cracked, the impatient steeds reared, plunged, or sprang away, and the Royal Mails flew from the yard of St. Martin's-le-Grand towards every corner of the Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|The job in Northampton {{lasted only}} three months. Travelling again, {{he passed through}} Leicester, which he {{describes}} as [...] "in a constant ferment", due to [...] "intense distress". In Sheffield, he met the Chartist leader George Julian Harney, and in Leeds worked for seven weeks and addressed meetings there and in the surrounding townships. He stopped briefly in Harrogate, where he had an introduction from his employer in Sherborne to a <b>coach</b> <b>trimmer</b> who had moved there from Dorset, and he finally arrived in Newcastle in September 1842. It is clear that on his travels since Chelmsford, he had become increasingly active as a speaker, and in Newcastle he was advised to take up lecturing as a Chartist orator regularly.|$|E
