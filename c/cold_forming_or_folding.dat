50|$|HFIM, {{acronym for}} high-frequency-impulse-{{measurement}}, {{is a certain}} kind of measurement technique in acoustics, where structure-borne sound signals are detected and processed with certain emphasis on short-lived signals as they are indicative for crack formation in a solid body, mostly steel. The basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as Fourier analysis in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real-time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space. The main benefit of this technique is the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio {{when it comes to the}} separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other, unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise. The technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes, e.g. <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> <b>or</b> machining, where a 100 percent quality control is required or in condition monitoring for e.g. quantifying tool wear.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} materials for lightweight constructions, which has been leading to a steady increase in its consumption for years. Many parts are manufactured by <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> <b>or</b> blanking. Due to the strong tendency to adhesion, aluminum processing is a big challenge. Adhesive wear deteriorates quality of the formed parts and shortens service times of tools. Minimizing wear is the main goal and only possible by improving the understanding of all wear causing interactions. Beside temperature, thermoelectric currents influence the occurring adhesive wear significantly. In order to understand the relationship between thermoelectric currents and wear, a precise measurement of the occurring currents during manufacturing processes is necessary. Therefore, lubricated and dry embossing and blanking operations with the aluminum alloy EN AW 1050 are carried out and the occurring thermoelectric currents are measured...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMicrostructuring is one {{suitable}} {{method to}} improve the tribological properties of surfaces. It leads {{to a reduction in}} friction and wear, especially in highly loaded tribological contacts. There are several machining techniques to generate microstructures, such as laser beam removal, <b>cold</b> <b>forming,</b> etching <b>or</b> fly-cutting. This paper describes a new method to produce microstructured surfaces more economically, based on a two- staged vibration-assisted turning process. During the first step, a specific microstructure is realized by ultrasonic vibration assistance of the turning tool in the direction perpendicular to the workpiece surface. In the subsequent step, the peaks of the obtained microstructured surface are removed by precision turning without vibration. This results in a plateau-shaped and microdimpled surface. The two-staged vibration- assisted turning process offers the advantage that no additional process is required after finishing because the microstructuring process is already part of the finishing operation. The investigated process can easily be integrated into large batch production, e. g., for tribological optimization of powertrain components...|$|R
50|$|Neurulation is the {{development}} of the nervous system in the vertebrates, at the thickened area above the notochord in ectoderms. The neural plate will fold to produce the neural tube which will develop into the brain. Remaining tissue will develop into the spinal cord. Neurula involves the formation of an internal neural tube from an external sheet of cells. The first signs of neurulation are flattening and thickening of the ectoderm overlying the notochord; this thickened area forms a neural plate. The edges of the neural plate that run in an anterior-posterior direction continue to thicken, <b>forming</b> ridges <b>or</b> <b>folds.</b> Between these neural folds, a groove forms and deepens as the folds roll over it to converge on the midline. The fold fuses, forming a cylinder--the neural tube--and a continuous overlying layer of epidermal ectoderm. The neural tube develops bulges at the anterior end, which become the major divisions of the brain. The remaining sections of the tube becomes the spinal cord.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe k-turn is a {{commonly}} occurring structural motif that introduces a tight kink into duplex RNA. In free solution, it can exist in an extended <b>form,</b> <b>or</b> by <b>folding</b> into the kinked structure. Binding of proteins including the L 7 Ae family can induce {{the formation of}} the kinked geometry, raising the question of whether this occurs by passive selection of the kinked structure, or a more active process in which the protein manipulates the RNA structure. We have devised a single-molecule experiment whereby immobilized L 7 Ae protein binds Cy 3 -Cy 5 -labeled RNA from free solution. We find that all bound RNA is in the kinked geometry, with no evidence for transitions to an extended form at the millisecond timescale of the camera. Furthermore, real-time binding experiments provide no evidence for a more extended intermediate even at the earliest times, at a time resolution of 16  ms. The data support a passive conformational selection model by which the protein selects a fraction of RNA that is already in the kinked conformation, thereby drawing the equilibrium into this form...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. 3 CR 12 is a {{corrosion}} resistant steel that {{was developed in the}} 1980 ’s as an alternative to coated mild steel in the construction industry. The low chromium content together with an absence of nickel result in a competitative production cost. It has good welding characteristics when compared to the other ferritic grades. Because of the cost and difficulties involved, structural hot-rolled sections in 3 CR 12 (or any other stainless steel for that matter) are not commercially available. Sections are either <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> <b>or</b> built-up through various welding techniques. Design in <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> stainless steel sections are done in accordance to the SABS 0162 - 4 : 1997 code of practice. In general welded built-up sections should comply with the SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 code of practice. Little is known about the structural behaviour of built-up stainless steel and particularly 3 CR 12 fabricated sections. Currently sections are fabricated using both manual metal arc and laser welding. The effect of using different welding techniques (which has become common practice) is totally unexplored. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate the structural behaviour of built-up 3 CR 12 sections when fabricated by using either manual metal arc or laser welding techniques. The investigation was initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review with specific reference to built-up 3 CR 12 structural sections. This is followed by an experimental investigation utilizing the neutron diffraction technique to determine the typical residual stress profile associated with manual metal arc and laser-welded built-up 3 CR 12 sections. This data is then used as input to a non-linear finite element investigation where the effect of the residual stress profile on the structural integrity of selected axial structural members (columns) is evaluated. An experimental program where a selected number of full scale fabricated sections were tested as axial members was then conducted to act as comparison and validation of the numerical model. The research found that both the welding techniques investigated may be successfully used to fabricate the structural sections. There is however a distinct difference in the residual stress profile within the sections between the two welding techniques. Laser welding induces smaller compressive residual stresses in the flange end regions when compared to manual metal arc welding. This has a beneficial effect on the axial buckling strength of the axial members. The difference could be up to about 8 % depending on the slenderness ratio and the column in question. SANS 0162 - 1 : 2005 was found to adequately describe the column behaviour for the sections tested as far as design is concerned...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{oligomers}} {{equipped with}} complementary H-bond donor (D) and acceptor (A) sites can interact via intermolecular H-bonds to <b>form</b> duplexes <b>or</b> <b>fold</b> via intramolecular H-bonds. These competing equilibria have been quantified using NMR titration and dilution experiments for seven systems featuring different recognition sites and backbones. For all seven architectures, duplex formation is observed for homo-sequence 2 -mers (AA·DD) {{where there are}} no competing folding equilibria. The corresponding hetero-sequence AD 2 -mers also form duplexes, but the observed self-association constants are strongly affected by folding equilibria in the monomeric states. When the backbone is flexible (five or more rotatable bonds separating the recognition sites), intramolecular H-bonding is favored, and the folded state is highly populated. For these systems, the stability of the AD·AD duplex is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding AA·DD duplex. However, for three architectures which have more rigid backbones (fewer than five rotatable bonds), intramolecular interactions are not observed, and folding does not compete with duplex formation. These systems are promising candidates for the development of longer, mixed-sequence synthetic information molecules that show sequence-selective duplex formation.

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} aluminium {{wrought alloys}} {{as well as}} powder metallurgical aluminium alloys are limited regarding massive formability. The formability at room temperature can be significantly affected by superimposing hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the process control, <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> enables locally induced strain hardening effects, whereby increased hardness or hardness gradients can be regulated. Simultaneously, the necessity of mechanical post processing is reduced by a metal forming fabrication of joint and connection elements at room temperature. By splitting the component in strengthened and not strengthened regions, specially adapted property profiles can be adjusted to the application. Thus, specially load adapted components with locally optimised property profiles e. g. ductile or high strength, brittle areas can be manufactured. A defined buckling <b>or</b> <b>folding</b> of a component {{in case of a}} crash can thereby be achieved. In this project innovative tool principles for superimposed <b>cold</b> solid <b>forming</b> will be developed.

A brittle failure of a heavy wall Alloy 800 H reactor vessel after 6 months service was the starting point of a Joint Industrial Programme (JIP) with 30 partners. The research was focused to assess the key factors concerning relaxation cracking and how to control it. It included the effect of chemical composition of the base materials (both Fe and Ni base alloys), heat to heat variation, grain size, cold deformation, welding, operating temperature and heat treatments. More than 40 base materials and 60 welded joints were included. Many austenitic materials showed to be susceptible for relaxation cracking, especially in the welded condition and after cold deformation. Heat treatments are very effective to avoid this {{degradation mechanism}}. The JIP ended up with an Equipment Degradation Document and a Recommended Practice. To date relaxation cracking failures can be avoided by a correct selection of base materials, welding consumables and heat treatments. In-field experiences with equipment manufactured based on knowledge gained within the JIP are supporting the outcome of the results, no failures have been encountered anymore. However, failures are still identified at companies who are still not aware of the degradation mechanism relaxation cracking. © 2007 by NACE International...|$|R
