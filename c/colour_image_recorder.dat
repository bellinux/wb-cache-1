40|$|Most {{digital cameras}} use a single image sensor to capture <b>colour</b> <b>images.</b> As a result, only one colour at each pixel {{location}} is acquired. Demosaicking {{is a technique}} to estimate all the other missing colour pixel information {{in order to produce}} a full <b>colour</b> <b>image,</b> while inverse demosaicking refers to the recovery of the single image sensor values from the full <b>colour</b> <b>image.</b> Early digital cameras using primitive demosaicking algorithms to produce a full <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> have resulted in inferior quality <b>images</b> with <b>colour</b> artifacts. Generally, the removal of those artifacts is not achievable by the application of direct filtering. If we can recover the actual image sensor values from a full <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> and re-demosaic it again using state-of-the-art recently developed demosaicking algorithms, a better image can be produced without filtering. In this paper, a novel technique using wavelet transform is proposed to inverse demosaic a full <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> in order to recover the actual sensor values. It is then re-demosaicked using an advanced recently developed demosaicking method to reproduce an output <b>image</b> with minimal <b>colour</b> artifacts...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A {{number of studies have}} shown {{that it is possible to}} use a colour codebook, which has a limited number of colours (typically 100 - 200), to replace the colour gamut and obtain a good quality reconstructed <b>colour</b> <b>image.</b> Thus <b>colour</b> <b>images</b> can be displayed on less expensive devices retaining high quality and can be stored in less space. However, a colour codebook is normally randomly arranged and the coded image, which is referred to as the index image, has no structure. This prevents the use of this kind of <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> representation in any further image processing. The objective of the research described in this thesis is to explore the possibility of making the index image meaningful, that is, the index image can retain the structure existing in the original full <b>colour</b> <b>image,</b> such as correlation and edges. In this way, a three band <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> represented by <b>colour</b> vectors can be transfomled into a one band index image represented by scalar variables. To achieve the scalar representation of <b>colour</b> <b>images,</b> the <b>colour</b> codebook must be ordered to satisfy the following two conditions: (I) codewords representing similar colours must be close together in the code book and (2) close code words in the codebook must represent similar colours. Some effective methods are proposed for ordering the colour codebook. First, several grouping strategies are suggested for grouping the code words representing similar colours together. Second, an ordering function is designed, which gives a quantity. measurement of the satisfaction of the two conditions of an ordered codebook. The code book ordering is then iteratively refined by the ordering function. Finally, techniques, such as artificial codeword insertion, are developed to refine the code book ordering further. A number of algorithms for colour codebook ordering have been tried to retain as much structure in the index image as possible. The efficiency of the algorithms for ordering a colour codebook has been tested by applying some image processing techniques to the index <b>image.</b> A VQ/DCT <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> coding scheme has been developed to test the possibility of compressing and decompressing the index image. Edge detection is applied to the index image to test how well the edges existing in the original <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> can be retained in the index image. Experiments demonstrate that the index image can retain a lot of structure existing in the original <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> if the codebook is ordered by an appreciate ordering algorithm, such as the PNNbased/ ordering function method together with artificial codeword insertion. Then further image processing techniques, such as image compression and edge detection, can be applied to the index image. In this way, <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> processing can be realized by index image processing in the same way as monochrome image processing. In this sense, a three-band <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> represented by <b>colour</b> vectors is transformed into a single band index image represented by scalar variables...|$|R

As, the available approaches for <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> steganography are using chaos-based and symmetric-key based cryptographic algorithms are not efficient and good for bulky data. However, the hash-based algorithms based approaches are considerably better in terms of providing better speed but these approaches are vulnerable in terms of providing security due to inherent flaws caused by used checksum approach. The key reason of vulnerability is that the used algorithms in such approaches such as MD 5 and SHA- 2 have flaws. In our approach, we purpose the use of perfect hashfunction algorithm to provide a secure and fast approach for <b>colour</b> <b>image</b> steganography. We also present a prototype tool in this paper that is implementation of the presented approach and is also a proof of concept. Another contribution of the approach is that the presented approach can be used for coding data in any type of <b>colour</b> <b>images</b> such as bmp, jpeg, gif, and tiff as other available approaches are file format specific. The results of the initial experiments are very encouraging and support not only the used approach but also uphold the potential of the presented approach in general.
