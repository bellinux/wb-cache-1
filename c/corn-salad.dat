It finished in its eleventh edition in 1857. It was modeled on a traditional English formula, of month-by-month instructions on planting, pruning, and soil preparation for the [...] "Kitchen Garden, Fruit Garden, Orchard, Vineyard, Nursery, Pleasure Ground, Flower Garden, Green House, Hot house and Forcing Frames". In some particulars, McMahon followed his English models so closely that J. C. Loudon suggested in 1826 that the derivative character of the Calendar was such that [...] "We cannot gather from the work any thing as to the extent of American practice in these particulars." [...] Ann Leighton notes the absence of Indian corn among the [...] "Seeds of Esculent Vegetables" [...] in 1806, though he lists old-fashioned favorites like coriander, <b>corn-salad,</b> orach, rampion, rocambole and skirret.|$|E
