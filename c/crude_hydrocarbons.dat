The most effective amongst all, as regards biodegradation, were the consortia of Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp. strains. The results indicated that the natural surfactants (rhamnolipides and saponins) are more effective surfactants in hydrocarbon biodegradation as compared to Triton X- 100.

40|$|Clay {{minerals}} are {{the most}} abundant minerals near the earth’s surface and play very important roles in biogeochemical processes. They have been found very useful in various industrial applications. The surface properties of clay minerals such as high specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) make them able to act as catalysts, supports and sorbents of toxic and radioactive chemicals. However, their role during the biodegradation of <b>crude</b> oil <b>hydrocarbons</b> is not well understood. The main aim of this research project {{was to investigate the}} capabilities of the various forms and types of clay minerals in supporting the microbial degradation of <b>crude</b> oil <b>hydrocarbons</b> so as to gain better understanding of their potential role in the bioremediation of oil polluted sites. The role of clays in hydrocarbon removal was investigated in aqueous clay/oil microcosm experiments with a hydrocarbon degrading microorganism community. The clays used for this study were bentonite, palygorskite, saponite and kaolinite. Clays were treated to produce acid activated clays and organoclays; homoionic interlayer bentonites were also used in this study. The study identified volatilization and adsorption as processes that will take place alongside biodegradation and therefore needed to be accounted for in the assessment {{of the effects of the}} clays. The study indicated that acid activated clays, organoclays, untreated kaolinite, K-bentonite, Zn-bentonite and Cr-bentonite were inhibitory to biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, via different mechanisms, whereas Ca-bentonite and Fe-bentonite were stimulatory to biodegradation with about 80 % removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) due to biodegradation. The ‘local bridging effect’ and polarization of the interlayer water were identified as two opposing influences arising from the interlayer cations of clay minerals that probably determine the extent of biodegradation of the hydrocarbons. Adsorption of hydrocarbons was significant during biodegradation especially with unmodified palygorskite, Zn-bentonite and K-bentonite as each of them caused more than 40 % removal of TPH by adsorption in the experimental microcosm containing 5 : 1 ratio (w/w) of clay to oil. The process of adsorption of aromatic compounds in the crude oil was believed to take place via cation-π interactions. The correlation between extent of biodegradation and surface area is more robust than that between extent of biodegradation and CEC. The same trend applies with adsorption indicating that both biodegradation and adsorption are more surface area dependent than CEC.

This was demonstrated to be technically feasible for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which is the main refinery process for producing gasoline. However, co-processing leads to more coke formation and to a more aromatic gasoline fraction. A detailed understanding is necessary on how the oxygenated moieties effect the reaction mechanism to further improve the process/catalysts. Moreover, for technical and marketing reasons, it is absolutely required to accurately determine the proportion of renewable molecules in the commercialized products. The carbon- 14 method (also called radiocarbon or C- 14) has been used as the most accurate and powerful method to discriminate fossil carbon from bio-carbon, since fossil fuel is virtually C- 14 -free, while biofuel contains the present-day "natural" amount of C- 14. This technique has shown that not all FCC products share bio-carbon statistically. The coke formed during a FCC cycle {{and to a lesser extent}} the gases are found richer in C- 14 than gasoline.

CFE biomass-C, dehydrogenase and arylsulfatase activity were enhanced with the occurrence of crude oil. Using these parameters for purposes of controlling remediation and recultivation success {{it is not possible}} to distinguish bctween promotion of microbial activity by oil carbon or soil organic carbon (SOC). For this reason we think that these parameters are not appropriate to indicate a soil damage by an oil impact. In contrast the metabolie quotient (qC 02), calculated as the ratio between soil basal respiration and the SIR biomass-C was adequate to indicate a high crude oil contamination in soil. Also, the ß-glucosidase activity (parameter ß-GL/SOC) was correlated negatively with oil in soil. The indication of a soil damage by using the stress parameter qCO, or the specific enzyme activities (activity/SOC) minimizes the promotion effect of the recent SOC content on microbial parameters. Both biomass methods (SIR, CFE) have technical problems in application for crude oil-contaminated and subarctic soils. CFE does not reflect the low C_mic level of the cold tundra soils.

Analyses of types of heteroatoms present (S 1, S 2, S 3, OS, OS 2, O 2 S, NS, and NOS compounds) suggest that marine shales from the Dalong Formation {{are mainly composed of}} carboxylic acids (O 2 compounds) with a high abundance of fatty acids, indicating a marine phytoplankton organic source. However, lacustrine shales from the Lucaogou Formation are dominated by pyrrolic compounds (N 1 compounds) with abundant dibenzocarbazole. It suggests that the organic source materials may be derived from lower aquatic organisms and lacustrine algae. Overall, FT-ICR-MS has potential for applications in analyses and determination of depositional environments and organic sources in petroleum geology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{exploitation}} of petroleum has generated various sources of pollution in soil. In order {{to resolve this}} problem, several techniques have been developed. Physical and chemical methods are the most widely methods used for land treatment of oil polluted soils. These methods are expensive, ineffective and could {{cause a lot of}} damages on soil. The biological methods are not expensive and do not cause changes in the soil physical and chemical characteristics. Bioremediation is based on the capacity of microorganisms to degrade organic pollutant compounds, such as hydrocarbons. This study presents the preliminary results of a bioremediation alternative for soils polluted with <b>crude</b> oil (petroleum <b>hydrocarbons).</b> The bioremediation was achieved by increasing the microbial population by adding the fibers provided from celluloid wastes and bacteria inoculum. The paper presents the effect of a bioremediation treatment applied to a cambic chernozem polluted with 50000 mg kg- 1 (5 % crude oil) and 100000 mg kg- 1 (10 % crude oil) of a complex mixture of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) ...|$|R
5000|$|Petroleum oil is toxic {{for most}} life forms and {{pollution}} {{of the environment}} by oil causes major ecological problems. A considerable amount of petroleum oil entering the sea is eliminated by the microbial biodegradation activities of microbial communities. A. borkumensis is a recently discovered hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium and {{is probably the most}} important global oil degrader. [...] A. borkumensis is capable of degrading oil in seawater environments. It is known as a hydrocarbonoclastic organism, with the root ‘clastic’ meaning it can divide something into parts (in this case <b>hydrocarbons).</b> <b>Crude</b> oil, or petroleum, is predominantly made up of hydrocarbons, a product that consists of a long chain of carbon atoms attached to hydrogen atoms. Whereas most organisms use sugars or amino acids for their source of carbon/energy, A. borkumensis uses alkanes, a type of hydrocarbon, in its metabolic process. This diet allows A. borkumensis to flourish in marine environments that have been affected by oil spills. Through its metabolism, A. borkumensis can break down oil into harmless compounds. This ability makes this particular species a major potential source for bioremediation of oil-polluted marine environments.|$|R
