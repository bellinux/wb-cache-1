5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 3 August 1914, Józef Piłsudski formed a small <b>cadre</b> military unit, the First <b>Cadre</b> Company—the predecessor of the Polish Legions—which set out from Kraków {{to fight for the}} liberation of Poland. The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914. Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the Polish Liquidation Committee assumed power.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, on 3 August in Kraków, Piłsudski formed a small <b>cadre</b> military unit, the First <b>Cadre</b> Company, {{from members of the}} Riflemen's Association and Polish Rifle Squads. That same day, a cavalry unit under Władysław Belina-Prażmowski was sent to reconnoitre across the Russian border, even before the official declaration of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|The Institut français du cheval et de l'équitation (French Institute of Horse Riding), the École {{nationale}} d'équitation (National Riding School) and the <b>Cadre</b> Noir all use mainly Selle Français. Young {{horses are}} selected {{according to their}} skills and are trained by students within the schools. Horses representing the <b>Cadre</b> Noir are selected {{at the age of}} three and are trained according to their abilities, with some reaching the highest levels of haute ecole dressage. Selle Français are also used for combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding, and have competed at the international level in all three sports.|$|E
30|$|Immediately {{following}} the liberation, {{the majority of}} official positions were occupied by local <b>cadres</b> with revolutionary experience in guerrilla counties. Since the southbound <b>cadres</b> took over the power of all counties, the situation had reversed. Whether in guerrilla counties or not, the party secretaries and the county heads were usually southbound <b>cadres</b> and local <b>cadres</b> serving in section-level (科级) positions or below. Nonetheless, in guerrilla counties the local <b>cadres</b> seemed more powerful. Between 1950 and 1966, local <b>cadres</b> filled 32  % of county-level or vice-county-level positions in guerrilla counties, whereas only 14  % of similar positions were filled by native <b>cadres</b> in no guerrilla counties.|$|R
30|$|After {{southbound}} <b>cadres</b> {{took control}} of local governments in some counties with a weak guerrilla tradition such as Lishui County, they promoted {{a large number of}} young <b>cadres</b> during the land reform (referred to as “land reform cadres,” 土改干部) to replace guerrilla <b>cadres.</b> However, in counties with strong guerrilla forces such as Yueqing, Cixi, Wenling, or Jinhua, the majority of <b>cadres</b> at the grassroots level were from local guerrilla forces. Our study suggests that due to their marginalized positions in local politics, local <b>cadres</b> with guerrilla backgrounds were forced to adopt policies that protected the local interests, hoping to win the support of the grassroots elites. It is worth noting that although the land reform <b>cadres</b> were local <b>cadres,</b> {{they were more likely to}} implement policies favored by high-level officials because their power derived from higher-level governments. In addition, informal ties among land reform <b>cadres</b> were weak such that they were unable to take collective actions as guerrilla <b>cadres.</b>|$|R
30|$|Although guerrilla <b>cadres</b> {{tried to}} {{mitigate}} {{the negative effects of}} “leftist” economic policies behind the scenes, they were forced to publicly comply with these policies in the 1950 s and 1960 s, given the dominant role of southbound <b>cadres</b> in local authorities. Precisely because guerrilla <b>cadres</b> protected the interests of grassroots elites and maintained a good relationship with the masses, they were more insulated from mass movements during the Cultural Revolution (CR). In contrast, the influence of southbound <b>cadres</b> was largely weakened during the CR. Beginning in the 1970 s, the relative de facto power of southbound and guerrilla <b>cadres</b> shifted in local governments. Although southbound <b>cadres</b> still {{played a major role in}} county-level and city-level governments, the political influence of guerrilla <b>cadres</b> began to increase.|$|R
5|$|After the war, the 2/15th {{remained}} on Brunei until November when it moved to Mempakul as personnel {{were returned to}} Australia in drafts based on priority of discharge. A small group of personnel volunteered {{at this time to}} undertake occupation duties in Japan and were subsequently transferred to the 66th or 67th Battalions. In early December, the battalion's vehicles were returned and after the appropriate clearances were received, the remaining <b>cadre</b> was transported to Labuan. From there, they sailed back to Australia aboard the Pachaug Victory, arriving at Brett's Wharf, in Brisbane on 19 December. The <b>cadre</b> moved into a camp at Chermside, where they completed unloading of stores and equipment before a short Christmas leave. Early in the new year, the final administrative tasks were completed and the last group of personnel were posted for demobilisation and discharge. Finally, the 2/15th was officially disbanded on 21 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war <b>cadre</b> of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army.

5|$|Consequently, {{under the}} socialist Second Republic, French {{instructors}} and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared {{the language of}} instruction and a large <b>cadre</b> of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.|$|E

30|$|The {{industrial}} and commercial {{markets in the}} rural areas of Zhejiang emerged and flourished during the CR. The development of markets not only benefited from the central government’s reorientation in economic policy around 1970 but was also a political consequence of the CR changing the power configuration of local politics. In our field interviews in Wenzhou, we noticed that compared to southbound <b>cadres,</b> guerrilla <b>cadres</b> were better able to protect themselves due to mass support during the CR and were soon rehabilitated in the 1970 s. 18 Although the majority of the leading positions in county-level and prefecture-level governments of Zhejiang were still occupied by southbound <b>cadres</b> in the 1970 s, their ability to exert political pressure on local guerrilla <b>cadres</b> gradually weakened. As a consequence, guerrilla <b>cadres</b> were able to promote their market-preserving policies to a larger extent. Furthermore, {{it is worth noting that}} this mass support helped the guerrilla <b>cadres</b> survive during the CR. We found in interviews that the southbound <b>cadres</b> of Wenzhou had tried to mobilize peasants to denounce guerrilla <b>cadres</b> during the “Four Clean-ups” Movement (四清运动), but the peasants refused to cooperate with the working groups sent by the higher-level government and thus protected the guerrilla <b>cadres.</b>|$|R

The brigade's battalions all had the same composition: three rifle companies, each comprising a company headquarters, and three platoons. Each had a Support Company of mortar, machine gun and carrier platoons, along with a Headquarters Company. The brigade's first commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Smyth, was replaced by Brigadier John Hackett on 4January 1943.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, {{including}} 595 {{child soldiers}} surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Approximately 150 hardcore LTTE <b>cadres</b> and 1,000 mid-level <b>cadres</b> escaped to India. The government took action to rehabilitate the surrendered <b>cadres</b> under a National Action Plan for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants while allegations of torture, rape, and murder were reported by international human rights bodies. They were divided into three categories; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcibly recruited (including child soldiers). Twenty-four rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa, and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended <b>cadres,</b> there had been about 700 hardcore members.

5|$|During World War II, the {{squadron}} flew Lockheed Hudson bombers in the Malayan and Dutch East Indies campaigns, suffering severe losses before being reduced to <b>cadre</b> in 1942. It was re-formed with Bristol Beauforts the following year, and re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquitos in 1945 for further {{operations in the}} Dutch East Indies. Reduced to <b>cadre</b> once more after the war ended, No. 1 Squadron was re-established at Amberley in 1948 as an Avro Lincoln heavy bomber unit. From 1950 to 1958 it was based in Singapore, flying missions during the Malayan Emergency, where it bore {{the brunt of the}} Commonwealth air campaign against communist guerillas. When it returned to Australia it re-equipped with English Electric Canberra jet bombers. It operated McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms from 1970 to 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber. The F-111 remained in service for 37 years until replaced by the Super Hornet in 2010. In 2014–15, and again in 2017, a detachment of Super Hornets was deployed to the Middle East as part of Australia's contribution to the military intervention against ISIL.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the {{division}} fought briefly against Soviet forces in southern Hungary in early October 1944 alongside the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. They were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun a move to the German puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, to join the 13th SS Division when the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the Kama division mutinied on 17 October 1944. The <b>cadre</b> quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in {{the division}} being formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.|$|E
30|$|More importantly, local <b>cadres</b> {{are more}} likely to be {{attacked}} by political rivals if they lack political support from the masses and grassroots <b>cadres.</b> Under China’s political system, higher-level officials are unable to unilaterally launch large-scale purges of certain kinds of officials. In order to achieve their goals, they must take advantage of political movements launched by the party center and mobilize grassroots <b>cadres</b> and the masses to denounce their political rivals. Thus, if the <b>cadres</b> have broad political support from grassroots <b>cadres</b> and the masses, it is difficult to purge them through political movements. Moreover, they can take advantage of the mass movements to mitigate the pressure from power conflicts.|$|R
