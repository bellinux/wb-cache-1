40|$|The <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> <b>anaemias</b> (CDAs) are a {{group of}} rare {{hereditary}} disorders characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities in the erythroblasts. Patients may present with jaundice or with symptoms of anaemia, gall stones or iron overload. The diagnosis can be challenging and cases have been confused with haemolytic anaemia, haemochromatosis or a haemoglobinopathy. A delayed diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment or delayed management of iron overload.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> <b>anaemias</b> (CDAs) are heterogeneous, {{hereditary}} disorders hallmarked by ineffective erythropoiesis {{and tissue}} iron overload. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF 15) was suggested to mediate iron overload in iron-loading anaemias, {{such as the}} thalassaemias and CDAI by suppressing hepcidin, the key regulator of iron absorption. Here, we show that serum GDF 15 concentrations are elevated in subjects with CDAI and CDAII. Despite similar disease characteristics, CDAI patients present with significantly higher GDF 15 concentrations compared to CDAII patients. Hepcidin concentrations are inappropriately low in CDAII patients considering the severe hepatic iron overload associated with this disorder. GDF 15 significantly correlates with the degree of anaemia (Hb), the response of erythropoiesis (reticulocyte index) {{as well as with}} iron availability in the serum (transferrin saturation). The observation that GDF 15 is elevated in CDAII patients is consistent with the proposal that GDF 15 is among the erythroid factors down-regulating hepcidin and contributing to iron overload in conditions of dyserythropoiesis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemias {{belong to}} a group of {{inherited}} conditions characterized by a maturation arrest during erythropoiesis with a reduced reticulocyte production in contrast with erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{discovery}} of the gene responsible for most cases of hereditary haemochromatosis {{has made it possible}} to evaluate the role of this gene in iron accumulation in other conditions. Previous observations in patients with various inherited anaemias are suggestive of a role of the haemochromatosis gene in the noniatrogenic form of iron overload that may occur in these conditions. METHODS: We studied two brothers with <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> <b>anaemia</b> type II, presenting with marked noniatrogenic iron overload. Young age, familial occurrence, concordance of iron overload, and histology were all suggestive of a genetic basis for the iron overload. A search for C 282 Y, H 63 D, S 65 C, and IVS 3 + 1 G?T mutations was performed by polymerase chain reaction after extraction of genomic DNA from whole blood. RESULTS: A search for the C 282 Y, H 63 D, S 65 C, and IVS 3 + 1 G?T mutations in the HFE gene proved to be negative. Despite the existence of ineffective erythropoiesis with mild anaemia, both patients were treated with regular phlebotomies in order to prevent long-term complications of their iron-overload. This treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: 1. C 282 Y, H 63 D, S 65 C, and IVS 3 + 1 G?T mutations were negative in two brothers with <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> in whom young age, familial occurrence, concordance of iron overload, and the histological pattern were all suggestive of hereditary haemochromatosis. 2.

A {{high proportion of}} the erythroblasts displayed the characteristic "Swiss cheese" abnormality of the nuclear chromatin and some also showed cytoplasmic intrusions lined with nuclear membrane within the nucleus. Occasional erythroblast profiles contained intracytoplasmic inclusions that were ultrastructurally indistinguishable from precipitated alpha chains.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{frequent}} form of <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemia {{is the type}} II form. Recently it was shown {{that the vast majority}} of patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemia type II carry mutations in the SEC 23 B gene. Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship. DESIGN AND METHODS: SEC 23 B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation. RESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found. CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the {{most frequent}} mutations in patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>dyserythropoietic</b> anemia type II. Correlations between the mutations and various biological parameters suggested that the association of one missense mutation and one nonsense mutation was significantly more deleterious that the association of two missense mutations.
