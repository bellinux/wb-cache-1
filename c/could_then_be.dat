5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|The Gracchi {{aimed to}} address these {{problems}} by reclaiming lands from wealthy members of the senatorial class that <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> granted to soldiers; by restoring land to displaced peasants; by providing subsidized grain for the needy and by having the Republic pay for the clothing of its poorest soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electric}} telegraph network expanded, {{allowing for the}} more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E

5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> used in the definitions of units of measure {{in place of the}} IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} proving {{the existence of the}} neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June 1944, Braun's sister Gretl Braun married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, {{who served}} as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Hitler used the {{marriage}} {{as an excuse to}} allow Braun to appear at official functions, as she <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> introduced as Fegelein's sister-in-law. When Fegelein was caught in the closing days of the war trying to escape to Sweden or Switzerland, Hitler ordered his execution. He was shot for desertion in the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn, The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community which first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London and boats carrying coal ran from Newcastle. From Herne was easy access by road {{to the city of}} Canterbury or to Dover, where further passage by boat <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> obtained across the English Channel to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} raffia {{plant was}} the base fiber for the clothing traditionally {{worn by the}} Betsimisaraka. Leaves of the raffia plant were combed to separate the fibers, which were knotted end to end to form strands that <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> woven together to form cloth. Among the various peoples who united under the Betsimisaraka confederation, women wore a short wrapper (simbo), typically with a bandeau top (akanjo), while men wore smocks. Traditional raffia clothing is still worn by some Betsimisaraka today.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years after its inauguration, the {{facility}} became popular with locals and tourists. Specifically guest books from the 1970s and 80s bear witness to this. Unlike today, the tower <b>could</b> <b>then</b> still <b>be</b> accessed and visited by the public and provided a spectacular view across the island.|$|R
5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower {{at the base of the}} telescope to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E
5|$|Trapping {{of newly}} emerged insects: By sealing the storage facilities, newly emerged adults from seeds could be {{prevented}} from escaping to their overwintering sites {{to decrease the}} pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic sorter. Additionally, a storage extended over two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

5|$|After the Sounds vacated Greer, Mayor Dean {{expressed}} interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, {{nearing the end of}} his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of asbestos. The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> sold to private developers. , the ballpark, now dilapidated and vadazlied, is still standing.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, {{and the city}} later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E

5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> traded for the designated item.|$|E
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|DMA Design founder David Jones began {{developing}} Walker {{following the}} release of Blood Money in 1989. The inspiration for the game's mech originated in a sprite from Lemmings (1991) originally designed for Blood Money. The graphics and animation for Walker were designed by Scott Johnston, who later worked on Hired Guns (1993). Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker's head in position, which <b>could</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> altered in Deluxe Paint. In early 1990, Jones scrapped Walker because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called Gore!; this was soon scrapped. Following {{the completion of the}} Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of Shadow of the Beast, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on Walker; Glancy redesigned the game. Raymond Usher wrote the game's soundtrack.|$|E
5000|$|From the Americas, many cattle {{branding}} {{traditions and}} techniques spread to Australia, where a distinct set of traditions and techniques developed.

50|$|The {{original}} Cole Creek {{site had}} become {{better known as}} the Gordon site and was considered an example of the late Gordon period of the Plaquemine culture. Sites such as Greenhouse and French Fork showed evidence of multiple occupations over a long period resulting in pottery that from multiple cultures.
