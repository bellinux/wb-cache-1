40|$|Friction {{is widely}} used as an {{indicator}} of surface slipperiness in preventing accidents in slips and falls. Surface roughness affects friction, {{but it is not clear}} which surface roughness characteristics are better correlated with friction and, therefore, are preferred as potential interventions. The transition friction between quarry tiles and Neolite under three different mixtures of glycerol and water as contaminants was correlated with the surface parameters generated from the quarry tile surfaces. The surface roughness parameters were measured with three different cut-off lengths (0. 8, 2. 5 and 8 mm). The results showed that transition friction decreased as the glycerol content in the contaminant was increased due to the lubrication effect. The linear correlation coefficients between the surface roughness parameters and the measured friction increased as the <b>cut-off</b> <b>length</b> was increased from 0. 8 to 8 mm.

The Hamiltonian for a flexible chain with weak intra-chain interactions is determined by two small parameters: the ratio ϵ of the energy of interaction between segments (within a sphere whose radius coincides with the <b>cut-off</b> <b>length</b> for the potential) to the thermal energy, and the ratio δ of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>length</b> to the radius of gyration for a Gaussian chain. Unlike conventional approaches grounded on the mean-field evaluation of the end-to-end distance, the Green function is found explicitly (in the first approximation with respect to ϵ). It is demonstrated that (i) the distribution function depends on ϵ in a regular way, while its dependence on δ is singular, and (ii) the leading term in the expression for the mean square end-to-end distance linearly grows with ϵ and remains independent of δ.

We generate geostatistical fracture aperture realizations that are characterized by the same mean-aperture and variance, but different Hurst exponents and <b>cut-off</b> <b>lengths.</b> For each of the 16 classes of heterogeneity considered, we generate 1000 fracture realizations from which we compute GPR reflection data using our recent effective-dipole forward model. We then use each (noise-contaminated) data set individually to invert for a single ‘apparent’ aperture, that is, {{we assume that the}} fracture aperture is homogeneous. We find that the inferred ‘apparent’ apertures are only reliable when fracture heterogeneity is non-fractal (the Hurst exponent is close to 1) and the scale of the dominant aperture heterogeneities is larger than the first Fresnel zone. These results are a direct consequence of the nonlinear character of the thin-bed reflection coefficients. As fracture heterogeneity is ubiquitous and often fractal, our results suggest that robust field-based inference of fracture aperture can only be achieved by accounting for the nonlinear response of fracture heterogeneity on GPR data...|$|R

Plasmas 17, 032503 (2010), 23, 022308 (2016) ] to obtaining à priori bounds on enstrophy in neutral fluids (R-Euler) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (R-MHD). This {{results in a}} far-reaching local, 3 -dimensional, non-linear, dispersive generalization of a KdV-type regularization to compressible dissipationless two-fluid plasmas and models derived therefrom (quasi-neutral 2 -fluid and Hall MHD). It involves the introduction of vortical and magnetic `twirl' terms λ_l^ 2 (w_l + q_l/m_l B) × (∇× w_l) in the ion/electron momentum equations (l = i,e) where w_l = ∇× v_l are vorticities. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>lengths</b> λ_l must be inversely proportional to the square-roots of the number densities (λ_l^ 2 n_l = C_l) and may be taken as Debye lengths or skin-depths. A novel feature is that the `flow' current ∑_l q_l n_l v_l in Ampère's law is augmented by a solenoidal `twirl' current ∑_l ∇×∇×λ_l^ 2 j_ flow,l. The resulting equations imply conserved linear and angular momenta and a positive definite swirl energy density E^* which includes an enstrophic contribution ∑_l (1 / 2) λ_l^ 2 ρ_l w_l^ 2. It is shown that the equations admit a Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation. Furthermore, singularities in ∇× B are conservatively regularized by adding (λ_B^ 2 / 2 μ_ 0) (∇× B) ^ 2 to E^*. Finally, it is proved that among regularizations that admit a Hamiltonian formulation and preserve the continuity equations along with the symmetries of the ideal model, the twirl term is unique and minimal in non-linearity and space derivatives of velocities.

A good agreement between the two free energies is found for slow director fields, and large deviations are observed only if L-dis approximate to a, where a is the molecular length.

Peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured using an Optic Disc Cube 200 × 200 scan of spectral domain Cirrus HD OCT and the axial length was measured using IOL Master Advanced Technology. In age groups based on decade, the normal ranges of peripapillary RNFL thickness for average, quadrant, and clock-hour sectors were determined with 95 % confidence intervals. After dividing the eyes into two groups according to axial <b>length</b> (<b>cut-off,</b> 24. 50 mm), the degrees of age-related RNFL thinning were compared.
