60|$|Perhaps {{it may be}} well {{to explain}} the {{circumstances}} under which it was thought expedient thus to establish a new Canadian capital. In 1841, when Lord Sydenham was Governor-General of the provinces, the two Canadas, separate till then, were united under one government. At that time the people of Lower or French Canada, and the people of Upper or English Canada, differed much more in their habits and language than they do now. I do not know that the English have become in any way Gallicized, but the French have been very materially Anglicized. But while this has been in progress national jealousy has been at work, and even yet that national jealousy is not at an end. While the two provinces were divided there were, of course, two capitals, and two seats of government. These were at Quebec for Lower Canada, and at Toronto for Upper Canada, both which towns are <b>centrically</b> situated as regards the respective provinces. When the union was effected, it was deemed expedient that there should be but one capital; and the small town of Kingstown was selected, which is situated on the lower end of Lake Ontario, in the upper province. But Kingstown was found to be inconvenient, lacking space and accommodation for those who had to follow the government, and the Governor removed it and himself to Montreal. Montreal is in the lower province, but is very central to both the provinces; and it is moreover the chief town in Canada. This would have done very well but for an unforeseen misfortune.|$|E

This is a very {{different}} species from the tropical kind seen in Nepal, and mentioned at vol. i, Chapter XII.] gambolling in a wood of Abies Brunoniana: this surprised me, as I was not prepared to find so tropical an animal associated with a vegetation typical of a boreal climate. The only other quadrupeds seen here were some small earless rats, and musk-deer; the young female of which latter sometimes afforded me a dish of excellent venison; being, though dark-coloured and lean, tender, sweet, and short-fibred. Birds were scarce, with the exception of alpine pigeons (Columba leuconota), red-legged crows (Corvus graculus, L.), and the horned pheasant (Meleagris Satyra, L.). In this month insects are scarce, Elater and a black earwig being the most frequent: two species of Serica also flew into my tent, and at night moths, closely resembling European ones, came from the fir-woods. The vegetation in the, neighbourhood of Lamteng is European and North American; that is to say, it unites the boreal and temperate floras of the east and west hemispheres; presenting also a few features peculiar to Asia. This is a subject of very great importance in physical geography; as a country combining the botanical characters of several others, affords materials for tracing the direction in which genera and species have migrated, the causes that favour their migrations, and the laws that determine the types or forms of one region, which represent those of another. A glance at the map will show that Sikkim is, geographically, peculiarly well situated for investigations of this kind, being <b>centrically</b> placed, whether as regards south-eastern Asia or the Himalayan chain. Again, the Lachen valley at this spot is nearly equi-distant from the tropical forests of the Terai and the sterile mountains of Tibet, for which reason representatives both of the dry central Asiatic and Siberian, and of the humid Malayan floras meet there.|$|E

Detaily are analysed <b>centrically</b> and eccentrically loaded {{hot rolled steel}} elements with equal leg cross-section. The procedures for determining the buckling load for elements with a compact and slender crosssection according the European Eurocodes and American AISC standards are presented.

Influence of residual stresses and geometrical imperfections resulting from the method of manufacture of steel elements, is incorporated in buckling curves. Numerical analysis of buckling behaviour were calculated in numerical environment Abaqus. In numerical simulations material and geometric imperfections were combined in an equivalent geometric imperfection with the corresponding amplitude, so that the results of numerical simulations for <b>centrically</b> loaded elements with a compact cross-section coincide with the corresponding buckling curve in Eurocode standard. Adequacy of the numerical model eccentrically loaded elements was validated by comparing the results of the buckling load by the results of other researchers. The results of numerical simulations <b>centrically</b> and eccentrically loaded elements are further compared with the results calculated according the standards.

40|$|Due to {{the mostly}} lower {{stiffness}} and greater poissons {{ratio of the}} mortar, units and bed joint mortar in <b>centrically</b> loaded masonry are in a triaxial stress state. The units are subjected to compressive stresses in the vertical direction and to tensile stresses in both horizontal directions whereas the bed joint mortar is exposed to triaxial compressive stresses. The strength and deformation properties of both masonry components under these stress states are largely unkown. While german masonry design codes are mostly based on results of tests on masonry structures such as walls or columns, a calculation of masonry structures, when using the finite element method, requires {{the knowledge of the}} basic material properties of mortar and units. By means of a new developed test equipment 184 triaxial compression tests were carried out on mortar specimens that were taken from bed joints and therefore represent the influence of unit suction. Two normal- and two lightweight mortars were used in combination with three different unit types for the preparation of mortar specimens. Triaxial loading was applied to the cylindrical specimens with constant ratios of radial and vertical stress #sigma#_r/#sigma#_v= 0 - 0. 05 - 0. 15 and 0. 30.

The FGM elastic properties can have any irregular variations with depth. The indenter is subjected to the loading normal to the flat contact surface. The classical Kelvin solution is used for the mathematical formulation of the homogeneous elastic indenter. The generalized Kelvin solution is used for the mathematical formulation of the FGM base. The contact variables are defined with respect to each of the surfaces using local coordinate systems. The corresponding contact equations are used to couple the two sets of the linear equation systems for the indenter and the FGM. The numerical verifications illustrate that the proposed method can obtain accurate results for the contact displacement and stress.

This approximate method for the calculation of critical force has been adopted into norms. Nowadays, we can also solve governing differential equations by numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM). Therefore, in this paper, the results of the approximate method and the FEM were compared to each other, while considering the FEM as a reference method. This comparison shows any discrepancies of the approximate method. Attention was also paid to when and why discrepancies occur.

The applicability to small or medium sized glass panes is shown through a parametric investigation in which the results are compared to linear and nonlinear finite element solutions. For large glass panes, especially at smaller glass thickness, geometric nonlinear effects must be considered in the analysis.

40|$|Numerous {{processing}} and manufacturing mills, workshops, warehouses, bridges and other industrial buildings belong to industrial heritage. Their origin {{dates back to}} the 19 th and 20 th century when cast iron became a widely used construction material. It has been recognised that existing structures including cast-iron structures do not fulfil requirements of present codes of practice. A key step of reliability assessment is modelling of resistance of load-bearing members made of cast iron. The present paper investigates several empirical or physical models for resistance of historic cast-iron columns. Outcomes of the models are critically compared with experimental results obtained for solid and hollow cylindrical, and square columns from English grey cast iron. Imprecision of the models is expressed by means of model uncertainty for which appropriate probabilistic models are proposed. As tensile strength of cast iron is considerably lower than compressive strength, it dominates resistances of columns <b>centrically</b> loaded in compression with slenderness ratio over 60. In such cases model uncertainty can be described by a two-parameter lognormal distribution with the mean of 1. 25 and coefficient of variation of 0. 15.

40|$|Balanced {{steady-state}} free precession (SSFP) imaging {{is sensitive}} to off-resonance effects, {{which can lead to}} considerable artifacts during a transient phase following magnetization preparation or steady-state interruption. In addition, nonlinear k-space encoding is required if contrast-relevant k-space regions need to be acquired at specific delays following magnetization preparation or for transient artifact reduction in cardiac-gated k-space segmented CINE imaging. Such trajectories are problematic for balanced SSFP imaging due to nonconstant eddy current effects and resulting disruption of the steady state. In this work, a novel acquisition strategy for balanced SSFP imaging is presented that utilizes scan time reduction by parallel imaging for optimized “double average” eddy current compensation and artifact reduction during the transient phase following steady-state storage and magnetization preparation. Double average parallel SSFP imaging was applied to k-space segmented CINE SSFP tagging as well as nongated <b>centrically</b> encoded SSFP imaging. Phantom and human studies exhibit substantial reduction in steady-state storage and eddy current artifacts while maintaining spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and similar total scan time of a standard SSFP acquisition. The proposed technique can easily be extended to other acquisition schemes that would benefit from nonlinear reordering schemes and/or rely on interruption of the balanced SSFP steady state...|$|E
40|$|A general {{assumption}} {{reported in}} the literature is that the structural response of a stress-laminated-timber (SLT) bridge deck is linear until failure. However, few studies of ultimate-load tests (ULTs) on timber bridges have been reported. A full-scale test of a SLT deck (span, 4. 9 m; thickness, 270 mm) was performed to obtain the deformations at various prestress levels {{as well as at the}} ultimate-load capacity of such a structure. Prior to the ULT, nondestructive tests (NDT) were performed at three different prestress levels. The load was applied as an axle load positioned both <b>centrically</b> and eccentrically. The deflections were about 10 % larger at a prestress level of 300 kPa compared with a prestress level of 600 and 900 kPa. For applied loads larger than 150 - 250 kN, the deflection of the deck was nonlinear at certain positions. This was most likely owing to large concentrated shear forces that resulted in interlaminar slip between the laminates. The limit for linearity seems to be dependent on the applied prestress. A prestress of 600 kPa and an eccentrically positioned load was used for the ULT. Failure occurred at a load level of 900 kN. The existing design codes and new procedures in development may be verified and calibrated against the results in this paper. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) BE. 1943 - 5592. 0000304.

40|$|Punching {{shear failure}} on flat {{reinforced}} concrete slabs of {{residential and commercial}} buildings is generally avoided by using transversal reinforcement and/or chapiters. The first option requires intense labour, mainly when densely flexural reinforcement exists in the potential punching failure region, with detrimental consequences in terms of costs of this construction solution. The second option has also extra costs due to the necessity of special arrangements of moulds for casting the chapiters. The interference of a chapiter on the flatness of the slab {{can also be a}} negative aspect from the architectonic point of view. The use of steel fibre reinforcement can be a solution to avoid both the conventional punching reinforcement and chapiters. Therefore, an experimental program was carried out to assess the potentialities of steel fibre reinforced self-compacting concrete (SFRSCC) for the punching resistance of flat slabs <b>centrically</b> loaded.

40|$|This paper mainly {{treats the}} seismic {{behavior}} of lead-rubber bearing (LRB) isolation systems with superealstic {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) bending bars functioning as damper and self-centering devices. The conventional LRB isolators that are usually installed at the column bases supply extra flexibility to the <b>centrically</b> braced frame (CBF) building {{with a view to}} elongate its vibration period, and thus make a contribution to mitigating seismic acceleration transferred from ground to structure. However, these base isolation systems are somehow susceptible to shear failure {{due to the lack of}} lateral resistance. In the construction site, they have been used to be integrated with displacement control dampers additionally withstanding lateral seismic forces. For this motivation, LRB isolation systems equipped with superelastic SMA bending bars, which possess not only excellent energy dissipation but also outstanding recentering capability, are proposed in this study. These reinforced and recentering LRB base isolators are modeled as nonlinear component springs, and then assigned into the bases of 2 D frame models used for numerical simulation. Their seismic performance and capacity in the base-isolated frame building can be evaluated through nonlinear dynamic analyses conducted with historic ground motion data. After comparative study with analyses results, it is clearly shown that 2 D frame models with proposed LRB isolators generally have smaller maximum displacements than those with conventional LRB isolators. Furthermore, the LRB isolation systems with superelastic SMA bending bars effectively reduce residual displacement as compared to those with steel bending bars because they provide more flexibility and recentering force to the entire building structure...|$|E

The cross - sections in a <b>centrically</b> compressed columns should be symmetrical so that the compressive stress over the entire section does not change. The computer program, created with the tool Microsoft Excel, allows the selection of the “boxed” and "I" section, which are the most common and effective for dimensioning built - up columns. The load capacity of a column mainly depends on its relative slenderness and rigidity of the connection between wooden elements, provided by the mechanical fasteners. Properties of the built -up column are captured by the effective bending stiffness and the slip modulus of mechanical fasteners. Shear connectors are wood - wood type and have one shear plane in which, when load is applied, the shear stress occurs. This shear stress is taken by the nails through their shear resistance. Fasteners are selected based on the type of wood, the cross - section dimensions and size of the load that fasteners have to bear. Based on the given geometry of the element, selected wood species, the applied time and size of load, the carrying capacity of elements, regarding column buckling and fasteners carrying capacity is checked. The program gives the results of the analysis of the selected column, separately for both load conditions, so that the user can correct only those parameters that do not meet certain conditions of the controls...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} that {{buildings}} are renovated and their functional use is changed which leads tonew layouts of floor plans and that new installations {{are necessary to}} be made. These changesentails that load bearing walls are removed and new door, window and shaft openings needs tobe made in already existing load bearing walls. Reinforced concrete walls are nowadayscommon as structural members in buildings. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have knowledge ofhow cut-out openings affect their structural behavior. This is nowadays almost unexplored andthe international codes, for example Eurocode 2 (2008), treat openings in walls indirectly,through the column theory. Further research is necessary in this subject to gain knowledge onhow cracks, failure mode and the ultimate load are affected by a cut-out opening, reinforcementratio and placement and the eccentricity of the load. A parametric study was performed with the finite element method (FEM) program ATENA(Version 5. 3. 2) (2015). A benchmark process was performed against experimental tests,reported by Popescu et al. (2015 b), on three different walls: one solid wall, one wall with largedoor opening (A 0 /A= 50 %) and one wall with small door opening (A 0 /A= 25 %). The materialparameters were benchmarked according to laboratory tests. The investigated walls in FEA andin the experimental tests were two-way walls with a centric reinforcement mesh. The parametric study included seven different wall types, one solid wall and six walls withopenings with A 0 /A between 25 - 75 %. Each wall was investigated to four load eccentricities,e= 0 mm, e= 10 mm, e= 15 mm, e= 30 mm. The influence of the reinforcement was investigatedby an analysis of an unreinforced wall and a wall with a centric placed reinforcement mesh. The influence of placement of the reinforcement was investigated by an analysis of a wall witha centric reinforcement mesh and a wall with two reinforcement meshes, one at each face ofthe wall. In both cases the reinforcement ratio was kept constant. The effect of the reinforcementratio was also investigated by increase the reinforcement ratio of a <b>centrically</b> placedreinforcement mesh by 4 times. The parametric study showed that the investigated door opening sizes gave a reduction of theultimate load with up to 74 % compared to the solid wall. It was noted that the opening sizeaffects the crack pattern of the wall but the influence of the door opening size decreases withan increased eccentricity. The parametric study also showed that the investigated loadeccentricities gave a reduction of the ultimate load with up to 82 % compared to when the loadact <b>centrically</b> on the wall. The influence of eccentricity decrease with increased door openingsize. It was also proved that reinforcement always increases the ultimate load. Anotherconclusion was that an increased reinforcement ratio by 4 times increases the ultimate load upto 11. 2 %. A placement of the reinforcement mesh in two layers, one at each face of the wall,instead of one centric increases the ultimate load up to 10. 2 %. Ultimate loads calculated in the finite element analysis (FEA) were compared to Eurocode 2 (2008) and a design equation according to Doh and Fragomeni (2006). The most accurate wasDoh and Fragomeni (2006) compared to the FEA. But both Eurocode 2 (2008) and Doh andFragomeni (2006) showed ultimate loads with large deviations for some wall types. This masterthesis showed that an improved design method for reinforced concrete walls with cut-outopenings is needed. Validerat; 20160313 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
30|$|First, {{the mode}} II {{delamination}} fracture behaviour of a functionally graded three-layered beam exhibiting material non-linearity was studied theoretically. There were two delamination cracks located symmetrically {{with respect to}} the beam centroid. The internal crack arm was loaded <b>centrically</b> by one tensile force. The material was functionally graded along the beam height. Two laws (quadratic and exponential) for variation of the modulus of elasticity were considered in the fracture analysis. The beam mechanical behaviour was described by using a non-linear stress-strain relation. The fracture was analysed by applying the J-integral approach. Closed form analytical solutions of the J-integral were derived for the two laws of variation of modulus of elasticity. Analyses of the strain energy release rate were developed with taking into account the material non-linearity in order to verify the J-integral non-linear solutions derived. The non-linear mode II delamination fracture was also analysed assuming that the beam under consideration is multilayered (in each layer, the material is functionally graded in the thickness direction). The effects of material gradient, crack location along the beam height and material non-linearity on the mode II delamination fracture behaviour of functionally graded three-layered beam configuration were evaluated. The results obtained can be applied for optimization of the beam structure in its design {{with respect to the}} non-linear fracture performance. Comparisons were carried out between linear-elastic and elastic-plastic fracture behaviour. It was found that the material non-linearity leads to increase of the J-integral value. Therefore, the material non-linearity has to be considered in fracture mechanics-based safety design of structural members composed by functionally graded materials. The present study indicates that the analytical approach can be applied to obtain very useful information for mode II non-linear fracture behaviour, since the simple formulae derived capture the essential of material non-linearity.|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of two-way {{reinforced}} concrete slabs, e. g. using the strip or yield line design method, the possibility of redistributing the load between different loading directions is used. The main aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how fibres affect the structural behaviour such as the possibility for redistribution, crack patterns and load-carrying capacity. The investigation was conducted by means of experiments on two-way octagonal slabs, simply supported on four edges, <b>centrically</b> loaded with a point load. The slabs spanned 2. 2 m in both directions and the reinforcement amount was twice as large in one direction as in the other, in order to provoke uneven load distribution. Three slabs of each reinforcement configuration were produced and tested: conventionally reinforced slabs, steel fibre reinforced slabs and a combination of both reinforcement types. The reaction force on each supported edge was measured on five rollers per edge. A moderate fibre content (35 kg/m 3) of double hook-end steel fibres was used. The steel fibres affected the structural behaviour significantly by providing post-cracking ductility and by increasing the ultimate load-carrying capacity by approximately 20 %. Most significant, the steel fibres influenced the load redistribution in such a way that more load could be transferred to supports in the weaker direction after cracking. Further, more evenly distributed support reactions were obtained in the slabs containing both reinforcement types compared to the case when only conventional reinforcement was used. The slabs reinforced by steel fibres alone did not experience any bending hardening; however, a considerable post-cracking ductility was observed. Furthermore, the work presented in this paper will provide results suitable for use in benchmarking numerical and analytical modelling methods for steel fibre reinforced concrete, as the experimental programme also included extensive testing of material properties...|$|E
