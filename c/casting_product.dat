Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling was used to identify the flow behavior during the filling process. X-ray radiography test was used to examine the general distribution of defects in the castings from different runner diameters. 3 -point bending test was applied to measure the flexure strength. The scatter of flexure strength results was quantified by Weibull statistics. The casting defects existing on the fracture surface of the casting specimens were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Simulation results show that predicted porosity location moved to ingate and runner area when the size of runner diameter is increased. This gives good agreement with experimental results, which showed that the <b>casting</b> <b>product</b> with a larger runner diameter leads to the improvement of average flexure strength and reduction of porosity defects.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nite element algorithm {{based on the}} adjoint method {{for the design of}} a certain class of solidi cation processes. In particular, the paper addresses the design of directional solidication processes for pure materials such that a desired freezing front heat ux and growth velocity are achieved. This is the rst time that an innite-dimensional continuum adjoint formulation is obtained and implemented for the solution of such inverse=design problems with moving boundaries and Boussinesq incompressible ow. The present design problem belongs to a category of inverse problems in which one is looking for the unknown conditions in part of the boundary, while overspecied boundary conditions are supplied {{in another part of the}} boundary (here the freezing interface). The solidication design problem is mathematically posed as a whole time-domain optimization problem. The gradient of the cost functional is calculated using the solution of an appropriately dened continuous adjoint problem. The minimization process is realized by the conjugate gradient method via the solutions of the direct, adjoint and sensitivity sub-problems. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with the solidication of an initially superheated liquid alu-minum conned in a square mold. The non-uniformity in the <b>casting</b> <b>product</b> in the direction of gravity due to the existence of natural convection in the melt is emphasized. The inverse design problem is then posed as nding the appropriate spatial-temporal variations of the boundary heat ux on the vertical mold walls that can eliminate or reduce the eects of convection on the freezing interface heat uxes and growth velocity. The numerical example demonstrates the accuracy and convergence of the adjoint formulation. Finally, open related research design problems are discussed. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
