5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} it is not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped {{in the form of the}} Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} thought that Tillingbourne would {{be sold to}} another operator, with four companies reported to be interested. However, by early April 2001, it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would not take place, as the offers submitted were lower than {{the value of the}} vehicles owned by the company.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British {{saw as a}} joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee went to Washington, D.C., to confer with President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed {{that there would be}} full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was restricted to basic scientific research.|$|E

5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would take more than}} six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} regnal lists {{show only}} one king reigning {{at a time}} in Kent, but subkingdoms were common among the Anglo-Saxons and from the reign of Hlothhere, in the late seventh century, there is evidence that Kent was usually ruled by two kings, though often one is clearly dominant. It is less <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the case before Hlothhere. Forged charters preserve a tradition of Eadbald ruling during his father's reign, presumably as a subking over west Kent. The papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of Æthelwald, a brother of Eadbald's, refers to Æthelwald as a king; if he existed, he would presumably have been a junior king to Eadbald.|$|E
5|$|Both Orkney and Shetland saw a {{significant}} influx of Norwegian settlers {{during the late}} 8th and early 9th centuries. Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre) annexed the Northern Isles, comprising Orkney and Shetland, in 875. (It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> story, which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga, {{is based on the}} later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be apocryphal.) Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E

50|$|There comes morning. The boy {{wakes up}} in the tiny apartment, and it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> all <b>this</b> was a dream. Together with the sister they rise by an attic and set the Bluebird of {{happiness}} free.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>this</b> context, Wade's boat {{is being}} used as a sexual euphemism. However, it is {{debatable}} whether this single indirect reference can be taken to demonstrate fertility aspects are a part of his character.|$|R
5|$|The lands {{went into}} royal {{possession}} while {{the matter of}} inheritance was being settled. By the entail of 1290, the lands could only be inherited by direct descendants of the seventh earl and Joan of Acre. Maud managed to postpone the proceedings by claiming to be pregnant, but by 1316 it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could not be the case. The late earl's sisters, Eleanor, Margaret (now widowed {{after the death of}} Gaveston) and Elizabeth were by 1317 all married to favourites of EdwardII: Hugh Despenser the Younger, Hugh de Audley and Roger d'Amory respectively. The three were granted equal parts of the English possessions, but Despenser received the entire lordship of Glamorgan in Wales, politically the most important of the de Clare lands.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was {{a new series of}} IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the snout taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} snout are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The jagged suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the snout are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
50|$|China {{has also}} {{developed}} a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system for the PL-8. Elbit Systems DASH (Display And Sight Helmet) helmet mounted sight (HMS). However, it’s not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> if <b>this</b> {{was part of the}} Python-3 deal or a separate deal instead.|$|R
50|$|Hyala vitrea {{used to be}} {{considered}} as a species of Onoba (Rissoidae). It is however made <b>clear</b> now <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species does not belong to the family Rissoidae but to Hyala in the family Iravadiidae.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the experimental results of soil stabilization, using the calcic refuse of the chemieal industry. A slaked line {{has been used as}} an addition for the stabilization of cohesion soil. This calcic refuse consists of Ca(OH) _ 2 (22. 5 %), CaO (5. 8 %) and CaCO_ 3 (56. 8 %) and it was mixed in soil at the rate of 5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 % power unit weight. At this result, it was <b>cleared</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> refuse is effective on the soil stabilization as same as a slaked lime is...|$|R
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E

50|$|The {{character}} Geoffrey Fisher in Keith Waterhouse's play Billy Liar (1959) {{is notable}} for his continual {{use of the}} word 'bloody'. Waterhouse's stage directions make it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> if <b>this</b> is considered offensive the word should be omitted entirely and not bowdlerised to ruddy or some other word.|$|R

"That may be Saxon opinion, Guy, {{but it is}} not Norman, and assuredly it is not the duke's; and {{friendly}} as are the relations between him and Harold, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> until <b>this</b> question is settled no permanent friendship can be looked for between the two nations." ...|$|R
25|$|Over time, {{it became}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{expectation}} {{was not being}} realized. Initially fewer insurers participated than expected leading to little competition within health care jurisdictions. Later, after the capitated-fee benchmark/bidding process was changed to increase insurer participation, costs to the Trustees increased dramatically.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a global average and circumstantial factors {{determine the amount of}} water used in beef production.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} of the role of {{distributional}} learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired. However, it does seem <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing.|$|E

25|$|A 'paravirus' is {{mentioned}} as {{the method of}} converting Homo sapiens serfs to Homo servus, the sex cells being transformed {{with the result that}} infected human parents give birth to servus children. However, it is not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> advanced method was the one used for the initial changes to human serfs in the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} tic-tac-toe {{depends on how}} it is generalized. A natural generalization is to m,n,k-games: played on an m by n board with winner being {{the first player to}} get k in a row. It is immediately <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> game can be solved in DSPACE(mn) by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class PSPACE. With some more work it can be shown to be PSPACE-complete.|$|E
25|$|Cubans {{have never}} been content to hear their music {{described}} as salsa, {{even though it is}} crystal <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a label for their music. Since the early 1990s Timba has been used to describe popular dance music in Cuba, rivaled only lately by Reggaetón. Though derived from the same roots as salsa, Timba has its own characteristics, and is intimately tied to the life and culture of Cuba, and especially Havana.|$|E
30|$|We {{see that}} the {{solution}} of fuzzy differential equation (4.1) depends upon the selection of derivatives. It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> new procedure, the unicity of the solution is lost, an expected situation in the fuzzy context. Nonetheless, we can consider the existence of four solutions {{as shown in the}} following examples.|$|R
50|$|During {{those years}} {{the public trust}} in the Minister of Treasury's {{promises}} was non existent. Most of the public assumed the Minister would lie at any time, and gave no attention to his statements. Most of all, Aridor's denial made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> at <b>this</b> point the public was dictating the government's moves.|$|R
