500|$|When the VOC was nationalized on 31 December 1799, many freedoms the Chinese {{experienced}} {{under the}} corporation were eliminated by the Dutch government. Among {{them was the}} Chinese monopoly on the salt trade which had been granted by the VOC administration. An 1816 regulation introduced a requirement for the indigenous population and Chinese traveling within the territory to obtain a travel permit. Those who did not carry a permit faced arrest by security officers. The Governor-General also introduced a resolution in 1825 which forbade [...] "foreign Asians in Java such as Malays, Buginese and Chinese" [...] from living within the same neighborhood as the native population. Following the costly Java War (1825–1830) the Dutch introduced a new agrarian and cultivation system that required farmers to [...] "yield up {{a portion of their}} fields and cultivate crops suitable for the European market". <b>Compulsory</b> <b>cultivation</b> restored the economy of the colony, but ended the system of revenue farms established under the VOC.|$|E
50|$|In 1811, Java fell to a British East India Company force under Baron Minto, the governor-general of India. Lord Minto {{appointed}} Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as {{lieutenant governor}} of Java. Raffles carried further the administrative centralisation previously initiated by Daendels. He planned to group the regencies of Java into 16 residencies. He ended Dutch administrative methods, liberalised {{the system of}} land tenure, and extended trade. Raffles tried to implement the liberal economic principles and the cessation of <b>compulsory</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Java.|$|E
5000|$|According to Tony Gray, the EPOs [...] "were so {{draconian}} {{that they}} effectively abolished democracy for the period, and most {{aspects of the}} life of the country were controlled by the dictatorial powers the government acquired". The Garda Síochána received extended powers of search and arrest. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>cultivation</b> of land and compulsory queuing for buses were a few topics for which EPOs were made. One aspect of the EPOs was that, once they were laid before the Oireachtas, TDs could only annul or accept an EPO; they could not scrutinise or amend them as they could with legislation. John A. Costello condemned the fact that EPOs could be judicially noticed in court without being introduced as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Boganda's {{attachment}} to his chosen calling weakened {{when he met}} {{and fell in love}} with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, <b>compulsory</b> cotton <b>cultivation,</b> and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.|$|R
5000|$|Dr Jameson’s {{programme}} {{was largely}} one of material development. In {{the words of}} the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, [...] "without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a self-sustaining colony cannot be assured". This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of <b>compulsory</b> education. The <b>cultivation</b> of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies {{was also one of the}} leading objects of Dr Jameson’s policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to Het Volk, the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at Ceres, a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the Bond, Dutch sentiment and action throughout South Africa.|$|R
