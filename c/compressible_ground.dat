It incorporates the combined {{effects of the}} 6 GeoSure hazards on (low-rise) buildings and links these to a postcode database – the Derived Postcode Database. A series of GIS (Geographical Information System) maps show the most significant hazard areas. The ground movement, or subsidence, hazards included are landslides, shrink-swell clays, soluble rocks, running sands, <b>compressible</b> <b>ground</b> and collapsible deposits.

40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} {{of bodies}} in <b>compressible</b> <b>ground</b> effect flowfields from low-subsonic to supersonic Mach {{numbers have been}} investigated numerically and experimentally. A study of existing literature indicated that <b>compressible</b> <b>ground</b> effect has been addressed sporadically in various contexts, without being researched in any comprehensive detail. One {{of the reasons for}} this is the difficulty involved in performing experiments which accurately simulate the flows in question with regards to ground boundary conditions. To maximise the relevance of the research to appropriate real-world scenarios, multiple bodies were examined within the confines of their own specific flow regimes. These were: an inverted T 026 wing in the low-to-medium subsonic regime, a lifting RAE 2822 aerofoil and ONERA M 6 wing in the transonic regime, and a NATO military projectile at supersonic Mach numbers. 	Two primary aims were pursued. Firstly, experimental issues surrounding <b>compressible</b> <b>ground</b> effect flows were addressed. Potential problems were found in the practice of matching incompressible Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to wind tunnel experiments for the inverted wing at low freestream Mach numbers (M&# 8734;> 0. 5), ground clearances and angles of incidence. The presence of the ground was found to affect the critical Mach number, and the aerodynamic characteristics of the bodies across all Mach numbers and clearances proved to be highly sensitive to ground proximity, with a step change in any variable often causing a considerable change to the lift, moment and drag coefficients. At the lowest ground clearances in both two and three dimensional studies, the aerodynamic efficiency was generally found to be less than that of unbounded (no ground) flight for shock-dominated flowfields at freestream Mach numbers greater than 0. 7. 	In the fully-supersonic regime, where shocks tend to be steady and oblique, a supersonic spinning NATO projectile travelling at Mach 2. 4 was simulated at several ground clearances. The shocks produced by the body reflected from the ground plane and interacted with the far wake, the near wake, and/or the body itself depending on the ground clearance. The influence of these wave reflections on the three-dimensional flowfield, and their resultant effects on the aerodynamic coefficients, was determined. The normal and drag forces acting on the projectile increased in exponential fashion once the reflections impinged on the projectile body again one or more times (at a height/diameter ground clearance h/d< 1). The pitching moment of the projectile changed sign as ground clearance was reduced, adding to the complexity of the trajectory which would ensue...|$|E
40|$|Validated {{geohazard}} layers depicting {{areas of}} observed and potential ground instability are being {{generated by the}} EU FP 7 PanGeo project for 52 of the largest towns across all 27 countries of Europe. The first product generated by the BGS covers the administrative area of Greater London, and consists of a polygon-wise Ground Stability Layer and associated Geohazard Description document. The identification of geohazards was performed through combined interpretation of geological, landuse and other geospatial layers, together with satellite Persistent Scatterers (PS) ground motion data for 1992 - 2010. The PanGeo product identifies ~ 450 km 2 of observed and ~ 1, 240 km 2 of potential geohazards over London. Potential for natural ground movements (shrink-swell clays, and <b>compressible</b> <b>ground)</b> is observed {{for the majority of}} the area. Geohazards observed through the PS data include both natural processes (compaction of the River Thames sediments) and anthropogenic instability due to water abstraction and recent engineering works (e. g., Jubilee Line Extension) ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{ground effect}} {{aerodynamics}} as the example, the essential role of both Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be highlighted. Examples from our studies {{in this area}} include the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, the study of dimples {{and the study of}} <b>compressible</b> flow <b>ground</b> effect aerodynamics. In many cases, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. We have found that laser-based experimental techniques provide an excellent means to compare to CFD. We have developed a post-processing method, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between often disparate data types. Using the case of the wing and wheel as an example, one dataset is gained from the combination of both LDA and CFD results, using a co-kriging analysis. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD), where {{the two sets of}} simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of <b>compressible</b> flow <b>ground</b> effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types...|$|R
40|$|Slovenian {{territory}} {{is characterized by}} diverse geological and geomorphological structure and tectonic activity. In designing and construction of objects it is therefore necessary to {{pay special attention to}} geologically caused risk factors, namely landslides, karst collapses, flooding of groundwater and surface water, tectonic zones, and soft and very <b>compressible</b> <b>ground.</b> In designing of large infrastructure objects, geological and geotechnical researches are an important integral part of planning of work in early stages of design and during construction. In designing and construction of individual houses and local traffic roads, geological and geotechnical researches are often overlooked either due to ignorance and short-sightedness of investors or savings in short term. Therefore, it is not coincidence that from year to year we face enormous damage on residential objects caused by landslides, floods, and uneven subsiding. An important role is also played by the fact that with constructions we increasingly interfere with the areas that our ancestries avoided, and also by more frequent weather extremes. In the graduation thesis, I presented the most common geologically caused risk factors in Slovenia, and their consequences on individual residential objects. From the geotechnical perspective I analysed and compared two locations for construction of residential object in the vicinity of Brezovica. Advantages and disadvantages of both locations for construction are presented...|$|E
40|$|Simple unpaved roads {{consist of}} a layer of coarse {{granular}} material placed directly {{onto the surface of}} weak or <b>compressible</b> <b>ground.</b> It is thought that the construction of such roads can be considerably improved by the incorporation of a geogrid {{at the base of the}} granular fill layer. Geogrids are a type of geotextile, distinguished by their relatively large aperture size. Laying out a geogrid on the surface of the ground before placing the fill layer may in many cases allow a reduced thickness of fill material to be used, and may also substantially increase the load required to cause a complete failure of the system. No generally accepted design method exists for the construction of reinforced unpaved roads, due to the complex mechanisms which govern deformations in the system. The primary aim of this dissertation was to investigate the performance, in such a construction, of a particular geogrid, namely Tensar, manufactured by Netlon Ltd. A detailed model study into failure mechanisms was undertaken using laboratory apparatus constructed to conduct work at 1 / 4 full scale. Simple plane-strain, monotonic footing tests were carried out on systems consisting of a fill layer compacted onto a consolidated clay subgrade, both with and without the incorporation of a model grid at their interface. The testing technique included a comprehensive study of photographs taken of marker movements in the clay through the transparent sides of the test-box during tests. The relevant failure mechanisms associated with reinforced and unreinforced systems were established. In addition the significance of shear stresses acting at the subgrade surface was recognised and a concept whereby the appropriate subgrade bearing capacity factor is related to these shear stresses was developed. The modelling techniques adopted in this work obviated the need for a centrifuge...|$|E
40|$|Columnar {{inclusion}} {{is one of}} {{the effective}} and widely used methods for improving the engineering properties of soft clay ground. This article investigates the consolidation behavior of composite soft clay ground using both physical model tests under an axial-symmetry condition and finite element simulations using the PLAXIS 2 D program. It was determined that the final settlement and the rate of consolidation of the composite ground depended on the stress state. For an applied stress that is much lower than the failure stress, the final settlement of the composite ground was lower, and the consolidation was rapid. When the soil–cement column failed, the stress on the column suddenly decreased (due to strain-softening); meanwhile, the stress on the soil increased to maintain the force equilibrium. Consequently, the excess pore pressure in the surrounding clay increased immediately. The cracked soil–cement column acted as a drain, which accelerated the dissipation of the excess pore pressure. The consolidation of the composite ground was mainly observed in the vertical direction and was controlled by the area ratio, which is the ratio of the diameter of the soil–cement column to the diameter of the composite ground, a. The stress on the column was shown to be low for a composite ground with a high value of a, which resulted in less settlement and fast consolidation. For a long soil–cement column, the excess pore pressures in the surrounding clay and the column were essentially the same at a given consolidation time throughout the improvement depth. It is proposed that the soil–cement column and surrounding clay form a <b>compressible</b> <b>ground,</b> and the consolidation occurs in the vertical direction. The composite coefficient of consolidation (cv(com)) that was obtained from the physical model test on the composite ground can be used to approximate the rate of consolidation. This approximation was validated via a finite element simulation. The proposed method is highly useful to geotechnical engineers because of its simplicity and reliable prediction...|$|E
40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) and National Grid Transco (NGT) have {{produced}} a new GIS for the rapid assessment {{of the potential for}} a significant geohazard to adversely affect any section of the UK natural gas pipeline transmission network. NGT is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the 18 000 km long high-pressure transmission network that supplies gas to business and domestic consumers across the UK. Health and Safety Legislation in the UK requires NGT to demonstrate that the risks to individuals living and working in the vicinity of gas pipelines are adequately managed. In order to enhance its capabilities for assessing the risks due to geological ground conditions NGT required detailed information about the distribution and potential severity of geohazards across the UK. BGS, as the primary holder of national geological hazard data in the UK, were commissioned to design suitable GIS layers as part of the risk assessment methodology. Of the many geohazards that affect the UK, landsliding and the dissolution of soluble rocks were considered to pose the greatest threat to the transmission network. Other hazards, such as clay shrinkage, running sand and <b>compressible</b> <b>ground,</b> were considered to be of significance only during pipeline construction and were not thought likely to cause rupture during operation. BGS national hazard datasets for landslide and dissolution hazard were truncated to buffer zones centred upon the pipeline. These data were enhanced by detailed information from the BGS National Landslide Database and Karst Database. The result of this research was a set of continuous GIS layers that show the level of potential hazard from landsliding or dissolution of soluble rocks at any location on the pipeline network in the UK. NGT will be using this data to: improve their risk assessment methodology in this area; inform discussions on pipeline safety with their safety regulator and to improve their surveillance strategies where it is considered that geohazards represent a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} providing geotechnical information on the design and construction procedures related {{to the use of}} scrap tires in gravity retaining structures and reinforced fills. If layers of tires, side by side, are filled with soil and tied together to make a mat or a chain, and then placed in successive layers, the resulting structure {{can be used as a}} retaining wall or reinforced fill and can provide a practical alternative for the use of this waste. The research also investigated the chemical quality of effluent water emanating from buried tire waste. The shear resistance of a soil-geotextile interface may be a fraction of the shear resistance of the soil itself. If the reinforcement function is accomplished with tire mats filled with soil, the shearing resistance between the soil and the reinforcement is primarily due to the shear resistance of the soil itself. If the tires are cut to remove the sidewalls, the placement of the soil in the tires is facilitated. A higher degree of compaction is therefore obtained and the shear resistance of the interface between the reinforcement and the soil corresponds to the shear strength of the soil. Earth structures using tires filled with soil have more flexibility than conventional structures and are able to withstand large differential settlements. The flexibility of the resulted material implies that it can be used to support earth fills on <b>compressible</b> <b>ground.</b> An important feature of the investigations was a large number of field pull-out tests on different configurations of tire mats. These tests provided valuable data on the interaction between the different soils and the tire reinforcement. This behaviour is necessary for the design of tire reinforced structures. Also, three large plate loading tests were performed on the surface of the completed test fill to assess the load deformation behaviour of this composite material. To evaluate any toxic effects of buried used tires on the surrounding groundwater, a drainage system was installed below the embankment and the effluent collected in three wells. Samples were periodically collected and analysed for chemical quality. Additional tests on water quality were performed in laboratory test columns in which tire chips were embedded in sand or clay to provide a conservative estimate. Some organic compounds can be leached out of the tire reinforced structure placed above the water table. Laboratory batch tests performed on tire chips embedded in sand provided evidence of an increase in solution of certain metal elements of which some exceed their respective drinking water standards.
