50|$|Oxalis corniculata, the <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel,</b> {{also called}} procumbent yellow-sorrel or {{sleeping}} beauty, resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, Oxalis stricta. It is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing, herbaceous {{plant in the}} family Oxalidaceae. It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a clover in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like Oxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea, have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules {{at the base of}} each petiole.|$|E
5000|$|Corniculate, an Anglicisation of the Latin diminutives corniculata, corniculatum, and corniculatus, {{describes}} an object possessing hornlike extensions. [...] The root is Latin cornu = [...] "horn". The term {{is used to}} describe the shape of the corniculate cartilages of the larynx. The horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata) is named for its distinctive horn-like coloration. Likewise Oxalis corniculata (<b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel)</b> is named for its two erect capsules, which resemble little horns, and the bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus and goat's horn mangrove Aegiceras corniculatum are named for their horn-shaped fruits.|$|E
5000|$|Several Oxalis species {{dominate}} the plant life in local woodland ecosystems, be it Coast Range ecoregion of the North American Pacific Northwest, or the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in southeastern Australia where least yellow sorrel (O. exilis) is common. In the United Kingdom and neighboring Europe, common wood sorrel (O. acetosella) is the typical woodland {{member of this}} genus, forming large swaths in the typical mixed deciduous forests dominated by downy birch (Betula pubescens) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), by sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), pedunculate oak (Q. robur) and blackberries (Rubus fruticosus agg.), or by common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) and European rowan (Sorbus aucuparia); it is also common in woods of common juniper (Juniperus communis ssp. communis). Some species [...] - [...] notably Bermuda-buttercup (O. pes-caprae) and <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> (O. corniculata) [...] - [...] are pernicious, invasive weeds when escaping from cultivation outside their native ranges; the ability of most wood-sorrels to store reserve energy in their tubers makes them quite resistant to most weed control techniques.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Experiments were {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} cultural management practices on weed growth in nursery containers. Experiments 1 and 2 evaluated the effects of dolomitic lime rate and application method on substrate pH, <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> (Oxalis corniculata L.) establishment in containers, and growth of azalea (Rhododendron ‘Rosebud’) and pieris (Pieris japonica ‘Claventine’). <b>Creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> shoot fresh weight was negatively correlated to substrate pH (r = - 0. 67, p = 0. 0001). <b>Creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> germinated and established poorly in substrates with pH greater than 6. 7. In Experiment 3 and 4 containers were topdressed with a uniform layer of pulverized or pelletized dolomitic limestone at several rates. The most significant pH effect occurred on the surface layer. Topdressing containers with 40 g of lime provided <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> control. In Expeiment 5 incorporating the same lime rates used in Experiment 3 and 4 caused chlorosis in azalea and pieris while topdressed lime ultimately caused no change in growth or foliar color regardless of rate applied. 	The effect of nitrogen (N) form on establishment and growth of bittercress (Cardamine oligosperma Nutt.), prostrate spurge (Chamaesyce maculata L.), pearlwort (Sagina procumbens L.), common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), northern willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum Rafin.), or <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel.</b> Injectors delivered 150 ppm N using either ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4) (AS), ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO３) (AN), calcium nitrate plus magnesium nitrate (Ca(NO３) ２+ Mg(NO３) ２) (CMN), or urea (CO(NH 2) 2) (UR). Weeds in containers receiving no N (non-treated controls) germinated in lower numbers and produced less biomass. Nitrogen form affected container weed establishment and growth especially in <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> and prostrate spurge. Across all species, CMN tended to reduce growth and flower number compared to other N forms. Weeds fertilized with AN were always among the largest with the most inflorescences. 	The effects of substrate particle size and herbicide rate on weed establishment and growth in containers were evaluated in three experiments. Across the three experiments, pearlwort established with higher numbers in containers with the finest substrate. Subsequent pearlwort growth was reduced in two of the three experiments with coarser substrates. As rate of Rout increased pearlwort growth decreased. Northern willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum Rafin) responded more to herbicide rate than substrate particle size in one experiment 2, however, in Experiment 3 it germinated and grew larger in fine bark compared to medium bark. Common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) established and grew larger with decreasing particle size and herbicide rate...|$|E
30|$|Given our {{conservative}} criteria, five scrub herbs (wedge-leaved button snakeroot [Eryngium cuneifolium Small], highlands scrub St. Johnswort, nodding pinweed, paper nailwort, and pineland scalypink), one subshrub (Deckert’s pinweed [Lechea deckertii Small]), one shrub (Florida rosemary), two graminoids (flatsedge and one grass), {{and five}} ruderal herbs (slender goldentop [Euthamia caroliniana {L.} Greene ex Porter & Britton], boneset, spoonleaf purple everlasting, Apalachicola toadflax, and <b>creeping</b> <b>woodsorrel</b> [Oxalis corniculata L.]) formed persistent soil seed banks. Several species had germinants emerging {{into the third}} year, suggesting {{that the possibility of}} a long-term persistent seed bank (Florida rosemary, slender goldentop, boneset, highlands scrub St. Johnswort, Apalachicola toadflax, Feay’s palafox, paper nailwort, and pineland scalypink). The club moss was also found across all seasons of sampling and had propagules after the second year.|$|E
