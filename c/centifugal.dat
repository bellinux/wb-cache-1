50|$|The {{acceleration}} due {{to gravity}} depends on {{the gravity of the}} mass, which rests inside of the object. The gravity decreases at longer distance between centers of mass. The acceleration {{due to gravity}} furthermore is influenced by the rotation of the earth. As <b>centifugal</b> force increases at longer earth's axis distance, thus centrifugal force is highest at the equator and lowest the poles.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an inverse method for the turbomachine blading design in incompressible non viscous flow {{in order to}} avoid cavitation and gives a new approach of the boundary conditions to be settled in relation with bound vorticity distribution on the blades. Treating first the 2 D cascade design, it shows how the blade must be generated with the given thickness distribution and must be loaded in order to obtain the desired outlet flow angle. The 3 D design is analysed by two steps S 2 -S 1 approach proposed by WuÂ [1]. For the meridian flow (S 2 approach), the blade thickness is taken into account by the modification of metric tensor in the continuity equation. The governing one is provided by the hub to shroud equilibrium condition and the meridian stream function is choosen to define the flow field. This step leads to the determination of axisymmetrical stream sheets as well as the approximate camber surface of the blades. In the second step, blade to blade flow (S 1 approach) is analyzed. The governing equation is deduced from the momentum equation which implies that the vorticity of the absolute velocity must be tangential to the stream sheet. The bound vorticity distribution must be the same one as in S 2 approach and the residual flux crossing over the blade be conservative (transpiration model). These two relations constitute the boundary conditions for the S 1 flow. The detection of this residual flux due to the normal component of the relative velocity on the blade surface leads to the rectification of the camber surface. The optimized design of the blading of a <b>centifugal</b> impeller with splitter blades is presented...|$|E
