40|$|Advances in {{information}} and communications technology (ICT) {{has allowed the}} location of <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> to be disjointed from the country they are providing service to, resulting in the UK having to compete with other countries {{as a location for}} <b>contact</b> <b>centres,</b> but the UK industry cannot match the low labour cost of many offshore locations. This means that the UK <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> have to now compete on other factors rather than cost. There are many ways in which organisations can compete but one of the key ways for developed economies to compete is through increased innovation. Therefore the aim of the research is to examine how UK <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> approach innovation. The research is carried out through a structured methodology of a systematic literature review and comparative case studies. The main findings of the research are that UK <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> approach innovation in two main ways, either structured or ad-hoc and that they are involved in a range of different types of innovation, with the aim innovation type being process innovation...|$|R

With the movement of industries from a resource based economy to knowledge based economy businesses have started to realize the customer eccentricity being the key to sustainability amidst high velocity of the market. However, as technologies have converged and advanced, so have the <b>contact</b> <b>centres.</b> <b>Contact</b> <b>Centres</b> have redirected the supply chains and the concept of retailing is highly diminished due to over exaggeration of cost reduction strategies. In conditions of high environmental velocity together with services featuring considerable information intensity <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> will require up to date and enlightened agents to satisfy the demands placed upon them by those requesting their services. In this paper we examine salient factors such as Power Distance, Knowledge structures and the dynamics of job specialisation and enlargement to suggest critical success factors in the domain of <b>contact</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to the {{guidance}} to the Children Act (1989 and 2004), ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children’ (2010; 2013), all organisations {{that work with}} children {{have a responsibility to}} protect children from maltreatment. However, previous research on child <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> raises questions about how well this service is meeting the responsibility. This study seeks to explore in more detail how well <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> manage their responsibility to protect children and what factors may influence them in this task. Research in the area of safety management has shown the limits of top-down guidance in achieving the desired level of practice. It provides a systems framework for studying how guidance is being implemented on the ground, including how it is interpreted by different actors in the system, and how they interact to produce the observed level of practice. METHODS: Mixed methods were used to undertake a systems approach to studying the management of child protection responsibilities in <b>contact</b> <b>centres.</b> This approach aims to provide an in-depth understanding of what is happening in child <b>contact</b> <b>centres,</b> in terms of child protection, and why. FINDINGS: Despite the introduction of reforms which aimed to improve safety in child <b>contact</b> <b>centres,</b> problematic child protection practice has persisted. It is argued that this is because common weaknesses in voluntary sector provision of human services have not been fully addressed. These weaknesses are insufficient funding, inadequate professionalization and narrow organisational focus. The findings suggest that these issues informed how actors in the system experienced and understood the practice of protecting children. The findings suggest that the safety of children in <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> is also affected by the persistence of problematic inter-professional working. It is argued that the tools which have been introduced to address this have not been effective because they do not in themselves address the difficulties actors face in working together. There remains a lack of capacity amongst some centres and referrers who do not necessarily have the skills required to safely make and accept referrals. In addition, actors in the system experience role ambiguity. Finally, the thesis suggests that although organisations that work with children are encouraged to take account of children’s wishes and feelings in order to protect them, workers in child <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> engaged with children in diverse ways. A typology of engagement, which was developed from the data, suggests that engagement can be conceptualised as ranging from ‘coercive’ to ‘limited’ to ‘meaningful’. The findings suggest that workers’ engagement with children was influenced not just by factors within <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> but by individuals’ personal values and the wider family justice system, which <b>contact</b> <b>centres</b> operate in. IMPLICATIONS: This research suggests that in the empirical context of child <b>contact</b> <b>centres,</b> the ‘Working Together’ guidance to organisations working with children does not in itself produce predictable effects which will fulfil {{the guidance}} aims. Rather, when the guidance combines with local factors it produces unexpected effects. The meaning that actors attributed to their actions was not static. Instead, socially constructed, local rationalities influenced how actors understood and experienced the process of protecting children. The findings contribute to the growing body of research which argues that policy makers need to focus, not simply on telling organisations what do, but on enabling them to do it. In addition, the findings contribute to the systems approach literature, which suggests that safety needs to be understood within the socio-technical system that actors inhabit...|$|R
