During rolling-sliding contact, the difference in relative velocities of two contacting components can cause slip in the contact (known as creep). The higher <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> may increase the severity of wear. In this work, the wear rate of the material and the behaviour of material just below the contact surface in rolling-sliding contact with various creep ratios were investigated. The carbon steel (about 0. 65 % C) {{was chosen as the}} test material and wear test was conducted using disc-to-disc contact testing machine with the maximum contact pressure of 1000 MPa and with various <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 %, 5 % and 7 %. The results show the higher <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> causes the material to accumulate critical shear strain more quickly, resulting in the increase of wear (i. e., from about 0. 0047 µm/cycle for <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 % up to about 0. 0077 µm/cycle for <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> of 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{consuming}} {{of paper}} and fibrous products is nowadays tremendous in our dailylife. The raw material used in the paper industry is mainly wood fibers. A betterunderstanding of properties of these fibers will help to improve the performance ofthe paper industry. Fiber deforms with time when subjected to a load, which has to be compensated for in packaging materials {{by the use of}} thicker papers thus morematerial. This deformation increases in the variable climate. This well-known complex phenomenon is called mechano-sorptive creep and leads to large losses in the paper industry every year. In order to understand the influence on the creep phenomenon of different fibermorphology, and how and to what extent the fibril angle affects the mechano-sorptive creep, the creep behavior of four series of fibers from spruce were measured by DMA(Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer) at a constant humidity climate followed by animmediately cyclic humidity. The fibers used were mature latewood fibers, matureearlywood fibers, juvenile latewood fibers and juvenile earlywood fibers. The CLSM(Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy) was used to determine the microfibril angle ofthe fibers. The results of the tests show a higher creep rate at cyclic humidity than thatat constant humidity. The comparisons among fibers show that latewood fibers havehigher mechano-sorptive <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> (creep rate at cyclic humidity/ creep rate atconstant humidity) than earlywood fibers and that juvenile wood fibers have highercreep ratio than mature wood fibers.

Assuming that the shear modulus varies exponentially through the thickness of the coating, the governing integral equations associated with the rolling contact problem are constructed. Furthermore, it is supposed that the contact patch is controlled by a central stick zone accompanied by two slip zones. The conventional Goodman approximation is employed in order to decouple the governing singular integral equations.

Samples measuring 10 mm x 10 mm x 3 mm were cut out {{from the bottom of the}} fruit, close to the natural indentations (the eye) of an approximately round-shaped fruit. The indentation load ranged from 50 to 500 N with an increment of 50 N. A comparator with digital display and a camera attached to the machine measured the total penetration and rate of penetration. The Oliver and Pharr indentation model and Hertz contact theory were used to determine the Young's modulus, hardness and <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> of coconut shells. Young's modulus determined in the polar zone was 3. 52 x 10 3 MPa and 1. 45 x 10 3 MPa in the equatorial zone. The hardness was 1. 16 x 10 2 MPa in the polar zone and 0. 7 x 10 2 MPa in the equatorial zone. The <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> was 16 in the polar region and 8 in the equatorial zone. Validation of the procedure and results will be done with indentation tests on a kind of wood: Azobé (Lophira alata). Introduction. Coconut Shell of Coco Nucifera (CSCN) is a product of the coconut tree (Coco nucifera) which is exploited for the valuable flesh (copra) enclosed in the hard shell. Important quantities of CSCN are generated during the production of copra [1]. The CSCN alone occupies about 25 % by weight of the nuts and with about 54 million tons of coconuts produced annually worldwide [2], an estimated 13. 5 million tonnes of CSCNs is generated. A small part of these shells is used in the production of activated carbon. [3]. However, most of CSCN is not used, presenting a challenge for solid waste management [4]. Usually the CSCN is simply discarded in nature with negative environmental impact (occupying land that could otherwise be used for agriculture, breeding sites for mosquitos). In recent years, the instrumented indentation test has been used as an alternative method for determining mechanical properties of materials [5]. The hard nature and the abrasiveness of the shell makes it a potential food processing material. A good knowledge of the properties of this hull allows it to be used as a green alternative in agro-processing tools to plump goods such as beans, maize and groundnuts, otherwise like abrasives for woods.

40|$|Creep {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{properties}} of materials, its speed significantly depends on the temperature. Helical cylindrical springs are widely used in the elements of heating systems. This results in necessity of taking into account the effect of temperature on the stress-strain state of the spring. The object of research is a helical cylindrical spring used at high temperatures. Under this condition the spring state stability should be ensured. The paper studies relaxation of stress state and generation of residual stresses. Calculations are carried out in ABAQUS environment. The purpose of this work is to discuss the law of relaxation and residual stress in the spring. This paper describes the basic creep theories of helical cylindrical spring material. The calculation formulas of shear stress relaxation for a fixed compression ratio are obtained. Distribution and character of stress contour lines in the cross section of spring are presented. The stress relaxation – time relationships are discussed. The approximate formula for calculating relaxation shear stresses in the cross section of helical springs is obtained. The paper investigates <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> and law of residual stress variation in the cross-section of spring at 650 ℃. Computer simulation in ABAQUS environment was used. Research presents a finite element model of the spring creep in the cross-section. The paper conducts analysis of the stress changes for the creep under constant load. Under constant load stresses are quickly decreased in the around area of cross-section and are increased in the centre, i. e. the maximum and minimum stresses come close with time. Research work shows the possibility for using the approximate formula to calculate the relaxation shear stress in the cross section of spring and can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the service life of spring at high temperatures.

40|$|The report {{deals with}} the effect of {{time-dependent}} concrete properties in the analysis and design of slender compression members. The main focus is on how to take these effects into account in nonlinear analysis, not on the properties as such in a materials science perspective. Simplified methods for practical design have earlier been calibrated against accurate calculations based on nonlinear analysis. Creep was then {{taken into account in}} a simplified way, using an effective <b>creep</b> <b>ratio</b> and an extended concrete stress-strain curve; shrinkage and strength increase were disregarded. The significance of these simplifications is studied here by comparisons with a more rigorous analysis, including a complete creep function plus the effects of shrinkage and strength increase. A good reason for not taking into account strength increase in normal design is that high loads can occur early in the service life. For slender compression members, however, this means that strength {{at the beginning of the}} service life is combined with second order effects at the end of it (including the full effect of creep). This is conservative but in principle not logical. Therefore, the effect of strength increase has been studied here. (Whether it should be allowed to take it into account in design is another question, to be considered by code writers.) The reduction of concrete strength due to high sustained stress is studied from different angles. The conclusion is that there is no need to take this into account in design. There are several independent reasons for this, each sufficient on its own: load factors, lower stress levels in case of second order effects, strength increase. The realism of the models for creep, shrinkage and strength increase given in Eurocode 2 (2004), when used in an accurate nonlinear analysis, has been examined by comparisons with tests of slender columns reported in the literature. Good agreement is found in most cases. The comparisons also confirm that high sustained stress has no effect in slender columns. QC 2010092...|$|E

Experimental data for five concrete compositions were obtained during the examination presented herein. The principal difference between compressive failure and tensile fracture {{is that there is a}} residual stress in the specimens, which is a consequence of uniformly accelerated motion of load during the examination of compressive strength. The critical interpenetration displacements and crushing energy are obtained theoretically based on the concept of global failure analysis. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Creep and {{shrinkage}} {{of concrete}} {{are known to}} have significant effects at early age of concrete. To be able to simulate the behavior of creep and shrinkage during this stage, accurate and actual properties of concrete should be obtained from the test. However, by performing normal creep testing, applying constant dead load to specimen, some important and necessary parameters cannot be obtained. Furthermore, creep also has significant effects on loss of prestress. Such normal test cannot clearly explain this kind of behavior well. Therefore, a new testing method for creep test is proposed. From this testing method, the modulus of elasticity of concrete (as a function of time) that is a useful parameter in estimating creep and reliable strain value can be achieved. Concrete creep and shrinkage are affected by many parameters. The factors investigated in this research were type of cement, cement content and w/c ratio, age at loading/drying, and stress/strength ratio. The tests were performed on mortar of self-compacting concrete. It was found that type of cement has slight effect on creep due to its difference in chemical compositions. For the same day of loading and same stress/strength ratio of applied load, the higher the w/c <b>ratio</b> the larger <b>creep.</b> Age at loading also has effect on creep such that the later age at loading, the smaller <b>creep</b> is. Stress/strength <b>ratio</b> has significant effect on creep. A new creep factor is proposed and it is found to give good agreement with the conventional terms, which are specific creep and creep coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of oriented crystalline cellulose (~ 50 %). This component has an elastic linear behavior with a Young's modulus around 130 GPa [1], which gives wood its high stiffness. As a cristal, its Young's modulus {{is supposed to}} be time independent. The viscoelastic behavior of wood is then assumed to come from the matrix behavior and/or cinematic conditions at the interface between microfibrils and matrix, or between fibers, [...] . Studying the cinematic of crystals of cellulose in wood during a mechanical loading, and comparing it with wood cinematic at higher scale can produce valuable information to understand better the source wood macroscopic behavior. This methodology has already been used to understand the source of elastic behavior of wood using FTIR [2] or X-Ray diffraction [3], but not until now for the investigation of the viscous behavior of wood. The methodology {{of this study is to}} determine the cellulose crystals longitudinal strain (in average) using X-Ray diffraction technique from compression side to tension side during a four point bending creep test, and to compare with the longitudinal macroscopic strain on the same specimen. For this study, the tested specimens have been submitted to a constant load over time (~ 20 h) in flexion, both in dry and wet conditions. For the dry specimens, the results show that there is a roughly linear relationship between macroscopic strain and the cellulose crystal strain during <b>creep,</b> with a <b>ratio</b> close to 1 between those two strains. This suggests that all of the creep macroscopic strain is visible in the cellulose crystals, so all of the compartments responsible of viscous behavior in wood are parallel to cellulose. For the Wet specimens, this same ratio is clearly higher than 1, which implies that cellulose strains more during creep than wood itself. This finding allows to propose rheological models of the wood viscoelastic behavior...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: "Fee code creep" is the {{increasing}} tendency of primary care physicians in Ontario to bill for more intermediate than minor assessments over time. The authors examine the extent and nature of fee code creep and describe physician characteristics associated with the changes. METHODS: A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of Ontario Health Insurance Plan billing and physician characteristic data was conducted for fee-for-service general practitioners and family physicians (GP/FPs) in Ontario. The ratio of intermediate to minor assessments (I-M ratio) was determined for the period 1978 - 79 to 1994 - 95, and the relation of various physician characteristics to high ratios was tested with bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The I-M ratio rose 10 -fold, from 0. 3 in 1978 - 79 to 2. 9 in 1994 - 95. Although the I-M ratio was higher for older patients and young children, changes in population age profile over time did not account {{for any of the}} increase. The median ratio varied widely among groups of physicians: urban physicians had higher ratios than rural ones (3. 9 v. 3. 0, p < 0. 05), and recent graduates had higher ratios than physicians 60 years of age or older (5. 1 v. 2. 9, p < 0. 05). The I-M ratio was inversely related to number of visits; physicians billing for fewer than 5000 visits had a median ratio of 4. 2, whereas those billing for 20, 000 visits or more had a median ratio of 1. 6. INTERPRETATION: Fee code creep has contributed to expenditure growth in Ontario. This phenomenon was related to both an increase in I-M ratio over time among physicians practising throughout the study period and an influx of new physicians billing at a higher <b>ratio.</b> <b>Creep</b> was not the result of aging of the population...|$|R
40|$|It {{is crucial}} to {{understand}} the creep behavior of Pb-free solder alloys in electronic packaging. Typical service environments are between 298 and 373 K. The thermal mismatch induced stresses acting on solder joints result in extensive rate-dependent plastic deformation. The solder alloy is potentially the weakest component in the electronic package because normal operating temperatures are already above 0. 5 of the melting temperate (in K). Characterization of small-volume materials has been primarily relying on the method of indentation. The topic of concern {{in this study is}} the relationship between indentation creep and uniaxial power-law creep. Two stages of numerical simulation were involved, the first a uniaxial creep test and the other an indentation test. Both were based on rate-dependent viscoplastic behavior as the input material model for the pure Sn and Sn alloys. The objective is to establish a connection between uniaxial creep and indentation creep. For conical and pyramidal indenters, the indentation strain rate is usually expressed as (ε_I) ̇= 1 /h dh/dt, where h is the instantaneous indentation depth and t is time. By using this definition of indentation strain rate, the four materials studied here were found to have stress exponents similar to the uniaxial creep response. This similar stress exponent gives rise to a near parallel strain rate-flow stress curves (on the logarithmic scale) between uniaxial creep and indentation creep. The separation between the curves thus provides the strain rate relationship between the two forms of <b>creep.</b> Relatively consistent <b>ratios</b> between uniaxial and indentation strain rates, between 0. 20 to 0. 28 was obtained, and can serve as guidance for obtaining uniaxial creep behavior using the indentation technique.
