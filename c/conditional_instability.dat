50|$|Castellanus {{can arise}} from clouds formed by either surface-based {{convection}} (e.g., cumulus) or elevated convection (e.g., altocumulus). Most of the convection in the towers, however, {{is due to}} instability (or <b>conditional</b> <b>instability)</b> at cloud height - not to convection below the cloud. The air surrounding the cloud is rapidly entrained into the towers. Cloud physics show that if a cloud does not contain enough humidity, the water vapour contained inside the cloud will only condense at a higher level, where {{the temperature of the}} ascending parcel reaches its saturation point. This will consequently dry out the cloud from the base and eventually result in its disappearance if this dry air does not condense below the cloud top.Conversely, if the air surrounding the cloud is nearly saturated and a thick, unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer exists above the initial cloud, convection will be able to continue.

This review shows that many of Sherwood’s concerns about the terminology were understood {{at the time of their}} origination. Definitions of <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> include both the lapse-rate definition (i. e., the environmental lapse rate lies between the dry- and the moist-adiabatic lapse rates) and the available-energy definition (i. e., a parcel possesses positive buoyant energy; also called latent instability), neither of which can be considered an instability in the classic sense. Furthermore, the lapse-rate definition is really a statement of uncertainty about instability. The uncertainty can be resolved by including the effects of moisture through a consideration of the available-energy definition (i. e., convective available potential energy) or potential instability. It is shown that such misunderstandings about <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> were likely due to the simplifications resulting from the substitution of lapse rates for buoyancy in the vertical acceleration equation. Despite these valid concerns about the value of the lapse-rate definition of <b>conditional</b> <b>instability,</b> consideration of the lapse rate and moisture separately can be useful in some contexts (e. g., the ingredients-based methodology for forecasting deep, moist convection).

40|$|Examination of <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> of {{the second}} kind (CISK) and wind-induced surface heat {{exchange}} (WISHE), two proposed mechanisms for tropical cyclone and polar low intensification, suggests that {{the sensitivity of the}} intensification rate of these disturbances to surface properties, such as surface friction and moisture supply, will be different for the two mechanisms. These sensitivities were examined by perturbing the surface characteristics in a numerical model with explicit convection. The intensification rate was found to have a strong positive dependence on the heat and moisture transfer coefficients, while remaining largely insensitive to the frictional drag coefficient. CISK does not predict the observed dependence of vortex intensification rate on the heat and moisture transfer coefficients, nor the insensitivity to the frictional drag coefficient since it anticipates that intensification rate is controlled by frictional convergence in the boundary layer. Since neither <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> nor boundary moisture content showed any significant sensitivity to the transfer coefficients, this is true of CISK using both the convective closures of Ooyama and of Charney and Eliassen.

These case studies usually associate UK MCSs with a synoptic environment known as the Spanish plume. Here a previously published 17 year climatology of UK MCS events is extended to the present day (from 1998 to 2008) and these events classified according to the synoptic environment in which they form. Three distinct synoptic environments have been identified, here termed the classical Spanish plume, modified Spanish plume, and European easterly plume. Detailed case studies of the two latter, newly defined, environments are presented. Composites produced for each environment further reveal the differences between them. The classical Spanish plume is associated with an eastward propagating baroclinic cyclone that evolves according to idealised life cycle 1. <b>Conditional</b> <b>instability</b> is released from a warm moist plume of air advected northeastwards from Iberia that is capped by warmer, but very dry air, from the Spanish plateau.

As in the classical Spanish plume, <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> is released from a warm plume of air advected northwards from Iberia.

40|$|The linear {{theory of}} <b>conditional</b> {{symmetric}} <b>instability</b> (CSI) is re-examined in a rigorous framework. In comparison with symmetric instability a new feature of CSI {{is that the}} moist updraught tends to be narrow, as with <b>conditional</b> buoyancy <b>instability</b> (CBI). As {{the width of the}} moist updraught varies from its tolerance maximum to infinitesimal, the inviscid growth rate increases from zero to its maximum and the slope of the moist updraught increases from the absolute momentum surface to the moist most unstable surface. The fact that CSI circulations absorb energy from the basic shear and moist thermal field but lose energy to the dry basic thermal field is responsible for the narrow and slant feature of the moist updraught. When a bulk viscosity is accounted for, the most rapidly growing CSI modes bear a qualitative resemblance to some observed rainbands. The stability criterion of viscous CSI also shows a better comparison with observational data than inviscid CSI.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of slantwise convection in general circulation models (GCMs). The approach is through the development of a slantwise convective parameterization scheme (SCPS) and its implementation into version 11 of the third generation GCM of the Canadian Climate Centre for modelling and analysis (CCCma gcm 11). We first study the characteristics of <b>conditional</b> symmetric <b>instability</b> (CSI) in an environment which is also unstable for <b>conditional</b> upright <b>instability</b> (CUI). The results indicate features common to both upright and slantwise convection. This so called slantwise buoyant instability (SBI) possesses two relevant time scales and its horizontal scale can ranges from tens of km up to over one thousand km. We then analyze the 15 -year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA) data to compute the global distributions of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and slantwise convective available energy (SCAPE). We show that the potential for CSI and CUI indeed co-exists over most areas around the globe. Based on the results of the theoretical study and the data analysis, a parameterization for slantwise convection was developed and implemented into gcm 11. It was found that the scheme impacts significantly the simulated general circulation by the development of a direct meridional secondary circulation. The results of the 5 -year simulations show that the scheme reduces SCAPE and SCAPE residual rs over the mid-latitudes, leading to a weakening of the thermal wind and the strength of the upper-level jets. The largest improvement in the simulated climate however lies in the reduced meridional transient eddy transports of heat and zonal momentum.

The energy that drives <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> is convective available potential energy (CAPE), which is computed with radio sonde data at each pressure level. The purpose of the present paper is to identify the pattern or shape of CAPE required for the genesis of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata (22 ° 32 ′N, 88 ° 20 ′E) confined within the northeastern part (20 °N to 24 °N latitude, 85 °E to 93 °E longitude) of India. The method of chaotic graph theory is adopted for this purpose. Chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are formed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. Ranks of the adjacency matrices constituted with the union of chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are computed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. The results reveal that the rank of the adjacency matrix is maximum for non-thunderstorm days and a column with all zeros occurs very quickly on severe thunderstorms days. This indicates that CAPE loses connectivity with pressure levels very early on severe thunderstorm days, showing that for the genesis of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata short, and therefore broad, CAPE is preferred.

40|$|Physical {{processes}} in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are {{of great importance}} to the global climate system. This thesis considers two such processes, namely ice- ocean interaction in ice shelf basal crevasses and the <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> of frazil ice growth. It {{has been suggested that}} freezing within basal crevasses can act as a stabilising in uence on ice shelves, preventing their break up. Using Fluidity, a nite element ocean model, it is found that ocean circulation within a crevasse is highly dependent upon the amount of freezing in the crevasse. It is also found that frazil ice formation is responsible {{for the vast majority of}} freezing within a crevasse, and that there is a non linear relationship between the amount of supercooling in a crevasse and its freeze rate. The <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> of frazil ice growth is a little investigated mechanism of ice growth. Any frazil forming in the water column reduces the bulk density of a parcel of frazil-seawater mixture, causing it to rise. Due to the pressure-decrease in the freezing point, this causes more frazil to form, causing the parcel to accelerate, and so on. Numerical modelling nds that the instability does not operate in the presence of strong strati cation, high thermal driving (warm water), a small initial perturbation, high `background' mixing or the prevalence of large frazil ice crystals. Given a large enough initial perturbation this instability could allow signi cant rates of ice growth even in water that is above the freezing point.

40|$|An {{idealised}} modelling {{study of}} sting-jet cyclones is presented. Sting jets are descending mesoscale jets {{that occur in}} some extratropical cyclones and produce localised regions of strong low-level winds in the frontal fracture region. Moist baroclinic lifecycle (LC 1) simulations are performed with modifications to produce cyclones resembling observed sting-jet cyclones. A sting jet exists in the idealised control cyclone with similar characteristics to the sting jet in a simulation of windstorm Gudrun (a confirmed sting-jet case). Unlike in windstorm Gudrun, a low-level layer of strong moist static stability prohibits the descent of the strong winds from above the boundary layer to the surface in the idealised case. Conditional symmetric instability (CSI) exists in the cloud head and dissipates as the sting jet leaves the cloud head and descends. The descending, initially moist, sting-jet trajectories consistently have negative or near-zero saturated moist potential vorticity but moist static stability and inertial stability, consistent with CSI release; the moist static stability becomes negative {{during the period of}} most rapid descent, by which time the air is relatively dry implying <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> release is unlikely. Sensitivity experiments show that the existence of the sting jet is robust to changes in the initial state, and that the initial tropospheric static stability significantly impacts the descent rate of the sting jet. Inertial and <b>conditional</b> <b>instability</b> are probably being released in the experiment with the weakest initial static stability. This suggests that sting jets can arise through the release of all three instabilities associated with negative saturated moist potential vorticity. While evaporative cooling occurs along the sting-jet trajectories, a sensitivity experiment with evaporation effects turned off shows no significant change to the wind strength or descent rate of the sting jet implying that instability release is the dominant sting-jet driving mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The term CISK (<b>Conditional</b> <b>Instability</b> of the Second Kind) was {{introduced}} by Charney and Eliassen (1964) to describe a positive feedback between deep moist convection and a large-scale circulation.

Yamasaki (1969) and Hayashi (1970) rst considered the feedbacks between deep convection and largescale equatorial waves. In their models, convection could intensify (destabilize) the wave in some cases through purely inviscid processes not dependent on feedbacks with surface drag or surface thermodynamic uxes.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Single- and multiple-banded {{clouds and}} {{precipitation}} are commonly observed {{in association with}} frontal zones in extratropical cyclones. One proposed explanation for these bands is slantwise convection due {{to the release of}} <b>conditional</b> symmetric <b>instability</b> (CSI), a type of moist symmetric instability (MSI). Indeed, some observational studies over extended periods of time show the presence of MSI in association with banded precipitating baroclinic systems to be rather common (e. g., Bennetts and Sharp 1982; Seltzer et al. 1985; Byrd 1989; Reuter and Yau 1990, 1993; Reuter and Aktary 1993, 1995). Although we do not deny the likely existence of slantwise convection or the possible involvement of MSI in some precipitating systems in the atmosphere, it is our contention that CSI is frequently overused and misused as a diagnostic tool [also noted by Wiesmueller and Zubrick (1998, 86) ].

Previous work has shown how the initial state required for CSI to occur {{is similar to the}} state produced as a result of Delta-M adjustment. An idealized dry numerical model is used to test the hypothesis that slantwise circulations can occur due to the release of symmetric instability formed by the Delta-M adjustment process. The numerical simulation shows the coexistence of two pairs of slantwise circulations: one due directly to Delta-M adjustment, and the other which occurs in a region of symmetric instability which was formed by the Delta-M adjustment process. The simulated circulation is qualitatively similar to some high-resolution Doppler radar observations of vertically stacked slantwise circulations. It is argued that a combined Delta-M/CSI mechanism may also be responsible for the creation of multiple slantwise circulations in the moist atmosphere...|$|R
