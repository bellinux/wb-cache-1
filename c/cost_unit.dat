50|$|Overhead is {{an ongoing}} {{business}} expense which cannot directly be allocated to a particular <b>cost</b> <b>unit,</b> {{which is why they}} belong to the so-called hidden costs. Despite not directly creating profits, they do still contribute to the ongoing business activities. Overhead can, for instance, be in the form of company cars. Buying a company car and maintaining it is a business expense, which is not profitable as such. However, a company car is seen as an asset and employees can use the car to go to meetings or to run errands, so that the company car eventually {{turns out to be a}} good investment. Another example of overhead expenses is budget dedicated for travel entertainment. These expenses do not create direct profit but are still vital to the business.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of modern Ramblers carried {{a modified version of}} Nash's Airflyte styling, which included closed wheel openings. Where the wheel openings of any car are a major source of wind resistance, the design was rather primarily an engineering design to increase the strength of the car for impact resistance. Many people surmised that the skirted fenders limited the turning radius of the wheels but was not an actual handicap for having a comparatively narrow front track. Ramblers continued to use this styling until 1955, when the front wheels were revealed by a periodic design update. In 1954 the Rambler offered the first industry combination heating and air conditioning unit that could be an add-on or installed at the factory for $395.00, which at that time was about the lowest <b>cost</b> <b>unit</b> available in an American car.|$|E

50|$|In business, {{overhead}} or overhead expense {{refers to}} an ongoing expense of operating a business; it {{is also known as}} an operating expense. Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular <b>cost</b> <b>unit.</b> Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.|$|E
50|$|Why is the {{competitive}} price a Nash equilibrium in the Bertrand model? First, if both firms set {{the competitive}} price with price equal to marginal <b>cost</b> (<b>unit</b> cost), neither firm will earn any profits. However, if one firm sets price equal to marginal cost, then {{if the other}} firm raises its price above unit cost, then it will earn nothing, since all consumers will buy from the firm still setting the competitive price (recall that {{it is willing to}} meet unlimited demand at price equals unit cost even though it earns no profit). No other price is an equilibrium. If both firms set the same price above unit cost and share the market, then each firm has an incentive to undercut the other by an arbitrarily small amount and capture the whole market and almost double its profits. So there can be no equilibrium with both firms setting the same price above marginal cost. Also, there can be no equilibrium with firms setting different prices. The firms setting the higher price will earn nothing (the lower priced firm serves all of the customers). Hence the higher priced firm will want to lower its price to undercut the lower-priced firm. Hence the only equilibrium in the Bertrand model occurs when both firms set price equal to unit cost (the competitive price).|$|E

Sultan Agung Hospital is a main educational hospital at the Medical Faculty of Sultan Agung Moslem University. <b>Cost</b> <b>unit</b> for the activity of Clerkship had not been calculated. Determination of a cost for Clerkship was based on estimation, appropriateness, and comparison with other cost for Clerkship at other private medical faculties. Therefore, it needs a cost analysis as the basic of Clerkship cost at the hospital. The problems are how much <b>cost</b> <b>unit</b> and how exact cost based on <b>cost</b> <b>unit</b> and other considerations for the students. Aim of this research was to find out a <b>cost</b> <b>unit</b> and determine educational cost of Clerkship which would be proposed at Sultan Agung Islamic Hospital as the Educational Hospital at Medical Faculty.
