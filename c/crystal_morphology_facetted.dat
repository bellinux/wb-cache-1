40|$|We present {{observations}} {{of the formation of}} plate-like snow crystals that provide evidence for an edge-enhancing crystal growth instability. This instability arises when the condensation coefficient describing the growth of an ice prism facet increases as the width of the facet becomes narrower. Coupled with the effects of particle diffusion, this phenomenon causes thin plate-like crystals to develop from thicker prisms, sharpening the edges of the plates to micron or sub-micron dimensions as they grow. This sharpening effect is largely responsible for the formation of thin plate-like ice crystals from water vapor near - 15 C, which is a dominant feature in the snow <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> diagram. Other <b>faceted</b> crystalline materials may exhibit similar morphological growth instabilities that promote the diffusion-limited growth of plate-like or needle-like structures...|$|R

Pyroxene occurs as phenocrysts, microphenocrysts, ophitic crystals, and poikilitic crystals. Plagioclase compositions became progressively poorer in anorthite and MgO and progressively richer in FeO as crystallization proceeded, while the average grain volume decreased and the aspect ratio of individual grains increased. Pyroxene compositions are largely independent of <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology.</b> The diabase dikes {{recovered from}} Hole 504 B during Leg 140 appear to have crystallized in situ. <b>Crystal</b> compositions and <b>morphologies</b> are consistent with a rapid cooling rate and solidification times for individual dikes on the order of hours or days.

40|$|Zeolites are {{crystalline}} microporous aluminosilicates with periodic {{arrangements of}} cages and channels of nanometer dimensions. Their structure, stability, and activity {{have led to}} a broad variety of applications in industry. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the development of zeolite membrane based separation processes. However, their applicability is limited by the inability to systematically and reproducibly control the membrane microstructure. In this dissertation, invaluable new insights have been developed regarding the growth of silicalite- 1 crystals and membranes. Based on these insights, systematic new strategies are developed to alter aspects of the growth mechanisms at the molecular level to obtain the desired <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> and membrane microstructure. ^ A novel non-destructive technique, fluorescence confocal optical microscopy (FCOM), is used to visualize the grain boundary network in MFI membranes. Using this technique, it is conclusively demonstrated that membranes with different crystallographic orientations, but similar intrazeolitic pathways, show dramatically different separation characteristics due to their grain boundary structures. Hence, the orientation of the crystals in the membrane influences the grain boundary structure and thereby impacts the molecular sieving capability and flux through the membrane. The growth of polycrystalline, faceted MFI films, starting from a randomly oriented seed layer, is modeled and simulated. In lieu of in-situ experimental techniques, which are not available, these simulations provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms that give rise to the membrane preferred orientation. In addition, this analysis also allows us to understand the interrelationship between individual <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> and membrane microstructure. ^ A systematic study on the influence of synthesis conditions and different organic templates on the silicalite- 1 <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> conclusively demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} change the fundamental morphology of silicalite- 1 crystals by changing the structure and properties of the structure directing agent. For the first time, a number of new silicalite- 1 <b>crystal</b> <b>morphologies</b> are reported. ^ The modeling and simulation studies coupled with the ability to modify the <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> are the basis for a new rational design methodology for obtaining membranes of a desired orientation and microstructure by tailoring the individual <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology.</b> This methodology is used to synthesize the first functional b-oriented MFI membranes. ...|$|R

Several carboxylic acids, including pharmaceutical compounds such as ibuprofen and aspirin, were crystallized from solvents with widely varying polarities. Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) facilitated quantitative characterization of crystals. Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) patterns were used to rule out the potential for polymorph formation.
