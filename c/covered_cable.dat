5000|$|Buildings 48-1 through 48-5 were {{transformer}} houses. The city of Peru {{provided a}} 33,000 volt transmission line that fed a sub-station at {{the northeast corner}} of the base. The sub-station had three 500KVA step down transformers that took the voltage from 33,000 volt, 3 phase, 3 wire to 12,500 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire. Primary distribution was then by aerial or underground transmission to secondary distribution locations. There were [...] of overhead line, with [...] of bare copper wire; and [...] of underground line, with [...] of lead <b>covered</b> <b>cable,</b> [...] of fiber conduit encased in concrete and 58 manholes. To further step down the voltage for use in buildings, 18 transformer banks were utilized, with 67 oil insulated, air cooled transformers in transformer vaults and transformer houses, with a total capacity of 3,119 KVA volts. Standby emergency electricity was supplied by two [...] generators connected to two 12 cylinder gasoline engines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- An {{excellent}} {{option to}} the utilities {{has been the}} utilisation of <b>covered</b> <b>cable</b> fixed to the insulator or to the line spacer. However, distribution lines located near the coast are often exposed to marine pollution and then the superficial resistance of the polymeric material can be reduced and leakage current can flow on the polymeric surface. This paper shows the results of investigation considering <b>covered</b> <b>cable</b> and line spacers. By testing the polymeric material, the behaviour of the leakage current {{and the evolution of}} degradation were analysed, aiming the on-line monitoring of the leakage current of line spacers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} monitor {{the health of}} power distribution plant is a very attractive prospect for utility companies. This capability would provide a system that engineers could use to assess the real-time state of the network. Analysis of the data produced could allow for more informed decisions {{to be made in}} the areas of asset replacement and maintenance scheduling amongst others. It is widely accepted that partial discharge activity is linked with the electrical ageing/degradation of high voltage equipment. Work at Southampton is focused on obtaining a better understanding of the characteristics and trends of partial discharge events associated with medium voltage cables under, 'real life ' conditions. An experiment has been developed that allows for service conditions to be applied to defective paper insulated lead <b>covered</b> <b>cable</b> samples. The samples under investigation were exposed to mechanical damage designed to replicate typical problems found on an active circuit. Partial discharge measurement was undertaken during the stressing process...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe AC {{breakdown}} voltage (BDV, 50 Hz) of various polymers is investigated regarding {{the influence of}} several constraints: (i) {{the effect of the}} electrodes geometry (namely cylindrical, spherical or pyramidally capped point/point) that simulates the interaction between the metallic constituents of the connector (piercing teeth and metallic plates) and those of <b>covered</b> <b>cables</b> (such as the conductor or the presence of voids); (ii) the rate-of-rise of voltage (RRV) and the connection of electrodes to the H. V. source; (iii) the thermal ageing at higher temperatures (namely, 100, 130 and 150 °C) and; (iv) the thermo-hygro ageing under salt rain. The aim of such a study is to identify suitable organic materials that could be intended for the conception {{of a new generation of}} piercing connectors that will be used on overhead <b>covered</b> <b>cables.</b> Regarding BDV tests, used polymers cover (i) thermoplastics (namely, polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyarylamide, polycarbonate, high density polyethylene and polyphenylene sulfide); and (ii) unfilled/fireproofed EPDM rubbers. The obtained results clearly show that {{breakdown voltage}} (BDV) with spherical electrodes exhibits the highest values. It is also evidenced that the connection to the H. V. source and the influence of the electrode dimension to the BDV value is significant. Results show that the spherical-pyramidally capped point electrodes exhibit higher BDV than that for the spherical-cylindrical ones for PA 66 / 50 PC/ 40, PARA/ 50 and HDPE. Furthermore, thermal ageing affects seriously BDV of EPDM based materials while polyphenylene sulfide is less damaged due to its highest thermal stability. As concerns thermo-hygro ageing, the moisture absorption is responsible for the significant BDV decrease of polyamide materials (PA 6 / 50 and PA 66 / 50) ...|$|R
