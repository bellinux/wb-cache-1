50|$|Between 348 and 383, Ulfilas {{translated}} the Bible into the Gothic language. Thus some Arian <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> the west used the vernacular languages, {{in this case}} including Gothic and Latin, for services, as did <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Roman provinces, while most <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> the western provinces used Latin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan {{have been}} murdered in {{outbreaks}} of communal violence, such as the 2009 Gojra riots, {{and they have been}} targeted by militant groups, with the Peshawar church attack killing 75 <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> Peshawar in 2013, and the Lahore church bombings killing 15 <b>Christians</b> <b>in</b> 2015.

5|$|In {{contrast}} with Sigebert, Ecgric {{seems to have}} remained a pagan. There {{is no evidence that}} he was baptised or that he promoted Christianity in East Anglia, according to D. P. Kirby, who notes that Bede wrote nothing that could imply that Ecgric was a <b>Christian,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to his praise of Sigeberht’s efforts to establish Christianity in East Anglia.|$|E

A small community of Orthodox <b>Christians</b> resides <b>in</b> the capital Freetown.|$|R

The school has no {{affiliation}} with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and pupils may opt to take the subject {{as part of their}} GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are <b>Christian</b> <b>in</b> nature, they are non-denominational; in some cases, local clergy attend as guest speakers. Pupils participate in a number of educational visits throughout their school career and Year 10 pupils are offered the opportunity to participate in a work experience programme, which usually lasts for two weeks.|$|E

They are also known as Nasrani (followers of Jesus the Nazarene).|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a <b>Christian.</b> <b>In</b> the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, The Hardyz began feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H (known as The Power Trip), {{which also}} led to a singles push for both Matt and Jeff. Hardy helped Jeff defeat Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship, and shortly after Hardy {{defeated}} Eddie Guerrero to win the European Championship on SmackDown! four days before Backlash. At Backlash he retained the title against Guerrero and <b>Christian</b> <b>in</b> a triple threat, and against Edge the following night on RAW. Hardy held the championship for 125 days, making him the second-longest reigning European Champion in history and the longest-reigning American-born European Champion.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, after {{recovering}} from an arm injury {{that threatened to}} end his career, Mustaine became a born again Christian. Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine's announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his new identification as a <b>Christian.</b> <b>In</b> May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands' anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.|$|E
5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, who {{may have}} been a sub-king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, seems to have remained a pagan. There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a <b>Christian,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to his praise of the devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were <b>Christian</b> <b>in</b> name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
