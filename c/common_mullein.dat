Verbascum thapsus, <b>common</b> <b>mullein,</b> is a biennial weed of roadsides, pastures, and open and semi-open natural habitats. This report reviews the autecology of V. thapsus in its native range (Eurasia) as well as in Hawai'i and elsewhere where it has naturalized. V. thapsus exhibits many characteristics of an ideal weed; broad germination conditions, self-compatibility, high seed output and a long-lived seed bank. Populations can vary substantially in life history characters, which may have allowed the species to spread over such a wide geographical range, including most temperate parts of the world. V. thapsus was introduced to the island of Hawai'i about 100 years ago, and it still appears to be spreading. It has invaded sites from sea level to the summit of Mauna Kea, but the densest populations occur in upper montane and subalpine habitats. Outside of Hawai'i, it is a poor competitor in many habitats, relying on continuous disturbance to maintain its populations. In contrast, in Hawai'i <b>common</b> <b>mullein</b> appears to have spread in little-disturbed native habitats, particularly where vegetation is sparse such as on relatively recent lava flows. Little is known about the impact this may have on the native biota. Further studies are needed to determine if the spread of V. thapsus depends on disturbance in Hawai'i. Extreme stem and inflorescence fasciation in V. thapsus appears to be unique to Hawai'i; its cause and how it affects life history characteristics are not known. While certain herbicides are effective in killing <b>common</b> <b>mullein,</b> long-term control is very difficult due to its abundant, long-lived seeds. No biocontrol agents have been introduced to Hawai'i, although a number of insects and pathogens attack it and its seeds elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Common</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus L.) is the {{dominant}} plant species at a disposal site polluted with metal from the hydrometallurgical jarosite zinc production process. Seeds collected at the site were germinated and plants were grown hydroponically under controlled conditions in a excess of Zn. Induction of total soluble POD activity in the root occurred at 1, 5, and 10 mM Zn, indicating Zn accumulation within the root. Accumulation of Zn in leaves was not accompanied by changes in POD activity, but resulted in gradual increase of total antioxidative capacity, which could be partly attributed to accumulation of soluble phenolics. The role of the phenolics/POD system in defense of V. thapsus against zinc is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The multiresistance of {{bacteria}} to antibiotics, {{as well as}} the lack of new antibiotics on the market encouraged the reasearch of antibacterial activity of non-antibiotic substances including plant extracts. During the previous decades, it has been proven that extracts of certain plants have a strong antibacterial activity, but their clinical use was limited due to the presence of organic solvents. However, plant extracts obtained by the process of supercritical fluid extraction contain no traces of solvents, and the latest researches have established that they do have antibacterial effects on some gram-positive bacteria. This comparative study included extracts of <b>Common</b> <b>Mullein,</b> Angelica and Echinacea obtained by means of supercritical fluid extraction, Soxlet extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction. The study of their antibacterial activity was performed on some strains of Staphylococcus, Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli isolated from clinical material of human and animal origin. A referential strain of S. aureus ATCC 25923 was included in the research. In the study broth macrodilution method was applied by which the MIC values of extracts were determined. The Angelica extract obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction had the strongest antibacterial activity, i. e. the lowest MIC value of 40 g/mL for S. epidermidis strain. The Angelica extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction also showed substantial antibacterial activity to all Staphylococcus strains included in this study, with the MIC values of 320 to 640 g/mL. The extracts of Echinacea and <b>Common</b> <b>Mullein</b> obtained by supercritical fluid extraction, as well as of Echinacea extract obtained by Soxlet extraction showed no antibacterial activity since the MIC values of these extracts were 2560 g/mL or> 2560 g/mL for all bacterial strains icluded in the study...|$|E

40|$|The campylomma bug (or mullein plant bug; Hemiptera: Miridae) causes {{sporadic}} {{damage in}} Utah apple orchards. Damage is inflicted by nymphs, which feed on developing fruit causing dimpling and fruit distortion. As apple fruits mature, they become {{less susceptible to}} campylomma injury. Injury appears shortly after petal fall as small corky areas alone or small corky areas surrounded by a depression. Golden Delicious is typically more susceptible to damage than Red Delicious. Pear fruit rarely suffer damage, even at high campylomma populations. Campylomma overwinter as eggs laid in the young twigs of apple, pear and other rosaceous plants.

40|$|Intra-specific {{variation}} in host-plant quality affects herbivore foraging decisions and, in turn, herbivore foraging decisions mediate plant fitness. In particular, {{variation in}} defenses against herbivores, both among and within plants, shapes herbivore behavior.

We quantified intra-specific variation in iridoid glycosides, trichome length, and leaf strength in <b>common</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus L, Scrophulariaceae) among maternal lines within a population and among leaves within plants, and related this variation to feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore, Trichopulsia ni Hübner.

Within plants, old leaves had lower levels of all defenses than young leaves, and were strongly preferred by T. ni. Caterpillars also preferred leaves with trichomes removed to leaves with trichomes intact. Differences among maternal lines indicate that phenotypic variation in defenses likely has a genetic basis.

Adults of both species emerged from overwintering sites during early April, began feeding and copulating on leaves of <b>common</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus) and surrounding vegetation, and reproduced shortly thereafter. Neither eggs and first instars of either species, nor second instars of E. variolarius, were collected in the field. Seasonal occurrences of the adults and subsequent immature stages are discussed for each species. No individuals were found after {{the first week of}} November. Both species were reared on green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) under a 16 L: 8 D photoperiod and constant temperature of 23 ± 0. 06 ° C. The incubation period averaged 5. 8 days for E. servus and 5. 4 days for E. variolanus.

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. <b>Common</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus L.) is a biennial herb naturalized in mostly temperate areas on the Island of Hawai’i. Mullein was first observed growing on Mauna Loa in Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park in the 1970 ’s. Localized efforts to eradicate mullein along roadsides in the Park began in 1989. This report documents monitoring and control efforts of mullein in the Park between 1994 - 1 999. Mullein occupies 1, 003 hectares of open lava flows located between 1, 500 and 2, 100 m elevation in the Park. Range expansion is expected to continue at both lower and higher elevations. Densities and recruitment are highest (> 1, 400 ind/ha) on weathered ‘a’a flows that edge vegetated kipukas. Lowest densities (< 1 ind/ha) and recruitment occur on open ‘a’a with little or no soil development. Recruitment of new individuals is highly variably between years and is likely influenced by fluctuations in seasonal rainfall. Manual uprooting mullein effectively reduces populations by the third or fourth year of annual removal treatments. Successful control requires consistent and thorough follow-up treatment. Workloads vary between 5 - 10 ha/worker days in moderate to low density infested areas. An estimated 200 worker days will be required annually to remove mullein from existing populations, other than the most densely infested areas in the Park. Based on these findings, management should emphasize containment and range reduction of the current distribution. Cooperative agreements with private and state landowners should be made to control mullein in areas adjacent to the Park in order to reduce re-invasion from outside areas into the Park. Use of herbicides and biological control agents as alternatives to uprooting mullein should be investigated. Long term studies of the impact of mullein on native plant communities will help managers prioritize mullein control efforts in the Park.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the plant species that are introduced into new ranges either do not become established, or become naturalized yet do not attain high densities and are thus considered ecologically and economically unproblematic. The factors that limit these relatively “benign” species are not well studied. The biotic resistance hypothesis predicts that herbivores, pathogens and competition reduce growth and reproduction of individual plants and so suppress population growth of non-native species. We explored the effect of insect herbivory and surrounding vegetation on growth and fitness of the non-native biennial plant Verbascum thapsus (<b>common</b> <b>mullein)</b> in Colorado, USA. Mullein is widespread in its introduced North American range, yet is infrequently considered a management concern because populations are often ephemeral and restricted to disturbed sites. To evaluate the impact of insect herbivores on mullein performance, we reduced herbivory using an insecticide treatment and compared sprayed plants to those exposed to ambient levels of herbivory. Reducing herbivory increased survival from rosette to reproduction by 7 %, from 70 – 77 %. Of plants that survived, reducing herbivory increased plant area {{in the first year}} and plant height, the length of the reproductive spike, and seed set during the second year. Reducing herbivory also had a marked effect on plant fitness, increasing seed set by 50 %, from about 48, 000 seeds per plant under ambient herbivory to about 98, 000 per plant under reduced herbivory. Our findings also highlight that the relationship between herbivory and performance is complex. Among plants exposed to ambient herbivory, we observed a positive relationship between damage and performance, suggesting that, as predicted by the plant vigor hypothesis, insect herbivores choose the largest plants for feeding when their choice is not restricted by insecticide treatment. In contrast to the strong effects of experimentally reduced herbivory, we found that cover of other plants surrounding our focal plants explained relatively little variation in performance outcomes. Overall, we found that herbivore-induced impacts on individual plant performance and seed set are substantial, and thus may help prevent this naturalized species from becoming dominant in undisturbed recipient communities...|$|E
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, field bindweed, absinth wormwood and <b>common</b> <b>mullein.</b> All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|E
