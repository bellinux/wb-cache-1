5|$|After {{retirement}} from the Foreign Service, Matlock {{began work on}} his magnum opus, Autopsy on an Empire: The American Ambassador's Account of the <b>Collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

5|$|After the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991, the {{movement}} made inroads into Central Asia. As of 2007, {{it was estimated}} that 10,000 Tablighi Jamaat members could be found in Kyrgyzstan, that was largely driven by Pakistani members initially.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1989, {{two years}} before the final <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev's {{government}} formally denounced the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, acknowledging that the bloody annexation of the Baltic States and the partition of Poland had been illegal.|$|E

25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>the</b> Russian 14th Army left 40,000 tonnes of {{weaponry}} {{and ammunition}} in Transnistria.

5|$|The flag of Lithuania {{consists}} of a horizontal tricolor of yellow, green and red. It was re-adopted on March 20, 1989, almost {{a year before the}} re-establishment of Lithuania's independence and almost three years before the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation {{in dealing with the}} numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|The {{information}} which Vetrov provided enabled the western countries to expel nearly 150 Soviet technology spies around the world; the French expelled 47 Soviet spies, {{most of whom}} were from Line X. This caused <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet's</b> information program {{at a time when it}} was particularly crucial. The U.S. created a massive operation to provide <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> with faulty data and sabotaged parts for certain technologies, as a consequence to the Farewell Dossier. Vetrov was also responsible for exposing the spy Dieter Gerhardt, a senior officer in the South African Navy who had been spying for <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> for 20 years. Vetrov also provided information hinting at a Polish coup d'état (eventually found to be that by Wojciech Jaruzelski, and alleging a link between <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and <b>the</b> assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> {{communism in}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Green left {{the party and}} helped found <b>the</b> Committees <b>of</b> Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{short-lived}} Hungarian <b>Soviet</b> Republic under Béla Kun in 1919 began a {{long period}} of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately after the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
2500|$|KGB Director Yuri Andropov was {{convinced}} that Pope John Paul II's election was <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> an Anglo-German conspiracy orchestrated by Zbigniew Brzezinski to undermine Soviet hegemony in largely Catholic Poland and ultimately to precipitate <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>Soviet</b> Union. <b>The</b> Pope's announcement <b>of</b> a pilgrimage to Warsaw fuelled Andropov's apprehension, with Andropov issuing a secret memorandum to Soviet schoolteachers: ...|$|R
2500|$|US President Ronald Reagan listed Hayek {{as among}} {{the two or three}} people who most {{influenced}} his philosophy and welcomed Hayek to the White House as a special guest. In the 1970s and 1980s, <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> Hayek were also a major influence on many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "velvet" [...] revolution in Central Europe during <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>Soviet</b> Empire. Here are some supporting examples: ...|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> brief Hungarian <b>Soviet</b> Republic {{headed by}} Béla Kun in 1919, Sándor served briefly on <b>the</b> {{governing}} council <b>of</b> Ung County. He {{managed to escape}} repression during the so-called White Terror after <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian <b>Soviet</b> regime, apparently benefiting from <b>the</b> 1920 Treaty <b>of</b> Trianon, which made Ruthenia (Subcarpathian Rus) part of Czechoslovakia, then a democratic country more hospitable to radical political activists than the Hungary under Miklós Horthy.|$|R
5|$|Following the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without {{sufficient}} {{personnel to}} man {{many of its}} ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, {{many of them were}} sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted {{that this was a}} manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|Production {{slowed down}} with the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and {{economic}} stagnation in the independent Republic of Georgia. In 1995, bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company (GG), which increased the production forty-fold. According to the company, 80% of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad—more than half of this amount to Russia. Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label {{as a result of}} rising piracy during the 1990s, Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign. The piracy also slowed down due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991 proved {{disastrous}} for Rustavi, as it also caused <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integrated <b>Soviet</b> economy <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> city {{was a key}} part. Most of its industrial plants were shut down and 65% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's population became unemployed, with the attendant social problems of high crime and acute poverty that such a situation brings. The population shrank from 160,000 in the mid-1990s to 116,000 in 2002 as residents moved elsewhere in search of work.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union, many {{pensioners}} in {{the newly}} independent Republic of Georgia were left destitute by <b>the</b> resulting <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Georgian economy and <b>the</b> inability <b>of</b> their meager pensions {{to keep up with}} inflation. The Red Cross, with <b>the</b> financial support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German government, assisted approximately 500,000 of these mostly elderly people with food parcels over a seven-year period during <b>the</b> 1990s. As <b>of</b> 2001, more than 12,000 were still dependent upon Red Cross food assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between <b>the</b> Federal Republic <b>of</b> Germany and <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Kazakhstan {{were established in}} 1991 after Kazakhstan gained independence from <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union. Ethnic Germans and ethnic Kazakhs have a shared history dating back to World War II when ethnic Germans living in <b>the</b> Volga region <b>of</b> Russia were relocated or imprisoned in <b>the</b> eastern steppe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in what is today <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> Kazakhstan. At <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union, about one million ethnic Germans lived in Kazakhstan.|$|R
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated canards and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a multi-role aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due to the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, and the resultant Su-37 {{was used as a}} technology demonstrator. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E
5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and {{ballistic}} missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which {{were used in the}} s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{corruption}} {{has become more}} pervasive in Kyrgyzstan following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USSR. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union maintained an extensive bureaucracy and powerful communist party, both of which closely regulated private and public life, penetrating citizens’ daily lives unlike any government in the West. Despite this, informal exchanges (blat) were tolerated to a degree, and were common throughout <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> states. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> communism removed bureaucratic safeguards and introduced new economic, political, and social instability. The resulting political vacuum and economic transition has caused corruption to become more common and indeed necessary. Informal exchanges, or what we in the West might perceive as corruption, provide what a flawed system cannot, are inspired by similar Soviet practices, and are still common in Kyrgyzstan...|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union, {{there were}} large {{stockpiles}} of arms left in Ukraine. <b>The</b> first prominence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian mafia came through {{their participation in}} the illicit international trafficking in these arms. Between 1992 and 1998, some $32 billion in military material disappeared from military depots in Ukraine and ended up primarily in West Africa and Central Asia. Allegedly, Ukrainian criminal organizations were also behind trafficking weapons to war-torn places such as Afghanistan at the time.|$|R
40|$|As Dale Herspring asserts {{in one of}} his works, “The Gorbachev {{period and}} <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union raised serious {{questions}} about many, if not most, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional assumptions <b>of</b> Western scholars about <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> politics in Russia”.
