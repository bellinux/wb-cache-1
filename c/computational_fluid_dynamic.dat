The nozzle-throat area was varied to increase the backpressure and this pushed the normal shock that was sitting within the inlet, out to {{the lip of the}} inlet cowl. Using the eddy dissipation combustion model in ANSYS-CFX, a combustion analysis was performed on the miniature ramjet. The analysis involved the single-step, stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen and oxygen within the combustion chamber of the ramjet. The drag force induced on the miniature ramjet when subjected to Mach 4 flow in a supersonic wind tunnel was measured using cryogenic strain gauges arranged in a Wheatstone bridge. A CFD cold-flow drag prediction was compared against this measured drag force to establish the formers accuracy in drag prediction. For all CFD predictions, the two-equation Shear-Stress-Transport (SST) turbulence model was used.

50|$|The major {{consideration}} {{during any}} general combustion process includes the mixing time {{scale and the}} reacting time scale elapsed for the process. The flame type {{and the type of}} mixing of flow streams of the constituents also have to be taken into account.

Also the transport equations for mass fractions of all the species as well as the enthalpy generated during the reaction have to be solved. Hence even the simplest combustion reaction involves very tedious and rigorous calculation if all the intermediate steps of the combustion process, all transport equations and all flow equations have to be satisfied simultaneously.

HOS solves nonlinear wave propagation in open sea (HOS-Ocean) and in numerical wave tank (HOS-NWT) with low computation time comparing with other nonlinear solvers. HOS solvers are released as open-source codes {{under the terms of}} GNU General Public Licence (GPLv 3). Nonlinear irregular wave generation in <b>computational</b> <b>fluids</b> <b>dynamic</b> (CFD) solvers becomes important recently in naval fiels to better estimate the loads on offshore structure. The conventional linear superposition methods imply a long computational time for wave generation and the simulation is made almost impossible without having enough computational power. And if the method is based on linear wave theory, there is also question on occurence of nonlinear phenomenon and the interaction between waves as the simulation goes. Therefore dedicated nonlinear wave solvers with high computational speed are needed. Grid 2 Grid is developed as a wrapper program of HOS to generate wave fields from the results of HOS computation. Grid 2 Grid reconstructs wave fields of HOS with inverse fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and uses a quick spline module, the nonlinear wave fields can be fastly reconstructed for arbitrary simulation time and space. The nonlinear wave simulation is then possible for a particular position and time where specific non linear phenomenon occur.
