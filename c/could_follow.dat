5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns usually {{were not}} dated, {{although}} some, concerning {{withdrawal of money}} from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period hatt-ı hümayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially inclined to date his hatt-ı hümayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III so that he <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> up whether his orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} gold fields, most took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River and sail {{down to the}} Klondike. Each of them was {{required}} to bring a year's supply of food by the Canadian authorities {{in order to prevent}} starvation. In all, their equipment weighed close to a ton, which for most had to be carried in stages by themselves. Together with mountainous terrain and cold climate, this meant that those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.|$|E

60|$|What {{was great}} and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet, misunderstood. This man, whose clay was so plastic {{that he could}} live {{in any number of}} pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and most obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole, which was the only one she knew. She <b>could</b> not <b>follow</b> the flights of his mind, and when his brain got beyond her, she deemed him erratic. Nobody else's brain ever got beyond her. She <b>could</b> always <b>follow</b> her father and mother, her {{brothers}} and Olney; wherefore, when she <b>could</b> not <b>follow</b> Martin, she believed the fault lay with him. It was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the universal.|$|R
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly who <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the convention, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race, casting himself as the standard-bearer of the Robert Kennedy legacy. As the 1968 Democratic National Convention started, Humphrey stated that he had more than enough delegates to secure the nomination, but {{commentators}} questioned the campaign's ability {{to hold on to}} the delegates. The Texas delegation announced frustration at the McCarthy campaign's attempts to change procedures, and declared that they might renominate President Johnson as a result. Observers noted that Humphrey's delegates were supporters of Johnson, and <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> suit. Meanwhile, protests and sleep-ins were held in the streets and parks of Chicago, forcing Mayor Richard J. Daley to order federal troops into the city. Eventually, 6,000 federal troops and 18,000 Illinois National Guardsmen were outside the convention, defending the premises. A televised debate was held featuring Humphrey, McCarthy and McGovern. Humphrey hoped to unite the party during the debate, affirming his support for peace in Vietnam, but his challengers were received better by the crowd, drawing more applause.|$|E
5|$|She {{owned the}} winners of {{approximately}} 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, {{the winner of the}} 1984 Whitbread Gold Cup, and Devon Loch, which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 Grand National and whose jockey Dick Francis later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed detective stories. Peter Cazalet was her trainer for over 20 years. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, Clarence House, so she <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> the races. As an art collector, she purchased works by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Peter Carl Fabergé, among others.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} horse remains {{found in}} the area now covered by Britain and Ireland date to the Middle Pleistocene. Two species of horse have been identified from remains at Pakefield, East Anglia, dating back to 700,000BC. Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove, dated 500,000BC, showed that early hominids were hunting horses in the area at that time. The land which now comprises the British Isles was periodically joined to continental Europe by a land bridge, extending from approximately the current coast of North Yorkshire to the English Channel, most recently until about 9,000years ago. Dependent on {{the rise and fall}} of sea levels associated with advancing and retreating Ice ages, this allowed humans and fauna to migrate between these areas; as the climate fluctuated, hunters <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> their prey, including equids.|$|E
5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E

Subjects then performed five isokinetic contractions at 180 °/s by doing five full range of motion kicks in the same manner. Average peak torque (Nm) was calculated over an angular displacement of 60 °. A 10  min rest was given prior to the dynamic muscle endurance testing.|$|R

25|$|In October 2015, Mazda {{unveiled}} the RX-Vision concept {{car at the}} Tokyo Motor Show, powered by a new rotary engine and featured design cues reminiscent to the third generation RX-7. A production-ready concept <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> suit by 2017, marking 50 years since the revealing of Mazda's first rotary-powered sports car, the Mazda Cosmo. As a halo car for the Mazda brand, this vehicle may enter production as the RX-9.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the Foundation prequels prior to reading the Foundation Trilogy fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises. In that same Author's Note, Asimov noted that {{there is room for}} a book between Robots and Empire (5) and The Currents of Space (6), and that he <b>could</b> <b>follow</b> Foundation and Earth (15) with additional volumes.|$|E
