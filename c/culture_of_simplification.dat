40|$|Kinyarwanda- the {{language}} of Rwanda- appears {{to be one of}} the world‟s most complex and possibly richest, but increasingly endangered by foreign influences. The language complex features are particularly associated with the multiplicity of its morphemes and their agglutination to form its words (or sentences), as well as its extra-ordinary lexical variability and expressivity. Conversely, its richness seems to be increasingly overshadowed by a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> language <b>simplification</b> and hybridization that affect key aspects of {{the language}}, which might be stemming from cultural crossbreeding that the Rwandan society has been undergoing for some years. The diversity of languages spoken by Rwandese who returned to their homeland after many years of exile in other linguistic cultures for example, colors, influences or hybridizes the standard Kinyarwanda. The present article argues therefore, that hybridization of the language has educational implications, and educators are often confronted by many unanswered questions that may include: „„What is the standard Kinyarwanda?‟‟, “To what extent can the foreign influences and related dilemma be tolerated during the learning and teaching process?‟ ‟ and, “How can educators deal with these?‟‟ The article attempts to explore the basis of these key questions, and basing on the findings of research conducted in the field of education including non-formal education, it sounds a wakeup call to all teacher trainers, especially those of Kigali Institute of Education, to reflect on their profession and their roles in shaping the future generation of th...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of biofilters to varying periods of starvation and {{to changes in}} inlet concentrations of a mixture of toluene and xylene have been tested in laboratory-scale biofilters packed {{with a mixture of}} Perlite and compost.

But for more stressful situations, like the resumption of the feed after periods of starvation, the use of carbon dioxide proved to be inappropriate as an indicator of the biomass activity, greatly overestimating biofilter performance. This suggested either the occurrence of cryptic growth (as a result of the stress inflicted on the biomass) or perhaps the utilisation of the compost as a carbon source...|$|R

40|$|<b>Simplification</b> <b>of</b> texts has {{traditionally}} been carried out by replacing words and structures with appropriate semantic equivalents in the learner's interlanguage, omitting whichever items prove intractable, and thereby bringing {{the language of the}} original within the scope of the learner's transitional linguistic competence. This kind <b>of</b> <b>simplification</b> focuses mainly on the formal features of language. The simplifier can, on the other hand, concentrate on making explicit the propositional content and its presentation in the original in order to bring what is communicated in the original within the scope of the learner's transitional communicative competence. In this case, simplification focuses on the communicative function of the language. Up to now, however, approaches to the problem <b>of</b> <b>simplification</b> have been mainly concerned with the first kind, using the simplifier’s intuition as to what constitutes difficulty for the learner. There appear to be few objective principles underlying this process.

40|$|A formalised {{means of}} {{simplifying}} hydrological models concurrent with calibration is proposed for use when nonlinear models can be initially formulated as over-parameterised constrained absolute deviation regressions of nonlinear expressions. This provides a flexible modelling framework for approximation of nonlinear situations, while allowing the models to be amenable to algorithmic <b>simplification.</b> The degree <b>of</b> <b>simplification</b> {{is controlled by}} a user-specified forcing parameter lambda. That is, an original over-parameterised linear model is reduced to a simpler working model which is no more complex than required for a given application. The degree <b>of</b> <b>simplification</b> is a compromise between two factors. With weak simplification most parameters will remain, risking calibration overfitting. On the other hand, a high degree <b>of</b> <b>simplification</b> generates inflexible models. The linear LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is utilised for the <b>simplification</b> process because <b>of</b> its {{ability to deal with}} linear constraints in the over-parameterised initial model.
