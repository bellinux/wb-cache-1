5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> as fundamental and then used the <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E

The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including <b>circular</b> <b>motion,</b> lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E

Pre-vious {{work in this}} field has produced theoretically justified algorithms for stabilization of parallel and <b>circular</b> <b>motions</b> of self-propelled particles using measurements of relative position and relative velocity. This paper describes an observer-based feedback algorithm for stabilization of parallel and <b>circular</b> <b>motions</b> using measurements of relative position only. This algorithm utilizes information about the particle dynamics and turning rates to estimate the relative velocities. We describe a laboratory-scale underwater vehicle testbed on which the algorithm is being implemented. I...|$|R

25|$|In {{non-uniform}} <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> the net acceleration (a) is along {{direction of}} Δv which is directed inside circle {{but does not}} pass through its center (see figure). The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: tangential acceleration and normal acceleration {{also known as the}} centripetal or radial acceleration. Unlike tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration is present in both uniform and non-uniform <b>circular</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of course, this radial force, {{which is}} the cause of the current, creates a radial {{component}} of electron velocity, generating in turn its own Lorentz force component that opposes the <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> of the electrons, tending to slow the disc's rotation, but the electrons retain a component of <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> that continues to drive the current via the radial Lorentz force.|$|E

In his questiones on the Sphere (written before 1362), Nicole Oresme described how to combine <b>circular</b> <b>motions</b> to produce a reciprocating linear motion of a planet along the radius of its epicycle.

25|$|Uniform <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> {{refers to}} the case of {{constant}} rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.|$|E
25|$|In physics, <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> is a {{movement}} of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> of its parts. The equations of motion describe {{the movement of the}} center of mass of a body.|$|E

25|$|In physics, uniform <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> {{describes}} {{the motion of}} a body traversing a circular path at constant speed. Since the body describes <b>circular</b> <b>motion,</b> its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates {{the presence of an}} acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation.|$|E
