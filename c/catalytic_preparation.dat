Three kinetic models were considered: (a) the conventional two-step model of enzyme catalysis, where the preparation contains only active catalyst (E(a)) and inert (i. e. non-binding, non-catalytic) material (E(i)); (b) {{an extension of the}} conventional model (a) involving only E(a) and E(i), but with non-productive binding to E(a) (in addition to productive binding); (c) a model in which the preparation contains also binding but non-catalytic material (E(b)), predicted to be present in polyclonal <b>catalytic</b> antibody <b>preparations.</b> The method involves comparing the parameters V(max) and K(m) obtained under catalytic conditions where substrate concentrations greatly exceed catalyst concentration with those (klim/obs, the limiting value of the first-order rate constant, k(obs), at saturating concentrations of catalyst; and Kapp/m) for single-turnover kinetics, in which the reverse situation obtains. The active-site contents of systems that adhere to model (a) or extensions that also lack E(b), such as the non-productive binding model (b), may be calculated using [E(a) ](T) =V(max) /klim/obs. This was validated by showing that, for alpha-chymotrypsin, identical values of [E(a) ](T) were obtained by the kinetic method using Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe- 4 -nitroanilide as substrate and the well-known 'all-or-none' spectroscopic assay using N-trans-cinnamoylimidazole as titrant.

40|$|Bio-refinery {{process has}} been {{considered}} to be a promising solution with high potential for a sustainable production of valuable chemicals. One motive is to partially substitute the conventional petroleum products and to minimize the negative effects related to their uses, for years to come. Compounds like γ-valerolactone, esters of levulinic acid, and 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran were identified as key target molecules that can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass and find use as renewable fuels, fuel additives, green solvents, or precursor to other fine chemicals. Central of this thesis is the exploration of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>preparation</b> of γ-valerolactone, esters of levulinic acid, and 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran starting from levulinic acid and α-angelica lactone, versatile and viable platform chemicals made efficiently from lignocellulosic biomass. Although the catalytic synthesis of γ-valerolactone was studied intensively in the last years, our effort has been directed toward developing less energy demanding protocols with lower environmental impact and higher sustainability. In this regards, the catalytic transformation of levulinic acid and α-angelica lactone to γ-valerolactone has been examined under mild conditions where high yield toward γ-valerolactone were obtainable. Secondary alcohols as an internal source of hydrogen were found to be as active as hydrogen in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. This has been proven using conventional heating or microwave irradiations methods. Analysis of reaction network confirms the conversion of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone through γ-hydroxyvaleric acid as an intermediate. Beside the main hydrogenation reaction of α-angelica lactone, the isomerization and ring-opening reactions have found to take place and yield by-products like valeric and pentenoic acids. Furthermore, this research was extended to the investigation of γ-valerolactone synthesis starting from different esters of levulinic acid. Examining the relationship between the ester of choice and the activity reveals higher yield of γ-valerolactone for the esters with low and linear alkyl chain. The second stage focus on the preparation of levulinic esters themselves. Starting from levulinic acid and α-angelica lactone, levulinic acid esters were prepared using different catalytic systems and under mild conditions. The use of α-angelica lactone as a substrate found to be more efficient than levulinic acid as no equilibrium is encountered in the addition of alcohols to α-angelica lactone. A mechanistic study of the addition of alcohols to α-angelica lactone reveals the presence of pseudo-esters of levulinic acid prior the rearrangement step which yields the neat esters. This dissertation is also dealing with the preparation of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran starting from levulinic acid, α-angelica lactone, levulinic acid esters, and γ-valerolactone. A prohibitive effect of water in the reaction mixture on the productivity of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran was confirmed. Additionally, the stability of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran was examined where pentanol has been observed as a degradation product of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran over time. A reaction network analysis reveals several side reactions occurring in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction of γ-valerolactone to 2 -methytetrahydrofuran. The utilization of ruthenium supported on carbon has found to catalyze other reactions like dehydration, decarbonylation, and dehydrogenation reactions. This yields compounds like pentanol, pentane, butanol, butane, methane beside 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran...|$|E

The diastereoselective hydrogenation of enantioenriched (E) -trisubstituted hydroxy enamines to generate 1, 2 -disubstituted 1, 3 -amino alcohols is also outlined. These methods are initiated by highly regioselective hydroboration of N-tosyl substituted ynamides with diethylborane to generate β-amino alkenyl boranes. In situ boron to zinc transmetalation generates β-amino alkenyl zinc reagents. These functionalized vinylzinc intermediates were subsequently added to aldehydes {{in the presence}} of catalyst derived from an enantioenriched amino alcohol (morpholino isoborneol, MIB). The catalyst promotes highly enantioselective C–C bond-formation to provide β-hydroxy enamines in good isolated yields (68 – 86 %) with 54 – 98 % enantioselectivity.

The specific nature of the antibody catalysis was demonstrated by the adherence of these reactions to the Michaelis–Menten equation, the complete inhibition by a hapten analogue, and the failure of the antibody to catalyse the hydrolysis of the 2 -nitrophenyl analogue of the 4 -nitrophenylcarbamate substrate. Hammett s–r analysis suggests that both the non-catalysed and antibody-catalysed reactions proceed by mechanisms in which development of the aryloxyanion of the leaving group is well advanced in the transition state of the rate-determining step. This is probably the ElcB (elimination–addition) mechanism for the non-catalysed reaction, but for the antibody-catalysed reaction might be either ElcB or BAc 2 (addition–elimination), in which the elimination of the aryloxy group from the tetrahedral intermediate has become rate-determining. This result provides evidence of the dominance of recognition of phenolate ion character in the phosphate hapten in the elicitation process, and is discussed in connection with data from the literature that suggest a BAc 2 mechanism, with rate-determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate for the hydrolysis of carbamate substrates catalysed by an antibody elicited by a phosphonamidate hapten in which phenolate anion character is minimized.

In general, aldolate-type products containing secondary and tertiary stereogenic centers are obtained in high yield and with excellent stereoselectivities. Despite the breadth of reactivity that has been observed for additions to aldehydes under this mode of catalysis certain structural motifs, such as quaternary carbons and tertiary alcohols have remained unsolved problems. This deficiency is further underscored by the dearth of general methods for the <b>catalytic,</b> asymmetric <b>preparation</b> of fully substituted stereogenic carbon centers. To address these challenges, and empower Lewis base catalysis for the asymmetric synthesis of tetrasubstituted carbons a range of disubstituted N-silyl ketene imines has been investigated as latent nucleophiles for additions to carbonyl compounds. In the presence of silicon tetrachloride and a catalytic amount of chiral bis-phosphoramide, N-silyl ketene imines underwent extremely rapid additions to aldehydes, providing aldol products containing quaternary stereogenic centers in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Further extension of this chemistry to catalytic, enantioselective Michael-type reactions and vinylogous aldol additions has also been realized, by introduction of a double bond into the aldehyde acceptor or N-silyl ketene imine donor.

Significant progress has been made toward the total synthesis of the marine meroterpenoid liphagal, a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase alpha inhibitor. The enantioselective decarboxylative alkylation has been employed, and an acetylene [2 + 2] photoaddition / ring-opening sequence is used to construct the 7 -membered ring. New understanding about the reactivity of [6 - 7] bicyclic scaffolds has been gathered, and the information applied during preparation of liphagal’s benzofuran motif. Our efforts have led to a functionally diverse array of liphagal analogues, which may be used for structure-activity-relationship studies with phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinases...|$|R

The effect of electron quantum confinement on the catalytic activities of 2 D ultra-thin metal films is explored by comparing the work function change and the initial reaction rate of atomically flat films of different thickness on silicon surfaces, using complementary microscopy and spectroscopy techniques.

40|$|Inhibition of {{translation}} in hemin-containing reticulocyte lysates by <b>catalytic</b> subunit (cS) <b>preparations</b> of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart, reported earlier by our group, {{is due to}} a highly active heat-stable protein contaminant (HS). The specific activity for translational inhibition goes up by a factor of 10 when cS is heated for 10 min at 80 degrees C, which completely destroys histone phosphorylation activity. HS has been purified to homogeneity from bovine heart. It consists of a single polypeptide chain (Mr approximately 68, 000). HS inhibits translation with biphasic kinetics similar to those of hemin deficiency and induces pronounced phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF- 2. The inhibition is relieved by eIF- 2 or GTP but not by high concentrations of double-stranded RNA, thus ruling out involvement of the double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor. Judged by poly(U) translation, HS has no effect on chain elongation. When added to crude preparations of the proinhibitor form (proHCI) of the heme-controlled translational inhibitor (HCI), HS appears to produce an increase of the HCI-to proHCI ratio. The mode of action of HS is as yet unknown...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanism(s) of the vasoconstrictor effect of cantharidin in bovine <b>preparations.</b> <b>Catalytic</b> subunits of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP 1) and type 2 A (PP 2 A) were immunologically identified in coronary arteries, isolated smooth muscle cells and ventricular myocardium. The mRNAs coding for catalytic subunits of PP 1 α, PP 1 β and PP 2 Aα were identified by hybridization with specific cDNA-probes in total RNA from coronary arteries, isolated smooth muscle cells and ventricles. The activities of catalytic subunits of PP 1 and PP 2 A separated by column chromatography from coronary arteries, isolated smooth muscle cells and ventricles were inhibited by cantharidin in a concentration-dependent manner. Cantharidin increased the phosphorylation state of smooth muscle proteins including the regulatory light chains of myosin in 32 P-labelled intact smooth muscle cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Cantharidin did not affect cytosolic calcium concentrations in aortic smooth muscle cells. It is suggested that cantharidin contracts smooth muscle preparations by increasing the phosphorylation state of regulatory proteins due to inhibition of phosphatase activities. Thus, cantharidin might be a useful tool to study the function of phosphatases in smooth muscle...|$|R

The phase-mineral and chemical composition, content and behavior (capture, retention, distribution, and redistribution) of transition metals, {{as well as}} morphogenesis, surface area, acid-base properties, surface active sites and oxidation-reduction transformations of the catalytic sorbents were characterized. It was found that minerals and phases such as anhydrite, calcite, clay minerals, pyrite, pyrrhotite, magnetite and fusinoid-type ingredients have a leading role for the behavior of loaded transition metals. Some original (pyrite, jarosite, shcherbinaite, coulsonite, trevorite, Ni oxide) and newly formed (pyrrhotite, magnetite, wuestite, hematite, paramontroseite, karelianite) Fe, V and Ni minerals in the catalytic sorbents are perspective redox indicators for the physicochemical conditions in such complex system.

The isocyanate-free {{approach is a}} green chemistry route, wherein carbon dioxide conversion {{plays a major role}} in NIPU <b>preparation.</b> <b>Catalytic</b> carbon dioxide fixation can be achieved through carbonation of epoxidized derivatives of JCO. In this study, 1, 3 -diaminopropane (DM) and isophorone diamine (IPDA) were used as curing agents separately. Cyclic carbonate conversion was catalyzed by tetrabutylammonium bromide. After epoxy conversion, carbonated JCO (CJCO) and carbonated alkyd resin (CC-AR) with carbonate contents of 24. 9 and 20. 2 wt %, respectively, were obtained. The molecular weight of CJCO and CC-AR were determined by gel permeation chromatography. JCO carbonates were cured with different amine contents. CJCO was blended with different weight ratios of CC-AR to improve its characteristics. The cured NIPU film was characterized by spectroscopic techniques, differential scanning calorimetry, and a universal testing machine. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of the NIPU film before and after solvent treatment. The solvent effects on the NIPU film interfacial surface were investigated with water, 30 % ethanol, methyl ethyl ketone, 10 % HCl, 10 % NaCl, and 5 % NaOH. NIPU based on CCJO and CC-AR (ratio of 1 : 3) with IPDA crosslink exhibits high glass transition temperature (44 °C), better solvent and chemical resistance, and Young’s modulus (680 MPa) compared with the blend crosslinked with DM. Thus, this study showed that the presence of CC-AR in CJCO-based NIPU can improve the thermomechanical and chemical resistance performance of the NIPU film via a green technology approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{preparation}} of Li-promoted MgO catalysts is described using, respectively, (i) wet impregnation and (ii) sol-gel method. In the case of Li-promoted MgO catalysts, defects sites, due to the surface substitution of Mg 2 + ions by a Li+ ion in the MgO matrix, are reported to {{play a significant role}} in processes involving oxidation reactions. More specifically, the impregnation of MgO supports with aqueous solutions of Li salts (i. e., LiNO 3), as route to prepare Li-promoted MgO catalysts, allows a homogeneous distribution of lithium on the catalyst surface. However, in this specific case, high temperature treatments are required. In fact, incorporation of lithium ions in MgO (forming a substitutional solid solution) takes place only at ≥ 700 °C causing drastic sintering effect that result in materials with low surface area and thus low <b>catalytic</b> activity. Sol-gel <b>preparation</b> is here presented as an alternative and promising route for {{the preparation of}} Li-promoted MgO catalysts. In this study, Li-promoted MgO catalysts were prepared via co-gelling Mg(OCH 3) 2 and LiNO 3. Our observations during gel studies suggested that the presence of lithium ions in the sol-gel system drastically influenced the extent of hydrolysis and condensation. In particular lithium ions can be incorporated already in magnesia at the Li-Mg-gel stage facilitating formation of a substitutional solid solution. Furthermore, the results showed that high temperature treatments are not required and very active materials are formed after calcination at temperatures below 600 °C. In addition, the enhanced lithium incorporation minimizes the amount of free lithium phases present. Our observations suggest that in the case of Li-promoted MgO catalysts both those effects are responsible for the high thermal stability and high surface area obtained after calcination. In this work, IR spectroscopic characterization of Lewis acid sites (Mg 2 + LC) using carbon monoxide is also extensively reported and presented as a tool to investigate the effect of the incorporation of lithium ions in MgO. Our results suggest that sol-gel catalysts possess a higher amount of incorporated lithium ions in MgO. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained from active site titration using CO 2 sorption experiments and oxidation reduction cycles with H 2. Interestingly, the results showed that incorporated lithium ions efficiently provide the stabilization of active oxygen species [O-] in MgO forming [Li+O-] sites. Therefore, the activity and selectivity improvements during the oxidative conversion of propane can be explained by the promoting effect of lithium to enhance the creation of active oxygen species [O-] in MgO. Accordingly, during the oxidative dehydrogenation/cracking of propane over Li-promoted MgO catalysts prepared using sol-gel route, a higher number of active [Li+O-] sites per cm 3 of reactor volume was achieved compared to conventionally prepared materials and superior yields were recorded (same amounts of catalyst in the reactor) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the concern}} of global warming {{resulted}} of greenhouse gases (GHG), continuous efforts have been devoted {{to address this issue}} by advanced chemical reaction technologies to convert the main GHG gas CO 2 into useful products. Among the proposed solutions, dry reforming of methane (DRM) for synthesis gas (syngas) production emerges as a promising technology compared to the industrially applied technologies for syngas production. DRM refers to the chemical reaction of methane and carbon dioxide to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are designated as synthetic gas. Due to the relatively low hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio, this process is attractive for the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process of the Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) Technologies. The DRM utilizes CO 2 as an oxidant to react methane over heterogeneous catalyst and has important environmental implications because of the consumption of both CO 2 and CH 4, both significantly contributing to the greenhouse effect. Converting these gases into a valuable syngas will reduce the atmospheric emissions of CO 2 and CH 4. This thesis presents a comprehensive review of the catalyst design and <b>preparation,</b> <b>catalytic</b> activity and thermodynamics-kinetics analysis, and focuses on the catalyst deactivation which is the main concern of this process. Heterogeneous catalyst for DRM generally consists of active species dispersed on mesoporous supports coupled with a promoter. Literature reports that group VIII metals onto oxides supports are effective for this catalytic process. Although noble metals demonstrate highest catalytic stability, the bimetallic Ni-based catalysts appears to be promising for future processes in industrial scale. Furthermore, mesoporous supports {{play an important role in}} both catalytic activity enhancement and coke deposition prevention. It is accepted that the Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 supports are more promising, contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity and to the coke deposition prevention. In addition, promoters are non-active additives that improve the metallic dispersion over the support. Among the various reported promoters, Ce and ZrO 2 show remarkable performance of minimizing carbon deposition and preventing active metal sintering. In this work, special attention is also paid to the investigation of catalysts design and synthesis. despite the fact that the catalyst preparation methodology is already well defined, the realization to obtain the exact structure, morphology and function of the produced catalyst is still hard to achieve and drives the further investigation on more controllable preparation and characterization methods. Finally, studies on thermodynamic and kinetics of DRM is also elaborated. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is based on Gibbs energy minimization method and are interconnected to the kinetic reaction mechanisms. Thermodynamic variable optimization is not fully identified yet and play an important role for gaining high DRM efficiency. In general, the DRM is favored with low pressures of 1 bar, temperature range of 770 - 1170 °K and reactant (CO 2 +CH 4) ratio close to unity. DRM is a relatively simple reaction however its mechanism is difficult to predict and catalyst deactivation is still a great concern. Further systematic studies need to be done in order to achieve significant process improvement for the utilization of the DRM in large industrial scales...|$|R
