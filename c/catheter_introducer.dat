30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} in a medical/surgical ICU {{was carried out}} over a 24 -month period: patient undergoing PDT between January 2014 to December 2014 (Group A: 70 patients) were retrospective analyzed and compared with patient who were undergoing PDT between January 2013 to December 2013 (Group B: 65 patients). In the Group A PDT was performed by using the modified CBR technique: the modification consist of a transverse cut (5 mm long and deep to the anterior tracheal wall) practiced, under guided light given by flexible bronchoscope trans illumination, before the trachea was punctured with a 14 -gauge Teflon <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer</b> needle. In the group B we use the standard CBR technique [1]. In both groups we use fiber optic guide and Blue Rhino dilator (Cook Critical Care, Bloomington, IN, USA) was used to dilate the opening to a sufficient size.|$|E
30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} all surgeons listed on the Gynecare database in the UK who were known to or thought to be carrying out TVT (n= 446). The surgeons {{were asked to identify}} themselves as gynaecologists or urologists and the institution in which they worked. They were asked approximately how many TVT procedures they carried out annually, whether they carried out preoperative urodynamics and whether they carried out TVT in the outpatient department, day surgery unit or as inpatients. The type of anaesthetic was requested and whether the surgeons used the concept of aqua dissection. The respondents were asked if they used a <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer</b> and, if so, what size catheter they used. They were asked if a cystoscopy was routinely carried out and whether this was carried out after each or both passes of the needle. The surgeons were asked whether they routinely used a cough test and, if so, at what bladder volume. They were asked whether the urethra was checked after the removal of the plastic sheath to ensure the sling was not too tight and, if so, what size dilator was used. They were asked whether a catheter was inserted at the completion of the procedure and, if so, whether a suprapubic or urethral catheter was used. They were asked what postoperative volume was deemed acceptable for discharge, whether the patients returned for follow-up and, if so, how long postoperatively.|$|E
40|$|A 100 cm-long 16. 5 F {{valvuloplasty}} <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer</b> {{was assessed}} {{as an adjunct}} for percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty (PTAV) via the femoral artery in 31 patients with severe aortic stenosis. Observed improvements in peak systolic gradient (81. 6 +/- 29. 9 mm Hg vs. 35. 5 +/- 16. 0 mm Hg, P less than 0. 000001) and aortic valve area (0. 6 +/- 0. 4 cm 2 vs. 1. 0 +/- 0. 6 cm 2, P less than 0. 00001) {{were similar to those}} achieved in a control group (C) of 17 patients in which no femoral sheath was used. However, a shorter procedure duration (211 +/- 81 min vs. 117 +/- 30 min, P less than 0. 001) and a reduced rate of vascular complications at the femoral puncture site (41 % vs. 6. 5 %) were observed in patients in whom the long sheath (LS) technique was used. The frequency of other PTAV-related complications was comparable (C = 35 %, LS = 29 %, P = n. s.). Other technical advantages of this device are: 1) prevention of looping and bending of the balloon catheter in tortuous vessels and easy positioning of the balloon across the aortic orifice provided by the LS trackability, 2) stabilisation of the balloon during inflation, 3) monitoring of supravalvular aortic pressure provided by the side-arm of the LS and reliable measurement of systolic gradient, and 4) the ability to perform aortograms without the need of another catheter in the ascending aorta. Thus, in our experience, the long sheath technique is a valuable adjunct for PTAV...|$|E

30|$|For anaesthesia, each rabbit {{was given}} an {{intramuscular}} injection of 10 mg/kg ketamine, 0.15 mg/kg of medetomidine, and 2 – 8 mg/kg of intravenous propofol (Propofol Lipuro®, Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The animals {{were placed in the}} supine position and a laryngeal mask size- 1 was used. An 8 – 10 cm midline incision through the skin was made from the epigastrium for a laparotomy. Then an incision was made through the thin subcutaneous tissue to expose the linea alba. Using an inverted number- 11 scalpel blade, an incision was made parallel to the linea alba. After exposure of the small bowel, a small branch of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was punctured with a 24 -gauge needle (Abbocath, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA). After the stylet of the needle was removed, a 0.014 -inch guidewire (Transend, Boston Scientific MediTech, Natick, MA, USA) was advanced with fluoroscopic guidance towards the liver. After removal of the cannula, a 4 -F coaxial <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer</b> (Micropuncture access set, Cook Medical, USA) was advanced within the SMV. The 2 -F introducer was then removed and direct portography was finally performed. Portograms were obtained with injection of 10 ml of contrast (RadialarⓇ 280 mg/ml, Juste SAQF, Madrid, Spain) into the hand. When the procedure was finished and the introducer was removed, the SMV was ligated {{at the level of the}} catheterisation. Finally the puncture site was covered with an absorbable haemostatic agent (Surgicel®, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). After confirming that there was no bleeding, the linea alba was closed in a simple continuous suture pattern with a synthetic absorbable material. The skin was closed using an interrupted pattern. Resulting images were transferred to the ImageJ programme (Rasband WS, ImageJ; National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) where the diameter and length of the portal branches were obtained.|$|E
30|$|Two {{hundred and}} fifty replies were received, {{including}} 14 from surgeons who did not perform the procedure. This left 236 (53 %) replies from 200 gynaecologists and 36 urologists for analysis: 184 replies were from district general hospitals, 43 from teaching hospitals and 9 from regional referral centres, which represents approximately 8, 386 annual TVT procedures (range 3 – 200, mean 36, median 25) and is therefore representative of practice in the UK. Preoperative urodynamics were carried out in 222 units (94 %). The majority of respondents carry out TVT for inpatients alone (n= 173) compared with day surgery units alone (n= 22). Forty surgeons carried out TVT in both day surgery and on inpatients, with only one surgeon carrying out TVT in the outpatient department. The type of anaesthetic varied widely from local anaesthetic alone (n= 15), local anaesthetic plus sedation (n= 32), general anaesthetic alone (n= 32), regional anaesthetic alone (n= 63) and a mixture of anaesthetics (n= 94). Opinion was divided concerning aqua dissection, with 125 respondents using this technique compared with 111 against it. The amount of local anaesthetic used ranged from 20 – 200  mls (mean 92  mls, median 90  mls). Almost all surgeons use a <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer</b> (n= 211, 89 %), with an average size of 18  g. All surgeons (100 %) carry out an intraoperative cystoscopy, with 108 doing a cystoscopy after each needle pass and 128 after both needles have been passed. Two hundred surgeons use a cough test compared to 36 who are against it: the majority (n= 144) simply filled the bladder to an approximate volume (range 150 – 1, 000  mls, mean 368  mls, median 350  mls). Three surgeons filled the bladder to the leak point pressure on urodynamics, eight filled to bladder capacity on urodynamics and ten used other measurements prior to a cough test. The majority (n= 125) do not routinely check the urethra after removal of the covering plastic sheaths. Those that do (n= 101) use an average of an 8 -hagar gauge or 18 French gauge dilator. The use of a catheter {{at the completion of}} the operation was equally divided: 115 of respondents who do use a catheter preferred urethral (n= 109) instead of suprapubic catheters (n= 6). The majority of surgeons (n= 142) use a post-void residual bladder volume of < 100  mls as acceptable for discharge: 62 use a residual of between 100 – 200  mls, 10 used a voided volume equal or greater than twice the voided volume, and 22 use other criteria. Two hundred twenty-nine of the surgeons follow up patients at between 1 – 52  weeks (mean 8  weeks, median 10  weeks).|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Descrever os eventos adversos ocorridos durante e após angioplastia coronária (ATC), possivelmente relacionados ao reuso de produtos médico-hospitalares, além de quantificar e identificar os motivos de descarte em relação ao primeiro uso e ao reuso. MÉTODO: Foram estudados 60 pacientes, sendo que 29 (48, 3 %) apresentavam angina instável, 27 (45 %) IAM e quatro (6, 7 %) outros diagnósticos. Durante o procedimento e na permanência na Unidade Intensiva Coronariana, atentou-se à possibilidade de ocorrência dos eventos adversos febre, hipertensão, hipotensão, calafrios, sudorese, sangramento, náuseas e vômitos. Foram avaliados sete produtos médico-hospitalares: introdutor, cateter-guia, fio-guia 0. 35, fio-guia 0. 014, cateter- balão para angioplastia, seringa com manômetro para insuflar balão (indeflator) e torneira de três vias (manifold). No total de produtos (76 de primeiro uso e 410 reprocessados), verificou-se se houve descarte e se isto ocorreu antes ou durante o procedimento e quais os motivos para tanto. Utilizou-se o teste Qui Quadrado, admitindo-se erro alfa de 5 %. RESULTADOS: Vinte e seis pacientes apresentaram eventos adversos. A hipotensão foi o evento mais prevalente e ocorreu em 11 (18, 3 %) casos. Não houve, porém, significância estatística entre o evento adverso hipotensão e reuso ou não dos produtos médico-hospitalares. Por não estarem íntegros, foram descartados três produtos de primeiro uso e 55 produtos dos reutilizados. CONCLUSÃO: Os eventos adversos apresentados pelos pacientes submetidos à angioplastia não estão associados ao reuso dos produtos médico-hospitalares. A integridade e funcionalidade foram os motivos principais de descarte. OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the adverse effects}} that occur during and after {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) possibly related to the reuse of medical equipment. An additional objective is to quantify and identify the reasons of discard in respect to the brand-new and reuse of medical equipment. METHOD: Sixty patients were studied (48. 3 % with unstable angina, 45 % with acute myocardial infarction and 6. 7 % with other diagnoses). During the procedure and stay in the Intensive Coronary Unit, the occurrence of fever, hypotension or hypertension, chills, sudoresis, bleeding, nausea and vomits were observed. Seven products were evaluated: <b>catheter</b> <b>introducer,</b> catheter guides (0. 35 and 0. 014), catheter balloons for angioplasty, indeflators and manifolds. In total, 76 brand-new and 410 reused apparatuses were studied to verify the occurrence of discard, whether this happened before or during the procedure and for what reasons. P-values < 0. 05 were considered signicant. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients presented adverse effects. Hypotension was the most common seen in 11 (18. 3 %) cases. There was no significant association between this adverse effect and reuse or not of the equipment. Three brand-new products and 55 of the reused products were discarded as they were incomplete. CONCLUSION: The adverse effects presented by patients submitted to coronary vessel angioplasty were not associated to the reuse of the medical equipment. The integrity and functionality were the main reasons of discard...|$|E

40|$|Arterial {{cannulation}} is {{a common}} procedure for diagnostic as well as interventional catheterisation. The incidence of arterial damage varies from around 1 % to 45 % {{depending on the size}} of the patient, size of catheters used, repeat procedures, pre-existing vascular disease and whether the procedure was interventional as opposed to diagnostic (twelve times higher risk with intervention). The absence of a pulse following catheterisation can result from spasm, local thrombus formation, formation of a flap of endothelium, dissection or avulsion of the artery. In order to minimize the risks of arterial damage the following factors may help: a clean puncture, small French <b>catheters,</b> tapered well-fitting <b>introducer</b> sheaths, a short procedure time and administration of heparin (50 to 100 units/kg with further dose/s if the procedure lasts more than 75 minutes) ...|$|R

30|$|Vascular access was {{obtained}} as described [1]. Briefly, each rabbit was sedated using isoflurane (5  %)/oxygen (1.5  l/min) via mask administration. An endotracheal tube was inserted, and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (3 – 4  %)/oxygen (1.5  l/min). The antibiotic Enrofloxacin (Baytril; Bayer Corp; Agriculture Division, Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, KS) was given intramuscularly (5  mg/kg), and the neck was shaved {{and prepared for}} aseptic surgery using alcohol and Betadine scrub. A small midline incision was made to isolate and cranially ligate the right common carotid artery. Proximal to the ligation, a small arteriotomy was made to insert a 4.0 -F sheath (Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN) into the vessel, where sodium heparin (100  IU/kg) was administered. A 2.8 -F microcatheter (EmboCath; BioSphere Medical, Rockland, MA) was inserted through the sheath and directed down the aorta to its bifurcation using fluoroscopic monitoring. The catheter was then manipulated into each external iliac artery. In order to assess vascular anatomy and tumor location, digital subtraction arteriography was performed by injecting radiographic contrast medium, meglumine-diatrizoate (Conray 60  %; Mallinckrodt Inc., St Louis, MO), and by hand using fluoroscopic guidance. The microcatheter was then positioned into the deep femoral artery, which is the main, if not exclusive, artery supplying the tumor. The catheter was flushed with saline first, and then 100  μl (MOI of 10) of adenovirus with or without 2.5  μg/ml angiotensin II (GenScript USA, Piscataway, NJ) in 10  ml saline was slowly injected; the catheter was flushed once again with saline. Angiotensin II has an approximately 15 -s half-life [22]. The catheter was then manipulated into the deep femoral artery in the opposite thigh, and the process was repeated. Then, the <b>catheter</b> and <b>introducer</b> sheath were removed, the carotid artery was ligated proximal to the arteriotomy, and the incision was closed in two layers.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular {{treatment}} of thoracic aortic disease {{may be associated}} with severe neurologic complications. The current study used the data of a multicenter registry to assess of the incidence and the risk factors for paraplegia or paraparesis and intracranial stroke. MethodsThe European Collaborators on Stent/Graft Techniques for Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) database prospectively enrolled 606 patients. Thoracic pathologies with urgent or elective presentation, which included degenerative aneurysm in 291, aortic dissection in 215, traumatic rupture in 67, anastomotic false aneurysm in 24, and infectious or nonspecified disorders in 9. Study end points included evidence of perioperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI) or stroke. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were used to assess the significance of clinical factors that potentially influenced the occurrence of neurological sequelae. ResultsParaplegia or paraparesis developed in 15 patients (2. 5 %) and stroke in 19 (3. 1 %); two patients had both complications. At multivariate regression analysis, independent correlation with SCI was observed for four factors: (1) left subclavian artery covering without revascularization (odds ratio [OR], 3. 9; P =. 027), (2) renal failure (OR, 3. 6; P =. 02), (3) concomitant open abdominal aorta surgery (OR, 5. 5; P =. 037) and (4) three or more stent grafts used (OR, 3. 5; P =. 043). In patients with perioperative stroke, two correlating factors were identified: (1) duration of the intervention (OR, 6. 4; P =. 0045) and (2) female sex (OR, 3. 3; P =. 023). A neurologic complication (paraplegia or stroke) developed in 8. 4 % of the patients in whom left subclavian covering was required compared with 0 % of patients with prophylactic revascularization (P =. 049). ConclusionPerioperative paraplegia or paraparesis was significantly associated with blockage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization. The clinical significance of this source of collateral perfusion of the spinal cord had not been confirmed previously. Intracranial stroke was associated with lengthy manipulation of wires, <b>catheters,</b> and <b>introducer</b> sheaths within the aortic arch, reflected by a longer duration of the procedure...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of endocardial LV pacing using a steerable lead introducer and active fixation polyurethane lead. Methods and results Endocardial LV lead placement was attempted in nine patients (seven males, age 48 – 77 years) in whom transvenous CS lead placement had failed. Trans-septal puncture and septal dilatation were performed via the femoral route. A steerable <b>introducer</b> <b>catheter</b> was advanced across the septal puncture site from the right or left subclavian vein into the LV. An active fixation polyurethane lead was then implanted into the high postero-lateral aspect of the LV endocardial wall. All patients were anticoagulated following implant. Successful LV lead placement was achieved in eight patients. There were no acute complications and no embolic events during follow-up (1 – 32 months). All implanted patients responded well with either improvement in New York Heart Association class or maintenance of symptomatic improvement that had previously been conferred by LV epicardial pacing. Conclusion Targeted LV endocardial pacing is a potential alternative to CS pacing and warrants a trial to characterize long-term benefits and risks...|$|R

The authors report their experience in counterpulsation-related complications of 201 consecutive patients who underwent 212 percutaneous counterpulsation balloon insertions from June 1989 to June 1996 by use of balloons with 8 - 9. 5 French shafts. Of these, 82 % were men and 36 (18 %) were women, {{with a mean age}} of 61 &plusmn; 12 years. Indications for counterpulsation were acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (67 %), severe left ventricular failure without AMI (20 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (4 %), unstable angina (3 %), high-risk supported percutaneous coronary angioplasty (2 %), and others (4 %). IABP was instituted at the bedside in the intensive care unit in 82 patients (39 %) and in the catheterization laboratory in 130 (61 %). Median duration of counterpulsation was 48 hours (range 30 minutes to 25 days) with successful weaning from counterpulsation in 70 % (148 of 212) of procedures.
