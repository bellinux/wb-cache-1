Also, unlike the previous researches, we've applied a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to account value of each project with respect to each criterion, in the proposed methodology. The FIS helps us to set rule-based systems for paying attention to expert's experience and professional knowledge in decision making.

In this respect, selecting managers based on their skills can lead to a competitive advantage towards the achievement of organizational goals. selection of the suitable project manager {{can be viewed as a}} multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and an extensive evaluation of criteria, such as Technical skills, experience skills, Personal qualities and the related criteria must be considered in the selection process of project manager. The fuzzy set theory and MCDM methods appears as an essential tools to provide a decision framework that incorporates imprecise judgments and multi <b>criteria</b> <b>nature</b> of project manager selection process inherent in this process. This paper proposes the joint use of the Fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEMATEL) and Fuzzy VIKOR methods for the decision-making process of selecting the most suitable managers for projects. First, with the opinions of the senior managers based on project management competency model (ICB-IPMA), all the criteria required for the selection are gathered. Then the FDEMATEL method is used to prioritize the importance of various criteria and FVIKOR used to rank the alternatives in a preferred order to select the best project managers from a number of alternatives. Next, a real case study used to illustrate the process of the proposed method. Finally, some conclusions are discussed at the end of this study. ...|$|R
40|$|Nature {{quality in}} {{relation}} to farming is a complex field. It involves different traditions and interests, different views of what nature is, and different ways of valuing nature. Furthermore {{there is a general}} lack of empirical data on many aspects of nature quality in the farmed landscape. The present paper looks at nature quality from the perspective of organic farming, which has its own values and goals {{in relation to}} nature – the "Ecologist View of Nature". This is in contrast to the "Culturist View" characteristic of much conventional agriculture and the "Naturalist View" characteristic of the traditional biological approach to nature quality. This threefold distinction forms a framework for exploration of <b>nature</b> quality <b>criteria</b> in the farmed landscape. The traditional work on nature quality has mainly focused on biological interests based on a Naturalist View of Nature. In this paper we will explore how <b>criteria</b> for <b>nature</b> quality based on the Ecologist View can be developed and thereby feed into the ongoing discussion of the development of the organic farming practises. We suggest additional <b>criteria</b> for <b>nature</b> quality based on an Ecologist View of Nature: biodiversity; habitat diversity, extent and structure; functional integrity of habitats and agroecosystems; and landscape integrity, accessibility and experientiality. The larger set of Naturalist and Ecologist criteria can provide a wider and more balanced basis for developing nature quality indicators that are relevant in the farmed landscapes. This broader approach to nature quality is also expected to benefit the general societal discussions and decisions on farming and nature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a {{real-world}} decision-aiding problem for zoning the risk of erosion, total suspended solids emissions, and ecological consequences of their transfers towards the streams. One of these consequences is the decrease of fishes into the streams in agricultural watersheds, because of the clogging of spawning areas. Given the multiple <b>criteria</b> <b>nature</b> of the problem, the originality of our research is to adapt a new decision-aiding sorting method, ELECTRE TRI-C, for identifying risk zones in rural areas, where measures must be taken. The developed model was applied in a small watershed (Low Normandy, France) where the objective {{was to assess the}} most appropriate intervention for protecting the reproduction habitat of the salmonid fishes. Agricultural parcels were evaluated on multiple criteria for grouping them into four risk categories, which are related to risk levels as well as priorities on the improvement works. The decision-aiding sorting model is co-constructed, within a constructive approach, through an interaction process between decision-aiding analysts, environmental experts, and local actors for improving transparency and communication on the results. This model is linked with a geographical information system (GIS) for assessing a set of criteria and the visualization of the farming parcels along with their type of intervention they should be submitted to best practices. The assignment results were validated by the environmental experts. These results have a strong impact on the agricultural practices of the farmers into the watersheds. The model proposed in this paper can be considered as a useful decision aid tool in any regions for implementing public agricultural and environmental policies for protecting the ecological areas...|$|R

Commonly, not only the phenotype but also the ecological capacity are considered in breeding back projects, because hardy breeding back results are used in certain conservation projects.

Therefore, selection <b>criteria</b> in <b>nature</b> versus those in domestic conditions are different and domesticated animals often differ significantly in phenotype, behaviour and genetics from their wild forerunners.

We prove this theorem, and also examine the precise roles of the strategy sets allowed to the minimizer and the maximizer in determining the upper value of the game.

40|$|The task {{of solving}} optimal {{engineering}} design problems is {{considered as a}} demanding decision-making process where the real-life industrial problems typically {{have to be considered}} from very different perspectives. In this context the most logical approach to achieving the best solution, at the presence of multiple design criteria and numerous design variables, has been the task of performing scientific optimization to produce potential solutions for further decision-making. Accordingly multiple criteria decision-making approaches to optimal engineering design problems, via employing efficient, robust, global and multi-objective optimization algorithms, have brought a significant and competitive advantage to the optimal design. However most of these approaches, due to the characteristics of the real-life problems, often associated with the usage, dimensionality and high computational cost of the objective evaluations, have not been practical and widely acceptable in engineering design community. Here the difficulties and further requirements of utilizing the optimization approaches in optimal engineering design are discussed with a more emphasis on challenges to complex geometries, dimensionality, and multiple <b>criteria</b> <b>nature</b> of the real-life engineering design problems. As a response to the considered challenges, performing the optimizations approaches in the framework of an integrated design environment is proposed as the key success to win industry. Further this research the metamodels in general approaches to optimal engineering design, are seen as the essential but not sufficient tools to enhance creating the efficient global optimization approaches in dealing with dimensionality. In fact by extension the dimension of multiple criteria decision-making problems which has been mostly due to the increasing number of variables, optimization objectives, and decision criteria, presenting a decision-maker with numerous representative solutions on a multidimensional Pareto-optimal set can not be practical in engineering applications. Accordingly for better dealing with the ever increasing dimensionality a supplementary decision-support system to enhance the metamodels is proposed. As the result an improved decision procedure is formed according to the limited human memory and his data processing capabilities. In this context the research further contributes in shifting from generating the Pareto-optimal solutions, to the reactive and interactive construction of a sequence of solutions, where the decision-maker is the learning component in the decision-making loop. To doing so the conventional evolutionary and interactive optimization and decision-making algorithms are updated by reactive search methodology, empowered with the advanced visualization techniques, in the framework of an integrated design environment...|$|R
