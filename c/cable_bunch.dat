40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} (NDE) {{of steel}} cables in long span bridges {{is necessary to}} prevent structural failure. Thus, an automated cable monitoring system is proposed that uses a suitable NDE technique and a cable-climbing robot. A magnetic flux leakage- (MFL-) based inspection system was applied to monitor the condition of cables. This inspection system measures magnetic flux to detect the local faults (LF) of steel cable. To verify the feasibility of the proposed damage detection technique, an 8 -channel MFL sensor head prototype was designed and fabricated. A steel <b>cable</b> <b>bunch</b> specimen with several types of damage was fabricated and scanned by the MFL sensor head to measure the magnetic flux density of the specimen. To interpret {{the condition of the}} steel cable, magnetic flux signals were used to determine the locations of the flaws and the levels of damage. Measured signals from the damaged specimen were compared with thresholds that were set for objective decision-making. In addition, the measured magnetic flux signals were visualized as a 3 D MFL map for intuitive cable monitoring. Finally, the results were compared with information on actual inflicted damages, to confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed cable monitoring method...|$|E

The non-cable qubo channel aired reruns of Elliot Moose from 2007 to 2010, and continues to air reruns of Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse and Timothy Goes to School {{as part of its}} daily programming.|$|R
50|$|Under Atal Jyoti Abhiyan Neemuch {{is having}} 24X7 power supply from 25 May 2013. Neemuch districtâ€™s {{population}} is 8 lakh 25 thousand 958 and {{total number of}} villages 674. Number of power consumers is 1 lakh 65 thousand 565 including 39 thousand 956 permanent agriculture pumps consumers. In the district, average power load is 70-75 MW, 53 feeders of 33/11 KV and 196 of 11 KV. There are 176 rural and 20 urban feeders. Besides, length of 33 KV lines is 644 kilometers, 11 KV lines 3,306 kilometers, low-tension lines (aerial <b>bunch</b> <b>cable)</b> 2553 kilometers and low-tension lines 8285 kilometers.|$|R
50|$|The Berryman Bridge was {{the second}} {{suspension}} bridge {{to be the primary}} access to Te Rata. The earlier bridge, which collapsed around the 1980s, was a fearsome structure on the same site. In the 'Otago Born and Bred' articles noted below, this first bridge {{is referred to as the}} Hayes Bridge. The Hayes bridge, said to be 100 ft above the water, is understood by the Ruslings, still resident in the valley, to have been built by the Tichner brothers, formerly sailors, around 1915-1916. The <b>cables</b> consisted of <b>bunches</b> of 52 strands of No. 8 wire, and endured the whole life of the bridge, a period of at least 66 years. When the bridge finally collapsed under the weight of a mob of sheep, the uprights on the house side gave way, allowing the anchors to fall away. Evan and Bob Hayes, who were moving the sheep, were fortunately not on the bridge when it collapsed, but most of the sheep were either killed from the fall, or drowned in the Retaruke.|$|R
