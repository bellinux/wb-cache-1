5|$|Chester J. Lampwick created Itchy for the now-lost silent <b>cartoon</b> Manhattan Madness, {{in which}} the mouse brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat <b>cartoon).</b> However, the {{character}} was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first <b>cartoon</b> in 1928, titled That Happy Cat. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first <b>cartoon</b> together, Steamboat Itchy, a violent parody of Disney's Steamboat Willie. Along with the <b>cartoon</b> shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II-era radio series, at least two films — Pinitchio and Scratchtasia (parodies of Pinocchio and Fantasia), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.|$|E

5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} <b>Cartoon</b> Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from <b>Cartoon</b> Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles.

5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's <b>cartoon</b> and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to <b>Cartoon</b> Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. <b>Cartoon,</b> would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it <b>Cartoon</b> Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E
