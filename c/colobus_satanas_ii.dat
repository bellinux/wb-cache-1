50|$|The black <b>colobus</b> (<b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas),</b> or satanic black colobus, is {{a species}} of Old World monkey {{belonging}} to the genus Colobus. The species is found in a small area of western central Africa. Black colobuses are large, completely covered with black fur, and like all other Colobus monkeys, {{do not have a}} thumb. The species has faced large declines in population due to habitat destruction and hunting by humans, and was consequently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} 105 mammal species which {{includes}} 16 species of primates. Some of the primate species recorded are <b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas,</b> Cercocebus torquatus, mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Other mammal species include elephants (bush elephants, Loxodonta africana, and forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis), and shrews (Crocidura grassei). Sixty-five species of reptiles are reported, including crocodiles. Amphibians reported include Petropedetes palmipes and Leptodactylodon stevarti {{which are in}} the IUCN Red List. Goliath frogs (Conraura goliath) {{are found in the}} southern part of the park.|$|R

40|$|WOS: 000071525700007 International audienceWe {{report the}} {{integration}} of single male crowned guenons (Cercopithecus pogonias) into troops of black <b>colobus</b> (<b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas).</b> We observed one male Cercopithecus pogonias in three troops of <b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas</b> on 30 % of observation days (n = 231). Activities of single males guenons {{did not differ significantly}} from those of the colobus with which they associated. Moreover, both species performed simultaneously the same activities more often than expected by chance. Interspecific grooming occurred on several occasions. Furthermore, single male guenons spent as much in time social activities when part of a colobus troop, as they typically do when part of a conspecific group. Unlike solitary male crowned guenons, which are silent, a male that is integrated into a troop of colobus is vocal and emits social alarm calls to which colobus monkeys respond. During the single file movements of colobus troops, single male crowned guenons were integrated in the core of the troop and used the same branches at the same height with the colobus. Thus, the life of a single male crowned guenon with black colobus was social. We suggest that the main benefits that he gained is the possibility to live in a social context. Social interactions could be the key element to explain why single males Cercopithecus pogonias join troops of monkeys so different from their natal groups...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe black <b>colobus</b> monkey <b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas</b> is a {{threatened}} species {{from the central}} African forests suspected to be vulnerable to habitat disturbance and thus thought to be mainly restricted to primary forest. A survey {{was carried out in}} 1995 – 1996 to estimate the density of black colobus in the primary forest of the Lopé Reserve, central Gabon. Combined with the available data on density in the logged part of the reserve, a population of ca. 55, 900 colobus was estimated for the whole reserve. No {{significant differences were found between}} densities in logged and unlogged forests. Using data on the logging activity that occurred in the reserve, this result was mainly explained by a low rate of extraction (1 – 2 trees ha− 1) which did not induce a major change in the forest composition and structure. This suggests that hunting is currently a more important threat to the survival of the species than habitat disturbance. The Lopé Reserve is of prime importance for the conservation of this species since it holds the largest population of black colobus known in any protected area...|$|R
5000|$|The crested mona monkey is an agile species, which crosses large {{gaps between}} trees by jumping. Thy are {{normally}} found {{in groups of}} between 8 and 20 individuals which are typically {{made up of a}} single male, several females and their dependent offspring. Groups are highly vocal, with the males producing the loud, [...] "boom" [...] mentioned above announcing their presence and status, there is also a sharp hacking call which is used as an alarm. The dominant males are able to establish groups, and therefore the lives of most males are rather solitary and are marked by an absence of social contact. Surprisingly, this appears to lead to some males joining groups of other monkeys such as the black <b>colobus</b> <b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas,</b> where these solitary males can form strong group bonds with the bon conspecific monkeys , possibly resulting in a permanent loss of mating opportunities. The social groups of crested mona monkeys will also associate with other guenon species, especially with moustached guenon Cercopithecus cephus and greater spot-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans [...] These large mixed-species groups grant the monkeys' increasedprotection from predation, as the greater number of eyes on the sky means that the spotting of predators such as birds of prey is more likely, and it also facilitates the sharing of information between groups about the best foraging sites.|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000082449400002 International audienceWe {{observed}} ranging {{patterns in}} a black colobus population in the Foret des Abeilles, Central Gabon. We compared the results with those for two other populations (Lope Reserve in Central Gabon, Douala-Edea in coastal Cameroun) in order to estimate the extent of specific variability in population structure and ranging behavior and to identify ecological factors influencing interpopulation differences. The mean number of monkeys in a group is 17 and all groups had a multimale structure. Home ranges were large, {{and the fact that}} they continued to increase with increasing number of observations indicated that the monkeys did not frequently resample their habitat. Ranging patterns varied according to the staple food consumed: distances travelled daily increased with increasing seed intake and decreased with increasing leaf intake. The ranging patterns of groups of <b>Colobus</b> <b>satanas</b> are seminomadic. Up to 6 or 7 groups shared the same space, and two group ranges could overlap by as much as 65 - 75 %. Comparisons with the two populations previously studied showed that group size and group structure are broadly similar At all three sites, black colobus were mainly seed eaters and ate large amounts of leaves in the season of fruit shortage. In the Foret des Abeilles, however group home ranges were much larger than at other sites, and this population had the lowest density. This is correlated with vegetation composition and with harshness of the main dry season. This colobus population appears limited by both recurring food shortage in the dry season and episodic periods of seed shortage resulting from irregular fruiting of the dominant family Caesalpiniaceae. Their seminomadic ranging would constitute the least costly strategy to cope with the low carrying capacity of their habitat...|$|R
50|$|The {{black colobus}} monkey {{is a large}} species with a head-body length of 50-70 cm and a long tail of around 80 cm. As in all Colobus species, the black colobus has a slender build and ischial callosities - tough pads of skin on the rump. There is little sexual {{dimorphism}} between the two sexes - adult males can weigh between 10-15 kg, whilst females weigh between 10-11 kg. The black colobus is covered in black fur apart from the ears and face, and has longer hairs on its cheeks and forehead. Unlike other species of colobus monkey, black colobuses have no white markings. The two subspecies of black colobus look very similar, although the fur of <b>Colobus</b> s. <b>satanas</b> is slightly longer and fluffier. There is currently not enough data to estimate the life expectancy of the species.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe line {{transect}} method {{is one of}} the main methods used to estimate primate densities. Several protocols have been proposed to analyze the data recorded under this method but none of them have been widely accepted since there is a considerable controversy about their respective accuracy. In this study, densities of the black <b>colobus</b> monkeyColobus <b>satanas</b> calculated using eight different protocols were compared with the actual density given by the home range method. Rates of polyspecific associations were also compared. The two most accurate estimates of group density (under- or overestimation < 10 %) were yielded by the protocol that used the maximum transect-to-animal distance and by that of using a fixed distance of 100 m. These protocols, however, underestimated individual density because counts performed from transects underestimated by 23 % the average group size. The six other protocols overestimated group density by 20 – 195 %. Factors that could explain these overestimation were discussed. Because histogram of sighting frequency showed several classes of distances with no records and because groups have been detected as far as 160 m, we suggested that the uneven topography of the study site increased the variability of the sighting distances. Combined with a relatively low number of sightings (n= 23), this did not allow to identify a sharp detection distance. Rates of polyspecific association found with the two methods were similar. We recommend to investigate the influence of the topography for bias in density estimates when using the {{line transect}} method...|$|R
