25|$|A {{channel is}} an {{independent}} hardware component that coordinates all I/O {{to a set of}} controllers or devices. It is not merely a medium of communication, despite the name; it is a programmable device that handles all details of I/O after being given a list of I/O operations to carry out (the <b>channel</b> <b>program).</b>|$|E
25|$|Channel I/O {{provides}} considerable {{economies in}} input/output. For example, on IBM's Linux/390, the formatting {{of an entire}} track of a DASD requires only one <b>channel</b> <b>program</b> (and thus only one I/O instruction), but multiple channel command words (one per block). The program is executed by the dedicated I/O processor, while the application processor (the CPU) is free for other work.|$|E
