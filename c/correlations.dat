Instead of trying to optimize the <b>correlation</b> filter, or propose a new decision <b>correlation</b> peak detection criterion, we propose herein to denoise the <b>correlation</b> plane before applying the peak-to-correlation energy (PCE) criterion. For that purpose, we use a linear functional model to express a given <b>correlation</b> plane as a linear combination of the <b>correlation</b> peak, noise, and residual components. The <b>correlation</b> peak is modeled using an orthonormalized function and the singular value decomposition method.

Finally, an optimized <b>correlation</b> plane is reconstructed while discarding the noise components.

Under all the three <b>correlation</b> measures, we observe the proposed LCCDC metric to demonstrate significantly larger <b>correlation</b> coefficient values with BWC vis-a-vis the <b>correlation</b> coefficient values incurred by the other centrality metrics. Among the three <b>correlation</b> measures, the Spearman’s rank-based <b>correlation</b> measure yields the largest values for the <b>correlation</b> coefficient between LCCDC and BWC, such that the level of <b>correlation</b> is very strongly positive for 16 of the 18 networks analyzed and strongly positive for the remaining two networks. Similarly, with respect to the Pearson’s product moment-based <b>correlation</b> measure, we observe the LCCDC metric to exhibit <b>correlation</b> levels of strongly to very strongly positive for 16 of the 18 networks (11 networks exhibit very strongly positive <b>correlation</b> and 5 networks exhibit strongly positive <b>correlation).</b> The Kendall’s concordance-based <b>correlation</b> measure yields the lowest values for the <b>correlation</b> coefficient between BWC and the other centrality metrics. Nevertheless, even under the Kendall’s <b>correlation</b> measure: we observe the LCCDC metric to exhibit strong to very strong positive <b>correlation</b> with BWC for 14 of the 18 real-world networks analyzed. Overall, considering all the three <b>correlation</b> measures, we could say that the LCCDC metric exhibits strong to very strong levels of positive <b>correlation</b> for at least 14 of the 18 real-world networks analyzed.
