The search for this particular flow can be obtained by interfacing the "maximum flow algorithm" (by Ford & Fulkerson) with a "shortest path algorithm" (we choose the one by Dijkstra) : this will lead to two new algorithms: the "cycle-canceling algorithm" and "successive shortest path algorithm". ...|$|E
40|$|The Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) {{problem has}} been defined as to {{determine}} a least <b>cost</b> <b>shipment</b> of a commodity through a network in order to satisfy demands at certain nodes from available supplies at other nodes.

Based on integer solution property of the problem, the Yager ranking indices can be calculated for fuzzy arc costs to change the fuzzy arc costs to crisp ones. Consequently the problem can be converted to a MCF problem with fuzzy arc capacities and fuzzy supply. Then by defining the fuzzy residual network, the MCF algorithms are developed to solve this problem efficiently. In fact the aim {{of this paper is to}} consider the theoretical aspects of the problem, not numerical results of the presented algorithm.

This thesis models the NAVICP shipping of unserviceable but repairable (retrograde) Navy materiel or Depot Level Repairables (DLRs). It develops an integer linear program to prescribe minimum <b>cost</b> <b>shipment</b> recommendations of DLRs from fleet to repair locations within the NAVICP and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) distribution system subject to constraints on average shipping time (AveTime). NAVICP provided data on DLR shipments {{for one year}} from which we construct six representative DLRs, 3 of aviation and 3 of maritime cognizance. We find a cost and time savings can be achieved for all representative DLRs by avoiding the use of DLA as storage prior to induction for repair. In this study we compare shipping costs {{for each of the}} six DLRs when we constrain AveTime, from 2 to 8 days. We find 2 -day constrained AveTime shipping, on average, costs 18 times that of 7 -day AveTime shipping, twice that of 3 -day shipping and a minimum of 5 times and a maximum of 11 times that of the costs of 4 through 6 -day shipping.

40|$|The minimum cost flow {{problem is}} to {{determine}} a least <b>cost</b> <b>shipment</b> of a commodity through a network G = (N, A) {{in order to satisfy}} demands at certain nodes from available supplies at other nodes. In this paper, we study a variant of the minimum cost flow problem where we are given a set R ⊆ A of arcs and require that each arc in R must carry the same amount of flow. This problem, which we call the simple equal flow problem, arose while modeling a water resource system management in Sardinia, Italy. We consider the simple equal flow problem in a directed network with n nodes, m arcs, and where all arc capacities and node supplies are integer and bounded by U. We develop several algorithms for the simple equal flow problem [...] -the network simplex algorithm, the parametric simplex algorithm, the combinatorial parametric algorithm, the binary search algorithm, and the capacity scaling algorithm. The binary search algorithm solves the simple equal flow problem in O(log(nU)) applications of any minimum cost flow algorithm. The capacity scaling algorithm solves it in O(m(m + n logn) log (nU)) time, which is almost the same time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem by the capacity scaling algorithm. These algorithms can be easily modified to obtain an integer solution of the simple equal flow problem. minimum cost flow problem, network simplex algorithm, scaling algorithm, parametric programming, network flows...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a decentralized dynamic production-distribution control. A discrete deterministic {{model in which}} a vendor produces a product and supplies it to the buyer is considered.

30|$|From the {{observations}} {{in the existing}} literature in which the ordering cost is fixed per cycle, it is seen that whenever the number of replenishment cycles is more, the ordering cost be very high than the ordering cost in one cycle though in each case total quantity delivered is same in finite time horizon. Practically, in real business world, this concept is not completely error free. Again, whenever number of replenishment cycles is more then the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> is reduced inversely since the quantity delivered is less per cycle. That is, if a_ 1 be the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> for total quantity Q to be delivered in one time in the business period then for n replenishment, the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> per cycle will be a_ 1 /n, since {{in this case the}} total quantity Q is delivered in n cycle of amount Q/n per cycle. So, the <b>shipment</b> <b>cost</b> per cycle varies inversely with n. Again, if the total quantity Q is delivered in more than one cycle, clearly due to the processing the delivery supplier must claim an extra charge which is known as processing cost. Notedly, this type of cost will be increased whenever number of replenishment cycles also increases. That is, the ordering cost can not be constant for a fixed time horizon. But, till now, no one has considered variable ordering cost depending on replenishment cycle in a fixed time horizon.|$|R

The proposed model helps railroads decide which fuel stations to contract, and how each locomotive should purchase fuel along its predetermined shipment path, such that no locomotive runs out of fuel while the summation of fuel purchasing <b>costs,</b> <b>shipment</b> delay <b>costs</b> (due to fueling), and contracting charges is minimized.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the papers in the area of distribution network design has explicitly addressed the issues of 2 -echelon inventory cost function arising from co-ordination of replenishment activities between the warehouses and the retailers. We structure this problem as a set-partitioning integer-programming model. The pricing problem that arises from the column generation algorithm gives rise to a new class of submodular function minimization problem.

We begin with some basic {{statistics on the}} number and frequency of {{export transaction}}s by a firm, overall and across individual markets. We then decompose the variation in overall exports into the number of transactions {{and the size of}} the average transaction, both at the aggregate level and for individual firms to explore gravity equations, where the patterns of exports and numbers of transactions are related to the distance with respect to the destination. The analysis is carried out both at the aggregate and the firm level. Then we explore the relationship between patterns of transactions numbers and shipment modes. Our results show great heterogeneity in the patterns of frequency and number of transactions across firms; the average firm sent about 75 shipments abroad in 2005, while the firm with largest number of transactions that same year dispatched more than 26, 000 shipments. Moreover, while close to 35 % of firms in the sample report a single export transaction over the period, for most firms with multiple transactions the average span between two transactions is less than a month. Part of this heterogeneity is shown to be related to the distance with respect to the destination market: firms exporting to more distant destinations make less frequent shipments than firms exporting to markets that are closer. This suggests that there are fixed <b>costs</b> per <b>shipment</b> inducing declining marginal <b>cost</b> of higher <b>shipment</b> volume. These patterns imply that, at the aggregate level, transactions numbers are the primary source of variation in exports.
