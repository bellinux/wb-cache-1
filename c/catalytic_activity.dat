5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this <b>catalytic</b> <b>activity,</b> meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of <b>catalytic</b> <b>activity,</b> the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of partially competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has <b>catalytic</b> <b>activity,</b> which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex.

5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the <b>catalytic</b> <b>activity</b> of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and in silico.

By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vapour-phase {{alkylation}} of catechol with ethanol {{has been}} investigated over Al-P-Ti-O oxides prepared by non-uniform precipitation method. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>activities</b> decrease {{with the increase of}} P content. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>activities</b> increase with increasing Ti content, while the selectivity to guathol decreases. The results of XRD characterization demonstrate that the increase of titanium and the addition of additive affects the structure of the catalysts. The addition of additive (cane sugar or citric acid) decrease the <b>catalytic</b> <b>activities</b> of the catalysts, while increase the stability of the catalyst. Both the conversion of catechol and the selectivity to guathol decrease by the addition of additive, and the C-alkylation products increase obviously.
