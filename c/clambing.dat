Martin continued with the Gearlink Kawasaki team for the 2009 season. The 2009 season was a struggle for Martin only finishing 2 of the 9 races. Despite this Martin <b>clambed</b> his first win in the British Supersport class at Mallory Park, that he completed crashing heavily at Brands Hatch.|$|R

İlk olarak, dikdörtgen plakların genel hareket denklemi Kirchhoff Plak Teorisi uygulanarak elde edildi ve plakın özdeğerleri ve özvektörleri sonlu farklar metodu kullanılarak hesaplandı. Daha sonra, plakın rijitlik matrisi ve kütle matrisi direkt rijitlik metoduyla oluşturuldu. Sonuçta, plakın rijitlik matrisi, kütle matrisi ve yük vektöründen oluşan sistemin hareket denklemi Newmark doğrusal ivme metodu ile çözüldü. The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the elastic and elasto-plastic {{deflections}} of rectangular thin plates with <b>clambed</b> supported under various dynamic loads by Newmark’s linear acceleration method. Firstly, the general equation of motion of the rectangular plate has been derived by applying Kirchhoff’s Plate Theory and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the plate with <b>clambed</b> supported have been obtained using the finite difference method. Then the stiffness matrix and mass matrix of the plate was constructed by the direct stiffness method. Finally, the equation of motion of the system which consists of the stiffness matrix, the mass matrix, and the load vector has been solved using the Newmark’s linear acceleration method...|$|R
25|$|The {{adaptation}} {{is eight}} hours in length, and covers {{most of the}} characters and storylines in the novel. Characters from the book who are not present include the wife of Snagsby, the law stationer; the wife and grandson of the money lender Smallweed; the law clerk Tony Jobling; the bankrupt Jellyby; Sir Leicester Dedlock's several cousins; and the Bagnet family, friends of the ex-soldier Sergeant George. The character of <b>Clamb,</b> clerk to the lawyer Tulkinghorn, {{was created by the}} screenwriter as a device for showing Tulkinghorn's motives and deeds without recourse to a narrator.|$|R
6000|$|When he {{sees the}} cottage the next time, it is smiling in sunset; those bedroom windows are open where the light was burning the night before; and Pen's tenant, Captain Stokes, of the Bombay Artillery (whose mother, old Mrs. Stokes, lives in Clavering), {{receives}} his landlord's visit with great cordiality: shows him over the grounds and the new pond he has made in the back-garden from the stables; talks to him confidentially about the roof and chimneys, and begs Mr. Pendennis to name a day when he will do himself and Mrs. Stokes the pleasure to, etc. Pen, {{who has been a}} fortnight in the country, excuses himself for not having called sooner upon the Captain by frankly owning that he had not the heart to do it. [...] "I understand you, sir," [...] the Captain says; and Mrs. Stokes, who had slipped away at the ring of the bell (how odd it seemed to Pen to ring the bell!), comes down in her best gown, surrounded by her children. The young ones <b>clamb</b> about Stokes: the boy jumps into an arm-chair. It was Pen's father's arm-chair; and Arthur remembers the days when he would as soon have thought of mounting the king's throne as of seating himself in that arm-chair. He asks if Miss Stokes--she is the very image of her mamma--if she can play? He should like to hear a tune on that piano. She plays. He hears the notes of the old piano once more, enfeebled by age, but he does not listen to the player. He is listening to Laura singing as in the days of their youth, and sees his mother bending and beating time over the shoulder of the girl.|$|R

On she wandered till {{she came to}} a great hill o' glass, that she tried a' she could to climb, bat wasna able. Round the bottom o' the hill she gaed, sabbing and seeking a passage owre, till at last she came to a smith's house; and the smith promised, if she wad serve him seven years, he wad make her iron shoon, wherewi' she could climb owre the glassy hill. At seven years' end she got her iron shoon, <b>clamb</b> the glassy hill, and chanced {{to come to the}} auld washerwife's habitation. There she was telled of a gallant young knight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash, and whaever washed thae sarks was to be his wife. The auld wife had washed till she was tired, and then she set to her dochter, and baith washed, and they washed, and they better washed, in hopes of getting the young knight; but a' they could do they couldna bring out a stain. At length they set the {{stranger}} damosel to wark; and whenever she began the stains came out pure and clean, but the auld wife made the knight believe it was her dochter had washed the sarks. So the knight and the eldest dochter were to be married, and the stranger damosel was distracted at the thought of it, for she was deeply in love wi' him. So she bethought her of her apple, and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewelry, the richest she had ever seen. [...] "All these," [...] she said to the eldest dochter, [...] "I will give you, on condition that you put off your marriage for ae day, and allow me to go into his room alone at night." [...] So the lady consented; but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared a sleeping-drink, and given it to the knight, wha drank it, and never wakened till next morning.
