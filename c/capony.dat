50|$|Vorey (also: Vorey-sur-Arzon) is a commune in the Haute-Loire {{department}} in south-central France. Clémentine Solignac the Doyenne of France {{from the death}} of Marie-Simone <b>Capony</b> until her own in 2008, lived in a retirement center in Vorey.|$|E
5000|$|Myra Leviston [...] "Nicky" [...] Nicholson (14 December 1894 - 20 September 2007) was {{the oldest}} living Australian and the eleventh-oldest {{validated}} {{person in the world}} following the death of French doyenne Marie-Simone <b>Capony</b> on 15 September 2007.|$|E
50|$|This tunnel allowed {{easy access}} to the <b>caponier</b> from the battery. In Victorian times, {{there would have been no}} other access to the secure <b>caponier</b> from outside the fort. It would {{probably}} have been lit by oil lamps.|$|R
5|$|The <b>caponier</b> (rifle gallery) extends {{into the}} ditch between the rampart and glacis from the fort's north west corner. It is {{connected}} to the fort via a tunnel, running under the rampart from the manning parade. For blast protection and defensibility the tunnel was built with a dogleg. The <b>caponier</b> has rifle firing ports and was originally protected from direct artillery fire by the glacis. Early plans showed the <b>caponier</b> extending from the fort's south west, and a tunnel linking the magazine and southern guns.|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{fire from}} one <b>caponier</b> {{bearing on the}} next, caponiers are {{sometimes}} set at alternate corners of the fort, so that they fire towards a blank wall {{at the opposite end}} of the ditch, giving full coverage of the ditch without subjecting the next <b>caponier</b> to fire. The length of the straight sections of the ditch is chosen so that it can be covered by fire from a single <b>caponier.</b> Caponiers are often wedge shaped so that they can fire down both angles of the ditch.|$|R
40|$|Summary More than 800 {{specimens}} of migrating symphylans (Myriapoda, Symphyla, Scutigerellidae) {{have been collected}} in an inundation forest at the rio Tarumã-Mirim near Manaus in Brazil. They belong to a new species, Hanseniella arborea, which is described. The material is from the migration into the <b>capony</b> prior to the inundation. All the specimens were collected in arboreal photoecectors placed {{at the height of}} 3. 60 m. above the ground...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian cancers have a {{high ability}} to invade the peritoneal cavity and some are stimulated by estrogens, In an attempt to {{understand}} the mode of action of estrogens on these cancer cells and to develop new markers, we have characterized estrogen-regulated proteins, This study,vas aimed at identifying a protein secreted by ovarian cancer cells whose level was increased by estradiol [Galtier-Dereure, F., <b>Capony,</b> F., Maudelonde, T. & Rochefort, H. (1992) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab, 75, 1197 - 1502]. By using microprotein sequencing, the 110 -kDa protein was identified as fibulin- 1, a protein of the extracellular matrix that binds to fibronectin, laminin, and nidogen, The amount of immunoprecipitated fibulin- 1 secreted into the medium and present in the cell extract was increased up to 10 -fold by estradiol in three estrogen-responsive ovarian cancer cell lines. By immunohistochemistry fibulin- 1 was located in the stroma of several ovarian cancers and cysts. The findings highlight a potential role for fibulin- 1 in the spread of ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity and/or in distal metastases...|$|E
40|$|Gelsolin is a Ca 2 (+) -dependent protein which severs actin filaments, caps their fast-growing {{ends and}} {{promotes}} nucleation. We report here results that delimit {{one of the}} interfaces between serum gelsolin and actin monomer. An actin-derived synthetic peptide (amino acids 305 - 326 of actin) coupled to a hydrophilic resin was tested for its possible interaction with gelsolin. We selected this sequence because it corresponds to a region implicated in the gelsolin-actin complex in a previous work [Boyer, Feinberg, Hue, <b>Capony,</b> Benyamin & Roustan (1987) Biochem. J. 248, 359 - 364]. We showed that this actin sequence {{is located at the}} surface of the actin molecule and observed a Ca 2 (+) -sensitive binding of gelsolin to this actin-derived peptide. In addition, by using a chymotryptic digest of gelsolin, we reported that only the C-terminal half of gelsolin interacts with the actin-(305 - 326) -peptide. These results that the Ca 2 (+) -sensitive interface includes both amino acids 305 - 326 of actin and probably amino acids 660 - 738 of gelsolin...|$|E

50|$|It {{was built}} in the 1890s for 9.2-inch breech loader guns. In use until 1936, and in World War II as a command post and {{searchlight}} battery. The battery was a regular polygon with central <b>caponier</b> on the landward side, and flanking caponiers at the North and South corners. The central <b>caponier</b> and North -East loopholed wall remain.|$|R

50|$|Crownhill Fort has six three-storey caponiers. The {{first floor}} was for infantrymen, {{the second was}} for gun casements each housing Smooth-Bore Breech-Loading guns and the third connects with the Chemin de Ronde, the parapeted walkway {{circling}} the fort. The north <b>caponier</b> is a full <b>caponier</b> because it points in two directions. The other five caponiers are demi-caponiers because they face in one direction only.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>caponier</b> is a counterscarp battery, dug into the outer face {{of the corner of}} the ditch, giving a similar field of fire. Reached by a tunnel from within the fort, it does not have the vulnerable roof that the <b>caponier</b> has, but being outside the ditch, is potentially more vulnerable to mining. Both structures may be found in the same fort.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Caponier</b> {{building}} in the ditch served as barrack accommodation for 24 men. With its iron window shutters and rifle slots the <b>Caponier</b> also provided a means of ditch defence. The original bridge had a section, which could be withdrawn, near the entrance gate, for defence purposes. The main building visible through the gate, was originally a single storey, flat roofed barrack comprising: three Officers’ Rooms, an Officers’ Kitchen, a Staff Sergeant's Quarters, and two rooms for 5 and 11 men.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>caponier</b> {{is a type}} of {{fortification}} in {{a defensive}} structure. The word originates from the French word caponnière. [...] "capon coop", i.e. [...] "hen house".|$|R
50|$|The Battery’s defences {{included}} a long south-east facing loop-holed wall for musketry fire, {{together with a}} <b>caponier</b> projecting northwards to flank the fort’s northern face (see plan).|$|R
50|$|In fortification, coffer {{a hollow}} lodgment, against a dry moat, {{the upper part}} being made of pieces of timber raised about two feet above {{the level of the}} moat. This {{elevation}} has hurdles filled with earth which serves as a parapet with embrasures. The coffer is similar to the <b>caponier.</b> The difference is that the former may be made beyond the counterscarp, and the latter is always in the moat. Another difference is that the coffer takes the whole breadth of the moat while the <b>caponier</b> does not.|$|R
50|$|The gate is {{approached}} {{through a}} pas-de-souris which is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Outer Greeks Gate. This was originally protected by a re-entrant place-of-arms, and was linked to the gate by a <b>caponier.</b> Today, the pas-de-souris provides vehicular access into the Mdina ditch, while the place-of-arms and <b>caponier</b> no longer exist. The gate was protected by a wooden à la Vauban drawbridge and a drop ditch, but the latter has been filled in. The underground chamber in which the drawbridge was retracted still exists. The gate still retains its wooden door in situ.|$|R

50|$|The fort was {{intended}} to be armed with 53 heavy guns; 19 of these were on the faces, 16 on the flanks, a lower tier of 9 guns in each flanking gallery under the ramparts with a further 30 lighter guns in the keep and caponiers besides 4 x 13-inch mortars on the parade ground. The site plan for the Gosport Advanced Forts lists the following armament :-Redoubt and Haxo 11 x 8-inch S.B. Left flank & <b>caponier</b> (2 Haxo) 13 x 8-inch S.B. Centre <b>Caponier</b> 6 x 8-inch S.B. Right flank & <b>caponier</b> (2 Haxo) 13 x 8-inch S.B. Left & Right shoulders terreplein2 x 40-pr. Armstrong Parade 4 x 13-inch mortarsIn 1886 Fort Brockhurst had mounted: 13 x 8-inch Smooth Bore (S.B.) guns, 16 x 7-inch Rifled Breech Loaders (R.B.L.s) and 4 x 64 pounder Rifled Muzzle Loaders (R.M.L.s) The armament of the fort remained until 1902 when all of the Gosport Advanced Line forts were disarmed. In 1916 it was armed with a 6-pounder Hotchkiss heavy anti aircraft gun.|$|R
