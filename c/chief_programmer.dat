5|$|Crash Boom Bang was {{developed}} by a Japanese video game studio Dimps. The game was designed by Yuka Niijima, Maiko Azaki and Shiina Suzuki, and was produced by Shinji Yoshikawa of Vivendi Universal Games. Takeshi Narita served as a creative director. It was programmed by Takeshi Kobayashi and Michitoshi Momose, with Kazuteru Suzuki serving as a <b>chief</b> <b>programmer.</b> The music was composed and arranged by Kuniyuki Morohashi. Yutaka Shioya served as the art director for the game.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} November 1972, James Whitmore {{expressed}} a desire to leave Temperatures Rising, claiming that [...] "the show [...] basically a broad farce and I didn't feel it was right for me". Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC <b>chief</b> <b>programmer</b> Barry Diller decided to replace Whitmore with comedian Paul Lynde, whose sitcom, The Paul Lynde Show, was airing on Wednesday nights. At the time, Lynde was scoring second only to Peter Falk in TV popularity polls even though his sitcom, which aired opposite The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour on CBS, was floundering in the ratings. Asher was against making this change but was overruled as his contractual commitments to ABC had been used up.|$|E

500|$|Core Design's {{original}} {{concept for}} the game was {{to make it more}} like an action-adventure, before the project has evolved into a more classic adventure game. The game was supposed to be [...] "an adventure for people who hadn't played that kind of game before." [...] The protagonist's effective invincibility was a late demand by the executive producer Jeremy Heath-Smith, resulting in a series of minor plot changes. The game's co-designer and the Amiga version's <b>chief</b> <b>programmer</b> Rob Toone said that their idea was to make these parts of the game [...] "interesting without being difficult." [...] Co-designer and the PC version programmer Ian Sabine stated that the lack of text [...] "speeds up gameplay". Regarding the decision to keep the onscreen text to a minimum, Toone said that [...] "too much reading can slow the game or kill it, like The Adventures of Willy Beamish," [...] with the main artist Rolf Mohr adding that [...] "hopefully, a picture will say a thousand words and make this system easy to use." [...] According to Toone, [...] "Lucasfilm gets most of its humour out of its text, whereas we hopefully get ours from comical animations and daft happenings." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{five members}} of Shiny Entertainment's MDK {{development}} team broke off to set up Planet Moon Studios in 1997 with software engineer, Scott Guest, they decided to make their first project fun and original, a game with graphics and gameplay unseen at that time. Nick Bruty, Bob Stevenson, and Tim Williams initially conceived the idea of pitting players as spacemen, pirates, and giants against each other and having fun. Initially projected for release in late 1999, the game suffered delays to its development {{largely due to the}} illness of their <b>chief</b> <b>programmer,</b> Andy Astor; he was suffering from stage IV mantle cell lymphoma in late 1999. The team realized they needed more resources and by 2000, they had hired two more programmers and an artist. Producing a next-generation game required them to keep up with 1998–2000's rapid advancement of technology, which resulted in further delays. The team upsized the graphic textures as they changed the graphical software to support NVIDIA graphics cards. Within a year after development started in 1999, the initial minimum graphics specification climbed from requiring [...] graphics cards to those of the GeForce-series. Planet Moon deemed game engines available during development too restrictive and inappropriate for their requirements, and built their own. Called Amityville, it could support Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D. The team used it to create the required [...] "lush and vibrant" [...] outdoor environments, and terrain deformation effects.|$|E

50|$|From 1990 to 1996, Poindexter {{served as}} co-founder of TP Systems, Inc., a {{software}} development {{firm specializing in}} commercial software for the IBM PCs and compatibles; Poindexter was the <b>chief</b> designer and <b>programmer.</b> Development included a symbolic debugger for multi-tasking environments, a BBS communications program, and numerous utility programs.|$|R
50|$|The founders, <b>chief</b> {{designers}} and <b>programmers</b> of the game, Ashik Noon and Adnan Karim were only final year students of computer {{science and engineering}} at the North South University during {{the development of the}} game. Ashik and Adnan took as many as 500 pictures of various streets of Dhaka to make the game realistic. The graphics modeling was done through Autodesk 3ds Max while the game's logic, artificial intelligence, car movement and behavior was programmed on Visual C++.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008 Big Brother {{returned}} for its eighth season with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O.

2500|$|In {{a series}} of books and {{articles}} published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by Autodesk in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. [...] Meanwhile, working independently, {{a team led by}} Douglas Engelbart (with Jeff Rulifson as <b>chief</b> <b>programmer)</b> was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with NLS. Ben Shneiderman working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [...] in 1983. [...] HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in Tim Berners-Lee's Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. [...] In 1988, Ben Shneiderman and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish [...] "Hypertext Hands-On!", the world's first electronic book.|$|E
2500|$|The aim with Catherine was {{to create}} a game that was not within the {{role-playing}} genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim {{was to create}} something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game. The three key staff members were all veterans of the Persona series: director and producer Katsura Hashino had helmed both [...] and Persona 4; art director and character designer Shigenori Soejima had designed characters for both Persona 3 and Persona 4; and composer Shoji Meguro had created music for multiple Megami Tensei titles, including the Persona series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the <b>chief</b> <b>programmer</b> was Yujiro Kosaka. The initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help. Hashino felt that Catherine was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.|$|E
50|$|According to the games' backstory, the Battletoads {{originally}} {{have been}} human computer technicians and roommates. The trio tested the original Battletoads game by {{playing the game}} as the 'Toads {{in a sort of}} virtual reality simulation. They became suspicious of both their boss and <b>chief</b> game <b>programmer</b> Silas Volkmire and decided to investigate the office at night. Upon finding the video game unit turned on, they tested it to see if it had been tampered with. This was a trap and they were transported to another planet, permanently transformed into the Battletoads. When the evil Dark Queen attempted to destroy the 'Toads upon their arrival, they fought their way to freedom with the assistance of Professor T. Bird, who became the 'Toads' friend and mentor. The 'Toads decided never to rest until the Dark Queen was defeated once and for all.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, NBCUniversal chief {{executive}} Jeff Zucker hired Ben Silverman as <b>chief</b> NBC <b>programmer,</b> {{and asked him to}} help bring NBC out of last place in network ratings. One of Silverman's early moves was to try to revive old franchises like Knight Rider and American Gladiators. Silverman, in a deal endorsed by Ford Motor Company, the car supplier, approved production. In advance of its anticipated weekly run, the new Knight Rider series was introduced with a television movie on February 17, 2008. The new series premiered on NBC on September 24, 2008 and led the network's Wednesday evening lineup, along with Deal or No Deal and Lipstick Jungle. On October 21, 2008, NBC gave the show a full season order of 22 episodes. All of the episodes that aired on TV are also available on the PlayStation Network Video Store, Xbox Live Marketplace, Hulu Plus (available only for computer streaming, not TV or mobile streaming), and iTunes Store. The episodes are available in HD format and SD format.|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Grant was Trespasser's <b>chief</b> {{artificial}} intelligence <b>programmer.</b> Every animation in Trespasser is done using inverse kinematics. No animation {{in the game}} is pre-animated; every movement of every dinosaur is generated automatically through their {{artificial intelligence}}. Due to the rushed nature of development, this feature resulted in awkward movement as the dinosaurs performed unnaturally. Trespasser was designed to have a complex artificial intelligence routine, giving each creature on the island {{its own set of}} emotions and the possibility of dinosaurs fighting each other. Dinosaurs would react to the player differently depending on what mood they were in. System bugs in the artificial intelligence routines made it so that dinosaurs would switch between mood-based actions so quickly that they would stop moving and acting. A quick fix was hard-coded into the game that locked all dinosaurs’ anger at maximum, leaving all other emotions at zero.|$|R
50|$|The <b>chief</b> <b>{{programmer}}</b> {{team will}} usually contain three-person teams. Consisting of a <b>chief</b> <b>programmer,</b> senior level programmer {{and a program}} librarian while additional programmers and analysts {{are added to the}} team when necessary. The weaknesses of this structure include a lack of communication across team members, task cooperation and complex task completion. The <b>chief</b> <b>programmer</b> team works best for tasks that are more simple and straightforward since the flow of information in the team is limited. Individuals that work in this team structure typically report lower work morale.|$|E

5000|$|A {{programming}} team {{is a team}} {{of people}} who develop or maintain computer software. [...] They may be organised in numerous ways, but the egoless programming team and <b>chief</b> <b>programmer</b> team are two common structures typically used.|$|E
50|$|Egoless {{programming}} explicitly minimizes {{constraints of}} hierarchy and status {{so as to}} enable the free exchange of ideas and improvements.
