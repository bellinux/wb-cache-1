This article develops a parametric haircut model by expanding haircut definitions beyond the traditional value-at-risk measure and employing a double-exponential jump-diffusion model for collateral market risk. Haircuts are solved to target credit risk measurements, including probability of default, expected loss or unexpected loss criteria. Comparing to data-driven approach typically run on proxy data series, the model enables sensitivity analysis and stress test, captures market liquidity risk, allows idiosyncratic risk adjustments, and incorporates relevant market information.

30|$|Let {{us first}} make some {{comments}} from the hedger’s perspective regarding the crucial features of the margin account. The financial practice may require to hold the collateral amounts in segregated margin accounts, so that the hedger, when he is a collateral taker, cannot {{make use of the}} collateral amount for trading. Another collateral convention mostly encountered in practice is rehypothecation (around 90 % of cash collateral of OTC contracts are rehypothecated), which refers to the situation where the hedger may use the collateral pledged by his counterparties as collateral for his contracts with other counterparties. Obviously, if the hedger is a collateral provider, then a particular convention regarding segregation or rehypothecation is immaterial for the dynamics of the value process of his portfolio. We refer the reader to Bielecki and Rutkowski (2015) and Crépey et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of various conventions on <b>collateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Here we will examine some basic aspects of collateralization (sometimes also called margining) in our context.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} {{evidence}} to fall within this rule, it must involve either (1) a written or oral communication made prior to {{execution of the}} written contract; or (2) an oral communication made contemporaneous with execution of the written contract. Evidence of a later communication will not be barred by this rule, as it is admissible to show a later modification of the contract (although it might be inadmissible for some other reason, such as the Statute of frauds). Similarly, evidence of a <b>collateral</b> <b>agreement</b> - one that would naturally and normally {{be included in a}} separate writing - will not be barred. For example, if A contracts with B to paint B's house for $1,000, B can introduce extrinsic evidence to show that A also contracted to paint B's storage shed for $100. The agreement to paint the shed would logically be in a separate document from the agreement to paint the house.|$|E

40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{a problem in}} the self-financing condition used in the papers "Funding beyond discounting: <b>collateral</b> <b>agreements</b> and derivatives pricing" (Risk Magazine, February 2010) and "Partial Differential Equation Representations of Derivatives with Counterparty Risk and Funding Costs" (The Journal of Credit Risk, 2011). These papers state an erroneous self-financing condition. In the first paper, this is equivalent to assuming that the equity position is self-financing on its own and without including the cash position. In the second paper, this is equivalent to assuming that a subportfolio is self-financing on its own, rather than the whole portfolio. The error in the first paper is avoided when clearly distinguishing between price processes, dividend processes and gain processes. We present an outline of the derivation that yields the correct statement of the self-financing condition, clarifying the structure of the relevant funding accounts, and show that the final result in "Funding beyond discounting" is correct, even if the self-financing condition stated is not.

5000|$|Collateral {{management}} is {{the method of}} granting, verifying, and giving advice on collateral transactions {{in order to reduce}} credit risk in unsecured financial transactions. The fundamental idea of collateral {{management is}} very simple, that is cash or securities are passed from one counterparty to another as security for a credit exposure. [...] In a swap transaction between parties A and B, party A makes a mark-to-market (MtM) profit whilst party B makes a corresponding MtM loss. Party B then presents some form of collateral to party A to mitigate the credit exposure that arises due to positive MtM. The form of collateral is agreed before initiation of the contract. <b>Collateral</b> <b>agreements</b> are often bilateral. Collateral has to be returned or posted in the opposite direction when exposure decreases. In the case of a positive MtM, an institution calls for collateral {{and in the case of}} a negative MtM they have to post collateral.|$|R

Therefore, {{the implementation of the}} Directive in the Italian legal system has created a specific area – related to financial collateral – in which the prohibition of patto commissorio is ineffective. Furthermore, this European regulation is the expression of a trend favouring self-help remedies for the creditor, who can – if the debt is not paid – sell or appropriate the collateral, subject to the condition that he will give the debtor the difference between the price obtained (or the value of the collateral) and the amount of the debt. The challenge for the Italian doctrine shall therefore be to examine whether the above self-help remedies could be granted in every case in which the value of the collateral can be determined according to objective criteria, such as whether the collateral consists of currency, receivables or financial instruments negotiable in the market...|$|R

For example, if C^+_t> 0 then the legal owner of the amount C^+_t at time t could be either the hedger or the counterparty (depending on the legal covenants of the <b>collateral</b> <b>agreement)</b> but the hedger, as a collateral taker, is allowed to use the collateral amount for his trading purposes. If there is no default before T, the collateral taker returns the collateral amount to the collateral provider.

In general, we have the following definition of the wealth process.|$|E

Basel previously covered the default capital charge for counterparty exposures however, the crisis showed that more than two third of the losses related to this risk emerged from the exposure to {{the movement of the}} counterparty's credit quality and not its actual default therefore, Basel III divided the required counterparty risk capital into two categories: The traditional default capital charge and an additional counter-party credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge. In this article, we explain the new methodologies to compute these capital charges on the OTC market: The standardized approach for default capital charge (SA-CCR) and the basic approach for CVA (BA-CVA). Based on historical calibration and future estimations, we built internal models in order to compare them with the amended standardized approach. Up till June 2015, interest rate and FX derivatives constituted more than 90 % of the traded total OTC notional amount; we constructed our application on such portfolios containing and computed their total counterparty capital charge.
