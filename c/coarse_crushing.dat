50|$|After 1850 {{the small}} and {{scattered}} stamp mills and ore washeries were replaced by central ore dressing plants. The basic steps - <b>coarse</b> <b>crushing</b> - manual separation - sieving - jigging - fine crushing - table work and slime washing - remained much the same. The process was increasingly mechanised and perfected. In 1905 the most modern ore dressing plant in Germany went into operation in Clausthal using the gravity dressing process. It was located near the Ottiliae Shaft {{on the site of}} the old central ore processing plant of 1872. It employed up to 650 workers and processed all ore from the Clausthal and Zellerfeld pits until 1930. A change occurred in the 1920s with the introduction of the froth floatation in Bad Grund and later in Lautenthal. This technique enabled the required production of metal concentration without manual pre-sorting and a much higher yield. The flotation process was steadily developed during the 20th century and was used right up to the end of vein mining in the Upper Harz in 1992.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ore body}} at Benson Mine is {{composed}} of magnetite and non-magnetite ore. The average percentage of iron in both magnetite and non-magnetite ore was about 23%., less than the 40% at Chateauguay. Iron-ore deposits that contained 50% or more iron were depleted in the United States by the mid-1940s. The ability to concentrate “non-magnetite ores by gravity processes” at Benson mines ensured its economic expansion because these processes enabled lower grade iron ore {{to be used in}} steel -making. In 1952, a gravity plant was built, which allowed non-magnetic ore to be processed on site. Ore was extracted using open pit mining methods. Holes were bored in the ground and filled with explosives. “About two gross tons of crude ore… *were produced+ per pound of explosive used.” A four ton ball on a crane smashed the ore into smaller pieces, which were then loaded onto a dump truck and transported to the <b>Coarse</b> <b>Crushing</b> Plant, which broke the ore into pieces three-inches in diameter. A conveyor belt then took the ore to the Fine Crushing Plant, which reduced it in size to “one and one-half inch in diameter.” The ore was sometimes crushed into even smaller pieces of “five eights of an inch” before it was sintered, concentrated, and transported to steel manufacturing centers. Sintering merges ore with coke so it is easier to process in steel facilities.|$|E

In that model there was some disagreements between predicted and measured geometry and several effects were suggested to explain the discrepancy in the model.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIComminution, {{particularly}} milling, is {{on average}} the largest consumer {{of energy in}} mining. Actual comminution circuits consist {{in most of the}} cases in <b>coarse</b> <b>crushing,</b> SAG milling, pebble crushing and secondary ball milling. In these circuits the SAG mill is the largest energy consumer. In many engineering projects either a power equation and/or a specific energy equation are used for the designing of these mills but not always with acceptable results. In general these equations are used to predict power consumption as a function of mill size, level and density of the internal charge and % of critical speed. Almost none of these equations (with the notable exception of the Morrell's model) consider explicitly the effect that the feed particle size has on the mill performance, particularly on the power and on the specific energy consumption of the mill. To address this fact new models are developed in this work able to predict power or specific energy consumption, including the usual design variables, but adding a variable that represents the feed size distribution. Operational data from 4 grinding circuits corresponding to 3 Chilean copper concentration plants are used and the % - 6 '' + 1 '' (- 152 + 25 mm) is selected as independent variable. The results indicate that both models are able to estimate the required variables for all data sets. In the first model (power equation) the average error obtained was 3. 7 % and in the second model (specific energy) the average error was 6. 8 %. These models would be useful for performance optimisation of the test case mills and should be fitted (parameters values) again for other mills...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a novel method of predicting the long-term phosphorus removal performance of large-scale adsorption filters, using data derived from short-term, small-scale column experiments. The filter media investigated were low-cost adsorbents such as aluminum sulfate drinking water treatment residual, ferric sulfate drinking water treatment residual, and fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>crushed</b> concretes. Small-bore adsorption columns were loaded with synthetic wastewater, and treated column effluent volume was plotted against {{the mass of}} phosphorus adsorbed per unit mass of filter media.

Moreover, the relationship between filter loading and effluent concentration could also be derived from this equation.

In this study, {{the effects of the}} grain size distribution and the microstruc-ture on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the compacted crushed argillite have been in-vestigated. The volume change properties were investigated by running one-dimensional compression tests under constant water content (2. 4 - 2. 8 %) with loading-unloading cycles. Under various vertical stresses, water flooding tests were carried out in constant volume condition. Depending on the vertical stress level, either swelling or collapse behavior was observed in the sense that vertical stress increased or decreased upon flooding respectively. A clear effect of grain size distribution has been also identified: finer samples exhibit stiffer compression behaviour and higher swelling potential. To provide a microstructure insight into the macroscopic behaviour feature observed, both mercury intrusion po-rosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were performed, evidencing that: (i) at the same dry density, the size of inter-aggregates pores is larger for the <b>coarser</b> <b>crushed</b> material; (ii) mechanical compression only reduces the inter-aggregate porosity in the stress range considered; (iii) the micro-mechanisms governing the flooding under constant-volume condition include the swelling of the clay particles, the increase of the intra-aggregate pores and the collapse of the inter-aggregates pores. The results show a strong effect of the grain size distribution on the hydro-mechanical behaviour and thus the close link between the microstructure and the hydro-mechanical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, {{the demand}} for bio energy has {{increased}} in recent years due to the current energy and climate debate.

Recent tests with stump lifting for energy use have been done within the Project Bioenergy Farms which runs from 2008 to 2011. Norra Skogsägarna (a forest owners association in he north of Sweden) has had the responsibility for these tests within the project.
