50|$|Forensic {{materials}} engineering, {{a branch}} of forensic engineering, focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or {{the source of a}} specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined {{by the nature of the}} material in question, be it metal, glass, <b>ceramic,</b> <b>polymer</b> or composite. An important aspect is the analysis of trace evidence such as skid marks on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of fractography.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{ferroelectricity}} was first discovered in 1921. This phenomenon {{began to play}} a much larger role in electronic applications during the 1950s after {{the increased use of}} BaTiO3. This ferroelectric material is part of the corner-sharing oxygen octahedral structure, but ferroelectrics can also be grouped into three other categories. These categories include organic polymers, <b>ceramic</b> <b>polymer</b> composites, and compounds containing hydrogen-bonded radicals. It wasn't until 1969 that Kawai first observed the piezoelectric effect in a polymer polyvinylidene fluoride. Two years later, the ferroelectric properties of the same polymer were reported. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, these polymers were applied to data storage and retrieval. Subsequently, there has been tremendous growth during the past decade in exploring the materials science, physics, and technology of poly(vinylidenefluoride) and other fluorinated polymers. Copolymer PVDF with trifluoroethylene and odd-numbered nylons were additional polymers that were discovered to be ferroelectric. This propelled a number of developing applications on piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity.|$|E

40|$|Fixed partial {{prostheses}} {{as integral}} <b>ceramic,</b> <b>polymers,</b> metal-ceramic or metal-polymers bridges are mainly {{used in the}} frontal part of the dental arch (especially the integral bridges). They have to satisfy high stress as well as esthetic requirements. The masticatory stress may induce fractures of the bridges. These may be triggered by initial materials defects or by alterations of the technological process. The fractures of these bridges lead to functional, esthetic and phonetic disturbances which finally render the prosthetic treatment inefficient. Dental interfaces represent {{one of the most}} significant aspects in the strength of the dental prostheses under the masticatory load. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the capability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to characterize the dental prostheses interfaces. The materials used were several fixed partial prostheses integral <b>ceramic,</b> <b>polymers,</b> metal-ceramic and metal-polymers bridges. It is important to produce both C-scans and B-scans of the defects in order to differentiate morphological aspects of the bridge infrastructures. The material defects observed with OCT were investigated with micro-CT in order to prove their existence and positions. In conclusion, it is important to have a non invasive method to investigate dental prostheses interfaces before the insertion of prostheses in the oral cavity.

40|$|Hybrid solid electrolytes, {{composed}} of 3 D ordered bicontinuous conducting <b>ceramic</b> and insulating <b>polymer</b> microchannels are reported. The ceramic channels provide continuous, uninterrupted pathways, maintaining high ionic conductivity between the electrodes, while the polymer channels permit {{improvement of the}} mechanical properties {{from that of the}} ceramic alone, in particular mitigation of the ceramic brittleness. The conductivity of a ceramic electrolyte is usually limited by resistances at the grain boundaries, necessitating dense ceramics. The conductivity of the 3 D ordered hybrid is reduced by only the volume fraction occupied by the ceramic, demonstrating that the ceramic channels can be sintered to high density similar to a dense ceramic disk. The hybrid electrolytes are demonstrated using the ceramic lithium ion conductor Li 1. 4 Al 0. 4 Ge 1. 6 (PO 4) 3 (LAGP). Structured LAGP 3 D scaffolds with empty channels were prepared by negative replication of a 3 D printed polymer template. Filling the empty channels with non-conducting polypropylene (PP) or epoxy polymer (epoxy) creates the structured hybrid electrolytes with 3 D bicontinuous <b>ceramic</b> and <b>polymer</b> microchannels. Printed templating permits precise control of the <b>ceramic</b> to <b>polymer</b> ratio and the microarchitecture; as demonstrated by the formation of cubic, gyroidal, diamond and spinodal (bijel) structures. The electrical and mechanical properties depend on the microarchitecture, the gyroid filled with epoxy giving the best combination of conductivity and mechanical properties. An ionic conductivity of 1. 6 x 10 - 4 S cm- 1 at room temperature was obtained, reduced from the conductivity of a sintered LAGP pellet only by the volume fraction occupied by the ceramic. The mechanical properties of the gyroid LAGP-epoxy electrolyte demonstrate up to 28 % higher compressive failure strain and up to five times the flexural failure strain of a LAGP pellet before rupture.

To identify key cell and cytokine targets, here we perform in-depth systems analysis of innate and adaptive immune system responses to implanted biomaterials in rodents and non-human primates. While macrophages are indispensable to the fibrotic cascade, surprisingly neutrophils and complement are not. Macrophages, via CXCL 13, lead to downstream B cell recruitment, which further potentiated fibrosis, as confirmed by B cell knockout and CXCL 13 neutralization.

In the granulation process, two ceramic particle size fractions (α-Al 2 O 3) and a thermoplastic polymer (polyvinyl butyral) are assembled to granules. In the process, μm-sized particles are coated {{with a layer of}} polymer which contains a second, nm-sized ceramic particles fraction. The mass fractions of each constituents can be adjusted independently. During the warm pressing, the nm-sized particle fraction along with polymer is pressed into the void volume of the μm-sized particles, thus achieving a homogeneous, isotropic composite structure with a very high packing density of ceramic particles.
