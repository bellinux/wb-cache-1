In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 <b>calories</b> <b>and</b> is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 <b>calories</b> <b>and</b> a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
30|$|We {{emphasize}} {{that it is}} not the use of <b>calorie</b> value <b>and</b> nutrition value is inappropriate or unsophisticated; it is that the adoption of <b>calorie</b> <b>and</b> nutrition measures may differentiate food commodities unnecessarily, and adds levels of complexity to the entire estimating process. For example, equivalent weight measures of fresh asparagus, frozen asparagus, cooked asparagus, and canned asparagus will have varying levels of <b>calorie</b> <b>and</b> nutrition. It is possible to make the same argument for the different varieties of asparagus (white, green, purple, and wild). Furthermore, other researchers have argued that where and how the produce is grown (in fertile versus arid lands; using various cultivation practices), processed, transported, stored, and prepared will influence <b>calorie</b> <b>and</b> nutrition values.|$|R

5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll.

Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 <b>calories</b> <b>and</b> 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

Little previous work {{has been carried out}} in this direction. We present a comprehensive analytical framework, which we apply for Malawi. Using household data and a demand systems approach, we estimate income and price elasticities of food, <b>calorie,</b> <b>and</b> micronutrient consumption. These estimates are used for policy simulations. Given multiple nutrient deficiencies, income-related policies are better suited than price policies to improve nutrition. While consumer subsidies for maize increase <b>calorie</b> <b>and</b> mineral consumption, they contribute to a higher prevalence of vitamin deficiencies. quadratic almost ideal demand system, food security, micronutrient malnutrition, calorie elasticities, nutrient elasticities, Malawi, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
