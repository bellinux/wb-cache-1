5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a <b>chemical</b> <b>storage</b> shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of their}} high {{hydrogen}} densities, boron based com-pounds, including especially sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) 1 and ammonia borane (NH 3 BH 3), 2 are now being intensely investigated as <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage</b> materials that can release hydrogen by hydrolytic processes (eqs 1 - 2). The high hydrogen release capacity that could potentially be achieved by ammonia triborane, NH 3 B 3 H 7, (1) oxidative-hydrolysis (eq 3) should likewise make it an attractive candidate for <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage.</b> But, owing {{to the lack of}} a suitable method for its efficient synthesis, there have been no previous explorations of the <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage</b> properties of this compound.

2500|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>storage</b> {{could offer}} high storage {{performance}} {{due to the}} strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of <b>chemical</b> <b>storage</b> systems are under investigation, which involve hydrolysis reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, ammonia borane and other boron hydrides, ammonia, and alane etc. [...] Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density. [...] For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0mol/L while methanol has a density of 49.5mol H2/L methanol and saturated dimethyl ether at 30°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1mol H2/L dimethyl ether. [...] These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks. The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity. Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding.

These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the past}} {{electrical}} generation was all dispatchable and consumer demand led {{how much and}} when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent sources such as wind, water, solar, means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply instead.

[...] Ideally {{the capacity of the}} intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace heating fuels or be converted to mechanical or <b>chemical</b> <b>storage</b> for later use.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHydrazine bisborane N 2 H 4 (BH 3) 2 (HBB; 16. 8 wt %) {{recently}} re-emerged as {{a potential}} hydrogen storage material. However, such potential is controversial: HBB {{was seen as a}} hazardous compound up to 2010, but now it would be suitable for hydrogen storage. In this context, we focused on fundamentals of HBB because they are missing in the literature and should help to shed light on its effective potential while taking into consideration any risk. Experimental/computational methods were used to get a complete characterization data sheet, including, e. g., XRD, NMR, FTIR, Raman, TGA, and DSC. From the reported results and discussion, it is concluded that HBB has potential in the field of <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage</b> given that both thermolytic and hydrolytic dehydrogenations were analyzed. In solid-state <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage,</b> it cannot be used in the pristine state (risk of explosion during dehydrogenation) but can be used for the synthesis of derivatives with improved dehydrogenation properties. In liquid-state <b>chemical</b> hydrogen <b>storage,</b> it can be studied for room-temperature dehydrogenation, but this requires the development of an active and selective metal-based catalyst.
