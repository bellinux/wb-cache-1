50|$|Community <b>corrections</b> <b>officials</b> are {{the main}} factors that help decide whether a {{criminal}} is granted probation or not. They {{are the ones who}} determine whether the offender is a serious risk to public safety. These officials are also the ones who make recommendations to the court on what action to take. The <b>correction</b> <b>officials</b> first go through an investigations process during the pretrial period. They assess the offenders background and history to determine if he or she can be released safely back into the community. The officers then write a report on the offender. This is an extremely important piece of information that the courts use to determine if the offender shall be put on probation instead of going to jail. After the offender is found guilty, the probation officer puts together a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI). Courts base their sentencing on it. Finally, courts make their decision whether to imprison the convict or to let him or her off on probation. If a court decides to grant a person probation, it must then determine how to impose the sentence based on the seriousness of the crime, recidivism, circumstances of the convict, and the recommendations from the <b>corrections</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|R
