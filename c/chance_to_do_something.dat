This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group {{find their way to}} the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.|$|E

Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, later said of the creative decision for the artwork, [...] "It was so interesting {{to me that a}} black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover.

500|$|Developer Tom Moyer {{wanted to}} redevelop the block since the 1970s. The City Club of Portland held a {{significant}} meeting in 1992 {{about the fate}} of the Central Park Blocks, also called the Commercial Park Blocks. Moyer and the PDC opposed [...] "the downtown parking magnate" [...] Greg Goodman's plans to turn the block into a 550-space 12-story parking structure in 1995, which was to be called the Park Avenue Plaza. Neil Goldschmidt said the parking structure would be [...] "like putting lipstick on a dead corpse" [...] and Bill Naito said that a [...] "12-story garage won't go away.

500|$|The premise behind [...] "Chimera" [...] was [...] "a {{compelling}} {{examination of}} the evil that lies beneath a prototypical white-bread suburban existence." [...] These themes had previously been explored in the season six episode, [...] "Arcadia". However, the show wished to explore the same ideas in a more [...] "straight-ahead scare" [...] style, rather than supplementing {{the horror of the}} episode with humor, as was done in [...] "Arcadia". Series creator, Chris Carter, saw the episode as [...] "a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> bold and new." [...] Carter wanted the story to revolve around a crow, an image that he described simply as [...] "scary". With the story, he wanted to [...] "bust pretense and perception and expose the underbelly of a white-bread community." [...] Originally, the episode was going to feature a subterranean monster and was aptly going to be titled [...] "Subterranean Monster Blues".|$|E

5000|$|As an objector, Scholberg {{was ordered}} to join the Civilian Public Service (CPS), through which {{he became one of}} the test {{subjects}} in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment from 1944. This was his first experience of the University of Minnesota, having previously had CPS postings in a conservation camp at Lagro, Indiana, and a mental institution in Maryland. He saw the Experiment as a relief from his work in mental health, which was increasingly giving him concern about his own mental state, and as a sacrifice befitting that being made by those of his countrymen who were engaged in the war. He later said that [...] Here we are in the middle of a war. Every day we're reading of casualties on both sides, and I thought here are Americans like me dying in the battlefield for their country, and what was I doing? Working in a mental hospital? And here was a <b>chance,</b> I thought, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that required sacrifice. [...] When he underwent a psychological assessment for acceptance on the Experiment, based on the then new Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory method, it was determined that he had psychotic tendencies, including depression, hypochondria and hysteria. He became one of the 36 selected test subjects, another of whom was Jasper [...] "Jay" [...] Garner, who by <b>chance</b> happened <b>to</b> have been at Woodstock School with Scholberg as an eight-year-old.|$|R

500|$|Spielberg {{was unsure}} {{if he was}} mature {{enough to make a}} film about the Holocaust, and the project {{remained}} [...] "on [...] guilty conscience". Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto. Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama The Pianist (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct Schindler's List in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as [...] "I'd given away a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for my children and family about the Holocaust." [...] Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of Cape Fear instead. Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom died in the Holocaust.|$|E
500|$|When Peter {{tries to}} {{apologize}} the next day, Lois is still upset {{with him for}} missing their date and has {{decided to go to}} the country club dance with Quagmire. Later that night, Peter and Brian sneak into the dance to prevent the kiss that caused Lois {{to fall in love with}} Quagmire. They get in by crawling through the air vent, but crash through and kill one of the guys playing in the band on the stage, so Brian has to play guitar and sing. Peter tries to convince Lois that they belong together but she stubbornly informs Peter that he had his chance and blew it, and therefore she loves Quagmire now. Peter almost gives up but Brian notices Chris, Stewie, and Meg disappearing from a family picture, indicating that they have fallen off the plane of existence and tells Peter it is his last <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that proves he loves Lois. Peter then demonstrates his passion by punching Quagmire and kissing Lois, showing that he cares deeply for her and wins back her love. He asks her to marry him and she accepts. In honor of this success, Brian and the band play [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by Rick Astley. The episode ends with things seemingly back to normal, with the exception of Roger from American Dad! apparently living with the family.|$|E
2500|$|Hardly had Gordon {{resigned}} when he {{was invited}} to Beijing by Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of customs in China, saying his services were urgently needed in China as Russia and China {{were on the verge of}} war. Gordon was nostalgic for China, and knowing of the Sino-Russian crisis, he saw a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> significant. The British diplomat Thomas Francis Wade reported [...] "The Chinese government still holds Gordon Pasha in high regard", and were anxious to have him back to fight against Russia if war should break out.|$|E
60|$|Again, it is {{characteristic}} {{that while the}} modern English know nothing about Lee they <b>do</b> know <b>something</b> about Lincoln; and nearly all that they know is wrong. They know nothing of his Southern connections, nothing of his considerable Southern sympathy, nothing {{of the meaning of}} his moderation in face of the problem of slavery, now lightly treated as self-evident. Above all, they know nothing about the respect in which Lincoln was quite un-English, was indeed the very reverse of English; and can be understood better if we {{think of him as a}} Frenchman, since it seems so hard for some of us to believe that he was an American. I mean his lust for logic for its own sake, and the way he kept mathematical truths in his mind like the fixed stars. He was so far from being a merely practical man, impatient of academic abstractions, that he reviewed and revelled in academic abstractions, even while he could not apply them to practical life. He loved to repeat that slavery was intolerable while he tolerated it, and to prove that <b>something</b> ought <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> while it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. This was probably very bewildering to his brother-politicians; for politicians always whitewash what they do not destroy. But for all that this inconsistent consistency beat the politicians at their own game, and this abstracted logic proved the most practical of all. For when the <b>chance</b> <b>did</b> come <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> there was no doubt about the thing <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> The thunderbolt fell from the clear heights of heaven; it had not been tossed about and lost like a common missile in the market-place. The matter is worth mentioning, because it has a moral for a much larger modern question. A wise man's attitude towards industrial capitalism will be very like Lincoln's attitude towards slavery. That is, he will manage to endure capitalism; but he will not endure a defence of capitalism. He will recognise the value, not only of knowing what he is doing, but of knowing what he would like <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He will recognise the importance of having a thing clearly labelled in his own mind as bad, long before the opportunity comes to abolish it. He may recognise the risk of even worse things in immediate abolition, as Lincoln did in abolitionism. He will not call all business men brutes, any more than Lincoln would call all planters demons; because he knows they are not. He will regard many alternatives to capitalism as crude and inhuman, as Lincoln regarded John Brown's raid; because they are. But he will clear his mind from cant about capitalism; he will have no doubt of what is the truth about Trusts and Trade Combines and the concentration of capital; and it is the truth that they endure under one of the ironic silences of heaven, over the pageants and the passing triumphs of hell.|$|R
