Ensuring that there is no electrical connection between mains voltage and the low-voltage plug makes it much easier to guarantee safety of the supply.

If one power or ground line is interdigitated with every four bus lines, the RLC noise and delay are no more than 7 % greater than RC models would predict.

In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram {{was said to be}} ‘grounded’—not {{to be confused with the}} US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.|$|E

When an artery is exposed to a magnetic field, the blood charged particles are deviated by the Lorentz force thus inducing electrical currents and voltages along the vessel walls and in the neighboring tissues. Such a situation may occur in several bio-medical applications: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic drug transport and targeting, tissue engineering… In this paper, we consider the steady unidirectional blood flow in a straight circular rigid vessel with non-conducting walls, {{in the presence of}} an exterior static magnetic field. The exact solution of Gold (1962) (with the induced fields not neglected) is revisited. It is shown that the integration over a cross section of the vessel of the longitudinal projection of the Lorentz force is zero, and that this result is related to the existence of <b>current</b> <b>return</b> <b>paths,</b> whose contributions compensate each other over the section.

40|$|ABSTRACT- By the full-wave {{electromagnetic}} field simulation, {{the effectiveness of}} certain measures to reduce the power and ground noise coupling in mixed signal modules is investigated. Segmentation of power and ground planes and proper placement of decoupling capacitors for the reduction of noise coupling are evaluated. With the boom of portable communications industry, challenges in designs of mixed signal modules are becoming increasingly serious. Severe electromagnetic interference may occur in highdensity mixed signal electronic modules. Switching currents of output drivers of high-speed digital circuits can generate significant noise in power and ground supply systems. Power and ground supply noise, together with the noise coupled to the analog and digital signal distribution systems, may cause malfunctioning of both digital and analog circuits. This presentation provides investigations {{on the effectiveness of}} some techniques used for the reduction of power and ground noise coupling. As shown in Figure 1, segmentation of power and/or ground planes are often used for the isolation of different parts of circuits [1].

With higher clocking rate, increasing interconnect lengths, and decreasing rise times, inductance effects are more evident than ever. This is especially true for the clock distribution networks, where the delay and the slope of clock waveforms are critical to overall system performance. In the past, several different approaches have been proposed to extract the inductance values [1][2]. Though there are many techniques to accelerate the speed of the electromagnetic field solvers, they are still impractical to be included in the early design phase. This is because it is nearly impossible to obtain the exact <b>current</b> <b>return</b> <b>paths</b> at the very beginning of the design cycle, which are layout dependent. Hence, precise inductance values cannot be calculated without the details of physical information, such as locations of the clock lines and neighboring wires.

Despite {{the imposition of}} strict management measures in force since the early 1990 s, the Scotian Shelf ecosystem has not reverted back to its former structure. Here we provide evidence of the transient nature of this ecosystem and its <b>current</b> <b>return</b> <b>path</b> towards benthic fish species domination. The prolonged duration of the altered food web, and its current recovery, was and is being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. These erupting forage species, which reached biomass levels 900 % greater than those prevalent during the pre-collapse years of large benthic predators, are now in decline, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. This dampening, and the associated reduction in the intensity of predation, was accompanied by lagged increases in species abundances at both lower and higher trophic levels, first witnessed in zooplankton and then in large-bodied predators, all consistent with a return towards the earlier ecosystem structure. We conclude that the reversibility of perturbed ecosystems can occur and that this bodes well for other collapsed fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Timing {{uncertainty}} {{caused by}} inductive and capacitive coupling {{is one of}} the major bottlenecks in timing analysis. In this paper, we propose an effective loop RLC modeling technique to efficiently decouple lines with both inductive and capacitive coupling. We generalize the RLC decoupling problem based on the theory of distributed RLC lines and a switch-factor, which is the voltage ratio between two nets. This switch-factor is also known as the Miller factor, and is widely used to model capacitive coupling. The proposed modeling technique can be directly applied to partial RLC netlists extracted using existing parasitic extraction tools without advance knowledge of the return path. The new model captures the impact of neighboring switching activity as it significantly affects the <b>current</b> <b>return</b> <b>path.</b> As demonstrated in our experiments, the new model accurately predicts both upper and lower delay bounds as a function of neighboring switching patterns. Therefore, this approach can be easily implemented into existing timing analysis flows such as max-timing and min-timing analysis. Finally, we apply the new modeling approach to a range of activities across the design process including timing optimization, static timing analysis, high frequency clock design, and data-bus wire planning.

A new scheme of resistance–inductance–capacitance networks is deployed for the spiral coils and substrate to account for 3 -D eddy <b>current,</b> sub-strate <b>return</b> <b>path,</b> and spiral coil to substrate coupling effects. The 3 -D eddy current is identified as the key element essential to ac-curately simulate the broadband characteristics. Electromagnetic simulation using the Advanced Design System momentum is con-ducted to predict the on-chip inductor performance corresponding {{to a wide range}} of substrate resistivities (ρSi = 0. 05 − 1 kΩ · cm). Three operation modes such as transverse electromagnetic mode, slow-wave mode, and eddy current mode are reproduced. The model parameters manifest themselves as physics-based through relevant correlation with ρSi over three operation modes. The onset of slow-wave mode can be consistently explained by a key element RP introduced in our model, which accounts for the conductor loss due to an eddy current arising from magnetic field coupling through a substrate <b>return</b> <b>path.</b> This broadband and scalable model is useful for radio frequency circuit simulation.

Two of the parameters to determine the performance of such gradient coils are the magnetic field linearity and magnetic field gradient uniformity. This research emphasizes on {{the analysis of the}} geometrical effect of the conventional Golay-Maxwell pair gradient coils to these two parameters through computer simulation. The results show that the geometrical parameters of ? and d affect Golay coil’s magnetic field gradient. Usable volume is improved 50 % while gradient strength is increased 11 % when ? is 1600 compared to the original 1200. The increase of d results in increase of usable volume, which is a maximum of 3374 cm 3 at 0 : 8 r but a loss of gradient strength of 36 % compared to - 0. 34 mT/m at 0 : 2 r. The other geometrical parameters of Golay coil are found not to affect much on the magnetic field gradient generated because of two reasons; the longitudinal sections of Golay coil do not contribute to Bz generation and the outer arcs are just acting as <b>current</b> <b>return</b> <b>paths.</b> For Maxwell coil, the usable volume can be improved until 19196. 128 cm 3 when d is 2 : 0 r although the gradient value obtained is lower compared to a maximum of - 0. 066 mT/m at 1 : 2 r.
