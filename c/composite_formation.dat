50|$|This was {{the last}} {{daylight}} raid of the war for the 330th BG {{and it was an}} old favorite of the XXI Bomber Command. The target was Nakajima Aircraft Engine plant northwest of Tokyo. The first strategic target hit by the B-29s in November 1944 from the Marianas and had been hit 12 times previously by the 73rd. 58th BWs and Navy Carrier Task Force planes. Just to show how sometimes the larger picture reports are misleading as to what was actually bombed, this mission is a good example. The 314th BW summary reports that 60 planes from the 314th BW bombed the Tokyo arsenal, the radar target for the Bomber Command Mission #320. The Tokyo arsenal was the primary radar target and secondary visual target. The 330th BS's assembled into four formations over a small volcanic island due south of Tokyo, called Torishima, Toshima. They then proceeded to the target with the 458th BS in the lead followed by 459th BS, 457th BS and a <b>composite</b> <b>formation.</b> Flak was encountered from landfall to the target with heavy anti-aircraft (HAA), meager to moderate and generally accurate as to altitude. Approaching the target, HAA fire increased in intensity and accuracy and continued until the formations climbed out of the target area. The 458th BS formation attacked on an axis of 70 degrees and dropped its bombs from 22000 ft. The 459th attacked on an axis of 175 degrees, overran the 458th BS formation, made a 360-degree turn and went over theprimary target again. But, the formation could not see the target the second time around and went for the secondary visual target -Tokyo Army Arsenal. The 457th BS formation, on a heading of 72 degrees, dropped its bombs from 22200 ft and the <b>composite</b> <b>formation</b> on a heading of 73 degrees dropped its bombs from 22900 ft. Why the 459th BS was on a heading of 175 degrees is not known. The weather over the primary target was almost ideal for a precision daylight-bombing raid with a few scattered clouds and visibility of 20 miles (30 km). Despite some snafus the 330th BG received its second DUC for its performance on this mission.|$|E

This position was usually flown by the least experienced crew in the squadron and was vulnerable to fighter attack, so perilous that it was commonly called the [...] "coffin corner". The second unit of the group formation was configured identically, except that its boxes were named Dog, Easy, and Fox. Each position within a box was numbered, so that the group leader flew the Able One position while the Tail-end Charlie of the leftmost rear squadron flew Fox Seven. The second unit flew at an altitude approximately 500 ft lower than the first unit.|$|E

By the time the attack was halted the Brigade was at half strength, having suffered casualties of which 800 had been killed.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the validity and adverse impact (AI) of predictor <b>composite</b> <b>formation</b> focused {{on the merits of}} regression-based or ad hoc composites. We argue for a broader focus. Ad hoc chosen composites are usually not Pareto-optimal, whereas the regression-based composite represents only one element from the total set of Pareto-optimal composites and can, therefore, provide only limited information on the potential for validity and AI reduction of forming predictor composites when both validity and AI are of concern. In that case, other Pareto-optimal composites may provide a better benchmark to decide on the merits of the predictor <b>composite</b> <b>formation.</b> We summarize a method to determine the set of Pareto-optimal composites and apply the method to a representative collection of selection predictors. The application shows that the assessment of the AI and validity of predictor <b>composite</b> <b>formation</b> can differ substantially from the one arrived at when considering only regression-based composites. 1...|$|E

This allowed the deduction of phenomenological rate constants describing the propensity for fracture and welding during processing. For the mill-operating conditions investigated, the number of particles in the mill generally decreased with milling time, indicating a greater tendency for particle welding than fracture. Moreover, a bimodal size distribution is often obtained {{as a result of}} preferential welding. Copper and chromium 'alloy' primarily by encapsulation of Cr particles within Cu. This form of alloying also occurs in Cu-Nb alloys processed at low mill power and/or for short milling times.

The traditional deployment of the army in the pre-emptive defense of the frontiers had largely broken down by the 250s {{in the face of these}} threats.
