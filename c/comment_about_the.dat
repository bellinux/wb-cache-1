Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E
5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats {{an idea about}} getting The Rolling Stones to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the delta}} itself, Caesar makes a passing <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi") in the Rhine river, without {{discussing}} who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became {{very important in}} this region. Much later Tacitus wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the Chatti, a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar. However, archaeologists find evidence of continuity, and suggest that the Chattic group {{may have been a}} small group, moving into a pre-existing (and possibly non-Germanic) people, who could even have been part of a known group such as the Eburones.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} found to be greater for adult mothers than for adolescent mothers. The level and quality of mind-mindedness, which refers to how prone the mother is to <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> infant's mental activity during interaction, is higher in adult mothers, and has been related to greater maternal sensitivity. The comments made by adult mothers were found to be more positive than those made by adolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers used almost no positive comments, but instead negative comments. This causes the adolescent mother to be more insensitive to their baby's needs, possibly because of lack of need understanding, and therefore have lower maternal sensitivity and a less secure attachment to their infants.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2007 it was {{announced}} {{at a press conference}} that Robson and Brian Kidd would be the new choice of management at Sheffield United following the resignation of Neil Warnock. His first match in charge was a home match against Colchester United on 11 August in a 2–2 draw. His first win was three days later in a 3–1 win against Chesterfield in the League Cup. United subsequently collected nine points in their first 10 league matches, leaving the Blades in 20th place in the Championship and prompting Robson to <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. After a string of inconsistent results and a 2–0 derby defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, Robson publicly stated that he had lost patience with his players.|$|E

25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{government}} had no <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel said that {{although he did not}} know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime {{he had to go to}} prison; however, he thought there was insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. Báez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.|$|E

500|$|On 27 January 2006, the {{developers}} responsible {{for maintaining the}} ReactOS code repository disabled access after a meeting was held to discuss the allegations. When approached by NewsForge, Microsoft declined to <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident. Since ReactOS is a free and open-source software development project, the claim triggered a negative reaction by the free software community; in particular, Wine barred several inactive developers from providing contributions and formal high level cooperation between the two projects remained difficult [...] Contributions from several active ReactOS developers have been accepted post-audit, and low level cooperation for bug fixes still occurs.|$|E
500|$|The {{families}} held a {{press conference}} in Dublin after the report was released. When asked to <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> report, Des McAlea replied, [...] "It's been a long time but we've got justice at last". He did, however, express his concern over the fact that nobody was ever charged with his attempted murder. and that none of the perpetrators ever offered him an apology. Stephen Travers offered, [...] "We believe the only conclusion possible arising from the HET report {{is that one of the}} most prolific loyalist murderers of the conflict was an RUC Special Branch agent and was involved in the Miami Showband attack".|$|E

[...] Barbara Barnett said that [...] "House is the needy one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as [...] "touching and genuine". However, Robert Sean Leonard compared the relationship between the two to that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh Laurie said that it's [...] "not just buddydom".

500|$|Commentators noted Beck's actions {{led to a}} Streisand effect; {{his suit}} against the website drew {{increased}} attention to it. Representatives of Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Citizen Media Law Project were all {{of the opinion that}} Beck's trademark argument in his complaint against the website was ridiculous. The assistant director of the Citizen Media Law Project applauded WIPO's decision, saying, [...] "It's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution." [...] Beck's representative declined comment to PC Magazine about the conclusion of the case.

500|$|When Wodehouse's {{contract}} ended {{after a year}} it was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave {{an interview}} to The Los Angeles Times. Wodehouse, who was described by Herbert Warren Wind as [...] "politically naive [...] fundamentally unworldly," [...] caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in The New York Times, and there was much editorial <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been [...] "a storm in a teacup", and Donaldson comments that in the straitened post-crash era the reforms would sooner or later have been inevitable.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Cruz {{appeared}} in the Christmas film Noel as Nina, the girlfriend of Paul Walker's character and as Mia in the romantic drama, Head in the Clouds, set in the 1930s. Head in the Clouds performed poorly at the box office. For Head in the Clouds, Bruce Birkland of Jam! Canoe said, [...] "The story feels forced and the performances dreary, with the notable exception of Cruz, {{who seems to be}} in a different film {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] Desson Thompson of The Washington Post was more critical; his <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character's [...] "pronounced limp" [...] was that [...] "Cruz (hardly the world's greatest actress) can't even perform without looking fake". She also starred in Sergio Castellitto's melodrama Don't Move. Cruz, who learned Italian for the role, earned critical acclaim for her performance and won the David di Donatello. She was also awarded the European Film Award for Best Actress for the film in 2004.|$|E
