40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-dimensional cutting stock procedure which will minimize material wastage when {{a batch of}} small pieces are cut from several long pieces. The problem differs from the classical one-dimensional cutting stock problem in that {{the dimensions of the}} material to be cut are random variables due to fringe defects caused by the production process. Examples of such processes include the production of flat glass, laminated board, corrugated board, adhesive tape, carpeting, and insulating tape. The cutting procedure inevitably generates some material wastage and process delays caused by the need to set <b>cutting</b> <b>knives</b> in required positions. The approach followed in this paper is to minimize material wastage when cutting a batch of identical rolls of insulating tape from several long rolls with stationary <b>cutting</b> <b>knives.</b> An exact solution is presented for the case in which the variability of defects at both ends is independently distributed and the two distributions differ by a location parameter only. An approximate solution is also presented when the two end defect distributions differ by both scale and location parameters. The wastage resulting from the use of these procedures is then compared with the wastage generated when the positioning of the knives is altered every time an original piece is cut. This comparison enables management to decide when the positioning of the <b>cutting</b> <b>knives</b> should be fixed. production/scheduling: cutting stock, inventory/production: reject allowances, probability: stochastic model applications...|$|R

50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - {{lead the}} current from the catenary {{to the two}} electrical <b>cutting</b> <b>knives</b> {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. These <b>cutting</b> <b>knives</b> could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these <b>cutting</b> <b>knives,</b> the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle. If one step switch failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four pneumatic controlled reverse switches were placed on the motors. They were connected in parallel.|$|R
50|$|Cutting {{plotters}} use knives to {{cut into}} a piece of material (such as paper, mylar or vinyl) that is lying on the flat surface area of the plotter. It is achieved because the cutting plotter is connected to a computer, which is equipped with specialized cutting design or drawing computer software programs. Those computer software programs are responsible for sending the necessary cutting dimensions or designs in order to command the <b>cutting</b> <b>knife</b> to produce the correct project cutting needs.|$|E
50|$|Although tissue {{embedding}} is not necessary, it {{is highly}} recommended that very small and soft specimens be embedded in agar or agarose. Embedding the tissue {{has no effect on}} the tissue itself, and agar or agarose embedding can be used for both live and fixed tissues. This process is very similar to the Compresstome vibratome procedures. One commonly encountered problem with the Leica vibratome is that the <b>cutting</b> <b>knife</b> pushes away the specimen which results in shearing or tearing of tissue. An agar block can be glued below the tissue specimen in an attempt to overcome this obstacle.|$|E

40|$|Machine vision (MV) {{is a broad}} {{field that}} is growing very rapidly and being used in every {{automation}} control system. It uses computer vi-sion {{in the context of}} manufacturing. Machine vision is the analysis of images/pictures to extract data of interest for controlling a process or activity. Thesis focus with in the field of Machine Vision that is used for optical online quality inspection of the <b>cutting</b> <b>knifes</b> in a wood chipper that is also the title of the thesis. The work is focused on measuring the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>knifes</b> that are moving with the speed of 45 m/s in a real time wood chipper. On the basis of that quality measurement it is decided that knifes in a wood chipper should be replaced or not. While measuring the quality of knifes the effect of blurring effect due to very fast motion of knifes is also investigated for different exposure times. Different types of illumination sources are discussed and described that which illumination source is suitable for what type of environment and application. The quality of <b>cutting</b> <b>knifes</b> is investigated by comparing the obtained values with predicted values in the least square sense. Different image processing algorithms and filtering techniques are applied to find the region of interest i. e. edges of knifes from the image. Decision is {{made on the basis of}} accumulated mean square error. The work presented in the thesis, very clearly describes the hardware components that are used in machine vision systems to acquire images. It forms the basis for future research and development activities within this application area. Analysis of results aim at being important input to the definition of problems faced in machine vision applications. Three important disciplines i. e. image processing, hardware and software design are utilized in this thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Execution of spiral-turned {{ornaments}} {{with constant}} pitch represents {{the movement of}} the tool on the helical trajectories (main trajectory) along a cylinder during manufacturing process. The processing tool has the profile shape of the helical winding (generated trajectory) on the <b>cutting</b> <b>knives.</b> The main and the generated trajectories are the basic elements in processing of spiral-turned ornaments with constant pitch. If the generated trajectory is materialized on the <b>cutting</b> <b>knives</b> of the tools (profiled router milling tools), the main trajectory must be kinematic generated by combining the movements performed by the tool and the workpiece. Generating the main trajectory means to combine the linear and angular movements, correlated with parameters as function of geometrical characteristics of the spiral-turned ornament: wrapping angle and winding pitch (axial pitch). This paper aims to present the links and parametric correlations between the working tool and the workpiece according to the geometric characteristics that must result to ensure the aesthetics of the ornament. The correlation of parameters results also in obtaining the desired quality of machined surfaces. All these require the development of correlation between kinematics and parameters of the machine tools that process such ornaments...|$|R
50|$|The Ransome Victory Plough's most {{recognizable}} {{feature is the}} vertically adjustable pivot wheel {{in front of the}} ploughshare (as opposed to a <b>cutting</b> <b>knife</b> or wheel). This pivot wheel, combined with an offset tension bar to which the chain from the yoke is connected, causes the forward motion of oxen to force the blade into the soil. However, the tension bar is typically far weaker than the main plough beam, and is likely {{the first part of the}} plough to break. The difficulty of accessing spare parts causes many farmers to simply chain the oxen to the front of the beam, after which the ploughman must use his own strength to keep the plowshare in the soil. Another notable feature is the relatively short mouldboard, which lessens the amount of draft force necessary to pull the plow.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the animal}} and the culture, docking may be done by <b>cutting</b> (<b>knife</b> or other blade), searing (gas or {{electrically}} heated searing iron), or constriction methods, i.e. rubber ring elastration. [...] The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association indicates that pain, stress, recovery time and complications associated with docking of livestock will be minimized by docking when animals are under one week of age. [...] However, docking of lambs within 24 hours of birth is not recommended, as it may interfere with ingestion of colostrum and/or formation of the maternal bond. [...] In the UK the law requires that docking on sheep using constriction methods must be performed within {{the first week of}} the animal's life. [...] The UK Farm Animal Welfare Council has noted that this limitation can be problematic in management of hill flocks where normal practice is to handle lambs as little as possible during the first week [...] "to avoid mis-mothering, mis-adventure and injury." ...|$|E
50|$|Crucial {{to process}} of {{manufacture}} was fustian cutting. This was a laborious process using a fustian <b>cutting</b> <b>knife.</b> This tool was around 50 cm long, {{and looked like}} a long spike; about 10 cm from the tip, the top edge was sharpened into a blade. It was inserted along the fabric alongside two warp threads, and under the raised weft, and as it was guided forward the blade severed the weft. In corduroy, there were seven ridges to the inch, so along a 31in bolt, there would be about 320 cuts to be done.In the 1860s, the cloth would be stretched over a 22yd long table, and the cutters would walk {{the length of the}} table as many times as was necessary, in recent times the cloth was tensioned over a 6 ft table and all the cuts made, and then the cloth would be released and the next two yards tensioned onto the table. Over a 60hr week the cutter would be expected to produce 500 yards of 7-8 ridge corduroy. Velveteen was cut the same way but had 32 ridges per inch so production would be proportionately less.|$|E

Legend has it that the Cistercians, which are also credited with having founded the wine industry in Burgundy, brought Pinot noir with them to Rheingau, although the earliest record of the grape variety in Rheingau is from 1470. The slopes down from the Taunus mountains belonging to Kloster Eberbach were planted as vineyards in the 12th Century, and early in the 13th Century the vineyards had reached their present area. In medieval times, more red than white wine was produced, usually as Gemischter Satz, i.e. the vineyards were planted with mixed varieties which were vinified together.|$|E
