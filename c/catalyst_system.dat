25|$|The ideal {{conditions}} for imine hydrogenation {{depend on the}} nature of the substrate and <b>catalyst</b> <b>system.</b> Generally, higher pressures of hydrogen gas are needed in order to achieve reasonable reaction times; however, hydrogen pressure does not appreciably affect enantioselectivity. If the active catalyst is generated in situ, Schlenck techniques or a glove box should be employed. Parr shakers may be used for reaction pressures up to 4 bar, although precise temperature control is difficult to achieve in the reaction vessel. For higher hydrogen pressures, specialized autoclave equipment is required.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the same}} <b>catalyst</b> <b>system</b> {{directing}} groups {{can be employed}} to achieve regioselectivity without substituents as steric mediators. For example, Boebel and Hartwig reported a method to conduct ortho-borylation where a dimethyl-hydrosilyl directing group on the arene undergoes iridium catalyzed borylation at the C–H bond ortho to the silane directing group. Selectivity for the ortho position {{in the case of}} using hydrosilyl directing groups has been attributed to reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, leading to preferential cleavage of the C–H bond ortho to the hydrosilyl substituent. Several other strategies to achieve ortho-borylation of arenes have been developed using various directing groups.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, the {{hydrogenation}} of carbon–nitrogen double {{bonds is}} {{the addition of}} the elements of dihydrogen (H2) across a carbon–nitrogen double bond, forming amines or amine derivatives. Although a variety of general methods have been developed for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones, methods for the hydrogenation of carbon–nitrogen double bonds are less general. Hydrogenation of imines is complicated by both syn/anti isomerization and tautomerization to enamines, which may be hydrogenated with low enantioselectivity {{in the presence of a}} chiral catalyst. Additionally, the substituent attached to nitrogen affects both the reactivity and spatial properties of the imine, complicating the development of a general <b>catalyst</b> <b>system</b> for imine hydrogenation. Despite these challenges, methods have been developed that address particular substrate classes, such as N-aryl, N-alkyl, and endocyclic imines.|$|E
25|$|Because the substituents {{attached}} to the imine nitrogen exert a profound influence on reactivity, few general <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> exist for the enantioselective hydrogenation of imines and imine derivatives.

25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be sodium bromide, {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals.

A feed mixture containing p-xylene, acetic acid, the <b>catalyst</b> <b>system,</b> and compressed air is fed to a reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where p-xylene is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the p-xylene is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA.

2500|$|Many {{aromatization}} processes {{start with}} two or three acyclic molecules which are fused into a new aromatic ring. Alkyne trimerization is one simple case whereby the [...] cycloaddition of three alkynes yields a substituted benzene [...] cyclization of 2-butyne forming hexamethylbenzene, for example. Benzene itself can be prepared by Reppe synthesis with the ligands on the nickel catalyst dictating whether production of benzene or cyclooctatetraene predominates. [...] If an unsymmetric alkyne is used, a variety of products is formed; Rhodium-catalysed cyclotrimerization of phenylacetylene yields both the 1,2,4- and 1,3,5- isomers of triphenylbenzene along with substantial quantities of acyclic enyne products, though use of an alternative <b>catalyst</b> <b>system</b> can produce 97% selectivity for the 1,2,4-product. Antiaromatic cyclobutadiene-derivatives and non-aromatic cyclooctatetraene products are also observed side-products of cyclotrimerizations, and when a mixture of substituted acetylenes is used regioselectivity becomes especially problematic.

2500|$|The first {{example of}} a {{catalytic}} C–H borylation of an unactivated hydrocarbon (benzene) was reported by Smith and Iverson using Ir(Cp*)(H)(Bpin) as the catalyst. [...] The efficiency of this system, however, was low, providing only 3 turnovers after 120 h at 150°C. [...] Numerous subsequent developments by Hartwig and coworkers led to efficient, practical conditions for arene borylation. [...] Aromatic C–H borylation was developed by Hartwig and Ishiyama using the diboron reagent Bis(pinacolato)diboron catalyzed by 4,4’-di-tert-butylbipyridine (dtbpy) and 2. With this <b>catalyst</b> <b>system</b> the borylation of aromatic C–H bonds occurs with regioselectivity that is controlled by steric effects of the starting arene. The selectivity for functionalization of aromatic C–H bonds is governed by the general rule that the reaction does not occur ortho to a substituent when a C–H bond lacking an ortho substituent is available. When only one functional group is present borylation occurs in the meta and para position in statistical ratios of 2:1 (meta:para). The ortho isomer is not detected due to the steric effects of the substituent.|$|E

40|$|The {{major focus}} {{of this study is}} the {{investigation}} of the reactivity and specificity of 4 -(dialkylamino) pyridine (DAAP) polymer <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> in the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters in aqueous solution. The <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> are based on a hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymer and DAAP functional groups. The polymer <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> include an N-ethylated and N-dodecylated- 4 -vinylpyridinium copolymer that dissolves in water and organizes into hydrophobic regions solubilized by the N-ethylated moieties. The hydrophobic regions serve as binding sites for organic lipophiles while catalytic activity is provided by DAAP functional groups that are bound to the polymeric system by electrostatic, hydrophobic or covalent means. The systems are designed to mimic enzymes. Substrate and catalytic unit are expected to dissolve into the binding domain prior to the reaction of substrate with the catalytic unit. This simplified enzyme mechanism does not account for all of the results observed in the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters when using the various polymer <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> examined in this study. The key to understanding the mechanism of the polymer <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> is the ability of the copolymer to solubilize p-nitrophenyl esters in its shell or interfacial regions. The polysoap is extremely compact and dissolution of p-nitrophenyl ester and the hydrophobically assembled DAAP functional group into the interior of the polymer core is very slow relative to the hydrolysis rate. The results of the kinetic studies indicate that a change in the structural organization of the polymer-ester complex occurs with increasing concentration of ester. The hydrolysis reaction can occur in three different phases: (1) p-nitrophenyl ester dissolved by the copolymer, (2) aggregated p-nitrophenyl ester dissolved by the copolymer and (3) aggregated p-nitrophenyl ester that is not dissolved by the copolymer. Four important points are required to understand substrate specificity for the polymer <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems.</b> They are (1) the greater capacity of the copolymer for the more hydrophobic p-nitrophenyl esters, (2) the location of p-nitrophenyl ester in the heterogeneous copolymer surface (3) the three phases where reaction occurs and (4) the inability of the copolymer to solubilize aggregates of p-nitrophenyl esters with alkanoate chain lengths ≥ 14 carbons. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{feasibility}} of ethanol production in the United States, ethanol has become more attractive as a fuel source and a possible energy carrier within the hydrogen economy. Ethanol can be stored easily in liquid form, and can be internally pre-formed prior to usage in low temperature (200 C – 400 C) solid acid and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. However, complete electrochemical oxidation of ethanol remains a challenge. Prior research of ethanol reforming at high temperatures (> 400 C) has identified several metallic and oxide-based <b>catalyst</b> <b>systems</b> that improve ethanol conversion, hydrogen production, and catalyst stability.
