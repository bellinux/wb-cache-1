2500|$|The Wylex {{standard}} <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> {{was very}} popular in the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding residual-current devices (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone. The design {{does not allow for}} fitting of RCDs or RCBOs. [...] Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the main switch, but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should not be RCD-protected. [...] There are two styles of fuse base that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn't be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base. [...] Cartridge fuse carriers are also now available for DIN-rail enclosures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.|$|E
50|$|The ring {{starts at}} the <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> (also known as fuse box, {{distribution}} board, or breaker box), visits each socket in turn, and then returns to the <b>consumer</b> <b>unit.</b> The ring is fed from a fuse or circuit breaker in the <b>consumer</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, older {{electrical}} <b>consumer</b> <b>units</b> (also called fuse boxes) are fitted {{either with}} semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses [...] or cartridge fuses [...] (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5A-, 15A- and 30A-rated wire wound {{on a piece}} of cardboard.) [...] Modern <b>consumer</b> <b>units</b> usually contain miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Beginning {{with the}} {{publication}} of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) 2003 data, several new, higher income ranges were shown for the first time. As incomes have continued to rise over the years, the larger number of higher income <b>consumer</b> <b>units</b> 1 occurring in the sample allowed for the publication of these new classes. Using 2003 data, this article compares characteristics and expenditures of those in the highest income range, $ 150, 000 and over, with expenditures and characteristics of those in the range of less than $ 70, 000. A majority (63. 9 percent) of <b>consumer</b> <b>units</b> in the CE had an average annual income of less than $ 70, 000, whereas a small number of <b>consumer</b> <b>units</b> (3. 5 percent) reported incomes of $ 150, 000 and over.
