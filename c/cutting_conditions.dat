For {{traditional}} rotary burrs, cutter teeth converge at the vertex, {{which means}} small chip space and poor <b>cutting</b> <b>condition.</b> In {{order to increase}} the chip space and to improve the <b>cutting</b> <b>condition,</b> {{a new type of}} rotary burrs with partition blade teeth, which took the feasibility of the actual process into consideration, was proposed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of high strength steels {{is sensitive to}} the surface quality of machined surfaces. The effect of <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> on the variation of surface roughness in turning of 30 CrMnSiA steel has been investigated through a serial of dry and oil-lubricant cutting tests. The characters of an amplitude characteristics set, Ra, Ry and tp, which {{are associated with the}} general shape of the machined surface profiles, are investigated in this study. It is concluded that, in the aspect of Ra and Ry values, dry <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> provides a similar surface roughness as in wet <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> under the experimental conditions of the present research; the bearing capacity of both kinds of machined surfaces, characterized by the bearing length rate tp, could be different according to the cutting parameters combinations.

40|$|Milling {{process is}} one of {{machining}} process mostly used to manufacture a component. In machining a component, high quality production should be met. High quality production is indicated by {{a better quality of}} surface roughness. Implementing combination of maximum machining parameters will cause higher surface roughness. For that reason, machining parameters of milling process such as spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> must be optimized to get an optimum condition of surface quality and tool wear. This research attempts to identify the significance of processing parameters and optimize the surface roughness and tool wear of milling operations. The Taguchi method is used to find the optimum process parameters. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is employed to investigate the characteristics of performance. Based on the optimization result, the optimum condition of surface roughness is 0. 72 ± 0. 18 µm with machining parameters as followed: 2500 rpm spindle speed; 0. 12 mm/rev feed rate, 1 mm depth of cut, and <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> using palm oil. Meanwhile, the optimum condition for tool wear is 3. 3 ± 0. 2 µm with machining parameters as followed: 2500 rpm spindle speed; 0. 12 mm/rev feed rate; 1 mm depth of cut, and <b>cutting</b> <b>condition</b> using palm oil. ...|$|R
50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) {{may be defined}} as the rate (or speed) at the {{workpiece}} surface, irrespective of the machining operation used. A cutting speed for mild steel, of 100 ft/min (or approx 30 meters/min) is the same whether it is the speed of the (stationary) cutter passing over the (moving) workpiece, such as in a turning operation, or the speed of the (rotating) cutter moving past a (stationary) workpiece, such as in a milling operation. What will affect the value of this surface speed for mild steel, is the <b>cutting</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some materials, such as {{machinable}} wax, {{can be cut}} at a {{wide variety}} of spindle speeds, while others, such as stainless steel require much more careful control as the cutting speed is critical, to avoid overheating both the cutter and workpiece. Stainless steel is one material that work hardens very easily, therefore insufficient feed rate or incorrect spindle speed can lead to less than ideal <b>cutting</b> <b>conditions</b> as the work piece will quickly harden and resist the tool's cutting action. The liberal application of cutting fluid can improve these cutting conditions; however, the correct selection of speeds is the critical factor.|$|E
