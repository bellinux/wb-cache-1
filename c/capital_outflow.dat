40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} capital flight from Russia, and discusses the effectiveness of administrative methods to combat that outflow. In the author's opinion, the fight against <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> boils down to fighting against the reluctance of a country's inhabitants to invest in their own economy. As long as investments abroad are incomparably more attractive than investments at home, the small reductions in returns on foreign assets produced by administrative barriers to <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> cannot be expected to significantly slow these outflows. The key factors in limiting <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> are not administrative measures, but rather a sensible tax system and legislation, and balanced budget policies that stimulate rather than impede investment in the Russian economy. On the other hand, the author assumes that unless problems of nonpayment of taxes, money laundering, and stealing are addressed, {{the creation of an}} attractive investment climate is impossible. ...|$|R

The model fits the two following facts, documented on a sample of 67 countries between 1980 and 2003 : (i) TFP growth is positively correlated with <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> in a sample including creditor countries; (ii) the long-run level of capital per efficient unit of labor is positively correlated with <b>capital</b> <b>outflows.</b> Consistently, we show that the capital flows predicted by the model are positively correlated with the actual ones in this sample once the capital wedge is accounted for.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{considers}} whether fundamentals or other factors {{can explain the}} yen's ongoing weakness. In particular, the importance of <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> due to the carry trade and longer-term portfolio investment outflows, which may be delaying the adjustment of the yen, are investigated. A simple portfolio model is developed, composed of a speculative component and a minimum variance portfolio, to address the underlying motivation for <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> from Japan {{over the past ten}} years. The author's main findings suggest that a substantial portion of outflows may be attributed to diversification. Furthermore, given that considerable 'home bias' remains in Japanese households' portfolios, the results suggest that <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> from households, largely driven by diversification, may continue to dampen a long-run appreciation of the yen going forward. That said, evidence of substantial speculative outflows, through carry trades, complicates the outlook for the yen.

The empirical findings indicate that capital flight reduces private investment dramatically but {{does not have any}} effect on public investment. However, no statistically significant impact of financial liberalization on the marginal effect of capital flight on investment is found. capital flight, emerging markets, financial liberalization, investment, resident <b>capital</b> <b>outflows,...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The 1986 Tax Reform Act {{introduced}} {{changes that}} potentially alter capital flows {{into and out}} of the United States, particularly for financial companies. This paper uses data from 1982 to 1997 to assess the evolution of net U. S. <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> (net repatriations) in banking and finance relative to other industries. The results of this paper indicate that net U. S. <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> in the banking and finance industry were much lower than in other industries after 1986, even after controlling for general finance company differences, a time trend, exchange rates, tax rates, and country fixed effects. Once controlling for the trend over time, net <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> were not different before and after 1986 for industries other than banking and finance, but are significantly lower for banking and finance companies after 1986. The results are interpreted to suggest that TRA 86 did not influence net <b>capital</b> <b>outflows</b> for most industries, but that changes in Subpart F for financial companies lead to a significantly lower outflow in the banking and finance industry. 1 Taxation of capital is particularly difficult in a world of increasingly mobile capital flows.
