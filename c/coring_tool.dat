50|$|The MAX-C rover {{would have}} been able to acquire samples through coring and abrasion. Coring was to be {{accomplished}} through the use of a core drill that could produce cores of approximately 10 mm diameter up to 50 mm long, which would be encapsulated in individual sleeves with pressed-in caps. Abrading of surface material would be accomplished through the use of a specialized abrading bit placed in the <b>coring</b> <b>tool.</b> This tool would be intended to remove small amounts of surface material in order to allow instruments access past any dust and/or weathering layer. It would abrade a circular area of similar diameter to the core (8-10 mm). Translation of the arm would be used to scan the individual abrasion spots. The rover should be able to cache at least 38 core samples.|$|E
5000|$|... {{drilling}} exploration {{diamond drilling}} where a rotating annular tool {{backed up by}} a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the <b>coring</b> <b>tool.</b> Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample {{on its way to}} surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the drilling fluid and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few millimeters in diameter (in wood, for dendrochronology) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in oil exploration). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for dendrochronology) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in oil exploration), and many runs can be made in succession if [...] "quick look" [...] analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} low-force rotary-percussive rock <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> for use {{in acquiring}} samples for geological surveys in future planetary missions was developed. The <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> could eventually enable a lightweight robotic system to operate from a relatively small (less than 200 kg) mobile or fixed platform to acquire and cache Mars or other planetary rock samples for eventual return to Earth for analysis. To gain insight needed to design an integrated <b>coring</b> <b>tool,</b> the coring ability of commercially available coring bits was evaluated for effectiveness of varying key parameters: weight-on-bit, rotation speed, percussive rate and force. Trade studies were performed for different methods of breaking a core at its base and for retaining the core in a sleeve to facilitate sample transfer. This led to a custom <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> design which incorporated coring, core breakage, core retention, and core extraction functions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt Is {{essential that the}} force vector {{of the weight of}} a <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> act along a line that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the core barrel. Such an alignment enables corers to obtain deeper, less disturbed core samples. The probability of bending the core barrel is furthermore greatly reduced. A fin assembly that provides the maximum righting moment for one shape of <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> does not necessarily provide the maximum moment for a different shape. The optimum fin design is determined by testing. A fin assembly for a particular <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> has been devised which reduces the probability of the force vector not acting parallel to the longitudinal axis. The optimum design is a vane-shroud fin assembly. The shape of the shroud is conical. Slotting the shroud by removing longitudinal strips improves the righting capability at higher angles of deviation, but is slightly inferior to the full shroud at lesser angles.

A differentiation {{has long been}} made between assemblages of large-sized 2 ̆ 2 <b>core</b> <b>tools</b> 2 ̆ 2 and assemblages of small-sized 2 ̆ 2 flake tools. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 <b>Core</b> <b>tool</b> 2 ̆ 2 assemblages are often argued to be the handiwork of early hominin species such as Homo erectus, while small-sized 2 ̆ 2 flake tool 2 ̆ 2 assemblages {{have been attributed to}} Homo sapiens. We argue that this traditional Southeast Asian perspective on stone tools assumes that the artifacts recovered from a site reflect a complete technological sequence. Our analyses of Pleistocene-age artifact assemblages from Flores, Indonesia, demonstrate that large pebble-based cores and small flake-based cores are aspects of one reduction sequence. We propose that the Flores pattern applies across island Southeast Asia: large-sized 2 ̆ 2 <b>core</b> <b>tool</b> 2 ̆ 2 assemblages are in fact a missing element of the small-sized flake-based reduction sequences found in many Pleistocene caves and rock-shelters.

40|$|A system {{consisting}} {{of a set of}} estimators and autonomous behaviors has been developed which allows robust coring from a low-mass rover platform, while accommodating for moderate rover slip. A redundant set of sensors, including a force-torque sensor, visual odometry, and accelerometers are used to monitor discrete critical and operational modes, as well as to estimate continuous drill parameters during the coring process. A set of critical failure modes pertinent to shallow coring from a mobile platform is defined, and autonomous behaviors associated with each critical mode are used to maintain nominal coring conditions. Autonomous shallow coring is demonstrated from a low-mass rover using a rotary-percussive <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> mounted on a 5 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm. A new architecture of using an arm-stabilized, rotary percussive tool with the robotic arm used to provide the drill z-axis linear feed is validated. Particular attention to hole start using this architecture is addressed. An end-to-end coring sequence is demonstrated, where the rover autonomously detects and then recovers from a series of slip events that exceeded 9 cm total displacement...|$|E
40|$|Free or hydrate-bound {{gas in the}} {{seafloor}} has been of scientific, ecologic and economic interest for many years because it predominantly contains high concentrations of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. A prerequisite of accurate quantifications of gases in sediments is to preserve pressure and temperature close to the in situ conditions during recovery. Here we introduce two new sediment coring devices that allow for the recovery of near-surface gas- and gas-hydrate-bearing sediments and subsequent investigations using several different techniques such as visualisation by computerized tomography, quantitative degassing, and sediment and porewater analyses. The first <b>coring</b> <b>tool,</b> the Multiple Autoclave Corer (MAC), resembles a standard multiple corer in terms of applications, size and core length of about 55 cm. The second tool, the Dynamic Autoclave Piston Corer (DAPC), {{is similar to a}} piston corer in application and size and enables one to take cores of up to 2. 5 m length. Both focus on the investigation of near-surface sediments, which are most strongly affected by changes in bottom-water temperature and hydrostatic pressure, which in turn influence continental slope stability.

40|$|Three {{moisture}} and bulk density sampling methods were evaluated {{for use in}} neutron gauge calibration. Each of the methods was comprised of a single core or portions of a core taken during installation of a neutron access tube. In addition to direct measurement of bulk density, the effect of using "smoothed", "probable " and gamma-probe measured bulk density profiles was evaluated. The use of these three alternative bulk density profiles in the computation of volumetric moisture generally had insignificant effect on the resulting neutron gauge calibration equation. The use of a depth-weighted volumetric moisture profile generally improved calibration statistics, but reduced slopes of neutron calibration equations (% moisture per count ratio). Overall, a total core method which used a tractor-mounted, hydraulically operated <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> provided the most consistent calibrations with lowest standard errors of estimate, although compression of soil along {{the perimeter of the}} cored hole increased subsequent neutron count ratios. A "Madera " down-hole sampler generally provided good calibrations, also. A third, small-volume, down-hole sampler provided valid {{moisture and}} bulk density samples; however, the smaller representative volume of the sampler relative to the sampling volume of neutron gauges adversely affected slopes of some calibration equations...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} {{the probability of a}} Viable Earth Microorganism (VEM) contaminating a sample during the sample acquisition and handling (SAH) process of a potential future Mars Sample Return mission is developed. A scenario where multiple core samples would be acquired using a rotary percussive <b>coring</b> <b>tool,</b> deployed from an arm on a MER class rover is analyzed. The analysis is conducted in a structured way by decomposing sample acquisition and handling process into a series of discrete time steps, and breaking the physical system into a set of relevant components. At each discrete time step, two key functions are defined: The probability of a VEM being released from each component, and the transport matrix, which represents the probability of VEM transport from one component to another. By defining the expected the number of VEMs on each component {{at the start of the}} sampling process, these decompositions allow the expected number of VEMs on each component at each sampling step to be represented as a Markov chain. This formalism provides a rigorous mathematical framework in which to analyze the probability of a VEM entering the sample chain, as well as making the analysis tractable by breaking the process down into small analyzable steps...|$|E
40|$|As {{a prelude}} {{to the design of}} {{sampling}} devices able to extract materials from the icy surfaces of comets, outer-planet satellites, and the martian poles, it is necessary to understand some of the physical properties of these ices. To this end we have investigated the mechanical resistance displayed by two ices subjected to coring operations at low temperatures and under vacuum. The ices used in this study were water ice, frozen from liquid water, and carbon dioxide ice grown from its vapour. The <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> employed had dimensions and required power levels that were comparable to a sample extraction system designed for a present-day spacecraft lander. The specific cutting strength, a parameter that measures the toughness of the material, has been measured while coring these two ices. For water ice this property rose from 25 MJ m− 3 at an ice temperature of 250 K, to 60 MJ m− 3 at 140 K. At the lower temperature of 140 K, pore-free carbon dioxide ice has also been measured to have a specific cutting strength approximately half that of water ice at the same temperature. These laboratory-based measurements may be used as guides for the power levels needed to core solid water and CO 2 ices at certain rates...|$|E
40|$|A US National Science Foundation-funded {{workshop}} occurred 17 – 19 May 2013 at the University of Oklahoma {{to stimulate}} research using continental scientific drilling to explore earth's sedimentary, paleobiological and biogeochemical record. Participants submitted 3 -page "pre-proposals" to highlight projects that envisioned using drill-core studies to address scientific issues in paleobiology, paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and biogeochemistry, {{and to identify}} locations where key questions can best be addressed. The workshop was also intended to encourage US scientists {{to take advantage of}} the exceptional capacity of unweathered, continuous core records to answer important questions in the history of earth's sedimentary, biogeochemical and paleobiologic systems. Introductory talks on drilling and coring methods, plus best practices in core handling and curation, opened the workshop to enable all to understand the opportunities and challenges presented by scientific drilling. Participants worked in thematic breakout sessions to consider questions to be addressed using drill cores related to glacial–interglacial and icehouse–greenhouse transitions, records of evolutionary events and extinctions, records of major biogeochemical events in the oceans, reorganization of earth's atmosphere, Lagerstätte and exceptional fossil biota, records of vegetation–landscape change, and special sampling requirements, contamination, and <b>coring</b> <b>tool</b> concerns for paleobiology, geochemistry, geochronology, and stratigraphy–sedimentology studies. Closing discussions at the workshop focused on the role drilling can play in studying overarching science questions about the evolution of the earth system. The key theme, holding the most impact in terms of societal relevance, is understanding how climate transitions have driven biotic change, and the role of pristine, stratigraphically continuous cores in advancing our understanding of this linkage. Scientific drilling, and particularly drilling applied to continental targets, provides unique opportunities to obtain continuous and unaltered material for increasingly sophisticated analyses, tapping the entire geologic record (extending through the Archean), and probing the full dynamic range of climate change and its impact on biotic history...|$|E
