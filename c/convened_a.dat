5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|In August 1562, David Lindsay {{received}} Mary, Queen of Scots, at Edzell. The Queen {{was on a}} Royal progress, {{with the}} aim of subduing the rebellious Earl of Huntly, and spent two nights at Edzell.

5|$|The Gold Rush {{propelled}} California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to {{a center}} of the global imagination and the destination {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic-mindedness. For example, in the midst of the Gold Rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was <b>convened,</b> <b>a</b> state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.|$|E
5|$|The University of Texas {{officials}} <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> {{task force}} to determine whether to honor the students' petition for removal of the statue.

The statue was removed on August 30, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Warren <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> {{meeting of}} the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument {{that the only reason}} to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E
5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of {{the leaders}} of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E

5|$|In 1851, a {{new state}} {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was {{an extension of the}} terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The new constitution delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> session every two years. The new constitution also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Dean's significant damage, several emergency response groups gathered funds and readied personnel. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of {{all member states}} in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands. The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in anticipation that member states would require international assistance.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{preparations}} for the 6th Congress. It was <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> decade after the 5th WPK Congress (in 1970), outside the party norm of a quadrennial meeting. There was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably {{due to the fact that}} WPK General Secretary Kim Il-sung spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor Kim Jong-il. In addition, a great deal of time was spent restructuring party organizations and functions. The primary reason for the 6th Congress was to formalize Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's chosen successor.|$|E

5|$|Marshal Murat <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} tribunal, {{chaired by}} General Emmanuel Grouchy, that morning to summarily try and sentence anyone found {{in possession of}} a potential weapon. Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, who witnessed the aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Doaiz's death his wife entered a convent in Seville.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} the Home Office were an {{undisclosed}} number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office {{that he was the}} correct applicant. ATSIC then <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1941, about 75 {{prominent}} Serbs <b>convened</b> <b>a</b> {{meeting in}} Belgrade where they resolved that Nedić should form a Government of National Salvation {{to replace the}} Commissioner Government. The same day, Nedić wrote to Danckelmann agreeing to become the Prime Minister {{of the new government}} on the basis of five conditions and some additional concessions. Two days later, the German authorities appointed Nedić and his government. Real power continued to reside with the occupiers. Aćimović initially retained his position as Minister of the Interior. In March 1945, he joined a Chetnik group in the NDH, and was killed battling the Partisans.|$|E
