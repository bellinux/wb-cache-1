40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Salmonella spp. {{was investigated in}} 109 wild birds poached in the illegal wildlife trade in Rio de Janeiro; {{most of them are}} passerines from Thraupidae family and three from Psittacidae. One strain of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium and two strains of Salmonella ser. Panama were isolated from passerine species and all of them showed resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs, like ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, tetracycline, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin. PFGE showed 100 % similarity among the Salmonella ser. Typhimurium strain isolated from a Temminck’s seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris) and the strains isolated from a human outbreak, in southern Brazil. The two Salmonella ser. Panama strains isolated from two <b>chestnut-capped</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (Chrysomus ruficapillus) present in the same catch showed the same clonal origin and have never been associated with epizooties and human outbreaks. Potential for dissemination of resistant Salmonella through situations offered by captive management and the isolation of the same strain from wild birds and human sources may become a problem for the conservation of natural populations and to public health...|$|R
50|$|The <b>chestnut-capped</b> <b>blackbird</b> {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} and semi-tropical eastern part of South America at altitudes of up to 500 m. Its range covers much of the Amazon Basin and extends from northern Brazil to northern Argentina. It {{is found in}} the vicinity of water, in marshes, in nearby grassland and in rice fields.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chestnut-capped</b> <b>blackbird</b> is sexually dimorphic. It has a {{straight}} dark-coloured beak {{with a sharp}} tip, and dark legs. The male has a chestnut-coloured head and throat but is otherwise glossy black; birds {{in the southern part}} of the range have darker heads than those in the north. The upper parts of the female are a dark olive-brown, slightly streaked with black, and the underparts are paler olive-brown; the streaking on the back of this species is less distinct than in other birds in this genus. The voice consists of various trills and whistles, the song being a lengthy [...] "chree-chree-churrr".|$|E
40|$|Brood Parasitism of the Shiny Cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis on <b>Chestnut-Capped</b> <b>Blackbird</b> Agelaius ruficapillus, In Eastern Buenos Aires Province, Information about brood {{parasitism}} of the Shiny Cowbird on the Chestnutcapped Blackbird in E Argentina is very scarce. Data of 29 active nests of this blackbird from 3 localities of E Buenos Aires province (Bernal, Hudson and General Lavalle), were studied. Ten {{of these}} nests were parasitized (34. 5 %), suggesting a considerable incidence of parasitism and adverse effect over the <b>Chestnut-capped</b> <b>Blackbird</b> brood was detected through a {{lower number of}} host eggs and chicks in parasitized nests.

40|$|AbstractThe illegal {{wildlife}} trade {{may increase}} the risk of infectious disease transmission, and it may not only cause disease outbreaks in humans but also threaten livestock, native wild populations, and ecosystems’ health. Bird species may act as carriers in the transmission of enteric pathogens. However, epidemiological studies on zoonotic bacteria in wild birds are rare in Brazil. From March 2011 to March 2012, we investigated the frequency of Enterobacteriaceae in cloacal swab samples from 109 birds of the passerine and Psittacidae families. These birds were recovered from illegal trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and sent to a rehabilitation center. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 86 wild birds (78. 9 %). A mean (±SD) of 1. 68 (± 1. 30) different bacterial species were isolated per bird, with a maximum of five bacterial species from three bird species. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, followed by Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric bacteria. Salmonella ser. Typhimurium was isolated from a Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), and two Salmonella ser. Panama were isolated from two specimens of <b>chestnut-capped</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Chrysomus ruficapillus). Of the 70 selected bacterial isolates, 60 exhibited antibiotic resistance. The resistance patterns varied from one to nine of the antibiotics tested. Resistance to ceftiofur was the most prevalent, followed by ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The dissemination potential of resistant strains in situations typically seen in the management of captive birds may become a problem for the conservation of natural bird populations and for public health...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{effective}} and environmentally sensitive methods of controlling vertebrate pest problems in agriculture and the urban environment. Nonlethal chemical repellents may meet this need where more traditional methods of control, such as scaring, shooting, and trapping, are either ineffectual or unacceptable. One such chemical repellent currently under investigation is cinnarnamide, a synthetic compound derived from a plant secondary compound, cinnamic acid. Cinnamamide is unusual because, unlike many of its contemporaries, it deters feeding by both birds and mammals. This paper reviews past and current laboratory and field studies in which cinnamarnide is shown to deter feeding by problem birds, such as the woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), rock dove (C. livia), and <b>chestnut-capped</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Agelaius ruficapillus), and mammalian pests, such as the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus musculus), and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Using peanuts in feeders as a model 2 ̆ 2 crop, 2 ̆ 2 we also show that free-living birds (e. g. greenfinch [Carduela chloris], blue tit [Parus caeruleus], and great tit [P. major]) are prepared to incur an increased risk of predation or abandon a feeding site altogether in order to avoid eating food treated with cinnamamide. Laboratory studies of cinnarnamide 2 ̆ 7 s mode of action suggest that it has both primary (immediate) and secondary (postingestional) activity. Birds generally respond immediately to the compound through unpleasant effects mediated through taste, odor, or irritation of the buccal cavity, whereas some mammals do not find it instantly repellent but learn to avoid it because of its postingestional activity...|$|E
40|$|Bird {{damage to}} {{ripening}} and sprouting agricultural crops {{is a serious}} problem in many Departamentos (States) in Uruguay and a limiting factor in the production of some crops. A total of about one million hectares of wheat, corn, sunflowers, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans, barley, oats, and peanuts are grown (De Grazio and Besser, 1975). Grain sorghum and sunflower crops are damaged most seriously by birds; corn and rice, soybeans, peanuts, and fruits (such as apples and pears), to a lesser extent. Three families of birds are responsible for most of the damage: doves and pigeons, parakeets, and blackbirds. Waterfowl and fringillids also contribute to bird damage problems in the production of cereal grains. Both cereal and oil grains are attacked as they sprout but more serious losses occur as crops ripen. Damage by the Eared Dove (zenaida auriculata) to ripening grain sorghum and sunflowers and by the Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) to ripening sunflowers and corn are the most serious problems. Eared Doves, the Spot-winged Pigeon (columba maculosa) and Picazuro Pigeons (columba picazuro) sometimes seriously damage emerging soybeans. Blackbirds, chiefly the <b>Chestnut-capped</b> <b>Blackbird</b> (Agelaius ruficapillus) and three species of cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensus, M. badius and M. rufoaxillarls), damage rice both when sprouting and ripening. Waterfowl, mostly the White-faced Tree Duck (Dendiocygna viduata), sometimes heavily damage rice seed in flooded paddies. Lesser amounts of damage are caused by parakeets to ripening wheat and grain sorghum fields and by pigeons and doves to ripening barley and oat plantings. To alleviate these losses, the Department of Plant Health of Uruguay (Direccion de Sanidad Vegetal) began organized campaigns nearly a decade ago to reduce the numbers of Monk Parakeets and Eared Doves in zones where crop damage was most severe. Some measure of success was attained in some areas by spraying the colonial nests of Monk Parakeets with contact toxicants and by baiting harvested fields with oral toxicants for Eared Doves (Martinez, 1971). In 1973, the Uruguayan Government sought the assistance of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through the U. S. Agency for International Development, Department of State, for additional methods of protecting their crops from birds. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the results of trials using two chemical agents: (1) a repellent, methiocarb, and (2) a frightening agent, 4 -aminopyridine, for the protection of sprouting and ripening crops...|$|E
