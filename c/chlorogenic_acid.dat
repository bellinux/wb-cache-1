5|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has been}} used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others. RNAi has developed many novel crops such as nicotinefree tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically engineered Arctic apples received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene making apple varieties that will not undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced apples are unable to convert <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acid</b> into quinone product.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> (CGA) are a {{group of}} {{phenolic}} acid derivatives, which are commonly found in coffee at concentrations reaching 0. 1 - 0. 2 %. A method based on high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) is proposed for the simultaneous determination of three <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids,</b> i. e. 3 - O -caffeoylquinic acid (3 -CQA), 5 - O -caffeoylquinic acid (5 -CQA) and 3, 5 -di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3, 5 -diCQA), in time portions of espresso coffee. Two different espresso coffee machines working with different pressure and temperature curves, and two different blends (i. e. Arabica and Robusta) were used. The method presents good linearities (correlation coefficient greater than 0. 99) and recoveries (in the range 67 - 99 %) for the 3 <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids.</b> The concentration of total CGAs in a cup of Certified Italian Espresso ranged from 1522. 5 to 2223. 4 mg kg - 1 and CGA isomer contents were, in decreasing order, 5 -CQA > 3 -CQA > 3, 5 -diCQA.

25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are heat-stable and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acid,</b> and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Total {{polyphenols}} in mg per 100g {{of fresh}} weight were 14–102 in white-flesh nectarines, 18–54 in yellow-flesh nectarines, 28–111 in white-flesh peaches, and 21–61mg per 100g in yellow-flesh peaches. The major phenolic compounds identified in peach are <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acid,</b> catechins and epicatechins, with other compounds, identified by HPLC, including gallic acid and ellagic acid. Rutin and isoquercetin {{are the primary}} flavonols found in clingstone peaches.|$|E
25|$|Chlorogenic acids {{belong to}} a group of {{compounds}} known as phenolic acids, which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65mg/g and of arabica 140mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature, more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed, leaving a residue less than 30mg/g in the roasted coffee bean. In contrast to green coffee, green tea contains an average of 85mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable, inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acid</b> is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol, which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1g/l water, they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{infusion}} electrospray ionization {{mass spectrometry}} {{in both the}} negative ESI(-) -MS and positive ESI(+) -MS ion modes are investigated to differentiate green and roasted Arabica coffees with different stages of ripeness (green, ripe and overripe), post-harvesting process (dry, wet and semi-wet) and coffees with different cup qualities. In the ESI(-) -MS of green coffees, ions from deprotonated fatty <b>acids</b> and <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are the most important}} for ripeness discrimination. In the ESI(+) -MS, maturity is differentiated by ions from protonated caffeine, <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> and K+ adducts of fatty acids. To differentiate between post-harvesting process in both ionization modes, ions from fatty <b>acids,</b> <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids,</b> sugars and carboxylic acids generated in the fermentation process are the most representative. Roasted Arabica coffees are also well discriminated: in the ESI(-) -MS, ions from <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> and short-chain organic acids derived from sugars are important. In the ESI(+) -MS, discrimination are mainly performed by low m/z ions such as protonated pyridine and alkylpiridines formed via trigonelline degradation. Both ESI(+) -MS and ESI(-) -MS are able to differentiate cup quality for Arabica roasted coffees and the ions used to perform discrimination are the same ones described in ripeness and post-harvesting processes...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "green coffee bean" [...] {{refers to}} unroasted mature or {{immature}} coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage {{and have an}} intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330mg per dried coffee bean. Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action. Since the mid 2000s, green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acid</b> content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of polyphenols in tobacco waste was identified by HPLC-PDA–ESI/MS/MS and {{the contents of}} <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> and rutin in 10 varieties of tobacco wastes were determined by HPLC–UV. The relationships between the contents of active polyphenols and the varieties of tobacco wastes were interpreted by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that 15 polyphenols were identified in a methanolic extract of dried tobacco waste. The tobacco wastes were characterized by high levels of <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> (3 -CQA, 5 -CQA, and 4 -CQA) and rutin; their ranges in the 10 tobacco varieties were 0. 116 – 0. 196, 0. 686 – 1. 781, 0. 094 – 0. 192, and 0. 413 – 0. 998 %, respectively. According to multivariate statistics models, two active compound variables can be considered important for the discrimination of the varieties of tobacco wastes: <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> and rutin. Consequently, samples of 10 tobacco varieties were characterized into three groups by HCA based on the PCA pattern. In conclusion, tobacco waste {{could be used as}} a new pharmaceutical material for the production of natural <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> and rutin in the ethnopharmacological industry...|$|R
40|$|Scope: Coffee {{is rich in}} quinic {{acid esters}} of {{phenolic}} <b>acids</b> (<b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids)</b> but also contains some free phenolic acids. A proportion of phenolic acids appear in the blood rapidly after coffee consumption due to absorption in the small intestine. We investigated in vitro whether this appearance could potentially be derived from free phenolic acids in instant coffee or from hydrolysis of <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> by pancreatic or brush border enzymes. Methods and results: We quantified six free phenolic acids in instant coffees using HPLC-DAD-mass spectrometry. The highest was caffeic acid, but all were present at low levels compared to the <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids.</b> Roasting and decaffeination significantly reduced free phenolic acid content. We estimated, using pharmacokinetic modelling with previously published data, that the contribution of these compounds to small intestinal absorption is minimal. Hydrolysis of certain <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> was observed with human-differentiated Caco- 2 cell monolayers and with porcine pancreatin, which showed maximal rates on 3 - and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acids, respectively. Conclusion: The amounts of certain free phenolic acids in coffee could only minimally account for small intestinal absorption based on modelling. The hydrolysis of caffeoylquinic, but not feruloylquinic acids, by enterocyte and pancreatic esterases is potentially a contributing mechanism to small intestinal absorption...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{inhibitory}} activity of coffee {{low molecular weight}} compound (LMWC) and high molecular weight compound (HMWC) fractions against in vitro advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation was investigated. The HMWC fraction was characterized for its content in total phenolic groups, proteins and carbohydrates. The <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> of LMWC fraction were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. HMWC inhibited bovine serum albumin glycation by acting as radical scavenger and Fe-chelator in the post-Amadori phase of the reaction and by inhibiting dicarbonyl reactive compounds production during glucose autoxidation. LMWC fraction was able to inhibit protein glycation and dicarbonyl reactive compounds formation more than HMWC fraction. <b>Chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> are the main responsible for the antiglycative activity of LMWC fraction. This study clearly shows that coffee contains molecules with in vitro antiglycative activity and in particular <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> are of particular interest for their known bioavailability in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} coffee brews prepared with different coffeemakers (filter, plunger, mocha, and espresso) {{was measured by}} colorimetric (total phenolic compounds and ABTS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy techniques (Fremy's salt and TEMPO). The mocha coffeemaker had the highest yield in coffee antioxidant extraction per gram of ground roasted coffee, but espresso coffee was richest in terms of antioxidant intake (per milliliter of coffee brew) followed by mocha, plunger, and filter. Both Folin-Ciocalteu (total phenolic compounds) and ABTS assays reacted with standard solutions of <b>chlorogenic</b> <b>acids</b> (CGA) and melanoidins (MO-Ala and MO-Gly).
