5000|$|While a {{large part}} of the former ABMA went to form MSFC, there were still major U.S. Army {{activities}} on Redstone Arsenal, and BECO had work in some of these. In May 1962, most of the activities were consolidated to become the U.S. Army Missile Command (AMC). Although Cummings was mainly involved with increasing BECO’s work for MSFC, he recognized the potential of business with AMC and established close relationships with many of the leaders. One of these was Colonel (later Brigadier General) Ivy O. Drewry, Manager of the new Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) program. In 1967, BECO’s Research Laboratories became the support contractor for the emerging Nike-X ABM system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{critical}} factors that must be considered in any centralization of <b>contracting</b> <b>activities</b> in a geographical region, and understanding these factors, how can they be incorporated using sound business practices to form an efficient and effective centralized <b>contracting</b> <b>activity</b> for the customer. The data for this research were gathered through a literature review on the INTERNET, and various libraries. Interviews were conducted with personnel in the San Diego region, as well as electronic surveys of various commands in the San Diego, Puget Sound, Norfolk, and Jacksonville regions. This thesis concludes that consolidation of <b>contracting</b> <b>activities</b> must consider critical factors including contracting workload, change management/perceptual issues, stakeholder issues, funding, technology, head of <b>contracting</b> <b>activity</b> authority issues, and core versus non- core mission support. The final conclusion is that centralization of <b>contracting</b> <b>activities</b> can be implemented, however, it must be done in an environment that seeks to add value to the contracting process, is process driven in finding the right regional procurement structure, and focuses upon the customer.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature and extent of {{outsourcing}} by higher education institutions, benefits and challenges associated with outsourcing, and the implications of outsourcing for effective management. The principal investigator conducted a national study of outsourcing by four-year colleges and universities at two points in time, 1998 - 99 and 2003 - 04. Results indicated that vending, dining, and bookstore operations were the most frequently <b>contracted</b> <b>activities.</b> The investigators also tested the relationship between each of two institutional variables, control and Carnegie classification, and each of the outsourcing activities.

This paper explores {{the nature and}} extent of outsourcing by higher education institutions, benefits and challenges associated with outsourcing, and the implications of outsourcing for effective management. Theoretical Framework The decision to contract with an external provider for the performance of an organizational function, on the premise that the outside entity can complete the task at a cost lower than that achievable by the organization, has a long history. Manufacturing businesses likely were the first to employ this calculus of lower cost, choosing to buy, rather than to make component parts (Dominia...|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the US Department of Energy's Solar Buildings Program is to advance the {{development}} and widespread deployment of competitive solar thermal technologies for use in buildings. The long-term goal of the Program is to combine solar energy technologies with energy-efficient construction techniques and create cost-effective buildings that have a zero net need for fossil fuel energy on an annual basis. The Solar Buildings Program conducts research and development on solar technologies that can deliver heat, light, and hot water to residential and commercial buildings. By working closely with manufacturers in both the buildings and solar energy industries and by supporting research at universities and national laboratories, the Solar Buildings Program brings together the diverse players developing reliable and affordable solar technologies for building applications. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, jointly participate in the Solar Buildings Program. These two national laboratories work closely with industry researching new concepts, developing technology improvements, reducing manufacturing costs, monitoring system performance, promoting quality assurance, and identifying potential new markets. In calendar year 1999, the Solar Buildings Program focused primarily on solar hot water system research and development (R and D), US industry manufacturing assistance, and US market assistance.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this planning document {{is to establish a}} long-term capability and validating oceanic biogeochemical satellite data. It is a pragmatic solution to a practical problem based primarily o the lessons learned from prior satellite missions. All of the plan's elements are seen to be interdependent, so a horizontal organizational scheme is anticipated wherein the overall leadership comes from the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry (OBB) Program Manager and the entire enterprise is split into two components of equal sature: calibration and validation plus satellite data processing. The detailed elements of the activity are based on the basic tasks of the two main components plus the current objectives of the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems Roadmap. The former is distinguished by an internal core set of responsibilities and the latter is facilitated through an external connecting-core ring of competed or <b>contracted</b> <b>activities.</b> The core elements for the calibration and validation component include a) publish protocols and performance metrics; b) verify uncertainty budgets; c) manage the development and evaluation of instrumentation; and d) coordinate international partnerships. The core elements for the satellite data processing component are e) process and reprocess multisensor data; f) acquire, distribute, and archive data products; and g) implement new data products. Both components have shared responsibilities for initializing and temporally monitoring satellite calibration. Connecting-core elements include (but are not restricted to) atmospheric correction and characterization, standards and traceability, instrument and analysis round robins, field campaigns and vicarious calibration sites, in situ database, bio-optical algorithm (and product) validation, satellite characterization and vicarious calibration, and image processing software.

40|$|The <b>contracted</b> <b>activities</b> for the {{procurement}} of 'Investigate Zero-Stress Replicated Optics' {{to support the}} AXAF-S x-ray spectrometer mirrors has been completed. To date four large Wolter I grazing incidence x-ray optical shells have been electroformed from nickel. The mirrors were fabricated utilizing each of two nickel alloy plated aluminum substrates twice. A wide variety of testing has been completed by NASA MSFC and UAH. This testing includes heat treatment control tests, subscale plating and fixture testing, alloy control of the electroless nickel, adhesion and release testing of the gold to electroless nickel, electroforming instrumentation and software and fabrication of subscale models. The full scale shells are one millimeter thick nickel electrodeposited over a thin gold layer {{which in turn has}} the optical surface on the inside. The optical surface is the replicate of the surface prepared on the substrate. Appendix I briefly outlines the fabrication process. Major objectives which were shared by UAH and MSFC include the design of facilities, equipment and tooling and procurement of materials and equipment. Process development followed with the fabrication of small scale pilot units. Procurement commenced immediately and equipment and materials were ordered to implement the fabrication of first surface full scale substrates (mandrels) and the second surface electroformed optical components. All principal objectives have been achieved. Inspection of the mirrors in visible and x-ray modes validates that the required performance and the quality can be achieved by an electroforming replication process. A very distinct progressive improvement has been achieved with each of the four mirrors produced. The final mirror exceeded the original goals and set an improved standard for flight hardware. The future goal of a 30 arc second resolution at 8 KEV x-ray appears to be achievable by this process when proper cleanliness and process control is utilized...|$|E

40|$|I empirically {{examine the}} choice of a firm’s {{vertical}} boundaries—specifically, the decision to use supplier-customer contracts instead of either using markets or vertical integration. I examine the determinants of supplier-customer contracts using data on a customer’s contractual purchase obligations with its suppliers. Contracting propensity is positively related to supplier relationship-specific investments (RSI), the supplier’s relative bargaining power, and vertical integration costs, and negatively related to contracting costs, alternative sources of information about the customer, and the percentage of a customer’s input traded on financial markets. I also find that customer firms which have product market contracts with their suppliers have better relative performance. These performance effects are enhanced by relationship-specific investments and are robust to corrections for endogeneity. Additionally, I examine the choice between vertical integration versus supplier-customer contracts and find that the choice is predicted by the type of RSI. Consistent with theory, RSI measured using tangible (intangible) assets are positively related to integration (contracts). Further, positive (negative) shocks to industry-level intangible investment are related to increases in a firm’s <b>contracting</b> <b>activity</b> and decreases (increases) in the level of vertical integration, while positive (negative) shocks to industry-level tangible investment are related to decreases in <b>contracting</b> <b>activity</b> and increases (decreases) in the level of vertical integration.
