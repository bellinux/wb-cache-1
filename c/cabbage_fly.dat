40|$|International audienceVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) {{released}} by plants {{are involved in}} various orientation processes of herbivorous insects and consequently {{play a crucial role}} in their reproductive success. In the context of developing new strategies for crop protection, several studies have previously demonstrated the possibility to limit insect density on crops using either host or non-host plants that release attractive or repellent VOCs, respectively. The <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> Delia radicum, is an important pest of brassicaceous crops for which control methods have to be implemented. Several studies have shown that plant odors influence <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> behavior, but only few VOCs have been identified so far. The present study aimed at selecting both plants and olfactory stimuli that could be used in the development of a "push-pull" strategy against the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly.</b> Olfactometer results revealed that plants belonging to the same family, even to the same species, may exhibit different levels of attractiveness toward D. radicum. Plants that were found attractive in behavioral observations were characterized by high release rates of distinct terpenes, such as linalool, β-caryophyllene, humulene, and α-farnesene.

The effect of various common organic pest control techniques was also measured. These techniques included: treatments with extract from neem (Azadirachta indica), potassium soap, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki toxins, application of a parasitic wasp (Trichogramma evanescens) and covering the crop with an agrotextile. Data were collected regarding the effect of cultivar selection and pest control technique on common local cabbage pests: cabbage flea beetle (Phyllotreta atra), <b>cabbage</b> <b>fly</b> (Delia brassicae), cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) and cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae).

40|$|<b>Cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> {{passes through}} three {{generation}}s {{a year in}} the south of England. The first generation peaks in late April to early May having overwintered in diapause. Recently, populations have been discovered in which the emergence of first generation flies was protracted, lasting until mid-July. The project aimed to investigate the incidence of late emergence in Devon and to examine the ways in which late emergers differed from early emergers in their progress through diapause. A new emergence trap was developed and used in conjunction with yellow water traps to monitor the emergence of <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> populations at locations of contrasting agricultural practice. Late emergence was widespread in Devon, occurring later (up to September), and in a greater proportion of some populations than any previously reported. The phenomenon appears to be a response to the planting of brassicas in June, as flies emerging at the normal time {{may not be able to}} locate a host crop. Emergence in a substantial proportion of one population was delayed for a year. This has not been been previously reported in <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> and represents a 'sit and wait' strategy associated with short-lived habitats, occurring in patches often separated by considerable distances but which frequently reappear in approximately the same location. A gas chromatography technique was developed which is capable of individually monitoring the respiration rates of large numbers of pupae. The results suggested that the temperature optimum for diapause development may r 1 se in late emergers, possibly above the threshold for postdiapause development. There was considerable 1 ntrapopulat 1 on variation in temperature responses. Overall, the results suggest that the level of variation in temperature response and emergence times between and within populations will require careful local investigation with continuous reassessment of selection pressures, for an accurate prediction of <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> emergence.

The first factors of disease are owed to unhealthy food and we cannot have a healthy food and a healthy organism if we do not remove from our food system the negative effects possessed by unhealthy food, even if it is not the cheapest option. From the products consumed by people, a very important role for producing the necessary energy for the organism is given to vegetables. Thus, we aimed the study of using decoctions obtained from the Aristolochia Clematitis plants which {{can be found in the}} spontaneous flora of Romania, unpretentious regarding the soil and which can combat one of the most frequent pests met in cabbage cultures: cabbage aphis (Brevicoryne brassicae L.), <b>cabbage</b> <b>fly</b> (Delia brassicae), cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae). The elimination of contact insecticides and chemical substances and obtaining healthier products are several purposes by using these methods. The obtained decoctions were made by combining three types of plant mixes in order to identify which component part is richer in aristolochic acid and which decoction gives better results for the combat of insects and to make a better comparison between them related to obtained results. There were taken soil samples from the six cultivars between planting cabbage seedlings for a better documentation. After the observations made on the whole period, the best results were obtained at cultivars 1, 3, 5, 6 where cabbage plants were treated with decoction obtained from the roots and where the whole plant combined with soap solution was used, followed by cultivars 2 and 4 where there was not used Aristolochia Clematitis plants. Because the results obtained were satisfied without using contact insecticides, a larger investigation of these decoctions follows using only Aristolochia Clematitis plants or in combinations with other plants which have very good results for ecological control of diseases and pests from vegetable cultures...|$|E

Batches of seed filmcoated with spinosad at five rates and imidacloprid at four rates, and also the combined products, were compared with a conventional post-planting treatment or with seed filmcoated with chlorpyrifos. Filmcoating with spinosad was ineffective at controlling flea beetle and cabbage aphid, whereas it gave a good control of <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> larvae and caterpillars at rates of 24 and 48 g a. i. per 100, 000 seeds.

In a pest management context, an appropriate selection of plants can modify pest distribution at the field scale. To develop a push-pull' strategy against the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> Delia radicum, we conducted a field study to both determine which plants exhibit contrasted pest infestation levels and to evaluate their influence on egg predation activity. Our field experiment reveals that infestation levels of brassicaceous plants by the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> in the field can vary considerably according to plant genotype and species, while the number of predated eggs is only slightly affected by plant species.

However, to date and after about 40 years of research, documented studies on applications in the field remain extremely scarce. Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> is a major pest of brassicaceous crops for which classical control strategies are currently lacking. Our previous studies showed that dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), a compound emitted by roots heavily infested by D. radicum larvae, was attractive for the flys main natural enemies and could lead to a reduction of 60 % in number of eggs laid on treated plants in the field. As a follow-up of this work, we conducted another field study to select additional volatiles that could be used in a pushpull approach. Several synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatiles, selected on the basis of their potential action on the behavior of both the fly and its natural enemies, were placed in odor dispensers in experimental broccoli plots and their influence on oviposition by D. radicum and egg predation by ground-dwelling predators was assessed. Our results confirmed the role of DMDS in reducing D. radicum egg numbers on broccoli plants and revealed that (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, a green leaf volatile released by recently damaged plants, strongly stimulated fly oviposition.

In one set of experiment, cabbage fields were surveyed and Steinernema affine, S. bicornutum, S. intermedium and S. feltiae were isolated. The presence of nematodes was correlated to pupal numbers of the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> D. radicum. The conclusion was that the presence of nematodes at cabbage plants did not reduce the number of pupae. Another approach was to quantify the proportion of larvae or pupae of D. radicum infected with entomopathogenic nematodes during the growing season. For that purpose a total of 6000 individuals were collected. Of these, only four isolates (S. feltiae) were obtained. This was in accordance with the above conclusion, that entomopathogenic nematodes under natural conditions only play a minor role in the mortality of D. radicum.

However, higher pupae/egg ratios were observed in the conventional compared to all organic systems, indicating that immature survival from oviposition to pupation was reduced under all the three organic farming practices. In organic system O 2 most small coleopteran predators were recorded, but predation on fly eggs was not significantly higher in organic treatments. Pupal parasitization rates ranged from 26. 5 % to 59. 5 %, but no significant differences among farming systems were found. Although reduced D. radicum survival could not be attributed solely to natural enemies, {{the results indicated that}} organic farming practices in general contribute to the suppression of belowground pests in cabbage production...|$|R
5000|$|This species {{resembles the}} closely related <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly</b> in {{appearance}} {{though it is}} slightly larger at seven to eight millimetres long. The body is light gray and the yellowish wings are transparent with yellow veins. Over most of its range, {{there is only one}} generation of this fly each year. The eggs are laid seven to ten days after the adult has emerged from the pupa. They are white and cigar-shaped and are laid in groups of thirty or forty eggs at the root collar of the host plant or on the ground nearby. Often several females lay eggs on one plant. The glossy white or yellow larvae hatch in five to fourteen days. They feed for about forty days, moulting three times, eating the young roots or tunneling into the main root of the host plant or even penetrating into the basal part of the leaves of hearting cabbage. The pupae are brown and about six millimetres in length. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the ground at a depth of five centimetres or more. The pupae can endure frosts of -33°C and in the following year the adults emerge at varying dates, doing so when the soil temperature reaches 18°C at the depth of the pupae.|$|R
40|$|Herbivorous insects {{identify}} their host plants either by structural features, chemical cues, or a combination. Some insects probe the host leaf prior feeding or oviposition, other species use olfactorial cues or compounds {{somewhere on the}} surface. Insects attacking Brassicaceae are no exception, some are attracted and stimulated by volatile isothiocyanates (ITC), many others depend fully on the non-volatile glucosinolates (GS) for host-plant recognition and acceptance. Since most insects {{have no access to}} the leaf interior investigators concluded that GS must be present on the leaf surface and ITC in the headspace. However, peelings of mechanically removed surface waxes were devoid of measurable amounts of GS, whereas solvent surface extractions revealed a correlation between stomatal conditions and GS concentrations. Both observations lead {{to the conclusion that the}} presence of GS on the top leaf surface is rather unlikely. In the experimental part we show that a chloroform/methanol/water (2 : 1 : 1 vol/ vol/vol) solvent leaf extract contains GS and, in addition, thia-triaza-fluorenes (TTF), other oviposition stimulants of the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> Delia radicum. Electrophysiological investigations showed that both, GS and TTF stimulated specific receptor neurones of the fly. We suggest that these compounds probably originated from deeper leaf layers and that herbivorous insects may penetrate the wax layer and perceive the stimulating compounds in deeper layers or through the stomata...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} several years, sulphur (S) {{deficiencies}} in agricultural crops have been reported with increasing frequency and therefore more interest has been directed into plant nutrition and fertilisation with particular respect to this element. In this context, special {{attention has been given}} to the economically important oilseed rape crop (Brassica napus), because of its high S need. Oilseed rape removes between 20 and 30 kg S/ha from the soil, corresponding approximately to double the demand of cereals. Until now, the effect of different S-supplies to plants in relationship to their pests has not attracted much attention. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of S-nutrition of rape on the preferences and performance of two main crucifer pests, the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera; Plutellidae) and the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> Delia radicum (L.) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae). The larvae of P. xylostella attack the aerial part while D. radicum infest the roots of numerous wild and cultivated plants belonging to the Cruciferae family. Since the larvae of both insects have only a limited capacity to select alternative plants or roots in the soil autonomously, their survival depends largely on the host choice made by the ovipositing female. To assess the effect of S plant nutrition on the oviposition behaviour, females of both insects were exposed to plants grown under three different S-regimes: S-free (S 0), normalS (Sn) and S-rich (S+) plants. In both insects the lack of S in the plant nutrient solution resulted in reduced oviposition, while differences between the two S fertilisation levels (normal and double field concentration) were smaller and not significant. In order to identify the plant characteristics influenced by S and perceived by the female insects, the ovipositional responses of the two crucifer pests were further tested by means of methanolic leaf surface extracts of the three types of B. napus. Using surrogate leaves treated with extracts of plants with an equivalent fresh weight, the same preferences were observed as in corresponding experiments with intact leaves, namely decreased oviposition in the absence of S. Also in both insects, the duration of larval development, from hatching to emergence, was significantly shorter and adults were heavier on Sn than on S 0 plants. Comparing these same two parameters in Sn and S+ plants, a somewhat shorter development time on plants rich in S was recorded, but again this trend was not statistically significant. Larval feeding preferences of the diamondback moth were tested in a dual choice assay, using leaf discs. A significantly higher number of larvae preferred leaf discs of Sn plants rather than those of S 0 plants. Further, the larvae preferred S+ to Sn discs. In the case of the <b>cabbage</b> root <b>fly,</b> the larval performance was evaluated using three additional intermediate sulphur levels between S 0 and Sn. The percentage pupation at the end of larval feeding ranged from 6...|$|R
