Most persons respond to oral therapy doxycycline, tetracycline hydrochloride, or <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate.</b> For initial treatment of severely ill patients, doxycycline hyclate may be administered intravenously. Remission of symptoms usually is evident within 48-72 hours. However, relapse can occur, and treatment must continue for at least 10-14 days after fever abates.|$|E
40|$|The global {{problem of}} {{advancing}} bacterial resistance to newer drugs {{has led to}} renewed interest {{in the use of}} <b>Chloramphenicol</b> <b>Palmitate</b> (C 27 H 42 Cl 2 N 2 O 6) [Palmitic acid alpha ester with D-threo-(-), 2 -dichloro-N-(beta-hydroxy-alpha-(hydroxymethyl) -p-nitrophenethyl) acetamide also known as Detereopal]. The characterization of the three polymorphic forms of <b>Chloramphenicol</b> <b>Palmitate</b> (CPP) was done spectroscopically by employing FT-IR and FT-Raman techniques. The equilibrium geometry, various bonding features, and harmonic wavenumbers have been investigated for most stable form A with the help of DFT calculations and a good correlation was found between experimental data and theoretical values. Electronic properties have been analyzed employing TD-DFT for both gaseous and solvent phase. The theoretical calculation of thermodynamical properties along with NBO analysis has also been performed to have a deep insight into the molecule for further applications...|$|E

Two different methods of dissolution profile comparison were used: ANOVA, {{and an independent}} model. Differences between the formulations were reflected in the dissolution profiles. The presence of metastable polymorphs or amorphous forms of <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate</b> might be responsible for variations in the concentration of the drug observed within formulations...|$|E

40|$|A {{pharmaceutical}} active compound, <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate,</b> {{appears in}} three polymorphic forms, {{that can be}} observed at room temperature. The stable form A (biologically inactive modification), the meta-stable form B (active modification) and unstable form C {{were found to have}} distinct Raman spectra, with bands attributable to the different polymorphs. The use of hot-stage Raman microscopy (the direct coupling of Raman microscopy and hot-stage) is demonstrated for the drug substance <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate</b> form C. All modifications of form C were produced and identified by hot-stage Raman microscopy. A close correlation of thermal and spectroscopic information was achieved by this combination of techniques. As reported in several pharmacopoeias, the content of form A should be less than 10 %; therefore, a mixture of 10 % (w/w) A in B was prepared, and the presence of the characteristic bands of form A after subtraction of the pure B was revealed. Moreover, mixtures between 2 and 12 % (w/w) A in B were investigated and the intensity ratio (as peak area) I 413 – 435 /I 1035 – 1158 as a function of A percentage has been demonstrated to show a linear trend. Other methods for the characterization of polymorphs were used: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the haemotoxic effect of orally {{administered}} <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate</b> (CAP) and the possible countering effect of multivitamin-haematinic complex (MVH) on chloramphenicol-induced anaemia was conducted using rabbits as the animal model. Twenty male rabbits were used in this study. They were randomly divided into four groups of five rabbits each according to the drug administered. Rabbits in group A were administered with 0. 9 % physiological saline; group B rabbits were administered with chloramphenicol only while rabbits in group C were given combination of chloramphenicol and MVH. Rabbits in group D were administered with MVH only. <b>Chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate</b> was administered at dosage of 50 mg kg - 1, 6 h interval per day {{for a period of}} three weeks. Chemiron ® was the source of multivitamin- haematinics used in this study and 5 mL of the syrup was administered thrice daily for the same period of time. All the administration of drugs was done orally. Blood samples were collected from the rabbits in all the groups on the 7 th, 14 th and 21 st of drug administration. Peripheral blood parameters such as the Red Blood Cell count (RBC), Packed Cell Volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) and White Blood Cell count (WBC) were evaluated. The haemotoxic effect of CAP was evident from the 7 th day to the 21 st day of drug administration with the lowered haematological values of rabbits in group B when compared with those of the rabbits in control group A. Statistical comparison shows that the differences of the means of group A and B were significant for RBC (p< 0. 01), PCV (p< 0. 05) and Hb (p< 0. 05) on day 7; for RBC (p< 0. 001), PCV (p< 0. 001) and Hb (p< 0. 01) on day 14; for RBC (p< 0. 001), PCV (p< 0. 001) and Hb (p< 0. 05) day 21. The administration of MVH to the rabbits in group D produced higher mean haematological values for the group compared with the mean values of the control group A and these changes were only significant for RBC (p< 0. 05), PCV (p< 0. 05) and MCH (p< 0. 05) on day 21. The rabbits of group C administered with MVH and CAP exhibited significantly lower levels of PCV (p< 0. 05) on day 7, RBC (p< 0. 01) PCV (p< 0. 01) and Hb (p< 0. 05) on day 14 relative to the values obtained in the control group A. This study further confirmed the anaemic side effect of chloramphenicol and it also established the limitations of haematopoietic micronutrients in reducing or ameliorating this anaemic effect especially during prolonged administration of chloramphenicol...|$|E
40|$|Solid dispersions of <b>chloramphenicol</b> <b>palmitate</b> and dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) {{have been}} {{produced}} both as copreci-pitate and physical mixtures. The dissolution behavior of both forms were compared with pure chloramphenicol palrnitate st different weight ratios of chloramphenicol palrnitate-lecithin (liposomal system); as well as various pH. The dissolution characteristic of physical mixtures for different weight ratios of chloramphenicol palmitate-lecithin {{was similar to the}} pure drug. Whereas, the coprecipitates produced a 2. 8 fold greater initial dissolution rate (1 DR) and a 2. 4 fold greater drug release concentration after 60 min at a chloramphenicol palmitatc-lecithin weight ratio of 19 : 1. However, lecithin content enhancement to 9 : 1, 4 : 1 and 1. 5 : 1 compositions, resulted in a further increase of 6 %, 21 %. and 24 %. respectively in the initial dissolution rate. In&not;creasing the lecithin content shows only a slight increase (8. 5 &deg;c) on drug release after 60 min when, the chloramphenicol palrnitate lecithin weight ratio was 1. 5 : 1. However, other weight ratios did not show any effect on the improvement of drug release after 60 min. I he effect of pH of the medium on dissolution was slight, but varied with composition of the system. "nIn conclusion, liposome encapsulation of chloramphenicol palmitale has a significant effect on dissolution improvement of this drug...|$|E
