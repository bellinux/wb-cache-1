The system was developed {{over two years}} by a multidisciplinary team, which involved researchers, manufacturers and consultants. An integrated approach has been the key element to design and prototype {{an innovative}} double cavity drywall façade, composed by plasterboard layers and blown-in <b>cellulose</b> <b>flakes,</b> with and without {{a thin layer of}} Phase Change Material.

40|$|People in industrialised {{countries}} spend approximately 80 % {{of their}} time indoors. As such, the internal environment quality can {{have a significant impact}} on occupant health and wellbeing. Additionally, the demand for increased building energy efficiency has the potential to degrade Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) through a reduction of air exchange rates. In many forms of construction, the walls and ceilings are plastered, providing a large surface area exposed to the indoor environment. There is a growing recognition of the important role this surface may have on IAQ through regulation of relative humidity. Another, less well known, impact is that porous coatings have the potential to adsorb Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from the air, which offers further potential to improve IAQ. This paper presents work from the development of a novel bio-based plaster with improved hygrothermal performance and VOC sorption characteristics. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>flakes,</b> used for blown insulation, were added into a cement-lime substrate in three different proportions. A range of mechanical, hygrothermal, VOC emission and VOC adsorption properties were investigated to evaluate the potential of the bio-based cement-lime plaster to improve IAQ. The bio-based cement-lime plaster resulted in an improved thermal conductivity and an improvement in the material’s moisture buffering capacity and VOC adsorption capacity. With 5 % addition of <b>cellulose</b> <b>flakes,</b> the hygrothermal performance increased by over 25 %. This material also showed the ability to capture VOCs and formaldehyde from the air, reducing the concentrations of these compounds by up to 22 % and 70 % respectively. Therefore, the impact of the implementation of this plaster includes potential benefits regarding better operational performance of the building and improved occupant health and wellbeing...|$|E

40|$|Evolved gas {{analysis}} of unplasticised <b>cellulose</b> diacetate <b>flake</b> and plasticised <b>cellulose</b> diacetate film (Clarifoil) {{was carried out}} {{as part of an}} assessment of the potential hazard that could occur as a result of overheating these materials during processing. In order to perform this work, a simple apparatus for heating a sample and introducing the evolved gases into a FTIR gas flow cell was constructed. These measurements were supplemented by thermogravimetry as part of separate experiments. Studies of the infrared spectra and thermogravimetric data showed that both materials degrade above 250 °C generating carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and acetic acid. In addition, Clarifoil releases a significant amount of plasticiser (diethyl phthalate) between 100 and 250 °C. Since its flash point is 160 °C, the potential fire hazard of this material needs {{to be taken into account}} during any processing operation which could reach this temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigated}} food packings {{consist of}} an outer layer of cardboard, a laminate adhesive and biodegradable plastics as the inner layer. Polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol, Polyviol), polyhydroxy butyrate (Biopol), <b>cellulose</b> acetate (<b>Flake</b> type, Dexel type), cellulose nitrate, cell glass and polycaprolactone (Tone Polymer) as the plastic component {{as well as}} SiO_x as additional coating have been considered and tested {{on the basis of}} national standards and the EU 'draft synoptic document 5 on plastics materials and articles intended to come into contact with food stuffs'. The results of the conducted investigations, including sensoric evaluations after long-term storage, demonstrated that the prototype packings for dried food developed in the frame of this project are of almost equal value as current original food packings.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that organic {{materials}} may be susceptible to attack from a range of fungal organisms and any bio-based material used in locations where there is the possibility of microbiological activity must be expected to be able to withstand or prevent such attack. There are a wide range of test methods and standards in place to test susceptibility although most of these test individual components such as wood or panel material. A wide range of old and new bio-based materials and novel construction techniques are showing an increase in use in new building and in the restoration of old buildings. These materials need to be assessed against microbial activity to determine if they are suitable for use in a particular area. Standard wood decay test methods are widely known and would seem applicable to many of the materials being used â�� especially where wood based products are used. However, due to their structure certain testing problems can arise. This paper seeks to test a variety of building materials, including sheepâ��s wool, mineral wool, hemp, wood fibre, <b>cellulose</b> <b>flakes</b> and assess the suitability of the testing regime on these materials. The method selected was the wood panel testing method DD ENV 12038, with some modifications to measure the extent of fungal growth as well as decay. The results show that although there was significant growth of the fungi through test samples only the lignocellulosic materials showed any appreciable decay. It was also noted that for some of the samples the structure of the material e. g. very thick or particulate fill, made the test sub-optimal...|$|E
40|$|AimsTo {{reveal the}} {{microbial}} communities from Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau wetland soils {{that have the}} potential {{to be used in the}} utilization of cellulosic and chitinous biomass at low temperatures (25 degrees C). Methods and ResultsSoil samples collected from six wetlands on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were supplemented with or without <b>cellulose</b> and chitin <b>flakes,</b> and anaerobically incubated at 25 and 15 degrees C; high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was used to access the composition and localization (in the slurry and on the surface) of enriched microbial communities; a hypothetical model was constructed to demonstrate the functional roles of involved microbes mainly at genus level. Overall, microbial communities from Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau wetlands showed significant potential to convert both cellulose and chitin to methane at low temperatures; Clostridium III, Clostridium XIVa, Paludibacter, Parcubacteria, Saccharofermentans, Pelotomaculum, Methanosaeta, Methanobrevibacter, Methanoregula, Methanospirillum and Methanosarcina participated in methanogenic degradation of both cellulose and chitin through the roles of hydrolytic, saccharolytic and secondary fermenters and methanogens respectively. Acetotrophic methanogens were mainly enriched in the slurries, while hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be both in the slurries and on the surface. ConclusionsThe composition and localization of microbial communities that could effectively convert cellulose and chitin to methane at low temperatures have been revealed by high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing methods, and reviewing the literatures on the microbial pure culture helped to elucidate functional roles of significantly enriched microbes. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study will contribute to the understanding of carbon and nitrogen cycling of cellulose and chitin in cold-area wetlands and provide fundamental information to obtain microbial resources for the utilization of biomass wastes at low temperatures...|$|R
