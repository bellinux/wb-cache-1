Motion of an observer relative to the object also refreshes cell responses.

Besides using the post-fabrication approaches, the current spreading layer can also be obtained by in situ epitaxial growth in the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system. Important examples are as follows: the short-period p-GaN/i-InGaN superlattice structure between multiple quantum wells (MQWs) structure and the p-GaN layer [22, 23], the tunnel junctions [24, 25], and barrier junctions [10]. Nevertheless, reports on epi-structures to improve the current spreading for DUV LEDs can be rarely found. In this letter, we propose using p-AlGaN/n-AlGaN/p-AlGaN (PNP-AlGaN) layer to better spread the lateral current for DUV LEDs. The PNP-AlGaN structure can generate the energy barrier in the valence band of the p-type hole injection layer. The energy barrier can modulate the electrical resistivity for the p-type hole injection layer, and therefore, the current flow path can be tuned. By properly designing the PNP-AlGaN current spreading layer, the EQE, the wall-plug efficiency (WPE), and the forward voltage can be improved. Furthermore, this work also comprehensively investigates {{the sensitivity of the}} current spreading, the EQE, the WPE, and the forward voltage to the PNP-AlGaN loop, the Si doping concentration, the thickness, and the AlN composition for the inserted n-AlGaN layer of the PNP-AlGaN architecture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Experts in peptide:MHC binding {{studies are}} often able to {{estimate}} {{the impact of a}} single residue substitution based on a heuristic understanding of amino acid similarity in an experimental context. Our aim is to quantify this measure of similarity to improve peptide:MHC binding prediction methods. This should help <b>compensate</b> for <b>holes</b> and bias in the sequence space coverage of existing peptide binding datasets. Results Here, a novel amino acid similarity matrix (PMBEC) is directly derived from the binding affinity data of combinatorial peptide mixtures. Like BLOSUM 62, this matrix captures well-known physicochemical properties of amino acid residues. However, PMBEC differs markedly from existing matrices in cases where residue substitution involves a reversal of electrostatic charge. To demonstrate its usefulness, we have developed a new peptide:MHC class I binding prediction method, using the matrix as a Bayesian prior. We show that the new method can compensate for missing information on specific residues in the training data. We also carried out a large-scale benchmark, and its results indicate that prediction performance of the new method is comparable to that of the best neural network based approaches for peptide:MHC class I binding. Conclusion A novel amino acid similarity matrix has been derived for peptide:MHC binding interactions. One prominent feature of the matrix is that it disfavors substitution of residues with opposite charges. Given that the matrix was derived from experimentally determined peptide:MHC binding affinity measurements, this feature is likely shared by all peptide:protein interactions. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of the matrix as a Bayesian prior in an improved scoring-matrix based peptide:MHC class I prediction method.

The thermal conductance develops a small peak at the energy of Fano antiresonance state, which {{can be interpreted as}} follows: when the system is in the antiresonance state, current associated with electrons is compensated by current associated with holes tunneling in the opposite directions, leading to a zero conductance.

In addition, {{two different types of}} cation layers are observed in the unit cell. The Fermi surface (FS), which can be regarded as a network of <b>compensated</b> electron and <b>hole</b> orbits according to band structure calculations at room temperature, turns to a set of two alternating linear chains of orbits at low temperature. The field and temperature dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations spectrum have been studied up to 54 T. Eight frequencies are observed which, in any case, points to a FS much more complex than predicted by band structure calculations at room temperature, even though some of the observed Fourier components might be ascribed to magnetic breakdown or frequency mixing. The obtained spectrum could result from either an interaction between the FS's linked to each of the two cation layers or to an eventual additional phase transition in the temperature range below 200 K.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Ni-doping on the {{magnetism}} and superconductivity in Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 Fe 2 As 2 {{has been studied}} through a systematic investigation of magnetic and superconducting properties of Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 (Fe 1 -xNix) 2 As 2 (x = 0, 0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 08 and 0. 12) compounds by means of dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities, electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements. Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 Fe 2 As 2 is known to exhibit superconductivity with superconducting transition temperature Tc as high as 33 K. The Ni-doping leads to a rapid decrease in Tc; Tc is reduced to 23 K with 3 % Ni-doping, and 8 % Ni-doping suppresses the superconductivity to below 1. 8 K. In 3 % Ni-doped sample Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 (Fe 0. 97 Ni 0. 03) 2 As 2 superconductivity coexists with short range ordering of Eu 2 + magnetic moments at Tm ~ 6 K. The suppression of superconductivity with Ni-doping is accompanied {{with the emergence of}} a long range antiferromagnetic ordering with TN = 8. 5 K and 7 K for Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 (Fe 0. 92 Ni 0. 08) 2 As 2 and Eu 0. 5 K 0. 5 (Fe 0. 88 Ni 0. 12) 2 As 2, respectively. The temperature and field dependent magnetic measurements for x = 0. 08 and 0. 12 samples reflect the possibility of a helical magnetic ordering of Eu 2 moments. We suspect that the helimagnetism of Eu spins could be responsible for the destruction of superconductivity as has been observed in Co-doped EuFe 2 As 2. The most striking feature seen in the resistivity data for x = 0. 08 is the reappearance of the anomaly presumably due to spin density wave transition at around 60 K. This could be attributed to the compensation of holes (K-doping at Eu-site) by the electrons (Ni-doping at Fe site). The anomaly associated with spin density wave further shifts to 200 K for x = 0. 12 for which the electron doping has almost <b>compensated</b> the <b>holes</b> in the system.

40|$|Nitrogen doping in {{graphene}} {{has important}} implications in graphene-based devices and catalysts. We have performed the density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structures of N-doped graphene with vacancies and Stone-Wales defect. Our results show that monovacancies in graphene act as hole dopants and that two substitutional N dopants are needed to <b>compensate</b> for the <b>hole</b> introduced by a monovacancy. On the other hand, divacancy does not produce any free carriers. Interestingly, a single N dopant at divacancy acts as an acceptor rather than a donor. The interference between native point defect and N dopant strongly modifies the role of N doping regarding the free carrier production in the bulk pi bands. For some of the defects and N dopant-defect complexes, localized defect pi states are partially occupied. Discussion {{on the possibility of}} spin polarization in such cases is given. We also present qualitative arguments on the electronic structures based on the local bond picture. We have analyzed the 1 s-related x-ray photoemission and adsorption spectroscopy spectra of N dopants at vacancies and Stone-Wales defect in connection with the experimental ones. We also discuss characteristic scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images originating from the electronic and structural modifications by the N dopant-defect complexes. STM imaging for small negative bias voltage will provide important information about possible active sites for oxygen reduction reaction. Comment: 40 pages, 2 tables, 16 figures.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} observations {{indicate that}} bulk $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $ (~ 200 nm thick), an insulator {{at room temperature}} and pressure, must act as a good electronic conductor during thermionic cathode operation, leading to the observed high emitted current densities and overall superior emission properties over conventional thermionic emitters which do not contain $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $. Here, we employ ab initio methods using both semilocal and hybrid functionals to calculate the intrinsic defect energetics of Sc and O vacancies and interstitials and their effects on the electronic properties of $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $ {{in an effort to}} explain the good conduction of $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $ observed in experiment. The defect energetics were used in an equilibrium defect model to calculate the concentrations of defects and their <b>compensating</b> electron and <b>hole</b> concentrations at equilibrium. Overall, our results indicate that the conductivity of $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $ solely due to the presence of intrinsic defects in the cathode operating environment is unlikely to be high enough to maintain the magnitude of emitted current densities obtained from experiment, and that presence of impurities are necessary to raise the conductivity of $Sc_ 2 O_ 3 $ to a high enough value to explain the current densities observed in experiment. The necessary minimum impurity concentration to impart sufficient electronic conduction is very small (approximately $ 7. 5 x 10 ^{- 3 }$ ppm) and is probably present in all experiments...|$|R
