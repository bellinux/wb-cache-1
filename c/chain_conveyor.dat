500|$|On November 6, 1928, an {{electronic}} news ticker {{known as the}} Motograph News Bulletin (colloquially known as the [...] "zipper") was introduced near {{the base of the}} building. The zipper originally consisted of 14,800 light bulbs, with the display controlled by a <b>chain</b> <b>conveyor</b> system inside the building; individual letter elements (a form of movable type) were loaded into frames to spell out news headlines. As the frames moved along the conveyor, the letters themselves triggered electrical contacts which lit the external bulbs (the zipper has since been upgraded to use modern LED technology). The first headline displayed on the zipper announced Herbert Hoover's victory in that day's presidential election. The zipper was used to display other major news headlines of the era, and its content later expanded to include sports and weather updates as well. On the evening of August 14, 1945, the zipper was famously used to announce Japan's surrender from World War II to a packed crowd in Times Square.|$|E
2500|$|Longwall mining {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored <b>chain</b> <b>conveyor</b> or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E

These conveyors must typically interface with other types of conveyors such as cross-transfer conveyors, and also with other material-handling equipment such as lift tables and hold tables. Micromodeling of <b>chain</b> <b>conveyors</b> and their equipment interfaces requires close attention to numerous details. These details include not only static and operational properties of the <b>chain</b> <b>conveyors</b> themselves, but also the particulars of dimensional and operational interfaces of the conveyors and the equipment served by the conveyors, such as lift tables and the conveyor acceleration and deceleration ramps. In this paper, we first delineate the situations in which micromodeling of material-handling equipment is appropriate. We then present an overview of conveyor types and terminology. Next, we describe the challenges of modeling <b>chain</b> <b>conveyors</b> accurately, and our recommendations for meeting these challenges within the framework of typical modeling tools and simulation-study contexts. As an example, we present details of these recommendations relative to the AutoMod modeling tool. In conclusion, we summarize these recommendations and indicate promising directions for further development of modeling techniques and enhancement of model-building tools. 1 MACRO- VS. MICRO-MODELING Macro models are, by definition, over-view models with a &quot;coarse &quot; level of detail. In contrast, micro models incorporate a &quot;fine &quot; (high) level of detail (Ülgen, Shore, and Grajo 1994). The appropriate level of detail for a particular model within a simulation study, and hence the decision of whether to build a macro or a micro model, properly depends on the objectives of the study, availability o...|$|R
