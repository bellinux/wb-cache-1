40|$|The {{economic}} and technological developments {{have led to}} a growing international demand for highly skilled human resources. The increased competition for human capital has determined numerous countries to take special measures for attracting and retaining human capital in such fields as: information technology, biotechnology, marketing, management, and health care. These measures have stimulated the economic imigration of skilled professionals, especially from less developed to more developed economies. In this study we analyse the implication of the expats presence in Romania employeed on full-time jobs, individual working contracts and of the expats involved on economic, profesional or <b>comercial</b> <b>activities.</b> imigration, expatriates, integration of imigrants, permanent residence rights, organizational assistance...|$|E
40|$|This paper dicusses {{the parking}} demand and {{supply in the}} central {{district}} of Nana. Occupylng only 5. 4 per cent, or 200 ha., of the total planned area of the city, the district is most heavily populated {{in the city and}} busiest in <b>comercial</b> <b>activities</b> all over Okinawa. Most of the important streets originate or cross the district. As of September of 1966, surveys were carried out to find out 1) available parking spaces in the district of which curb parking and parking lots were the main sources, 2) characteristics in the use of parking lots, and 3) number of vehicles stored in the district during the day time on an average weekday,Saturday, and Sunday. Cordon counts were performed at eighteen locations distributed along the circumference of the district. The locations are shown by triangles in Fig. 1. Important results from the surveys are shown in the figures and tables presented elsewhere in this paper of which Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5,T able 1, and Table 2 are of more importance. Some of the important conclusions drawn from the discussion in this paper are listed in the following. 1) As of September of 1966, there were about thirty to fourty parking lots in the city all of which run by private owners. There was no slngle parking garage or parking lots operated by any govermental organization. 2) parking spaces available in the thirty-four parking lots studied were about 29, 230 square metres or 1183 in vehicle number, of which 754 were in the district. Spaces available for curb parking in the district were 2074 in vehicle number. 3) Parking demands on a weekday, Saturday, and Sunday were found as follows. (表については省略) 4) Comparison between the parking demands and the spaces available in the district as stated above indicates that the district has enough parking spaces. 5) However. due to increasing traffic regulations and the presence of unbalance between geological distribution of demand and supply, it seems difficult to expect that all of the available curb parking apaces in the district are or will be used effectively. It is the writer's belief that to bring good balance between them not only in the district concerned, but also in the city as a whole it is a must of today for govermental functions to establish a parking plan which is well integrated in a comprehensive traffic plan for the city. Above conclusions were derived based on the specific conditions and limitations described in the paper. therefore any one who would refer to any part of the conclusions is expected to understand those conditions and limitations and not to use them beyond the range wherein the study is valid...|$|E
40|$|Robinson Mall Development {{has led to}} {{distribution}} of commercial activities and services {{in the city of}} Bandar Lampung. During this time, trading activities and services focused in the downtown area, is in The Tanjung Karang Pusat (TKP). So, centralization of <b>comercial</b> <b>activity</b> in TKP, led of many vehicles heading downtown and that have an impact on traffic congestion in the area of city center. Centralization of economic activity, such as mall, supermarket, traditional and modern market, etc, has caused problem in traffic in the TKP. Problem solving such as widening of roads and arrangements of parking, is not able to resolve the issue. So, it needed others solution to decrease traffic problem in TKP, one of solution is spread of <b>comercial</b> <b>activity</b> (IB Ilham Malik, 2013). That is mean, if there is a new application of permit to build shopping center or mall or modern market, city government will be give the permit if location of project outside of TKP area. For example; at Kemiling area, Way Halim area, Rajabasa area, Teluk Betung area, etc. Spread of commercial activity in Bandar Lampung relevan with regulation (regional regulation or Perda) on Spatial Planning, that is Perda No. 04 Year of 2004 on Spatial Planning of Bandar Lampung, and updated by Perda No. 10 Year of 2011 on the same thing. So, in line with the regulation, in some of areas in Bandar Lampung have comercial center too, such as Robinson Mall in the Rajabasa area, Boemi Kedaton Mall in Kedaton Area, Giant Supermarket and Giant Mall in Kemiling area and Antasari area, etc. And that situation, encourage of area growth and in the future will be the <b>comercial</b> <b>activity</b> area...|$|R
