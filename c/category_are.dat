5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the two types of}} classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each one has a specific definition in relation to the National Register. All but the eponymous district <b>category</b> <b>are</b> also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the family}} size of student, four <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> defined. The first <b>category</b> <b>was</b> “Less {{than or equal to}} 4 members”, second <b>category</b> <b>was</b> “ 5 to 6 members”, third <b>category</b> <b>was</b> “ 7 to 8 members” and the fourth <b>category</b> <b>was</b> “ 9 members and above”.

5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between <b>category</b> <b>are</b> able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E
5|$|Sachs later added a fifth category, electrophones, such as theremins, {{which produce}} sound by {{electronic}} means. Within each <b>category</b> <b>are</b> many subgroups. The {{system has been}} criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by ethnomusicologists and organologists.|$|E
5|$|The Echo Music Awards {{are granted}} {{every year in}} Germany by the Deutsche Phono-Akademie (an {{association}} of recording companies).

The winners in the pop <b>category</b> <b>are</b> announced in March, the winners in the classical category in October. Winehouse won two awards from three nominations.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a {{complete}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> {{in which all}} small limits exist. That <b>is,</b> a <b>category</b> C <b>is</b> complete if every diagram F : J → C where J is small has a limit in C. Dually, a cocomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> one in which all small colimits exist. A bicomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> which <b>is</b> both complete and cocomplete.|$|R

The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display the best times and scores in each event.|$|E
5|$|Each award {{consists}} of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award <b>category</b> <b>are</b> etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is met through individual donations and fundraising events.|$|E
5000|$|In mathematics, a {{skeleton}} of a <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a subcategory which, roughly speaking, does not contain any extraneous isomorphisms. In a certain sense, the {{skeleton of a}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "smallest" [...] equivalent category which captures all [...] "categorical properties". In fact, two <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> equivalent {{if and only if}} they have isomorphic skeletons. A <b>category</b> <b>is</b> called skeletal if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.|$|R

5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid <b>category</b> <b>are</b> the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|Films {{that are}} {{eligible}} for the Best Foreign Language Film <b>category</b> <b>are</b> able to compete for other Academy Awards {{if they had been}} commercially released in Los Angeles County and fulfill the requirements of the categories they are participating in. Among the foreign language films that have won Academy Awards outside the Best Foreign Language Film category, six have won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Gate of Hell was the recipient of an Academy Honorary Award.|$|E
5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this <b>category</b> <b>are</b> generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E
50|$|A fifth {{category}} and a sixth <b>category</b> <b>were</b> developed later.

5|$|In the city, {{all schools}} under the National Education System (government {{education}} institution <b>category),</b> <b>are</b> {{managed by the}} Kuching Combined Education Office (Pejabat Pelajaran Gabungan Kuching). There are many government or state schools {{in and around the}} city. Like other Malaysian schools, schools in the city are divided into four levels of education — pre-school, primary, secondary (lower and upper) and post-secondary (excluding tertiary). Among the well-established and prestigious boarding schools in the city is Sekolah Menengah Sains Kuching, which is located at Batu Kawa. Other secondary schools including some of the oldest and well known are St.Joseph, St.Thomas, St.Teresa and St.Mary as well as others like Sekolah Menengah Kai Chung, SMK Batu Lintang, and SMK Padungan. Kuching has 4 out of 14 Chinese independent schools in Sarawak. These are Chung Hua Middle School No. 1 (古晋中华第一中学), Chung Hua Middle School No. 3 (古晋中华第三中学), Chung Hua Middle School No. 4 (古晋中华第四中学) and Batu Kawa Min Lit secondary school (石角民立中学). There are also two international schools in Kuching namely Tunku Putra International School and Lodge International School. Other private schools in Kuching are Sunny Hill School and St Joseph Private Schools.|$|E
5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon (USAD) is an American {{academic}} {{competition for}} high school students. The United States Academic Decathlon National Championship, first held in 1982, pits winners {{at the state level}} against each other for a national title. The Academic Decathlon consists of 10 events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech. The Super Quiz replaces one of the seven objective events; since 2003, it has alternated between replacing science and social science. The Academic Decathlon requires participation from students of all levels of academic ability; teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Though teams consist of nine members (three from each category), only the top two individuals from each <b>category</b> <b>are</b> counted in the final team score. Each student has the possibility of scoring up to 10,000 points, for a combined team score of 60,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this <b>category</b> <b>are</b> the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E

Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.|$|E
