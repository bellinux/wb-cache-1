30|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{pertinent}} and important question facing clinicians is {{how best to}} diagnose SIPE. In keeping with the other differential diagnoses such as respiratory disorders, clinical diagnostic accuracy is confounded by the poor predictive value of what are essentially non-specific symptoms [11]. Indeed, it appears that generally the rule of two thirds seems to apply; specifically, haemoptysis or at least blood tinged sputum is present in approximately two thirds of SIPE cases, pulmonary auscultation reveals crackles in two thirds, oxygen saturation is reduced in two thirds and a chest radiograph is abnormal in two thirds of cases [12]. A more <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> almost <b>universal</b> feature is the complete resolution of symptoms in under 48  h. More recent reports highlight the value of point-of-care testing, including ultrasound to identify pulmonary interstitial fluid accumulation [13]. The role of other diagnostic tests or biomarkers {{is yet to be}} established, but there is evidence that obvious go-to biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction are not elevated in individuals presenting with SIPE [14]. Regardless, it is clear that a currently unmet need is a diagnostic questionnaire or screening tool for SIPE.|$|R

40|$|Our work is {{motivated}} by three trends. First, the ubiquitous migration of services to the World Wide Web {{is due in part}} to its simple, <b>consistent,</b> <b>and</b> now <b>universal</b> user interface: navigation by following links and filling out HTML forms are interactions familiar to even novice Internet users. Second, client-side extension technologies such as Java and JavaScript allow sites to extend and “personalize ” the behaviors and interfaces of their services, with portable user-interface elements that integrate transparently into the browser’s existing interface. Finally, there has been a recent surge of interest in proxymediated access to the Web, in which proxy agents in the network infrastructure provide caching [1], anonymize user requests [2], or accelerate Web access via datatype-specific lossy compression [3, 4, 5]. Recent results show that these services can be built scalably and cost-effectively, and can shield the user from the limitations of their Internet connections or client platforms. Not surprisingly, the services have become increasingly powerful and therefore parameterizable and customizable by each user, resulting in increased attention on the design and implementation of the user interface by which the service can be controlled [8...|$|R

It {{needs to be}} clinically relevant, robust, and prospective, and must incorporate epidemiological variables. The 10 -Group Classification System (TGCS) is a simple method providing a common starting point for further detailed analysis within which all perinatal events and outcomes can be measured and compared. The system is demonstrated in the present paper using data for 2013 from the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Interpretation of the classification can be easily taught. The standard table can provide much insight into the philosophy of care in the population of women studied and also provide information on data quality. With standardization of audit of events and outcomes, any differences in either sizes of groups, events or outcomes can be explained only by poor data collection, significant epidemiological variables, or differences in practice.

40|$|We analyse {{the results}} of a 5. 5 -yr {{photometric}} campaign that monitored 247 southern, semi-regular variables with relatively precise Hipparcos parallaxes to demonstrate an unambiguous detection of Red Giant Branch (RGB) pulsations in the solar neighbourhood. We show that Sequence A' contains a mixture of AGB and RGB stars, as indicated by a temperature related shift at the TRGB. Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic sequences are compared in several ways to show that the P-L sequence zero-points have a negligible metallicity dependence. We describe a new method to determine absolute magnitudes from pulsation periods and calibrate the LMC distance modulus using Hipparcos parallaxes to find μ (LMC) = 18. 54 +- 0. 03 mag. Several sources of systematic error are discussed to explain discrepancies between the MACHO and OGLE sequences in the LMC. We derive a relative distance modulus of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) relative to the LMC of Δμ = 0. 41 +- 0. 02 mag. A comparison of other pulsation properties, including period-amplitude and luminosity-amplitude relations, confirms that RGB pulsation properties are <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> <b>universal,</b> indicating that the RGB sequences are suitable as high-precision distance indicators. The M giants with the shortest periods bridge the gap between G and K giant solar-like oscillations and M-giant pulsation, revealing a smooth continuity as we ascend the giant branch.

40|$|By now, {{research}} has painted a coherent {{picture of the}} characteristics and motivations of the citizens supporting Radical Right parties. Nevertheless, {{one of the most}} <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> characteristics of the Radical Right electorate has remained puzzling: the considerable overrepresentation of men among these parties’ voters in virtually all countries and at all elections. This ‘gender gap’ – which can substantially constrain parties’ electoral success – could only be partially explained by typical models of Radical Right voting. This suggests that conventional accounts do not fully grasp all aspects of electoral behavior. This dissertation systematically investigates the causes of the overrepresentation of men in the Radical Right electorate, in a range of European countries, {{from the point of view}} of various models of voting behavior. It shows that men’s and women’s differing socio-economic conditions play a role in shaping the gap, but mainly so among socio-economically more left-wing Radical Right parties. No evidence was found that suggests that men are more likely to agree with the Radical Right’s ideology. New data collection does show, however, that men are less likely than women to be deterred by both the social stigma and the ongoing association with prejudice that surround many Radical Right parties. Indeed, the last chapter shows that men are systematically more likely to vote for extreme or stigmatized parties of any political color. This dissertation proposes we can better comprehend gendered voting patterns and further increase our understanding of the Radical Right electorate by combining socio-structural, attitudinal and socio-psychological models...|$|E

40|$|Synthesis of {{operational}} behaviour {{models from}} scenario-based specifications {{has been extensively}} studied. Focus has been mainly on either existential or universal interpretations. Existing model synthesis techniques use traditional two-valued behaviour models such as Labeled Transition Systems (LTS). We propose a scenario-based language that supports both existential <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> interpretations for conditional scenarios. We show that LTS are not sufficiently expressive to accommodate such languages and shift the target of synthesis to Modal Transition Systems (MTS), an extension of LTS that can distinguish between required, unknown and proscribed behaviour to capture the semantics of existential <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> scenarios. MTSs support elaboration of behaviour models through refinement, which complements an incremental elicitation process suitable for specifying behaviour with scenario-based notations. The synthesis algorithm that we define constructs an MTS that uses refinement to characterise all the LTS models that satisfy a mixed, conditional existential <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> scenario-based specification. In order to capture all permissible implementations, model MTSs of component based systems are given at the system level. However, iterative refinement by engineers is often more convenient at the component level. We {{address the problem of}} decomposing partial behaviour models from a single monolithic model to a component model. We prove that a sound and complete distribution can be built when the MTS to be distributed is deterministic, transition modalities are <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> the LTS determined by its possible transitions is distributable. We show how this combination of scenario language, synthesis, MTSs, and distribution supports behaviour model elaboration. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) began during the 20 th century in most industrialized countries, where CHD is {{a leading cause of}} mortality among adults. 1 Developing countries show the beginnings of the same epidemic. Reliable information on population incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality rates of CHD is essential to understanding, treating, and controlling the epidemic but is generally unavailable. <b>Consistent</b> <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> definitions of cases of CHD allow the determination of rates and comparisons within and between populations. These case definitions are essential to epidemiological studies and other research, such as clinical trials, quality assurance, and economic analysis of healthcare costs. The need for standardization is clear, and this statement recommends updated definitions. Definitions of cases for epidemiology studies and clinical trials in acute CHD rest on World Health Organization (WHO) (1959) and American Heart Association (1964) reports, followed by the WHO European AMI Registry criteria. 2, 3 Myocardial infarction (MI) is based on cardiac symptoms, ECG changes, and/or elevation in biomarkers. This basic system has been widely used but variably interpreted, resulting in a lack of comparability among and within studies. Further specification and working definitions of CHD come from the Framingham Study. 4 The WHO criteria were revised in a joint report with the International Society and Federation of Cardiology in 1979. 5 More recently, the WHO MONICA Study 6 and other surveillance and intervention studies, such as the Lipid Research Clinics in the United States, 7 have modified further the definition of CHD cases. These changes are usually based on a greater specification to the original WHO definition to allow for application in different settings.

40|$|Objectives Provision of person-centred generalist {{care is a}} core {{component}} of quality primary care systems. The World Health Organisation believes {{that a lack of}} generalist primary care is contributing to inefficiency, ineffectiveness and inequity in healthcare. In UK primary care, General Practitioners (GPs) are the largest group of practising generalists. Yet GPs fulfil multiple roles and the pressures of delivering these roles along with wider contextual changes create real challenges to generalist practice. Our study aimed to explore GP perceptions of enablers and constraints for expert generalist care, in order to identify what is needed to ensure health systems are designed to support the generalist role. Design Qualitative study in General Practice. Setting UK primary care. Main outcome measures A qualitative study – interviews, surveys and focus groups with GPs and GP trainees.

40|$|Gift-giving and the {{acceptance}} of gifts in the South African public sector is a controversial issue. The bestowal of a gift may generate a negative public perception of corrupt behaviour. Gift-giving and the framework that governs it varies from country to country, together with what {{can be regarded as}} acceptable. There is a delicate balance between what is interpreted as a mere gift or donation, or whether the objective of the bestowal is to seek a benefit, create a relationship or to generate an understanding of quid pro quo, or sense of beholdenment, which will benefit the giver privately. This is deemed a bribe, irrespective of what it is called. As corruption is rife in the South African public sector the abuse of public power for private gain is a problematic issue that needs special attention. The current existing legislative framework in South Africa is fragmented and does not provide public servants with clear, comprehensive or adequate guidance relative to {{the acceptance}} of gifts. The multiple ambiguities in legislative instruments make it unfeasible and impossible for an auditor or enforcement agency to establish links between gifts and corrupt practices; the overlaps create loopholes, of which corrupt officials take advantage. It is therefore deemed imperative that the existing South African legislative instruments, which currently govern and manage {{the acceptance of}} gifts, be assessed and evaluated, in an endeavour to establish best practices in supervising gift-giving to public officials. It is crucial for South Africa to fight corruption, and an essential element of this is the necessity of strengthening the controls which prevent and identify corrupt activities in the Public Service. Through comparisons drawn it is apparent that the legislative framework regarding the acceptance of gifts should be reviewed, and possibly consolidated into one guideline or code, then implemented nationally in the Government sector. This would result in clarification, with a single, <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> set of rules across the government sector, with which public servants must comply. A possible solution has been proposed, whereby if an unsolicited gift is received it is shared or distributed between all employees; if everyone benefits equally, it may lessen the perception that the gift was intended to influence the action of a single employee.

40|$|Today, the {{operator}} is insufficiently supported at the machine tool while correcting or optimizing machining programs. These programs only describe {{a sequence of}} simple toolpath and switching commands to be executed by a numerical control. They do not provide any planning information, like working steps, features or operations to {{the operator}}. Based on this poor level of information he can hardly review the machining process. The consequences are errors while generating, editing or optimizing machining programs in the shop-floor. At runtime the machining program cannot be changed. There are only few parameters and variables {{which can be used}} for process manipulation at runtime. A programmed toolpath or a selected tool can only be changed after stopping program execution. This causes downtimes at the machine tool and high costs. Even if these downtimes can be compensated in mass pro-duction by a larger quantities of parts, the lack of consistency between planning data and ma-chining program limits the feedback of changes and optimizations at the NC. In a first step this thesis analyzed these deficits and defined the requirements of NC pro-gramming, operator support and manipulatable program processing. On the part of programming these requirements focus a solution, providing <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> information from planning to machining that reflects the process understanding of the operator. Inside the numerical control this information shall be used to display the machining progress and geometry, to parameterize monitoring and control systems according to the actual operation and to offer enhanced manipulation routines in order to optimize the process at runtime. Universal, task oriented NC-programming interface. The information retrieval was solved by developing and standardizing a data model that contains both complete planning data and control oriented commands. The result is a comprehensive, hierarchically structured description of machining jobs. The jobs are defined in so called Workingsteps which are listed in Workplans. Each Workingstep consists of a geometry to be machined (e. g. a Feature) and an Operation specifying which Strategy, Technology parameters and Tool shall be used. In addition explicit Toolpaths and NC-Functions can be defined within the Operation in order to precisely predetermine how to machine the part and when to activate or deactivate the machine’s functions. The level of detail depends on the requested degree of optimization and the availability of functions to compile toolpaths and commands autonomously inside the numerical control. In addition it permits to migrate step by step from a conventional numerical control and its detailed commands to a more flexible system that can process features based on the given operations, tools and machine data. The developed solution permits {{for the first time the}} universal use of NC programs from planning to numerically controlled machining. Specific formats, like APT, CL-DATA or G-codes which convert and simplify the planning information are not necessary any longer. At the machine tool the operator can access at any time an understandable description of the machining task, geometry and operation. The information constantly provided from planning allows manipulating even complex NC programs at the machine tool. Hence NC programs can be corrected or optimized more easily and fast with less risk of wrong codes or misunderstandings. The exchangeability of the programs and the advantages for the user were successfully demonstrated based on the realized prototypes and evaluated with industrial partners...|$|E
