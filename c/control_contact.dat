40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{analytical}} formulation of the dynamical behaviour of complex and open physical systems which is formulated on the total thermodynamic phase space using the contact form associated with Gibbs' relation. Starting from balance equations we construct <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> systems by using the entropy function to represent the thermodynamic properties. The contact Hamiltonian function generating the dynamical behaviour has then the units of an entropy variation. We consider complex thermodynamic systems, described by compartmental systems, and we construct the associated <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> system by composing the <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> formulation of every compartment. The contact Hamiltonian functions generating the dynamical behaviour are discussed with respect to two alternative formalisms used for describing coupled sets of reversible and irreversible processes, namely the GENERIC formulation and the Matrix formulation. This analysis is then illustrated on the elementary example of a coupled mechanical and thermodynamic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we suggest {{a class of}} quasi-port Hamiltonian systems called Irreversible port Hamiltonian Systems, that expresses {{simultaneously}} {{the first and second}} principle of thermodynamics as a structural property. These quasi-port Hamiltonian systems are defined with respect to a structure matrix and a modulating function which depends on the thermodynamic relation between state and co-state variables of the system. This modulating function itself is the product of some positive function and the Poisson bracket of the entropy and the energy function. This construction guarantees that the Hamiltonian function is a conserved quantity and simultaneously that the entropy function satisfies a balance equation containing an irreversible entropy creation term. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we suggest a lift of the Irreversible Port Hamiltonian Systems to <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> systems defined on the Thermodynamic Phase Space which is canonically endowed with a contact structure associated with Gibbs' relation. For this class of systems we have suggested a lift which avoids any singularity of the contact Hamiltonian function and defines a <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> system on the complete Thermodynamic Phase Space, in contrast to the previously suggested lifts of such systems. Finally we derive the formulation of the balance equations of a CSTR model as an Irreversible Port Hamiltonian System and give two alternative lifts of the CSTR model to a <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> system defined on the complete Thermodynamic Phase Space...|$|E

Such systems systematically arise in models established in Chemical Engineering. The differential-geometric {{of these systems}} is a contact form {{in the same manner}} as the symplectic 2 -form is associated to Hamiltonian models of mechanics. In this paper we study the feedback preserving the geometric structure of controlled contact systems and renders the closed-loop system again a contact system. It is shown that only a constant control preserves the canonical contact form, hence a state feedback necessarily changes the closed-loop contact form. For strict contact systems, arising from the modelling of thermodynamic systems, a class of state feedback that shapes the closed-loop contact form and contact Hamiltonian function is proposed. The state feedback is given by the composition of an arbitrary function and the <b>control</b> <b>contact</b> Hamiltonian function. The similarity with structure preserving feedback of input-output Hamiltonian systems leads to the definition of input-output contact systems and to the characterization of the feedback equivalence of input-output contact systems. An irreversible thermodynamic process, namely the heat exchanger, is used to illustrate the results...|$|E

This is of importance when performing complex tasks in unstructured environment, particularly in humanoid robot applications. The proposed multicontact control framework provides {{a new way of}} defining the operational space coordinates, which facilitates the specification of multiple <b>contact</b> <b>control.</b> The <b>contact</b> force space on multiple links is constructed as an operational space for the highest priority task. Motion control, given lower priority, can be executed using the rest of degree of freedom within the null-space of the force control.

This dynamic decoupling enables each contact force controller to utilize linear control theories. In particular, the contact force controllers adopt full state feedback control and estimation methods to produce robust performance with respect to modeling and parameter uncertainties.
