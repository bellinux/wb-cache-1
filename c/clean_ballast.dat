40|$|Ballast is most {{commonly}} used as a structural component of rail track due to its high load bearing capacity, resiliency and rapid drainage. However, ballast along coal freight corridors often becomes fouled due to spilling of coal from moving wagons, in addition to further track deterioration attributed to particle breakage and pumping of soft subgrade.

It is known how the proper operation of a ballast track bed may be undermined {{by the presence of}} fine-grained material which can fill progressively the voids between the ballast aggregates and affect the original strength mechanisms. This occurrence is typically defined as "fouling". To this effect, a square-based methacrylate tank was filled with ballast aggregates in the laboratory environment and then silty soil (pollutant) was added in different quantities. In order to simulate a real-life scenario within the context of railway structures, a total of four different ballast/pollutant mixes were introduced from 100 % <b>ballast</b> (<b>clean)</b> to highly-fouled (24 %). GPR systems equipped with different air-coupled antennas and central frequencies of 1000 MHz and 2000 MHz were used for testing purposes. Several processing methods were applied in order to obtain the dielectric permittivity of the ballast system under investigation. The results were validated using the "volumetric mixing approach" (available within the literature) as well as by performing a numerical simulation on the physical models used in the laboratory. It is important to emphasize the significance of the random-sequential absorption (RSA) paradigm coupled with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique used during the data processing.

40|$|Railways {{offer an}} {{efficient}} and economic transport mode {{in many countries}} including Australia, China and USA. Conventionally, rail tracks are positioned on ballast due to several potential benefits, including economy (availability and abundance), rapid drainage and high load bearing capacity. However, the ballast becomes contaminated due to intrusion of pumped subgrade material (e. g. clay and silt). This {{is one of the}} primary reasons for rapid track deterioration. In severe circumstances, fouled ballast needs to be cleaned or replaced to maintain the desired track resiliency, load bearing capacity and the track alignment, all of which influence the level of safety. In Australia, massive amount of funds have been invested in track maintenance. By employing an effective maintenance program, both cost and the ballast quarrying can be reduced with significant favourable environmental implications and improved productivity. In order to identify the risk associated with fouling, it is important to accurately assess the amount of fouling. In this paper, the current methods commonly used for evaluating the degree of ballast fouling were critically examined and a new parameter, Void Contaminant Index (VCI) was proposed to capture the role of different fouling materials in terms of volume based air-voids reduction.

This paper presents characterization of rail track subsurface to identify ballast fouling and subsurface layers shear wave velocity using seismic survey. Seismic surface wave method of multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) {{has been carried out}} in the model track and field track for finding out shear wave velocity of the <b>clean</b> and fouled <b>ballast</b> and track subsurface. The shear wave velocity (SWV) of fouled ballast increases with increase in fouling percentage, and reaches a maximum value and then decreases. This character is similar to typical compaction curve of soil, which is used to define optimum and critical fouling percentage (OFP and CFP). Critical fouling percentage of 15 % is noticed for Coal fouled ballast and 25 % is noticed for clayey sand fouled ballast. Coal fouled ballast reaches the OFP and CFP before clayey sand fouled ballast. Fouling of ballast reduces voids in ballast and there by decreases the drainage. Combined plot of permeability and SWV with percentage of fouling shows that after critical fouling point drainage condition of fouled ballast goes below acceptable limit. Shear wave velocities are measured in the selected location in the Wollongong field track by carrying out similar seismic survey. In-situ samples were collected and degrees of fouling were measured. Field SWV values are more than that of the model track SWV values for the same degree of fouling, which might be due to sleeper’s confinement. This article also highlights the ballast gradation widely followed in different countries and presents the comparison of Indian ballast gradation with international gradation standards. Indian ballast contains a coarser particle size when compared to other countries.

40|$|The United State Federal Railway Administration (FRA, 2010) {{estimates}} that the demand for rail freight transportation (tonnage) will increase 88 % by 2035. North American railroads spend about $ 3. 4 billion every year on track substructure maintenance and renewal due to track-component degradation (Li et al. 2004). These increases in traffic density and weight will cause more deformation and, consequently, more maintenance of the ballast layer. An alternative method in order to decrease maintenance cost is desirable. One such method is injection of polyurethane resin at critical locations in the ballast. This method is effective on <b>clean</b> <b>ballast</b> as a preventive measure (Keene at al. 2012). This study is aimed at evaluating its effectiveness in remediating fouled ballast through polyurethane injection <b>clean</b> <b>ballast</b> was mixed with various types of fouling at different amounts, water contents, and sealed in rectangular (76 mm x 76 mm x 290 mm) and cylindrical (254 mm x 508 mm) molds. The polyurethane was injected into the molds and the specimens were cure for 24 hours. Testing protocol was developed to quantify plastic deformation, flexural strength, and unconfined compressive strength of the fouling ballast stabilized by polyurethane. Average flexural strength of PSB (938 kPa) is about 35 % greater than the average flexural strength of PSFB (611 kPa). The average UCS strength of the PSB specimens (3200 kPa) is {{greater than that of}} the PSFB specimens (2713 kPa). However, PSFB has a greater strength (about 74 %) than unstabilized <b>clean</b> <b>ballast.</b> The PSFB cylindrical specimen with different FI and WC under cyclic loading with deviator stress, ?d of 350 kPa, the plastic strains vary between 0. 9 % - 1. 02 %, which are under the FRA limit for maintenance (2. 5 % - 3 %) (Hesse, 2013, Keene et al. 2012). The results show that the injection of polyurethane into fouled ballast significantly reduces plastic strain and increases strength. Increasing amounts of fouling material and water content reduces strength and increases plastic strain.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringEric J. FitzsimmonsThe rail industry's recent {{shift towards}} larger and heavier railcars has {{influenced}} Class III / short line railroad operation and track maintenance costs. Class III railroads {{earn less than}} $ 38. 1 million in in annual revenue and generally operate first and last leg shipping for their customers. In Kansas, Class III railroads operate approximately 40 percent of the roughly 2, 800 miles (4, 500 km) of rail; however, due to the current Class III track condition they move lighter railcars at lower speeds than Class I railroads. The State of Kansas statutorily allots $ 5 million to support rail improvement projects, primarily for Class III railroads. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to conduct an inventory of Kansas’s Class III rail network to identify the track segments in need of this support that would be most beneficial to the rail system. Representatives of each railroad were contacted and received a survey requesting information regarding the operational and structural status of their systems. The data collected were organized and processed to determine the sections of track that can accommodate the heavier axle load cars that are currently being utilized by Class I railroads. This study identified that Class III railroads shipped over 155, 000 carloads of freight in 2016 and 30 percent of Kansas’s Class III track can currently accommodate heavy axle cars. The increased load from the increased railcar size has also increased the risk of damage to railroad’s track structure. Railroad ballast is the free draining granular material that supports the track structure. As the track ages, small particles can fill the voids of the granular material which is a process known as fouling. Established methods for determining the fouling of a section of ballast are destructive tests that usually require the railroad to restrict or reroute traffic on its network. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a nondestructive geophysical surveying method that measures the time required for electromagnetic wave impulses to reflect off differing subsurface interfaces. Historically, GPR surveys of track structures primarily determine the depth of ballast and track geometry. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the viability of utilizing the laboratory’s existing GPR equipment to develop a methodology of measuring ballast fouling nondestructively. A 48 x 48 x 48 in (1. 2 x 1. 2 x 1. 2 m) test box was built. The test box was filled with 48 in (1. 2 m) of <b>clean</b> and <b>ballast.</b> Tests were run on dry and partially saturated material, wetted using 6 gallons (22. 7 L).

GPR scans and samples to determine the water content were collected after the addition of each gallon. The data collected were processed to determine soil properties. Preliminary results from this research indicate that the GPR set up utilized can effectively determine the dielectric constant of geologic materials including ballast, although the dielectric constant is highly dependent on the volumetric moisture content of the material...|$|R
40|$|The {{railway track}} network plays an {{essential}} role of the transportation infrastructure worldwide. During operations, the ballast becomes contaminated or fouled due to the infiltration of fines from the surface, mud pumping up from the subgrade, and ballast degradation under repeated train loading. In Queensland and New South Wales, Australia, ballast degradation and infiltration of fine particles such as coal and soft subgrade fills the voids in the ballast layer, which restricts drainage, and results in uneven track settlement and high maintenance costs to <b>clean</b> the <b>ballast.</b> Geosynthetics have been increasingly used in railroads to provide reinforcement and confinement pressure to the layer of ballast. However, the interaction mechanism and behaviour of the geosynthetics and ballast at their interface are not well understood, particularly when the ballast is severely fouled. This {{is due to the}} steady accumulation of fine particles that clog the apertures of the geosynthetics, which dramatically reduces its beneficial effects and also causes track instability associated with substantial deformation. This research aims to study how the interface between ballast and geogrid copes with fouling by coal fines. The shear stress-displacement behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast, and ballast reinforced with geogrids was investigated through a series of large-scale direct shear tests where the levels of fouling ranged from 0 % to 95 % Void Contamination Index (VCI), and at relatively low normal stresses varying from 15 kPa to 75 kPa. The results indicated that inclusion of geogrids increases the shear strength and apparent angle of shearing resistance, while only slightly reducing the vertical displacement of the composite geogrid-ballast system. However, when the ballast was fouled by coal fines, the benefits of geogrid reinforcement decreased in proportion to the increasing level of fouling. A conceptual normalised shear strength model was proposed to predict this decrease in the peak shear stress and peak angle of shearing resistance caused by coal fines at a given normal stress. A novel Track Process Simulation Apparatus (TPSA) was used to simulate realistic rail track conditions subjected to cyclic loading and the Void Contamination Index (VCI) was used to evaluate the level of ballast fouling. The inclusion of geogrid at the interface between the layer of ballast and sub-ballast provides additional internal confinement and particle interlocking via the geogrid apertures, which reduces deformation. A threshold value of VCI= 40 % has been proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance. If the level of fouling exceeds this threshold the geogrid reinforcement significantly decreases its effectiveness, and the fouled ballast exhibits pronounced dilation. Based on the experimental results, an equation incorporating VCI was proposed to predict the deformation of fresh and fouled ballast. This equation improves track design and assists in making appropriate and timely decisions on track maintenance. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to study the shear behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast in direct shear testing. The volumetric changes and stress-strain behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast were simulated and compared with the experimental results [...] Fouled ballast with various Void Contaminant Index (VCI), ranging from 20 %VCI to 70 %VCI, were modelled by injecting a specified number of miniature spherical particles into the voids of fresh ballast. The DEM simulation highlights the fact that the peak shear stress of the ballast assembly decreases and the dilation of fouled ballast increases with an increasing of VCI. Furthermore, the distribution of contact force chains and particle displacement vectors clearly explains the formation of a shear band and the evolution of volumetric change during shearing. An acceptable agreement was found between the DEM simulation and laboratory data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Railroad ballast is the uniformly-graded {{aggregate}} {{between and}} underneath railroad ties. The purpose of ballast {{is to provide}} support for the heavy loading applied by trains. New ballast contains significant void space between the aggregate. As ballast ages it is progressively fouled by fine-grained material that fills the void space. The structural integrity of seriously fouled ballast can be compromised leading to track instability and ultimately, train derailments. For this reason {{it is very important}} to be able to detect fouled ballast. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been used over the past 25 years for ballast evaluation and has yielded mixed results. Traditionally, GPR data have been interpreted with strategies focusing on reflections from layer interfaces. This can be a severe handicap when obtaining data on a ballast structure which contains gradational fouling. GSSI developed a 2 GHz horn antenna in 2003 which was initially tested on ballast at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. in Pueblo, CO in 2005 and subsequently on Amtrak Rails near Boston, MA in 2006. It was noted that the antenna is much more focused compared to the commonly used 1 GHz horn antenna and provides data that contain significant scattering energy from the void space in <b>clean</b> <b>ballast.</b> The data from fouled ballast contained minimal scattering from the remaining void space. Comparison of the data obtained using the 2 GHz antenna with available ground truth supports this interpretation.

The spectral analysis {{is based on the}} power spectral density (PSD) as an indicator of frequency content. This method was developed and tested at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc., in Pueblo, Colorado. The system provides an efficient means for monitoring track bed to predict settlement and deformation conditions that would require maintenance. The method relies on a triaxial piezoelectric accelerometer inserted into a permanently installed inclinometer casing installed into the subgrade. Periodic measurement of the dynamic ground response allows for the identification of changes in the small strain elastic properties of the substructure layers. The methodology uses conventional downhole seismic shear wave velocity testing. For the purpose of comparison, test sections were constructed with clean and fouled ballast. Shear wave velocities indicated the differences in material properties. PSDs of the signals were analyzed to determine variation resulting from differences in soil conditions. PSDs were calculated at different intervals of loading. With increased loading, settlement of the subtrack soils occurs. The densification can be seen as an increase in the predominant frequency of the PSD. The PSD from the section with the <b>clean</b> <b>ballast</b> had a higher predominant frequency than the PSD from the section with the fouled ballast. A decrease in predominant frequency over time would indicate the decrease in stiffness and the potential of increased fouling of the ballast with fines. Changes in the frequency content would indicate changes in elastic response...|$|E
40|$|Ballast fouling {{is created}} by the {{breakdown}} of aggregates or outside contamination by coal dust from coal trains, or from soil intrusion beneath rail track. Due to ballast fouling, the conditions of rail track can be deteriorated considerably {{depending on the type}} of fouling material and the degree of fouling. So far there is no comprehensive guideline available to identify the critical degree of fouling for different types of fouling materials. This paper presents the identification of degree of fouling and types of fouling using non-destructive testing, namely seismic surface-wave and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. To understand this, a model rail track with different degree of fouling has been constructed in Civil engineering laboratory, University of Wollongong, Australia. Shear wave velocity obtained from seismic survey has been employed to identify the degree of fouling and types of fouling material. It is found that shear wave velocity of fouled ballast increases initially, reaches optimum fouling point (OFP), and decreases when the fouling increases. The degree of fouling corresponding after which the shear wave velocity of fouled ballast will be smaller than that of <b>clean</b> <b>ballast</b> is called the critical fouling point (CFP). Ground penetrating radar with four different ground coupled antennas (500 MHz, 800 MHz, 1. 6 GHz and 2. 3 GHz) was also used to identify the ballast fouling condition. It is found that the 800 MHz ground coupled antenna gives a better signal in assessing the ballast fouling condition. Seismic survey is relatively slow when compared to GPR survey however it gives quantifiable results. In contrast, GPR survey is faster and better in estimating the depth of fouling.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of the hydraulic fracturing technique, used extensively in the United States, for {{oil and natural gas}} extraction, has significantly expanded the frac sand market and impacted freight rail corridors. This growth in the freight rail sector is expected to raise the operation and maintenance costs for the railroads due to the increase in heavy axle loads (HAL), traffic in million gross tons per year (MGT), and fouling from surface spillage. The impact of heavy axle loads has been studied in some detail; however, it is unknown how infiltration of frac sand into the ballast affects the deformation behavior of the track structure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent that frac sand infiltration and subsequent moisture retention in the ballast structure increases deformation as compared to <b>clean</b> <b>ballast.</b> Three ballast, and three frac sand samples were used in this study, of which the following basic properties were characterized: particle size distribution, mineralogy classification, particle shape, bulk density, void ratio, particle shape, hydraulic conductivity, and soil water characteristic curves. These properties were used to optimize the large-scale cyclic triaxial (LSCT) test method. The results of HAL tests show an increased rate of strain accumulation averaging 0. 07 %/MGT for every 30 kip car load increase. The results of the surface spillage tests show an average increased rate of strain accumulation averaging 0. 05 %/MGT, 0. 13 %/MGT, and 0. 31 %/MGT for AREMA ballast # 24, # 4 A, and # 5 respectively, for a 7 % increase in gravimetric water content. The results of the WiscRail? modeling shows similar results to the HAL and ballast type LSCT results. As the load increases, the maintenance cycles increased 50 % to 100 %. The type of ballast was simulated in the model and for AREMA # 24, # 4 A and # 5, the maintenance cycles increased from 50 % to % 300 percent, respectively. Both the LSCT and WiscRail? model results show that the two primary factors governing ballast and frac sand behavior are the load amount and the ballast type...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary This project {{includes}} {{the use of}} expanding rigid polyurethane foam to remediate substructure deficiencies in railroad track at a field site in Illinois. Soft substructure soils exhibit creep or consolidation that lead to excess track settlement. Cyclic loading from passing trains can fail the subgrade, with progressive cyclic shear failure. Track settlement and progressive shear failure were found at a field sites in Dayton, Illinois. Following a geotechnical and geophysical investigation of the sites, URETEK USA planned a polyurethane injection strategy to compress the subgrade soils and permeate the subballast layer. Polyurethane injection was compared to traditional railroad maintenance with a Life-Cycle Cost Analysis and Life-Cycle Analysis. Due to weather and scheduling difficulties, the injection results will be appended and included in a final, updated report. A full-scale prototype model is often the ideal simulation of the final product for field application. Therefore, in geotechnical engineering, different models are developed to test proposed construction methods, interaction between elements, and field performance. Areas where experimental products are used in full-scale applications, and that are constructed with traditional equipment and techniques, are invaluable to researchers and industry alike. The prototyped product can be evaluated in real-world conditions, where not all variables can be closely controlled. Laboratory tests, while important, cannot replicate porewater distributions and soil heterogeneity in the environment where the product is proposed for use. The expanding rigid polyurethane enhanced ballast research began in 2011 with Keene (2012) investigating the performance of <b>clean</b> <b>ballast</b> injected with polyurethane (PUR) in a collaboration of with UW-Madison and URETEK USA. PUR strengthened the ballast layer in both compression and flexural tests. Dolcek (2013) investigated the same PUR, but with injection into ballast with varying amounts of fouling (fine) materials and water content. Similar to Keene (2012), the mechanical behavior was enhanced in both compression and flexural, but flexural performance of fouled ballast was below that of the <b>clean</b> <b>ballast.</b> Enhancement of the ballast layer was proven over repeated experiments with different ballast types and gradations and resulted in the motivation to test this technology in the field. A railroad track site was chosen in Dayton, Illinois, for which fraccing sand is transported to test {{the performance of a}} substructure deficient section of railroad injected with PUR. This spur line receives fully loaded unit trains on a near daily basis. Car switching and train assembly (putting cars in proper positions for transportation) occurs here as well. The track borders the Fox River, and there are substructure problems with: soft soil, settlement, and embankment failures along this stretch of track. To clarify what the contributing underlying problems are at the track field site, the ?Dayton Dip,? geotechnical and geophysical investigations were conducted. URETEK USA/ICR provided Dynamic Cone Penetrometer logs, which give an indication of soil strength. The UW-Madison team conducted Ground Penetrating Radar, Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Time Domain Reflectometry, and excavated test pits to take samples to run engineering property tests in a laboratory setting. The data from these different tests collectively verified the hypothesis of a highly fouled ballast layer, with a soft saturated clay subgrade beneath. There were classic subgrade shear failures along the track and at bridge approaches; i. e., the ?bump {{at the end of the}} bridge? in which an abrupt change in track stiffness causes differential settlement. The investigation assisted in the design of two types of polyurethane injection: one to strengthen the subballast and one to strengthen and stiffen soft subsurface material. With URETEK USA?s background in polyurethane injection for infrastructure projects, including rail crossings, their expertise was necessary in designing a functional and economical injection package. The injection was proposed as a combination of subballast layer strengthening and URETEK Deep Injection (UDI) to strengthen and stiffen the subgrade. Due to imposed restrictions of the railroad, PUR could not be placed within 30 cm of the bottom of the tie. The evaluation of polyurethane injection included mobilization and construction costs, track stiffening, maintenance, and environmental impact. Fast construction time decreases user costs and inconveniences. Furthermore, environmental impact has become an important consideration in construction projects. Polyurethane injection can fulfill these metrics. A life-cycle cost analysis was conducted with inputs from URETEK and Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, over a ten-year period. Over a 10 -year period, PUR injection appears to be a superior improvement methodology to traditional maintenance resulting in a cost savings from $ 1000 - $ 20, 000 depending on discount rate. In the life-cycle analysis, PUR injection results in use of water, and CO 2 emissions, 82 %, and 5 % respectively, compared to traditional maintenance methods. After the ongoing portion of this project are completed, various instruments and techniques will be used to monitor the rail section. To measure the dynamic properties and track modulus, strain gauges will be used to measure the cumulative strain in the super-structure and sub-structure of the track. Survey reflectors will be installed every 2 m on both sides of the rail to measure settlement and differential settlement between rails. Finally, settlement rods will be installed to isolate the response of different layers and their corresponding contribution to the permanent deformation in the railroad track. An un-injected control section will be also instrumented to compare results and assess PUR effectiveness. Due to schedule constraints (e. g., early onset of cold weather in 2014), the injections were not completed before the completion of this thesis. Therefore, when the pilot study is completed and analyzed, results will be appended, and a final, updated report issued to the project sponsors. Included in the Appendix are laboratory tests of environmental impacts on polyurethane stabilized fouled ballast and rigid polyurethane foam. Freeze-thaw cycling was conducted; degradation was tracked and tested with non-destructive methods and cyclic triaxial testing. No effect was determined after 20 -freeze-thaw cycles. Long term water absorbance of polyurethane foam was investigated. Samples were submerged for 120 -days then tested in unconfined compression. Minimal, approximately 3 %, changes were seen from ideal polyurethane samples. The results from freeze-thaw cycling and water absorbance indicate that PUR will remain stable in field conditions...|$|E
