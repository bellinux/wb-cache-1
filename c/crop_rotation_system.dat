Galician Poles resented the government for its apathy in handling disease; a typhus epidemic claimed 400,000 lives between 1847 and 1849, and cholera killed over 100,000 in the 1850s. Galicia suffered a potato blight between 1847 and 1849, similar to Ireland's famine at the same time, but relief was never reached because of political and geographical isolation. A railroad system connecting Poland began reaching West Galicia from 1860 to 1900, and railroad tickets cost roughly half a farmhand's salary at the time.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agronomy) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. A {{two year}} {{experiment}} (2004 - 2005) {{was conducted at}} the Tygerhoek Experimental Farm near Riviersonderend in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The effect of different <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> on soil properties, disease and insect pests, weed populations, wheat growth, yield and quality in the wheat crop phase, included in these <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems,</b> was determined. This trial {{was part of a}} long term <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> experiment started in 2002. This trial was laid out as a block design with four replications. <b>Crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> included wheat, barley, canola, lupins and pasture phases which consisted of medics and clovers planted collectively. Soil samples were taken at each replication for N-incubations for determination of mineral N (NO 3 - -N plus NH 4 + -N) at 0 - 150 mm soil depth. A basic soil chemical analysis was done at 0 - 150 mm and 150 - 300 mm soil depths, respectively. Each sub-plot (replication) consisted of a 3 m 2 block that was divided into a 1. 5 m 2 block for harvest and smaller 0. 25 m 2 blocks for samples that were taken at different growth stages throughout both seasons. Dry mass and nitrogen (N) content of different plant components, leaf area index, disease symptoms and pest damage were recorded from each sample. Trends in basic soil chemical properties mostly differed between <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> during different seasons while similar trends in soil mineral nitrogen occurred. Highest soil mineral N levels occurred after one or two consecutive years of pasture while levels after a lupin phase were disappointingly low in both seasons. These high soil mineral N levels showed similar trends to wheat grain quality and some wheat yields, while the most influencing factors on wheat grain yield were probably soil physical properties. Soil mineral N after canola was high during plant after which levels were much lower than many other <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems.</b> This occurrence will probably need a re-evaluation of N fertilizing programs if the same trends are found in similar, but longer trials. Lolium spp. was the most prominent weed that occurred in both seasons at some <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> seemingly with no direct effect from <b>crop</b> <b>rotation.</b> Highest disease incidence mainly from Septoria spp. and Puccinia spp. occurred, particularly in wheat/wheat rotations, except for Puccinia which showed high ratings of disease symptoms in all <b>crop</b> <b>rotations</b> in the drier 2004 season. Lower ratings occurred in <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> when wheat was preceded by nonwheat crops. Insect pest damage showed no similar trends indicating no direct effect of <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> on these pests and/or effective control from applied pesticides in both seasons. It was concluded that climate {{was one of the most}} influencing factors affecting differences and seem to be the main cause for different trends found between these two seasons in similar <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems.</b> A similar trial with longer duration than this one is thus needed to obtain conclusive trends.

50|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the open}} field system had {{initially}} used a two-field <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture {{for a time}} to try to recover some of its plant nutrients. Later they employed a three-year, three field crop rotation routine, with a different crop in each of two fields, e.g. oats, rye, wheat, and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans, and the third field fallow. Normally from 10-30% of the arable land in a three <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> is fallow. Each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands. The planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the bacteria on legume roots' ability to fix nitrogen (N2) from the air into the soil {{in a form that}} plants could use.

Therefore,the usefulness of fallow green manure cropping is pointed out. But, {{from the fact that}} it is a non commodity crop, positioning in regard to crop selection farmers is low. So, bidding which is directed to its fixation is necessary. In this paper, we will explore the elucidation of introduction fixation conditions of fallow green manure cropping in large-scale upland farming. The focus of this paper, Sarabetsu village in the Tokachi region, is a typical example of largescale upland farming. First, frequency and continuity of fallow green manure cropping of upland farming were rearranged. As a result, we can see that similar types such as "continuation" "discontinuance" "non continuation", clearly showing the differences in cropping conduct. Second, based on field investigations, the primary factors of introduction fixation of fallow green manure cropping are made clear; 1) The recognition of improvements for the <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>system,</b> 2) The necessity of guaranteeing a yearly gross income, and, 3) Present scale and existence of scale enlargement conditions. Third, the crop selection of large-scale upland farming, making use of linear programming, was modeled and appraised. When obedience of the <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> is designated as a purpose, fallow green manure cropping selection occurred according to the area. It was selected in the 5 - 10 % of the total area when it was present. Fourth, comparison of the profitability with fallow green manure cropping was conducted. Although it caused profit decreases, the cost decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, per area income showed the fact that there is little overall difference. From the results above, 3 points were given as a fallow green manure introduction fixation conditions. First, introduction makes farm working adjustments possible, making the obedience of crop rotation possible. Under present conditions, recognition of the management for wheat repeated cultivation has influenced fallow green manure cropping introduction. Because of that, recognition improvement of the problems which occur with repeated cultivation is necessary. Second, it is important to consider,as clearly shown by analysis, that fallow green manure cropping does not always reduce profits, but that its overall impact is negligible. Third, it is large-scale farming with which fallow green manure cropping introduction has rationality, and the introduction ratio is 5 - 10 % of the cropping acreage. It is also necessary for such bidding to be done.

How to scale up in situ observations from flux tower sites to regional and global scales is a challenging task. In this study, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) and satellite images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP during 2001 – 2005 at five maize cropland sites located in Nebraska and Minnesota of the U.

These sites have different <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> (continuously maize vs. maize and soybean rotated annually) and different water management practices (irrigation vs. rain-fed). The VPM is based on the concept of light absorption by chlorophyll and is driven by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and air temperature. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM agreed well with GPP estimates from eddy covariance flux tower data over the period of 2001 – 2005.
