2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; <b>cambric,</b> popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|E

50|$|He was apprenticed in Bristol to Walter Stephens, a linendraper and iconoclast. Holloway set up {{in trade}} for himself, and carried on {{business}} with the West Indies.

He established a business in Warwickshire, and employed some hundreds of workpeople; but, in spite of the prohibition, French <b>cambrics</b> were still largely imported, and Holloway, having lost money, gave up. In 1679 he pressed the Bristol chamber to help him to carry out his scheme in the city, offering to employ Bristol people only, and to find steady work for five hundred of them. On 8 May the chamber agreed to his proposals, and decided to erect a workhouse for the purpose at the east end of the Bridewell. A letter, however, was sent to them on the 25th by Sir John Knight, alderman, and one of the Members of Parliament for the city, pointing out that the prohibition of French linens would terminate in March 1681. Holloway then went to London to advocate his plan.|$|R

But she went on and endured it, and worked diligently with her needle, and folded and unfolded as she was desired, and became as it were quite a younger sister in the house,--creeping out by herself now and again into the purlieus of the city, to find such consolation as she might receive from her solitary thoughts.|$|R
40|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, {{a great deal}} of linen was {{produced}} in the American colonies. Virtually every farming family spun and wove linen cloth for its own consumption. The production of linen was the most widespread industrial activity in America during the colonial period. Yet at the same time, large amounts of linen were imported from across the Atlantic into the American colonies. Linen was the most important commodity entering into the American trade. This apparently paradoxical situation reflects the importance in pre-industrial society of the production and consumption of the extensive range of types of fabrics grouped together as 2 ̆ 7 linen 2 ̆ 7. The range of uses of 2 ̆ 7 linen 2 ̆ 7 is greater than for any other type of fabric. Clothing, bedding, the table and other domestic needs required various sorts of linen, and the transport and packaging industries required others - sailcloth, sacking and bagging of all sorts. The range of quality was considerable, from the finest <b>cambrics</b> and lawns and damasks to the coarsest sackcloths. In colonial America there was a sort of dual economy: basic linen needs were provided outside the market by the widespread domestic production of homespun coarse linetv while the market was dominated by a range of better-quality (though still low-priced) linens imported from England, Scotland and Ireland, and imported too from the continent of Europe (especially Germany) via London. The point was well made by Thomas Fitch, a Boston upholsterer, writing in 1726. 2 ̆ 7 Very coarse 3 / 4 Garlets [i. e. linen from Gulik, or Julich] not being serviceable won 2 ̆ 7 t sute our people 1, he wrote, 2 ̆ 7 though we certainly have enough that are poor.
