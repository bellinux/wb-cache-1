5|$|The Regional Championship matched Tennessee {{with the}} 2nd-seeded Tar Heels, who were coming {{off of a}} 6-point victory over 3rd-seeded Illinois. Summitt's team started off with a 17–11 lead, only to falter and allow Carolina to tie it up at 21. Tennessee responded with a 12–6 run to end the first, but Carolina {{answered}} by opening the second half with the first seven points, giving them a one-point lead, 34–33, {{and the first time}} an opponent had held a lead over Tennessee in over three months. Carolina slowly extended the lead as the game continued, until they were eventually leading 61–49, at which point Summitt sent several players, including Holdsclaw (who was on the bench due to a poor shooting performance) back onto the floor. A minute later, Tennessee had <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to five, and by the five-minute mark the game was tied again, at 62. The teams traded baskets, tying the game at 64 and 66, before Tennessee reached a 70–67 lead, with less than ninety seconds remaining. Carolina was soon forced to start fouling the Lady Vols, who made their free throws and advanced to the Final Four, 76–70. Holdsclaw once again led all scorers, this time with 29, and Semeka Randall had 20. North Carolina was led by Wright and Reid, who had 21 and 20.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E
5|$|Ulis debuted {{with the}} Suns on October 26, 2016 against the Sacramento Kings. He posted 2 points, a rebound, an assist, a steal, and a block in 13 minutes of action during the blowout loss, but {{was on the}} court as Phoenix <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> from 26 to 10 points at one point. His play in mop-up time earned him {{a role in the}} second unit. On October 31, Ulis posted a team-high 6 assists in 18 minutes of play against the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 18, he scored a season-high 10 points and 4 steals in a 116–96 win over the Indiana Pacers. He matched the 4 steals and added 4 rebounds the next night against the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 14, he was {{assigned}} to the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA Development League. He managed to record 13 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds in a loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors before returning to Phoenix to play against the San Antonio Spurs the next day. On December 29, he matched his season and career high with 10 points in 15 minutes in a 99–91 win over the Toronto Raptors. On February 8, there was an oncourt altercation between the Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies resulting in suspensions and fines, including a $15,000 fine for Ulis (who came to the defense of Booker). On February 11, 2017, Ulis recorded a career-high 13 points and tied another career high with six assists in a 133–102 loss to the Houston Rockets. On February 17, he had his number retired at Marian Catholic. Following the break for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, Ulis was moved into the main rotation of players ahead of Brandon Knight. In his new role, Ulis set new career-highs in assists on February 28 against Memphis (7), and March 2 against Charlotte (8); and new career-highs in points on March 3 against Oklahoma City (14) and March 5 against Boston (20, including a buzzer beater game-winning three point shot). Ulis helped improve the team's assist production post All-Star break from 18.6 assists per game (tied for last in the NBA) prior to the break to 24.8 per game in the first two weeks after the break. Ulis received his first NBA start (in place of an injured, resting Eric Bledsoe) on March 15 against the Sacramento Kings and former Kentucky teammate Skal Labissière, who had a career-high 32 points. Ulis record his first career double-double with 13 points and a season-high 13 assists in a 107–101 loss against the Kings. Ulis became the first Suns rookie with at least 12 points and 12 assists in a game since Steve Nash in November 1996. Two days later, Ulis, making his second career NBA start, scored 19 points and added eight assists in a 109–103 loss to Orlando Magic. On March 30, he had 16 points and matched his career best with 13 assists in a 124–118 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 2, he had a near triple-double with career highs of 34 points and nine rebounds as well as nine assists in a 123–116 loss to the Houston Rockets. The 34 points was a 2016–17 season single-game high for all NBA rookies. Ulis was subsequently named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for April, becoming the second Suns rookie to win the award during the 2016–17 season (after Marquese Chriss in January). It was the first time two different Suns earned the award in the same season since the 1987–88 NBA season. Ulis ended April by leading all rookies in points (20.7) and assists (6.8), while also recording 3.8 rebounds. His average of 20.7 points and 6.8 assists was the most by an NBA rookie in a month since Damian Lillard in March 2013. While he averaged 7.3 points, 3.7 assists, and 1.6 rebounds in 61 games for the season, he averaged 16.1 points and 8.5 assists in games that he started. Ulis finished 14th in the voting for the 10-man NBA All-Rookie team.|$|E

Tulane managed <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to 13 points late in the third quarter, but Damaris Johnson's 66-yard punt return for a score with twelve minutes to play ended their hopes of a comeback. Sophomore quarterback G.J. Kinne went 15 of 20 for 211 yards in his debut with the Golden Hurricane, throwing for one touchdown and running for another.

In the second period, Sharks forward Melker Karlsson got called for interference against Eric Fehr and on the ensuing power play, Malkin tipped in a shot by Kessel for the Penguins' second goal. During the third period, Karlsson was able to <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to one at 8:07.

Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute to <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to two points, {{it looked as if}} they might have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E
25|$|The Hornets, {{who earned}} the home-court {{advantage}} via winning the Southwest division, {{were able to}} gain a quick 2–0 lead over the veteran Spurs.

Game 5 back in New Orleans shocked many as the Hornets played off the home crowd to a 22-point rout. The home teams were clearly dominating in this series as Game 6 was {{more of the same}} in San Antonio. However, that all changed when a much anticipated Game 7 saw the Spurs build a 15-point lead after 3 quarters, which proved to be enough (even after the Hornets <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> to 3 with 1:35 left) to send them to another Western Conference Finals.|$|E
