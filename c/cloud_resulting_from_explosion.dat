50|$|Before the tests, {{the height}} of the {{radioactive}} <b>cloud</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> the <b>explosions</b> was estimated at 12,000 feet, (+/-1000 feet). This led to safety criteria for making the decision to detonate the device that the wind direction from ground level up to 10,000 feet should not lie between 330 and 130 degrees and that no rain was forecast closer than 200 miles downwind. However the cloud from the Totem 1 shot rose to 15,000 feet, drifting east and crossing the coast 50 hours later near Townsville.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust <b>cloud</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> the <b>explosion</b> would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|R
40|$|Important {{prebiotic}} {{organic compounds}} {{might have been}} transported to earth in dust or produced in vapor <b>clouds</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> atmospheric <b>explosions</b> or impacts of comets. These compounds coalesced in the upper atmosphere with particles ejected from craters formed by impacts of large objects. Coalescence during exposure to UV radiation concentrated organic monomers and enhanced formation of oligomers. Continuing coalescence added material to the growing particles and shielded prebiotic compounds from prolonged UV radiation. These particles settled into the lower atmosphere where they were scavenged by rain. Aqueous chemistry and evaporation of raindrops containing monomers in high temperature regions near the earth's surface also promoted continued formation of oligomers. Finally, these oligomers were deposited in the oceans where continued prebiotic evolution led to the most primitive cell. Results of present studies suggest that prebiotic chemical evolution may be an inevitable consequence of impacting comets during the late accretion of planets anywhere in the universe if oceans remained on those planetary surfaces...|$|R

By executive order of president Harry S. Truman, the U.S. dropped the nuclear weapon [...] "Little Boy" [...] on the city of Hiroshima on Monday, August 6, 1945, followed by the detonation of [...] "Fat Man" [...] over Nagasaki on August 9. These two events are the only active deployments of nuclear weapons in war. The target of Hiroshima was a city of considerable military importance, containing Japan's Second Army Headquarters, {{as well as being}} a communications center and storage depot. Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, 1945, Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, officially ending the Pacific War and therefore World War II.|$|R
