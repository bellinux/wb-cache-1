5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E
5|$|Texas has {{the most}} farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked #1 for revenue {{generated}} from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked #2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California. At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas' annual agricultural cash receipts, beef <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broilers at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).|$|E
5|$|The Arima {{study is}} based on 761 {{municipalities}} located in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in Mato Grosso. The model showed that a 10% (3,910km²) reduction of soy in old pasture areas would {{have led to a}} reduction in deforestation of up to 40% (26,039km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis showed that the displacement of <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> due to agricultural expansion drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.|$|E

5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, a Brazilian {{land law}} was passed that {{supported}} ownership of the land by the developer: if a person could demonstrate effective cultivation {{for a year and}} a day, then that person could claim a right to the land.

25|$|Ranching {{occupies}} {{about three}} million hectares {{of natural and}} induced pasture, with about 52% of all pasture induced. Most livestock is done by families using traditional methods. Most important are meat and dairy cattle, followed by pigs and domestic fowl. These three account for 93% {{of the value of}} production. Annual milk production in Chiapas totals about 180 million liters per year. The state's <b>cattle</b> <b>production,</b> along with timber from the Lacandon Jungle and energy output gives it a certain amount of economic clouts compared to other states in the region.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{its history}} Kentucky gained {{recognition}} for its excellent farming conditions.

Today Kentucky ranks 5th nationally in goat farming, 8th in beef <b>cattle</b> <b>production,</b> and 14th in corn production. Kentucky has also been a long-standing major center of the tobacco industry – both as a center of business and tobacco farming.|$|E
25|$|Red Deer {{is a city}} in Central Alberta, Canada. It {{is located}} near the {{midpoint}} of the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor and is surrounded by Red Deer County. It is Alberta's third-most-populous city after Calgary and Edmonton. The city is located in aspen parkland, a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and <b>cattle</b> <b>production.</b> It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. Red Deer had a population of 100,418 as of the Canada 2016 census making Red Deer Alberta's third city to surpass a population count of 100,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} council, {{responsible for}} managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental {{problems such as}} pest infestation and pollution.

The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. Possums are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> through the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Eradication programmes also concentrate on rabbits, rooks and feral goats, while other exotic species such as Parma wallaby (Macropus parma), wasps, ferrets, stoats and weasels are a source of concern.|$|E

25|$|The Caribbean sugar boom {{brought about}} a steady decline in world sugar prices. Unable to compete, Brazilian sugar exports, which had peaked by the mid-seventeenth century, {{declined}} sharply. Between {{the fourth quarter of}} the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century, Portugal had difficulties in maintaining its American colony. The downfall of sugar revealed a fragile colonial economy, which had no commodity to replace sugar. Paradoxically, however, the period of stagnation induced the settlement of substantial portions of the colony's territory. With the decline of sugar, the cattle sector, which had evolved to supply the sugar economy with animals for transport, meat, and hides, assimilated part of the resources made idle, becoming a subsistence economy. Because of extensive <b>cattle</b> <b>production</b> methods, large areas in the colony's interior were settled.|$|E
25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high <b>cattle</b> <b>production,</b> and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E
