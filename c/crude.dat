5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: <b>crude</b> tankers and product tankers. <b>Crude</b> tankers move large quantities of unrefined <b>crude</b> oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving <b>crude</b> oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that the United States entered World War II in 1941, oil was a vital part of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's <b>crude</b> oil, with the state of Texas in the south-west leading this production, producing {{more than twice as much}} <b>crude</b> as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and <b>crude</b> oil (petroleum). <b>Crude</b> oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from <b>crude</b> oil.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of extra heavy <b>crudes,</b> the oil {{produced}} from the Carabobo field has extremely high viscosities. Typical heavy <b>crudes</b> produced are around 10,000 cp, which is the viscosity of corn syrup. Recoveries in this area are naturally very low. As a result, emerging technologies have recently made recoveries high enough to produce the extra heavy <b>crudes</b> economically. Specifically, enhanced oil recovery methods have dramatically improved recoveries. Methods such as immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as fireflooding, have all seen limited success in the Carabobo field. However, steam injection and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) have seen the most success.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increased}} use of coal and the reduced demand for Bunker C and other heavy liquid fuels, more refiners are adding or increasing the capacity of their facilities for converting the bottom-of-the-barrel streams into more desirable products. Also many of today's <b>crudes</b> are heavier and contain more sulfur and metals than <b>crudes</b> available five or ten years ago and, therefore, are available at a lower cost than lighter <b>crudes.</b> Most of these heavier <b>crudes</b> require either the addition of hydrogen or the removal of carbon to make more desirable products out of them. Both kinds of these processes require relatively large amounts of energy compared to simple distillation. Energy conservation measures are required to make these processes efficient and hence more economical. The technology of conserving energy and the use of cogeneration in bottom-of-the-barrel processes are discussed in this paper. The selection of the best combination of process scheme and energy recovery techniques importantly influences the return-on-investment for such plants...|$|R
