40|$|Nineteenth-century <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the Netherlands By the Royal Decree of 1815 a {{separate}} faculty {{of mathematics and}} natural science was founded at the Dutch universities of Leyden, Utrecht and Groningen. The decree emphatically stated that each of those universities should have a <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratory.</b> The teaching of chemistry was, however, of little significance. This situation changed radically when G. J. Mulder was appointed professor of chemistry at Utrecht University (1840). Mulder's ideal was to give his students a practical chemical education; for that purpose he needed an adequate laboratory which he got in 1845. With Mulder and his students {{a new era of}} chemical education at Dutch universities began. Opportunities for a chemical career were improved by the foundation of a new type of secondary school in 1863, which needed a great number of chemistry teachers. Twelve out of 36 graduate students of J. H. van 't Hoff made a career in governmental services or in private and industrial laboratories. In this article a survey is given of types of non-university laboratories existing in the Netherlands {{at the end of the}} last century: private <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> for the training of chemists outside the university and for the analysis of chemical products; governmental <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> (sugar, foods); industrial <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> (the N. V. Nederlandsche Gist- en Spiritusfabriek in Delft appointed a research chemist already in 1885), agricultural <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> and <b>chemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> at secondary schools where a number of teachers did their own chemical research. With the great expansion of Dutch chemical industry in the beginning of the twentieth century, more and more chemists found a job at the newly established industrial research laboratorie...|$|R
