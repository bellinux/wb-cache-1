50|$|The bark is used {{to produce}} 'Ecuadorian' (or 'American') {{cinnamon}} which bears some resemblance to <b>common</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (which also comes from a tree in this family).

40|$|THE OLDEST SCIENTIFIC NAME FOR THE CINNAMON TREE Cinnamomum {{zeylanicum}} BL, 1826, {{has been}} currently {{considered to be}} the proper name for the <b>common</b> <b>cinnamon</b> tree. This name was already in use during the pre-Linnean period (cf. Kostermans, Bibliogr. Laur. 364. 1964). The oldest valid name, however, is Cinnamomum verum J. S. Presl, 1825, This is not a pharmaceutical name, as is evident from the references cited by Presl and by the treatment of other species. For complete refe- rences cf. Kostermans, Bibl.

40|$|Eleven {{essential}} oils (clove, rosemary, cinnamon leaf, sage, scots pine, neroli, peppermint, aniseed, caraway, lavander, common thyme were tested for in vitro antifungal activity on twelve plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium graminearum, F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans, F. oxysporum, F. avenaceum, Diaporthe helianthi, Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora, Phomopsis longicolla, P. viticola, Helminthosporium sativum, Colletotrichum coccodes, Thanatephorus cucumeris). The {{results indicated that}} all oils except scots pine and neroli had antifungal activity against some or all tested fungi. The best antifungal activity had <b>common</b> thyme, <b>cinnamon</b> leaf, clove and aniseed oils. When compared to control, scots pine, neroli and sage oils stimulated mycelium growth of some investigated fungi...|$|R
5000|$|Breath spray is {{a product}} sprayed into the mouth {{for the purpose of}} {{eliminating}} (or at least covering up) halitosis. It is occasionally advertised as being for smokers or those who dip tobacco, and occasionally to cover up the smell of cigarette/cigar smoking. <b>Common</b> flavours include <b>cinnamon,</b> spearmint and peppermint, as well as company-specific flavours such as [...] "Ice Mint" [...] or [...] "Supermint".|$|R
50|$|Cinnamomum cassia, called Chinese cassia or Chinese cinnamon, is an {{evergreen}} tree {{originating in}} southern China, and widely cultivated there {{and elsewhere in}} southern and eastern Asia (India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam). It {{is one of several}} species of Cinnamomum used primarily for their aromatic bark, which is used as a spice. In the United States, Chinese cassia is the most <b>common</b> type of <b>cinnamon</b> used. The buds are also used as a spice, especially in India, and were once used by the ancient Romans.|$|R
50|$|When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) {{took over}} the coastal areas, it re-organised {{cinnamon}} cultivation on modern capitalist lines, with plantations located {{within the boundaries of}} VOC rule, mainly in the Galle district. The Salagamas were converted from a feudal caste into a modern proletariat.The Dutch demand for cinnamon was more intense than that of the Portuguese, and by the era of British control mortality rates among Salagamas had increased sharply. It became <b>common</b> practice for <b>cinnamon</b> peelers' children to be registered under the names of other castes in order to spare them a life of ever-growing misery.|$|R
5000|$|Turkish delight, lokum or rahat lokum {{and many}} other transliterations (رَاحَة الْحُلْقُوم rāḥat al-ḥulqūm, Lokum or rahat lokum, from colloquial راحه الحلقوم rāḥat al-ḥalqūm, Azerbaijani: [...] ) is a family of {{confections}} based on a gel of starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are mostly flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon. The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or powdered cream of tartar, to prevent clinging. Other <b>common</b> flavors include <b>cinnamon</b> and mint. In the production process, soapwort {{may be used as}} an emulsifying additive.|$|R
50|$|Henrys Lake is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for sport fishing. The most common species in the lake is Yellowstone cutthroat. They make up 55 percent of the trout population. The average size in 2015 was 15 inches but biologists found some fish over 20 inches. The second most prevalent species is rainbow-cutthroat hybrids, which make up 24 percent of the population. The average size is 19 inches, although Idaho Fish and Game found hybrids longer than 25 inches. Brook trout make up 21 percent of the population. The average length is 16 inches but biologists found several Brook trout that exceeded 20 inches in length. There is a fish hatchery {{on the north side}} of the lake that helps to replenish the lake.Henrys Lake is home to a variety of migrating birds. The western and eastern edges of the lake provide wetland/marsh habitats that serve as breeding areas for many birds in spring. Notable at Henrys Lake are White Pelicans, Widgeon, Lesser Scaup, Cormorants, Red-necked and western Grebes, coots, mallards, bufflehead, Ring-necked Ducks, Canada Geese, Blue-winged Teal, eared Grebe, Killdeer, common Merganser, <b>common</b> tern, <b>Cinnamon</b> Teal, Trumpeter Swans, Great Blue Heron, California Seagulls, Bald Eagles, Swainson's Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, Red-winged Blackbirds, cowbirds and more.|$|R
30|$|Recently, safe {{tyrosinase}} inhibitors {{have become}} important for their potential applications in improving food quality and preventing pigmentation disorders and other melanin-related human health issues (Fitzpatrick et al. 1983; Seo et al. 2003). Furthermore, safe tyrosinase inhibitors {{are important in}} cosmetics for skin whitening effects. C. cassia has been safely used for many years by humans as a flavoring agent and a traditional medicinal herb. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Cinnamomum spp., including <b>common</b> and cassia <b>cinnamon,</b> are {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) when used in amounts commonly found in food (Dugoua et al. 2007). Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde and benzaldehyde, which are found in CC-EO, are also GRAS (Kubo and Kinst-Hori 1999). Thus, it is expected that CC-EO and its major constituent, cinnamaldehyde, may be a safe and viable source of skin-whitening agents.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether the addition of different herbal oils (anise, sweet basil, blue chamomile, clove, true <b>cinnamon,</b> <b>common</b> sage) into whey will extend its shelf life. Changes in pH, titration acidity and microbiological analysis of whey during storage life were chosen as parameters for monitoring of whey shelf life. Based on these analyses possibility of utilization of herbal oils has been confirmed for the purpose of extension of the lifetime of whey. The use of essential oils blue chamomile and common sage did not help to extend the shelf life of fresh whey. The treatment of whey by herbal essential oils anise, sweet basil, clove and cinnamon extend the shelf life up to 21 days without significant changes in pH and titratable acidity. The results of our study show that essential oils could be used to inhibit microbial spoilage whey and to prolong its shelf life...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} that {{patients}} with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) had increased level of oxidative DNA damage and decreased efficacy of DNA repair. These changes were implicated in the increased cancer risk in patients with diabetes mellitus. Cinnamon bark extracts have diverse biological activities including antidiabetic and anti-tumor properties. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia) is a <b>common</b> used <b>cinnamon</b> species present in commercial cinnamon preparations. We aimed to investigate the effects of cinnamon extracts prepared from C. cassia bark on endogenous and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -induced oxidative DNA damage, as well as cytotoxic and apoptotic activities in this study. Type 1 diabetic (T 1 DM) lymphocytes (GM 02765, GM 01838) and fibroblasts (GM 01837) were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository of Coriell Institute, New Jersey, USA. Cytotoxicity analysis were performed by using a tetrazolium salt, 4 -[3 -(4 -iodophenyl) 2 -(4 -nitrophenyl) 2 H- 5 -tetrazolio] 1, 3 -benzene disulfonate (WST- 1). The effects of extracts on endogenous and H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative DNA damage were studied using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE; Comet Assay), a technique allowing DNA damage in a single cell. Apoptotic activities of extracts were investigated by TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays. using flow cytometry. IC 50 and IC 20 values of the extracts varied and the effects on endogenous and H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage were different regarding cell lines and extracts. Although their protective effects at some doses against to H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage, our results suggested DNA damaging and apoptotic potential of cinnamon bark extracts on Type 1 diabetic cell lines, in vitro...|$|R
