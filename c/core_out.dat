The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E

40|$|New {{abdominal}} and {{vaginal hysterectomy}} techniques, such as classic intrafascial serrated edged macro-morcellator (SEMM) hysterectomy (CISH), by pelviscopy/laparoscopy or laparotomy, and intrafascial vaginal hysterectomy (IVH), are both essentially supravaginal techniques. It has been {{claimed that they}} give a prophylaxis against cervical stump carcinoma by <b>coring</b> <b>out</b> the cervix with the SEMM. We set out to answer two questions: 1) How can vaginosonography help to choose an adequate SEMM diameter so that the cervical mucosa and transformation zone are completely removed, and 2) How often do cervical glands remain after the <b>coring</b> <b>out</b> procedure? We were able to show a good correlation between sonographic and histological morphology by giant and serial sections. In 253 CISH operations, resection of both endocervix and transformation zone was complete in 92. 9 %. Dysplasias were always removed completely; only 18 cervical cores exhibited healthy glands (retention cysts) in the resection margin. Therefore, CISH procedures {{should be able to}} prevent most of the cervical stump carcinomata that follow traditional supravaginal hysterectomy, but only long-term follow-up will give the final proof.

40|$|The {{operative}} {{methods of}} total uterine mucosal ablation (TUMA) {{as well as}} new abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy techniques are described. Classic intrafascial serrated edged macro-morcellator (SEMM) hysterectomy (CISH) by pelviscopy or laparotomy and intrafascial vaginal hysterectomy (IVH) are techniques that allow the nerve and the blood supply of the pelvic floor to remain intact, mainly because only the ascending branches of the uterine arteries are ligated. TUMA avoids the removal of the uterus altogether and is reserved for hypermenorrhea or menorrhagia without major enlargement of the uterus. Both CISH and IVH reduce the physical trauma of hysterectomy considerably and have the advantages of the supravaginal technique. Prophylaxis against cervical stump carcinoma is assured by <b>coring</b> <b>out</b> the cervix with the SEMM. In patients in whom both procedures are possible, IVH is preferred because it combines the minimal trauma and short operative time of vaginal hysterectomy. The decreased diameter of the cervix after <b>coring</b> <b>out</b> greatly simplifies this type of vaginal hysterectomy, the technique that has always been favored because of its short operative times and minimal trauma.

50|$|In a nuclear-powered ship, {{the nuclear}} fuel is {{essentially}} a solid inside a reactor core which is inside the ship's nuclear reactor. Once a reactor core has gone critical, meaning {{it has been used}} during a reactor operation, highly radioactive nuclear fission products have formed in the core, and the core has become highly radioactive. Refueling involves taking the expended <b>core</b> <b>out</b> of the reactor and putting in a new core with fresh nuclear fuel. Because it is so radioactive, removing a core with spent nuclear fuel from a reactor requires elaborate radiological handling precautions. All materials that came in contact with the critical core, including the internal surfaces and coolant water, are considered radioactively contaminated and require special radiological handling and disposal precautions. In addition to radiological training and qualification required for working in radiation areas or with radioactive materials or contamination, radiation exposure to workers is monitored to ensure maximum exposure limits are not exceeded.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Often, a {{diagnosis}} of pT 3 is {{made on the basis}} of radical retropubic prostatectomy specimens, despite a Gleason score of 6 on the preoperative prostate biopsy. Thus, we investigated the preoperative variables in patients displaying these characteristics. Materials and Methods: Study subjects comprised patients at our institute from 1996 to July 2010 who had exhibited a Gleason score of 6 on their prostate biopsies and had undergone a radical retropubic prostatectomy. Through univariate and multivariate analysis, we investigated pT 3 predictive factors including age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) -weighted prostate volume, digital rectal examination findings, bilaterality via prostate biopsy, prostatic cancer in prostate base cores via prostate biopsy, maximum length and percent of prostatic cancer, and number of cores detected in prostatic cancer via prostate biopsy. Results: In the univariate logistic regression mode, a PSA value of 7. 4 ng/ml or higher, TRUS-weighted PSA density of 0. 2 ng/ml/cc or higher, prostate cancer detected in the basal core, and prostate cancer detected in 2 or more <b>cores</b> <b>out</b> of 12 were predictive factors for extraprostatic extension. Independent predictive factors for stage pT 3 were a PSA of 7. 4 ng/ml or higher and prostate cancer detected in 2 or more <b>cores</b> <b>out</b> of 12. Conclusions: In the case of patients with the foregoing risk factors, it is advisable not to perform nerve-sparing surgery but to prepare for the possibility of a pT 3 stage.
