We then turned eastwards or inland, ascended a Nakb ("gorge"), and saw, as before, the corallines and carbonates of lime altered, fused, scorified, and blackened by heated injections; the grey granite scored with quartz veins, running in all rhumbs; and the porphyritic trap forming crests that projected from the sands.

The Jebel el-Mará, the centre or focus of the formation, was found to push out veins to the north, {{extending}} within a few yards of the Wady Makná's mouth.

6000|$|This {{section of}} North Midian may be {{described}} as essentially a mining country, which, strange to say of a province so near Egypt, has been little worked by the Ancients. The first Khedivial Expedition brought back specimens of free gold found in basalt, apparently eruptive, and in corundophyllite, which the engineer called greenstone porphyry: silver appeared in the red sands, in the chloritic quartz, and in the titaniferous iron of the Jebel el-Abayz; the value being 265 to 300 francs per ton, with traces in the scoriæ. The second Expedition failed to find gold, but brought back argentiferous galena in copper-stained quartz, and possibly in the ochraceous red veins seaming the Secondary gypsum; with silicates and carbonates of copper: select specimens of the latter yielding the enormous proportion of forty per cent. In this northern region the great focus of metallic deposit appears to lie between north lat. 28° 40' and 27° 50'; that is, from the Jebel Tayyib Ism, north of Makná, to the southern basin which contains the Jebel el-Abyaz or [...] "White Mountain." [...] Its characteristics are the argentiferous and <b>cupriferous</b> ores, whereas in South Midian gold and silver were worked; and the parallelogram whose limits are assigned above, might be converted into a Northern Grant.

The discovery led to the growth of Georgetown as an early center of the silver mining industry in Colorado, although development was slowed by a general ignorance of how to properly treat the ore, by the high cost of transportation from the mines, and by the climate at that altitude. Eventually, both sides of the pass were heavily mined, and the district was divided into the East Argentine and West Argentine Districts, divided by the pass.

40|$|Crepidorhopalon perennis is an endemic metallophyte {{restricted}} {{to only one}} site on Cu-rich soils in Katanga. Crepidorhopalon tenuis has a broader niche, from normal to Cu-rich soils, but has high affinity for <b>cupriferous</b> habitats. Both plants have been considered as Cu-Co accumulators. Cu tolerance and accumulation of C. tenuis were studied in axenic conditions in vitro in four metallicolous populations and one non-metallicolous population whereas for C. perennis only one population was investigated. Results showed a Cu tolerance of both C. tenuis and C. perennis. Variation of tolerance among metallicolous and non-metallicolous populations was also observed. The addition of Cu enhanced the growth of some metallicolous populations under sterile conditions, hence confirming the high needs in copper of metallicolous populations. This could represent a cost of tolerance which would explain the high affinity of species for <b>cupriferous</b> habitats. On the other hand, Crepidorhopalon perennis did not show the same features.

40|$|Indigenous and {{exogenous}} {{organic matter}} in sediments of the North American Midcontinent Rift {{were involved in}} precipitation of Cu-bearing minerals during main- and second-stage mineralization events at White Pine, Michigan. Samples of the Proterozoic Nonesuch Formation from the White Pine mine and adjacent areas were investigated petrographically and geochemically {{in order to determine}} the influence of organic matter on the precipitation of Cu and to determine whether mineralization influenced thermal maturity of organic matter. During main-stage mineralization, introduction of <b>cupriferous</b> fluids into the lower Nonesuch Fm. formed Cu-bearing sulfides by replacement of pyrite. Sulfur may have been added to the system via abiogenic sulfate reduction, with organic matter providing a direct source of reducing potential. In basal ore horizons where all sulfide had been incorporated into chalcocite during main-stage mineralization, native Cu also precipitated locally, with organic matter presumably acting as a direct reductant. Later compressional faulting at White Pine provided conduits for additional <b>cupriferous</b> fluids; these fluids deposited second-stage Cu mineralization. Inclusions of liquid petroleum and solid pyrobitumen in veins filling fractures associated with compressional faults record migration of petroleum into the White Pine district from the deeper, hotter, axis of the rift penecontemporaneous with second-stage fluids. Some of this petroleum may have acted as a reductant during precipitation of native Cu in basal ore horizons. Biomarker compositions of bitumens and isotopic compositions of individual n-alkanes from petroleums and bitumens suggest that these materials were all derived from organic matter deposited during sedimentation of the Nonesuch Fm [...] Biomarker data demonstrate that bitumens from the White Pine area have significantly higher levels of thermal maturity than bitumens from unmineralized strata outside the mine area. Therefore, Cu mineralization at White Pine coincides with a thermal anomaly. Seep petroleums from the northeast and southwest domains of the mine contain different n-alkane distributions; we propose that this difference reflects elevated thermal maturity of seep petroleums spatially associated with second-stage mineralization in the southwestern domain of the mine...|$|E
40|$|Small {{scattered}} disseminations of metalliferous minerals, primarily copper bearing sulphides {{and secondary}} malachite, are {{widespread in the}} Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks of South-West Cork. This mineralization is spatially associated {{with the development of}} 'red beds'. Typically the host rocks are the sandstone and comstone fractions of green-grey coloured strata. In the 'red bed' sequence such greon-grey strata are present as thin concordant bands. An upward stratigraphic zoning of the sulphides from those rich in copper to those relatively rich in iron occurs. In addition the sulphides show evidence of having been deformed together with the enclosing host rocks during the Ilercynian orogeny. The copper abundances in unmineralized portions of the succession are apparently abnormally lev. Similar though less richly mineralised <b>cupriferous</b> strata occur in the Devonian succession elsewhere in Southern Ireland and in the Anglo-Welsh area. The disseminated mineralisation is considered to have formed as a result of diagenetic processes active within the coinpacting sedimentary column. The position of the water table, the presence of sulphate-reducing) bacteria, the movement of 'waters of compaction', variations in sediment permeability and the presence both of 'red beds' and of the adjacent Variscan marine eeosynclinal basin are considered to have bean important factors in effecting metal concentration. In South-West Cork the subsequent Hercynian orogeny produced small quartz-sulphide veins by lccal renobilization of <b>cupriferous</b> country rock. Larger vein deposit of quartz, of baryte, and of manganese and iron oxides also occur. Where quarts forms a major constituent, metalliferous (chiefly Cu-Pb) mineralization is common. It is suggested that in the main such metalliferous mineralization vas emplaced during the Hercynian orogeny from remnant connate fluids channelled through fractures after the surrounding strata were rendered impermeable.

40|$|During {{the gold}} cyanidation process, cyanide can be lost from the {{leachate}} by various chemical routes. Since cyanide is generally {{the most expensive}} reagent in this process, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to monitor these cyanide losses. The products of these cyanide losses include base metal cyanide complexes, thiocyanate and cyanate. The two most significant cyanicides in order of importance are sulfides and copper bearing minerals. The problems caused by cyanide soluble copper minerals are well known to the gold processing industry and have been reviewed by several authors (e. g. 1, 2). One particular facet of this problem concerns the effect of the CN:Cu mole ratio, R, on the gold leaching kinetics. In order to efficiently leach <b>cupriferous</b> ores, it is important that R is maintained at a level that allows sufficiently rapid leaching without excessive use of cyanide. An additional consideration when leaching <b>cupriferous</b> ores is the oxidation of cyanide by Cu(11) minerals, resulting in the formation of cyanate. Ion chromatography (IC) has been successfully used for the determination of cyanide, metal cyanide complexes, thiocyanate and cyanate in leachates. Most of the important metal-cyanide complexes and thiocyanate can be determined by reverse phase ion interaction chromatography (e. g. 3, 4, 5, 6). Cyanide and cyanate are both unretained in the separation of the metal cyanide complexes and are not detectable as their respective anions. However, it has been possible to determine cyanide in this separation by either precolumn derivatisation with Ag to form [Ag(CN) J (4) or post-column derivatisation with a selective colourimetric reaction to produce a visible dye (5). There are no reactions suitable for the analogous pre or post column derivatisation of cyanate in the above separation of metal cyanide complexes. Cyanate has been determined separately on an anion exchange column (e. g. 7, 8, 9). This paper presents two new IC techniques that enable the rapid determination of cyanate concentration and R in samples containing large concentrations of Cu(I) -cyanide complexes. Other metal cyanide complexes, in addition to Cu(I), can also be determined in conjunction with R, while other anions such as chloride and sulfate can be determined in conjunction with cyanate.

40|$|The Okiep Copper District {{situated}} in the north-western Cape Province, covers some 3 000 km and is the oldest mining area in the Republic of South Africa. The O'okiep Copper Company Limited commenced production in 1940 with a proven ore reserve of 9 million tons at 2, 45 % cu. Production since 1940 and present ore reserves total some 93 million tonnes at 1, 08 % Cu. The rocks comprising the Okiep Copper District are of Proterozoic age and have been subdivided into a meta-volcanosedimentary succession, intruded by various sub-horizontally emplaced granitoid intrusions. The various intrusions occurred at different stages relative to the main structural and metamorphic events. The copper deposits are confined to basic rocks which are the youngest major group of intrusives in the District. They occur as swarms of generally easterly-trending, steep northdipping, irregular dyke-like bodies consisting of diorite, anorthosite and norite. The dominant silicate constituents are andesite ranging to labradorite, hypersthene, biotite and phlogopite. Copper sulphides are preferentially associated with the more basic varieties. The copper sulphides are mainly chalcopyrite, bornite and subsidiary chalcocite. The copper content of the basic rocks is erratic ranging over small distances from a mere trace to several percent. Emplacement of the <b>cupriferous</b> basic rocks is predisposed {{to a large extent}} by enigmatic structural features locally referred to as steep structures. The most common manifestation of steep structure deformation is typically a narrow antiformal linear feature along which continuity of the country rocks has been interrupted by piercement folding and shearing. In places, pipelike bodies of megabreccia occur along steep structures, and also act as hosts to the basic rock. Areas of steep structure are thus prime exploration targets, due to their close spatial association with the <b>cupriferous</b> basic rocks.

40|$|The {{top of the}} <b>cupriferous</b> zone in {{the lower}} Nonesuch Shale of Northern Michigan is {{characterized}} by an abrupt zonation of Cu-Fe sulfides which represents a chemical and mineralogic transition into the overlying barren pyritic shale.

Exceptionally well preserved textures in part of the massive ore, together with sulfur and oxygen isotope data, permit insight into details of the mineralization that occurred on or near the sea floor. The massive ore contains two major generations of pyrite, a fine and a coars...|$|E
40|$|The Bor metallogenic zone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metallogenic units in the Republicof Serbia. Volcanic processes in this unit are characterized by the domination of extrusivevolcanic activity, and the change of depositional environment during the numerous volcaniccycles, as well as facial transitions and huge deposition of syn- and post eruptive resedimentedvolcanoclastics. The predominant metals in the Bor metallogenic zone are copperand gold, accompanied by iron, base-metals, silver, molybdenum, and minor platinumgroupelements. The most prominent morphogenetic types of deposit comprise porphyrycopper-gold, <b>cupriferous</b> pyrite, massive base-metal sulphides and hydrothermal veins,iron oxides skarns, carbonate replacement polymetallic deposits, volcanogenic epithermalgold mineralization of the high sulphidation type, and exceptionally rare clasts of coppersulphide ore mechanically accumulated in small sedimentary basins filled by pyroclastics. The total production of the Bor metallogenic zone since 1902 has been near 652 Mt ofore with 4. 93 Mt of copper and 280 tons of gold. Mineral resources of the Bor metallogeniczone are estimated at over 20 millions of tons of copper and 1, 000 tons of gold. Themain geological characteristics of selected metallic mineral deposits in this area are describedin this paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|Silene vulgaris is a metallophyte of calamine, <b>cupriferous</b> and {{serpentine}} soils {{all over}} Europe. Its metallicolous populations are hypertolerant to zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni), compared with conspecific nonmetallicolous populations. These hypertolerances are metal-specific, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are poorly understood. We investigated the role of HMA 5 copper transporters in Cu-hypertolerance of a S. vulgaris copper mine population. Cu-hypertolerance in Silene is correlated and genetically linked with enhanced expression of two HMA 5 paralogs, SvHMA 5 I and SvHMA 5 II, each of which increases Cu tolerance when expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Most Spermatophytes, except Brassicaceae, possess homologs of SvHMA 5 I and SvHMA 5 II, which originate from an ancient duplication predating the appearance of spermatophytes. SvHMA 5 II and the A. thaliana homolog AtHMA 5 localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon Cu exposure move to the plasma membrane, from where they are internalized and degraded in the vacuole. This resembles trafficking of mammalian homologs and is apparently an extremely ancient mechanism. SvHMA 5 I, instead, neofunctionalized and always resides on the tonoplast, likely sequestering Cu in the vacuole. Adaption of Silene to a Cu-polluted soil is {{at least in part}} due to upregulation of two distinct HMA 5 transporters, which contribute to Cu hypertolerance by distinct mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Patterns {{of genetic}} {{divergence}} between populations of facultative metallophytes {{have been investigated}} extensively. However, most previous investigations have focused on a single plant species making it unclear if genetic divergence shows common patterns or, conversely, is species-specific. The herbs Rumex acetosa L. and Commelina communis L. are two pseudo-metallophytes thriving in both normal and <b>cupriferous</b> soils along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. Their non-metallicolous and metallicolous populations are often sympatric thus providing an ideal opportunity for comparative estimation of genetic structures and divergence under the selective pressure derived from copper toxicity. Results In the present study, patterns of genetic divergence of R. acetosa and C. communis, including metal tolerance, genetic structure and genetic relationships between populations, were investigated and compared using hydroponic experiments, AFLP, ISSR and chloroplast genetic markers. Our results show {{a significant reduction in}} genetic diversity in metallicolous populations of C. communis but not in R. acetosa. Moreover, genetic differentiation is less in R. acetosa than in C. communis, the latter species also shows a clustering of its metallicolous populations. Conclusions We propose that the genetic divergences apparent in R. acetosa and C. communis, and the contrasting responses of the two species to copper contamination, might be attributed to the differences in their intrinsic physiological and ecological properties. No simple and generalised conclusions on genetic divergence in pseudo-metallophytes can thus be drawn. </p...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{stratiform}} copper mineralization {{occurs in}} three upper Proterozoic embayments along a 250 -km-long arcuate belt in the Mackenzie Mountains Supergroup, Northwest Territories, Canada. Mineralization {{is found in}} transgressive strata between the continental red beds of the Redstone River Formation and shallow restricted marine carbonates of the overlying Coppercap Formation. A mafic volcanic succession lying stratigraphically beneath the red beds possibly provided copper-bearing detritus to the red beds. The Coates Lake deposit, the object of this study, contains <b>cupriferous</b> ulfides (principally chalcocite, bornitc, and chalcopyrite) hosted by microbial-laminated limestones and dolo-stones. These carbonates are intercalated with red siltstones to form {{as many as seven}} red bed-carbonate couplets within the 110 -m-thick transition zone. Regional and local studies indicate that the host sediments were deposited in a peritidal setting associated with a sabkha environment. Paragenetic studies reveal a consistent order of precipitation for gangue and ore-forming minerals. These minerals can be related to the diagenetic evolution of the host sediments. Their presence at the Coates Lake deposit may be divided chronologically into four syngenetic to early diagenetic stages: syndiagenesis [...] precipitation of gypsum, anhydrite after gypsum, dolomitization; diagenesis 1 [...] deposition of calcite with partial replacement of anhydrite, preore pyrite, authigenic silica with partial replacement of anhydrite and calcite, and authigenic feldspar; diagenesis 2 [...] precipitation of copper-bearing sulfides in the presence of reduced sulfur, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and organic matter, and partial replacement of preore pyrite, anhydrite, calcite and quartz; and diagenesis 3 [...] neomorphism of calcite. Mineralization, identified with the second stage of diagenesis, would have preceded the marked reduction in permeability associated with the formation of neomorphic calcite...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we aimed {{to assess the}} role of metallothionein- 2 b in Zn or Cd hypertolerance by {{analyzing}} the expression of SvMT 2 b in roots of metallicolous and non-metallicolous Silene vulgaris populations, {{as well as in}} interpopulation crosses segregating for tolerance to Zn or Cd. Plants were grown in hydroponic nutrient solution and Zn and Cd were supplied as sulphates after 1 week of preculture. After 14 d of growth, RNA samples were taken from roots of plants exposed to different concentrations of Zn or Cd (2, 20, 200 μM Zn; 0, 2. 5, 12. 5 μM Cd) for 72 h. SvMT 2 b transcript levels were analyzed by real-time qPCR and compared to an Actin II control. Populations from <b>cupriferous</b> and calamine soil had significantly higher expression than non-metallicolous populations (P 0. 10) Metals did not significantly affect SvMT 2 b expression in any of the populations (P > 0. 10). No co-segregation of Zn and Cd tolerance was observed, nor was any co-segregation of SvMT 2 b expression and Zn or Cd tolerance seen. It is concluded that Zn and Cd tolerance are genetically independent traits. Further we conclude that enhanced SvMT 2 b expression is not a primary determinant of naturally selected Zn or Cd hypertolerance. The enhanced expression in populations from calamine soils without Cu enrichment could be related to Cu homeostasis or, alternatively, point to a role as a non-metal specific hypostatic enhancer in metal hypertolerance. The possible role for SvMT 2 b in heavy metal tolerance is discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to consider the potential of plants in the remediation or rehabilitation of areas affectedby mining as well as their capability of absorbing metals in anomalous amounts which could be analternative to traditional mining. Phytoremediation is an innovative way of addressing theenvironmental impacts of mining. Studies on metallophytes have identified some plant species thatthrive in nickeliferous laterites and in <b>cupriferous</b> soils. It has been of interest as to how these plantsaccumulate the heavy metals the soil contains, and specifically how much of the available metals arebeing taken up by these plants. In Brookes Point, Palawan, some of the identified plants that thrive innickeliferous laterites, were Sapotaceae planchonella, Apocynaceae alstonia macropylla andCunoniaceae weinmannia sp. Results showed similar responses among the plant species in terms ofthe total Fe content in their leaves, stems and roots. The positive relationship between the soil andplant components was observed manifesting the characteristics of indicator plants for Fe. Apocynaceae alstonia macrophylla specifically had high Fe contents in the root system making it alsoan accumulator and phytostabilizer for Fe. In Mankayan, Benguet, four native fern species that cantolerate the Cu enriched soils were identified and analyzed for Cu using the root-stem-leafcomponents. These species were Pteridium aquilinum, Dicranopteris linearis, Pteris sp. andNephrolepis hirsutula. The results showed Nephrolepis hirsutala and Pteris sp. to be the best Cutolerant species. These plants were not only considered as indicator plants for Cu manifested by thepositive correlation between soil and plant components but also as accumulators and phytostabilizersfor Cu due to the high Cu content in their roots. These are characteristics of metallophytes and thussuch plants may be used for phytoremediation...|$|E
