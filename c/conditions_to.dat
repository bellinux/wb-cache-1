40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether, like fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> angry faces resists extinction even after verbal instruction and {{removal of the}} shock electrode. Participants were trained in a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure with angry face or happy face conditional stimuli (CSs). Prior to extinction, half the participants in each group were informed that no more unconditional stimuli would be presented and the shock electrode was removed. In the absence of this manipulation, participants showed resistance to extinction after training with angry face CSs, but not after training with happy face CSs. Instructed extinction and electrode removal abolished fear conditioning regardless of the emotion expressed by the CS faces. This finding suggests that fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> angry faces, like fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> racial out-group faces, is more malleable than fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> snakes and spiders...|$|R
40|$|Prepared {{learning}}, {{learning that}} is selective, resistant to extinction, evident after one trial, and encapsulated from cognition, {{is said to}} underlie animal and social phobias (O¨ hman, 2009). Resistance to extinction has been shown for fears <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders and to pictures of faces of threatening conspecifics (angry faces or faces that look different – other race faces). However, whereas fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders is encapsulated from cognition, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of other race faces is not (Mallan et al., 2009). The present study investigated whether fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of angry faces is encapsulated from cognition. Two groups of participants were trained in a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure with angry face or happy face conditional stimuli (CSs). Prior to extinction, half the participants in each group were informed that no more unconditional stimuli would be presented. In the absence of verbal instruction, participants showed resistance to extinction after training with angry face CSs, but not after training with happy face CSs. Instructed extinction abolished differential fear conditioning regardless of the emotion expressed by the CS faces. This finding suggests that unlike fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders, but similar <b>to</b> fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of other race faces, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of angry faces is malleable by cognition...|$|R
