50|$|The terms logical host or cluster logical host {{is used to}} {{describe}} the network address that is used to access services provided by the cluster. This logical host identity is not tied to a single <b>cluster</b> <b>node.</b> It is actually a network address/hostname that is linked with the service(s) provided by the cluster.

50|$|HAST {{provides}} a block device to be synchronized between two servers {{for use as}} a filesystem.

50|$|A {{clustered}} NAS is a NAS that {{is using}} a distributed file system running simultaneously on multiple servers. The key difference between a clustered and traditional NAS {{is the ability to}} distribute (e.g. stripe) data and metadata across the <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> or storage devices. Clustered NAS, like a traditional one, still provides unified access to the files from any of the <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes,</b> unrelated to the actual location of the data.|$|R

5000|$|... eXtremeDB Cluster is the {{clustering}} sub-system for McObject's eXtremeDB {{embedded database}} product family. It maintains database consistency across multiple hardware nodes by replicating transactions in a synchronous manner (two-phase commit). An important characteristic of eXtremeDB Cluster is transaction replication, {{in contrast to}} log file-based, SQL statement-based, or other replication schemes {{that may or may}} not guarantee the success or failure of entire transactions. Accordingly, eXtremeDB Cluster is an ACID compliant system (not BASE or eventual consistency); a query executed on any <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> will return the same result as if executed on any other <b>cluster</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E

30|$|Generally, a {{clustered}} ad hoc network {{consists of}} three kinds of nodes: <b>cluster</b> head <b>nodes,</b> gateway nodes, and ordinary <b>nodes.</b> <b>Cluster</b> head <b>nodes</b> are vested with the responsibility of managing the cluster. For example, {{in the case of}} a cluster-based control channel design for a CRAHN, the <b>cluster</b> head <b>node</b> is responsible for allocating a set of control channels out of the set of channels available to every member of that cluster. The coordination between two adjacent clusters is conducted through the gateway nodes. A <b>node</b> of a <b>cluster</b> can act as a gateway only if it has a neighboring node as well as a channel in common with the designated control channel of its neighboring <b>cluster.</b> All <b>nodes</b> other than the <b>cluster</b> head <b>node</b> and gateway node are ordinary nodes.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we present}} a routing {{protocol}} through intra-clustering. Most hierarchical protocols use direct intra-cluster routing, {{so that all the}} <b>cluster</b> member <b>nodes</b> forward their data to the <b>cluster</b> head <b>node</b> directly.

At last, simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{wireless}} sensor networks {{continue to}} grow, so does the need for effective security mechanisms. But {{one of the main}} challenges for efficient key distribution in {{wireless sensor networks}} is the resource limitation. Some nodes {{play a central role in}} key distribution. For example, cluster heads in the LEAP security protocol have the main responsibility for key distribution to their <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes.</b> Therefore, they use more resources than other <b>nodes</b> in their <b>cluster.</b> In case of a cluster head failure, e. g. battery wear out, all <b>nodes</b> within the <b>cluster</b> lose their connection to the base station and considered dead by the base station although the <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> are alive. The unavailability of the base station has a similar implication too, but in a wider extent covering all live cluster heads and <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> in the network leading to the failure of the whole network. This paper presents a new energy aware key distribution solution to enhance the availability of a secure wireless sensor network environment by increasing the lifetime of all constituents of the network including the base station, cluster heads and <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R

50|$|The above {{described}} mechanisms only {{resolve the}} issues with LVM's {{access to the}} storage. The file system selected {{to be on top}} of such LVs must either support clustering by itself (such as GFS2 or VxFS) or it must only be mounted by a single <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> at any time (such as in an active-passive configuration).|$|E
50|$|The {{architecture}} of a diskless computer cluster {{makes it possible}} to separate servers and storage array. The operating system as well as the actual reference data (userfiles, databases or websites) are stored competitively on the attached storage system in a centralized manner. Any server that acts as a <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> can be easily exchanged by demand.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distributed}} lock {{manager is}} used to broker concurrent LVM metadata accesses. Whenever a <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> needs to modify the LVM metadata, it must secure permission from its local , which is in constant contact with other [...] daemons in the cluster and can communicate a desire to get a lock on {{a particular set of}} objects.|$|E

5000|$|As {{each new}} node is booted it will locate one <b>cluster</b> <b>node,</b> then {{negotiate}} its {{entry into the}} cluster. If the IP address of a node is not supplied to the booting node, it will multicast for one. The first responding node {{will be used as}} the point of negotiation. The local CHAOS node initiates an IPSEC tunnel to the elected negotiation node using a pre-shared key. If the tunnel fails to establish, the new node is unable to join the cluster. With the tunnel established the new node requests a copy of the openMosix cluster map from the negotiating <b>cluster</b> <b>node.</b> The new node then repeats this process with every node in the cluster map; establishing an IPSEC tunnel, validating the cluster map, then moving on. In this way, every node is interconnected with every other node by [...] "n-1" [...] IPSEC tunnel connections. All openMosix cluster communications are then said to be authenticated and encrypted via the CHAOS platform.|$|E
50|$|A cluster-aware {{application}} is a software application designed to call cluster APIs {{in order to}} determine its running state, in case a manual failover is triggered between cluster nodes for planned technical maintenance, or an automatic failover is required, if a computing <b>cluster</b> <b>node</b> encounters hardware or software failure, to maintain business continuity.

It {{is not yet}} trivial to program applications that use multiple GPU-enabled <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> efficiently. A key aspect of this is managing effective communication between GPU memory on separate devices on separate nodes. We develop a algorithmic framework for Finite-Difference numerical simulations that would normally require highly synchronous data-parallelism so they can effectively use loosely coupled GPU-enabled <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes.</b> We employ asynchronous communications and appropriate memory overlay of computations and communications to hide latency...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) applications have tended to transmit data hop by hop, from sensor <b>nodes</b> through <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> to the base station. As a result, users must collect data from the base station. This study considers two different applications: hop by hop transmission of data from <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> to the base station and the direct access to <b>cluster</b> <b>nodes</b> data by mobile users via mobile devices. Due to the hardware limitations of WSNs, some low-cost operations such as symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are used to implement a dynamic key management. The session key can be updated to prevent threats of attack from each communication. With these methods, the data gathered in {{wireless sensor network}}s can be more securely communicated. Moreover, the proposed scheme is analyzed and compared with related schemes. In addition, an NS 2 simulation is developed in which the experimental {{results show that the}} designed communication protocol is workable...|$|R
