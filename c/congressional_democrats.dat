5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} to the Senate in a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
25|$|Congressional Republicans deftly {{decided to}} remain silent on the matter, denying <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> the {{opportunity}} to use them as a unifying force. Republicans then watched from the sidelines as the Democratic party split itself in the ensuing Senate fight.|$|E
50|$|Norcross {{announced}} his candidacy February 5, {{and within a}} week, he was endorsed by every New Jersey <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrat,</b> State Senate President Stephen Sweeney, General Assembly Majority Leader Louis Greenwald, Mayor of Camden Dana Redd, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, and former Governor Jim Florio.|$|R

25|$|Despite an {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority, the 86th United States Congress {{was not able}} to accomplish much of their agenda since the President had immense popularity and a veto pen. With the 1960 elections nearing, <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> sought issues on which they could conspicuously oppose the Republican administration. The Strauss nomination proved tailor made.|$|E
25|$|Without {{enough cash}} {{to pay out}} its Lehman-related debts, AIG went under and was nationalized. Credit markets locked up and {{catastrophe}} seemed all too likely. Paulson proposed providing liquidity to financial markets by having the government buy up debt related to bad mortgages with a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> advocated an alternative policy of investing in financial companies directly. Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized both policies.|$|E
25|$|By {{creating}} state-level marketplaces or exchanges, {{enough people}} could form pools to obtain cost-effective coverage. Furthermore, the law provided {{federal funding for}} states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs. The vast majority of <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> voted for the law, while no Republicans in the House {{and only a few}} in the Senate did so. Republicans, mainly in the House of Representatives, attempted on as many as 60 occasions to repeal, defund, or delay the law during Obama's tenure, but to no avail.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
25|$|Though debt {{almost always}} {{increased}} under every {{president in the}} latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan. In addition to the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large trade deficits. Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed. Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats.</b> He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Reagan's {{support for}} an {{increased}} defense budget {{at the height of}} the Cold War was supported by <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Republicans. However, Congress was reluctant to follow Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic programs. In accordance with Reagan's less-government intervention views, many domestic government programs were cut or experienced periods of reduced funding during his presidency. These included Social Security, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and federal education programs. Though Reagan protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, in one of the most widely criticized actions of the administration, the administration attempted to purge tens of thousands of allegedly disabled people from the Social Security disability roles, who the administration alleged were not truly disabled. Funding for government organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, were also reduced. He cut the EPA's budget by 22%, and his director of the EPA, Anne M. Burford, resigned over alleged mismanagement of funds. Tax breaks and increased military spending created a larger budget deficit, which led Reagan to approve two tax increases, aiming to preserve funding for Social Security.|$|E

25|$|Though 8 {{million workers}} {{remained}} unemployed in 1936, economic conditions had improved since 1932 and Roosevelt was widely popular. An attempt by Huey Long and other individuals {{to organize a}} left-wing alternative to the Democratic Party collapsed after Long's death in 1935. Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority. The Republicans nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a well-respected but bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover. While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved {{of the goals of}} the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation. In the 1936 presidential election, Roosevelt and Garner won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont. The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote and the electoral vote since the 1820 presidential election. <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> also expanded their majorities, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in both houses of Congress. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic {{for the first time since}} the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Like his predecessor, Obama pursued {{free trade}} agreements, {{in part due}} to the lack of {{progress}} at the Doha negotiations in lowering trade barriers worldwide. In October 2011, the United States entered into free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Congressional Republicans overwhelmingly supported the agreements, while <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> cast a mix of votes. The three agreements had originally been negotiated by the Bush administration, but Obama re-opened negotiations with each country and changed some terms of each deal. Obama also promoted two significantly larger, multilateral free trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with several Pacific Rim countries, and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. TPP negotiations began under President Bush, and Obama continued them as part of a long-term strategy that sought to refocus U.S. power to East Asia. The size and scope of the TPP negotiations grew under Obama until it included twelve countries, including Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, and Canada. The Obama administration received heavy criticism from citizen activists and members of the Democratic Party for the lack of transparency in the negotiations, as well as the presence of corporate representatives who assisted in the drafting process. After years of negotiations, the 12 countries reached a final agreement on the content of the TPP in October 2015, and the full text of the treaty was made public in November 2015. In July 2015, Congress passed a bill giving trade promotion authority to the president until 2021; trade promotion authority requires Congress to vote up or down on trade agreements signed by the president, with no possibility of amendments or filibusters. The TPP became a major campaign issue in the 2016 elections, with both major party presidential nominees opposing its ratification. In January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order pulling the United States out of the TPP negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} the Baird and Wood picks, along with Lani Guinier's failed {{nomination}} (for unrelated reasons) to Assistant Attorney General for Department of Justice Civil Rights Division a few months later, made <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> cautious in endorsing future Clinton personnel choices. [...] When federal judge Stephen Breyer was first considered for a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy in mid-1993, he was not selected, {{in part because he}} too had a 'Zoë Baird problem' (he would be nominated and confirmed the following year, following another vacancy).|$|E
50|$|In the 1892 <b>congressional</b> elections, <b>Democrats</b> {{retained}} {{control of}} the House and won {{a majority in the}} Senate. The resulting 53rd United States Congress was the only time between the Civil War and 1913 that Democrats had unified {{control of the}} presidency and both houses of Congress.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Beard was {{appointed}} Tennessee personnel commissioner by newly elected Republican Governor Winfield Dunn. In 1972, {{he entered the}} GOP primary for the newly reconfigured 6th <b>Congressional</b> District. <b>Democrats</b> {{in the state legislature}} shifted several Republican-trending portions near Memphis into the Sixth and removed several solidly Democratic areas.|$|R
5000|$|McKinney {{garnered}} little support. Not one <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrat</b> {{chose to}} join her {{at a news conference}} to discuss the situation at Howard University, although Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sent a supportive statement to be read at the event. Initially stating on March 31 that she [...] "wouldn't make a big deal" [...] out of the incident, Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Cal.) later said on April 5 that she [...] "found it hard to see any set of facts that would justify striking a police officer," [...] and McKinney's fellow Georgia Democrat, Rep. John Lewis, told McKinney that [...] "she needs to lower the temperature and stop holding press conferences." [...] Outside of Capitol Hill, the Sarasota Democratic Party withdrew from a rally at which McKinney was due to speak.|$|R
500|$|During the 1991 Gulf War, Rangel {{demanded that}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell {{investigate}} allegations of discrimination from black {{members of the}} New York Army National Guard regarding combat training and treatment. [...] During the Clinton administration, Rangel did battle with executive branch officials over budget items {{almost as much as}} he had during Republican administrations, and always resented when Clinton negotiated directly with Republicans while bypassing <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats.</b> [...] In 1993, however, Rangel was a key sponsor of increases to the Earned Income Tax Credit that passed.|$|E
500|$|<b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{and health}} policy experts like MIT {{economics}} professor Jonathan Gruber and David Cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate {{to ensure that}} adverse selection and/or [...] "free riding" [...] would not result in an insurance [...] "death spiral". This approach was taken because the president and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans, such as the (single-payer) Medicare for All act, could not obtain filibuster-proof support in the Senate. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas—the same basic outline was supported by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell—the bill's drafters hoped to garner the votes necessary for passage.|$|E
500|$|The {{triumph over}} Tammany {{paved the way}} for Tilden's {{election}} to a two-year term as governor in 1874. As a popular, reformist governor of a large swing state, Tilden was a natural candidate for the presidency in 1876, when one of the main issues was the corruption of the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant. He was nominated on the second ballot, and campaigned on a platform of reform and sound money (i.e. the gold standard). His opponent was Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, likewise noted for his honesty and hard-money views. [...] After the closely contested election, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the dispute to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. [...] Tilden opposed the idea, but many Democrats supported it as the only way to avoid a second Civil War. The commission voted 8–7 to award Hayes the disputed votes. <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> acquiesced in Hayes's election, but at a price: the new Republican president withdrew federal troops from Southern capitals after his inauguration. Tilden was defeated—robbed, in his opinion and that of his supporters.|$|E

2500|$|On July 30, 2007, Tancredo [...] "criticized <b>Congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> for {{eliminating}} {{a requirement}} that anyone applying for Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) services provide proof of U.S. citizenship". According to Tancredo, [...] "he new Democrat plan would raise taxes and {{make it easier for}} illegal aliens to obtain taxpayer-funded medical benefits." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, a {{group of}} <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> criticized McCain for voting against 2005 {{legislation}} that would have toughened sanctions against Iran. [...] "McCain tries {{to give the impression}} that he's tough on Iran, but when it came time to stand up to party leaders and Big Oil, John McCain stood down," [...] said senator Frank Lautenberg.|$|E
2500|$|Gabbard did {{not join}} the 169 <b>congressional</b> <b>Democrats</b> who signed a letter of {{opposition}} to Stephen Bannon's appointment as Trump's chief strategist, but she cosponsored a bill to remove Bannon from the National Security Council. Bannon has {{described himself as a}} [...] "big fan" [...] of Gabbard; according to one source, [...] "He loves Tulsi Gabbard," [...] and another source said that he [...] "wants to work with her on everything." ...|$|E
50|$|Republican Paul Sanford {{defeated}} Representative Hall in {{the special}} election to fill the District 7 State Senate Seat vacated {{earlier this year when}} the incumbent Parker Griffith was elected to the United States House of Representative representing Alabama’s 5th <b>Congressional</b> District. <b>Democrat</b> Laura Hall continues to represent District 19 after re-elections in 2010 and 2014.|$|R
