40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{characterize}} the expression patterns of tenascin-C (TN-C) splice variants in normal <b>corneas</b> {{and in those}} affected by pseudophakic-aphakic bullous keratopathy (PBK-ABK). METHODS. Alternatively spliced variants of TN-C mRNA from normal and age-matched human <b>corneas</b> with PBK-ABK were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot hybridization, using / 32 -microglobulin as a housekeeping gene to normalize the samples. Normal and PBK-ABK <b>corneas</b> were studied by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis with antibodies to specific fibronectin type Ill-like (FN-III) repeats of TN-C. RESULTS. Tenascin-C mRNA expression was detected in epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells of normal and PBK-ABK central <b>corneas,</b> although the protein was seen only in diseased <b>corneas.</b> Assessed by RT-PCR, PBK-ABK <b>corneas</b> expressed approximately three times more total TN-C mRNA than did normal <b>corneas.</b> Four major TN-C mRNA variants (with no FN-III insertional repeats or with retained insertional repeats D, Al, or Al+D) and three minor variants (with retained repeats A 1 +A 2, A 1 +A 2 +D, or A 1 +A 2 +B+D) were much more abundant in PBK-ABK than in normal <b>corneas.</b> Repeat Al was more abundant in PBK-ABK TN-C protein than repeats A 2, A 3, B, or D.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} {{aimed to explore}} the {{feasibility}} of using antisense connexin (Cx) treatment to promote corneal wound healing, and to investigate the changes of Cx gap junction proteins in terms of mRNA, protein expression and distribution in human <b>corneas</b> that were diseased due to various causes. A total of 13 diseased <b>corneas</b> were studied, which were obtained from five eyes injured by chemical burns, five infected eyes and three eyes with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) -affected <b>corneas.</b> Total RNA was extracted from the <b>corneas</b> and processed by qPCR with isoform primers to detect the expression of eight Cxs. Flow cytometry was adopted to determine {{the differences in the}} expression levels of Cx 26, Cx 31. 1 and Cx 43. Immunofluorescence was employed to show the localization of the three aforementioned Cxs. The qPCR results indicated that of the eight Cxs, only Cx 26, Cx 31. 1 and Cx 43 were upregulated in diseased <b>corneas.</b> Flow cytometry showed that all the diseased corneal tissues, with the excep-tion of the SJS-affected <b>corneas,</b> showed a significantly higher percentage of cells that expressed Cx 26 and Cx 31. 1 compared with the percentage in normal <b>corneas</b> (P< 0. 05). For Cx 43, all three injured corneal groups showed a significantly higher percentage of cells that expressed Cx 43 compared with the percentage in normal <b>corneas</b> (P< 0. 05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the localization of Cx 26, Cx 31. 1 and Cx 43 differed between normal <b>corneas</b> and diseased <b>corneas.</b> This study elucidated the alteration of Cx expression patterns in several corneal diseases. The results indicated that Cx 26, Cx 31. 1 and Cx 43 are upregulated in chemically burned and infected <b>corneas</b> at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas only Cx 43 is upregulated in SJS-affected <b>corneas...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Corneas</b> with {{scars and}} certain chronic {{pathologic}} conditions contain highly sulfated dermatan sulfate, but {{little is known}} of the core proteins that carry these atypical glycosaminoglycans. In this study the proteoglycan proteins attached to dermatan sulfate in normal and pathologic human <b>corneas</b> were examined to identify primary genes involved in the pathobiology of corneal scarring. METHODS: Proteoglycans from human <b>corneas</b> with chronic edema, bullous keratopathy, and keratoconus and from normal <b>corneas</b> were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), quantitative immunoblotting, and immunohistology with peptide antibodies to decorin and biglycan. RESULTS: Proteoglycans from pathologic <b>corneas</b> exhibit increased size heterogeneity and binding of the cationic dye alcian blue compared with those in normal <b>corneas.</b> Decorin and biglycan extracted from normal and diseased <b>corneas</b> exhibited similar molecular size distribution patterns. In {{approximately half of the}} pathologic <b>corneas,</b> the level of biglycan was elevated an average of seven times above normal, and decorin was elevated approximately three times above normal. The increases were associated with highly charged molecular forms of decorin and biglycan, indicating modification of the proteins with dermatan sulfate chains of increased sulfation. Immunostaining of corneal sections showed an abnormal stromal localization of biglycan in pathologic <b>corneas.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The increased dermatan sulfate associated with chronic corneal pathologic conditions results from stromal accumulation of decorin and particularly of biglycan in the affected <b>corneas.</b> These proteins bear dermatan sulfate chains with increased sulfation compared with normal stromal proteoglycans...|$|R

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the <b>cornea</b> caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light.

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the <b>cornea,</b> damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{explore the}} {{potential}} for adenovirus-mediated ex vivo gene transfer of a soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and evaluate the effect of transplanting the adenovirally transplanted <b>corneas</b> in vivo. METHODS. Rabbit corneal segments were transfected with replication-deficient adenovirus (AdTNFR) encoding a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein (TNFR-Ig). Production of TNFR-Ig was measured by using ELISA and bioassay. <b>Corneas</b> were transfected ex vivo with AdTNFR and then transplanted in vivo. Survival of AdTNFR-transfected <b>corneas</b> was {{compared with that of}} those treated either with a null vector control adenovirus (Ad 0) or nontransfected control <b>corneas.</b> RESULTS. Ex vivo production of a molecule with TNF blocking bioactivity from AdTNFR-transfected <b>corneas</b> was demonstrated over a period of 4 weeks. Transplanted AdTNFR-transfected <b>corneas</b> showed a marginally increased survival time in vivo over nontransfected control <b>corneas,</b> but a significantly increased survival time over Ad 0 -treated control <b>corneas.</b> Ad 0 treatment of corneal allografts before transplantation had a proinflammatory effect and accelerated the onset of corneal endothelial rejection. CONCLUSIONS. Adenoviral gene transfer is an effective means of transferring a gene encoding soluble TNFR-Ig to corneal endothelium, and ex vivo production of a biologically active secreted molecule was demonstrated for 4 weeks. However, in vivo, only a marginally increased survival was seen compared with control <b>corneas.</b> The introduction of this transgene using a less immunogenic vector may demonstrate prolongation of corneal allograft survival.

5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and <b>cornea,</b> leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the <b>cornea</b> and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The <b>cornea</b> has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to detect viral transcripts in the <b>corneas</b> of latently infected rabbits with a history of herpetic keratitis to determine whether the viral DNA represents latent virus, characterized by the restricted transcription of HSV genes and accumulation of the stable latency-associated transcripts (LATs), as occurs in neurons. METHODS. Rabbits were injected in the subalveolar mucosa with HSV strain RE. After 30 days, <b>corneas</b> were infected by intrastromal injection of HSV.

5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and <b>cornea</b> correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a <b>cornea,</b> retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids.
