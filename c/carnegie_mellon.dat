5|$|Druckmann {{soon became}} a {{research}} assistant at Florida State University, while living in Tallahassee, Florida. He spent {{a year at the}} university working at the Visualization Lab within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game Pink-Bullet, for Linux and Microsoft Windows, with some friends. At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so. After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference, and began a Bachelor of Computer Science in December 2002, which he completed the following year. Druckmann moved to Pittsburgh, where he attended <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University; in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology, which he earned in 2005 from the Entertainment Technology Center. In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a student at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon,</b> in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.|$|E
5|$|Pausch {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland, {{and grew up in}} Columbia, Maryland.

5|$|MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare {{movement}} {{started in}} 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its timms initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server). The OCW movement only took off, however, with {{the launch of}} MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University in October 2002.

5|$|In high school, Hawke {{aspired to}} be a writer, but {{developed}} an interest in acting. He made his stage debut at age 13, in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, and appearances in West Windsor-Plainsboro High School productions of Meet Me in St. Louis and You Can't Take It with You followed. At the Hun School he took acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus, and after high school graduation he studied acting at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University in Pittsburgh, eventually dropping out after he was cast in Dead Poets Society (1989). He twice enrolled in New York University's English program, but dropped out both times to pursue acting roles.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Carnegie, an {{immigrant}} from Scotland, a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded {{to play a}} key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut {{attended}} Cornell University, but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, {{with whom he had}} three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband died in a train accident.|$|E

5|$|Pausch was an {{assistant}} and {{associate professor in the}} Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science from 1988 until 1997. While there, he completed sabbaticals at Walt Disney Imagineering and Electronic Arts (EA). In 1997, Pausch became Associate Professor of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon</b> University. In 1998, he was a co-founder, along with Don Marinelli, of CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), and he started the Building Virtual Worlds course at CMU, which he taught for 10 years. He consulted with Google on user interface design and also consulted with PARC, Imagineering, and Media Metrix. Pausch is also the founder of the Alice software project. He received the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award and was a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow. Pausch was the author or co-author of five books and over 70 articles.|$|E
5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon,</b> to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Mellon,</b> he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E
