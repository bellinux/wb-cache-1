5|$|The son of Leslie Keith Davidson and Hilda Aileen Clifton, Davidson {{grew up in}} Lisarow, New South Wales (NSW) {{near the}} city of Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. He learnt to play cricket on a pitch that he dug out of a hill on his family's rural property. By the age of nine, he was playing in the second {{division}} of the Gosford grade competition. Throughout his high school years, he represented Northern High Schools in the state combined public schools' competition where he played against his future Test captain Richie Benaud, who captained City High Schools. During his teenage years, Davidson kept fit by working on the family property, <b>chopping</b> <b>wood</b> and carrying farm produce.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, <b>chopping</b> <b>wood</b> and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

25|$|His fellow captives {{included}} many political prisoners, who {{were forced to}} perform hard labour for many years. Reunited with his brother Ganesh, the Savarkars nevertheless struggled in the harsh environment: Forced to arise at 5am, tasks including cutting trees and <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> and working at the oil mill under regimental strictness, with talking amidst prisoners strictly prohibited during mealtime. Prisoners were subject to frequent mistreatment and torture. Contact {{with the outside world}} and home was restricted to the writing and mailing of one letter a year. In these years, Savarkar withdrew within himself and performed his routine tasks mechanically. Obtaining permission to start a rudimentary jail library, Savarkar would also teach some fellow convicts to read and write.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|E
500|$|The {{gardens and}} {{outbuildings}} {{of the property}} were designed to Fletcher Steele's vision of what colonial garden should be. [...] He drew on ideas seen in the gardens of George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon to design a property where [...] "a hundred forms of industry were carried on". Rows of vegetables, fruit trees, and bushes, were lined with flowers for aesthetic appeal, and spaces for carved out that he envisioned would {{have been used for}} performing outdoor work such as <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> churning butter, and preparing preserves. [...] Echoing statements made in his Design of a Little Garden, published just a few years earlier, Steele laid out the outbuildings in such a way to provide the homeowners a private retreat.|$|E

500|$|Typical work duties at Brook Farm {{included}} <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> {{bringing in}} firewood, milking cows, turning a grindstone, and other farming chores. Not all were farmers, however. Some {{worked in the}} trades, including making shoes, and others were teachers. Regardless of the job, all were considered equal {{and because of the}} job distribution, as Elizabeth Peabody wrote, [...] "no one has any great weight in any one thing". In exchange for their work, participants were granted several [...] "guarantees", including [...] "medical attendance, nursing, education in all departments, amusements". There were some occasional conflicts between different workers, partly because those who were educators believed themselves more aristocratic; overall, however, as historian Charles Crowe wrote, [...] "indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction" [...] in general.|$|E

A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not looked at his finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April 1878, Constable Strachan, {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} Greta police station, learned that Kelly was at a certain {{shearing}} shed and went to apprehend him. As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kellys, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. He was instructed to proceed directly to Greta but instead rode to the public house at Winton, five miles from Benalla police headquarters, where he spent considerable time. On resuming his journey, he remembered that a couple of days previously he had seen in The Police Gazette an arrest warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He went to the Kelly house to arrest him, despite a police policy that at least two constables participate in visits to the Kelly homestead. Finding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone <b>chopping</b> <b>wood,</b> he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William [...] "Bricky" [...] Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land. (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kellys and was arrested there when he refused to give information about the Kellys.) Fitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and took a seat near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. A struggle followed, and the brothers, assisted by their mother, Williamson and Skillian, soon over-powered the constable, and he was beaten to the ground insensible. On regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped. On regaining safety he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer.|$|E
