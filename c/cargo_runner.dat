50|$|The player {{character}} and protagonist {{of the game}} is Max, a Federation Agent ordered by Federation Commodore Adrian to infiltrate the Noir Dyne ranks disguised as a <b>cargo</b> <b>runner.</b> Just outside the Ice Planet, he joins with the Noir Dyne vessel, STX Darkstar, in order to retrieve a bio-toxin sample and return it to the Federation for further study. However, his cover is blown and the shipment received is a bomb. Having been warned of the trap by his Federation liaison Agent Ginger Malloy, Max aborts the mission, but now the chase is on. With the help of Ginger’s brief data bursts, Max must battle his way through enemy fighters, ground troops, robot weapons, and deadly alien Hivasects to destroy the Hive and save the galaxy.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessor, EV Override {{is fully}} {{open-ended}} {{and does not}} force the player {{to get involved in}} any of the game's plots, nor does it make a player continue a plot once they're in it. Players have the option to take the storylines and cause their actions to {{have a major impact on}} the galaxy. On the other hand, they can also simply become a commodity trader, <b>cargo</b> <b>runner,</b> or pirate and leave the galaxy to fend for itself. Players can purchase (or capture) and outfit many ships in the game as they see fit, allowing for many methods and styles for playing the game. Also, once they become powerful enough, players also have the option of forcing worlds to pay them daily tribute by destroying their defense fleets. This, however, may cause serious drops in their legal status elsewhere, and causes bounty hunters to start chasing them.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{critical}} initial need was replenishment of the base's stored munitions, 98% {{of which had}} been destroyed in the initial attack. The division diverted C-123s (the largest airlift aircraft capable of using the damaged runway) to meet this need. On return flights, division planes flew out refugees and casualties. [...] In the first two days, the division was able to replenish 120 tons of munitions, conducting night operations by the light of flares. By the end of the month, runway repairs permitted C-130 operations to resume. [...] Division aircraft landing at Khe Sanh were referred to as [...] "mortar magnets" [...] because of their attractiveness as targets for enemy fire. The transports used a technique called [...] "speed offloading" [...] to deliver their <b>cargo.</b> <b>Runners</b> were fixed to the planes' rear ramps and onboard pallets, and as the planes taxied, the pallets were released and rolled off the planes impelled by the planes' motion and [...] "vigorous kicks" [...] by their loadmasters. [...] Even adding in additional time to onload passengers, a typical C-123K sortie was on the ground for only three minutes.|$|R
5000|$|HMS E35 was a British E class {{submarine}} {{built by}} John Brown, Clydebank. She was laid down on 20 May 1916 and was commissioned on 14 July 1917. E35 sank [...] (one of the 1,512 ton U-boat cruisers originally designed as <b>cargo</b> carrying blockade <b>runners)</b> {{off the island}} of Madeira on 11 May 1918. This sinking was helped by British intelligence who had learned of a planned rendezvous between two U-boats off Cape St Vincent. E35 was sold in Newcastle on 6 September 1922.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The drift and {{spreading}} of the Runner 4 {{oil spill in}} the ice-covered Gulf of Finland is analysed. The oil spill {{was caused by the}} sinking of the Dominican-registered <b>cargo</b> ship <b>Runner</b> 4 on 5 March 2006, after collision with the Malta-registered cargo ship Svjatoi Apostol Andrey. This oil spill was very difficult to detect in the first week due to severe ice conditions. Combating operations started when the wind pushed the ice floes away and the spill was observed in open sea areas. Two efforts were made to collect and control the oil spill, one during 1519 March and the other on 9 April. A sea ice dynamics model is employed to simulate the evolution of the ice conditions. A comparison between the oil spill coverage and the sea ice movement suggests that part of the oil followed with the ice while the other part of it must have drifted together with the surface current. The observations also show that the oil was continuously leaking from the hole in {{the left side of the}} Runner 4, at least until 9 April...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will seek}} to examine the tension between nineteenth-century Southern gender {{expectations}} of upper-class femininity contrasted with the necessities of wartime and determine if this tension {{is evident in the}} material record by analyzing the cargo of Confederate blockade runners entering the affluent ports of Wilmington and Charleston. By examining the <b>cargo</b> from blockade <b>runners,</b> as well as analyzing historical records, research will lead to conclusions about what women wanted to buy during the Civil War. It will compare these demands with the new notions of simplicity and sacrifice that theoretically defined the Confederacy, in order to better understand gender expectations during this period...|$|R

5000|$|Harding {{was born}} in 1837 in Middletown, Connecticut. He served during the Civil War as a captain of the {{forecastle}} on the [...] On June 9, 1864, the blockade runner Pevensey was chased down, run aground near Beaufort, North Carolina, and suffered a boiler explosion. Harding and others took a small boat from Dacotah to Pevensey and loaded it {{with some of the}} blockade <b>runner's</b> <b>cargo</b> of arms and uniforms. While returning to Dacotah through heavy surf, the small boat began to take on water and sank. Harding tried to help an officer who could not swim, Acting Master's Mate Jarvis G. Farrar, but was unsuccessful and Farrar drowned. For this attempt, Harding was awarded the Medal of Honor six months later on December 31, 1864.|$|R
