5|$|Largely non-religious, Heinrich {{was a man}} of the Enlightenment, {{interested}} in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, then governed by an absolute monarchy. In 1815, Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra. His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> for loans while they were exiled in London.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos I was {{the last}} of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, {{although}} his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his violent death, had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely.</b> Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west. In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west. It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1964 Paz Estenssoro {{decided to}} run again for president, and {{accepted}} General René Barrientos Ortuño as vice presidential candidate. Because most opposition groups abstained, Paz Estenssoro was reelected {{with the support of}} the military and the peasants. Paz Estenssoro had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> increasingly on the military, whose role as a peacekeeper had made it an arbiter in politics. But this support was to prove unreliable; the military was already planning to overthrow him.|$|E
25|$|The Silures {{resisted}} this invasion fiercely {{from their}} mountain strongholds, but the Romans eventually prevailed. In time, relative peace was established and the Penydarren fortress was abandoned by about 120 AD. This had an unfortunate effect upon the local economy, which had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> upon supplying the fortress with beef and grain, and imported {{items such as}} oysters from the coast. Intermarriage with local women had occurred and many auxiliary veterans had settled locally on farms.|$|E
50|$|The series {{began with}} a variety format, with mixed success. The program {{increasingly}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on adaptations of major motion pictures—presenting a considerable challenge to writers who had to compress the narrative into 22 minutes.|$|R

25|$|The natural diet of many corvid {{species is}} omnivorous, {{consisting}} of invertebrates, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and carrion. However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions and have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on anthropogenic foods. In a US study of American crows, common ravens and Steller's jays around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows {{appeared to have}} the most diverse diet of all, taking anthropogenic foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available anthropogenic food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the game}} world, kender names are chosen {{from a wide}} range of sources such as recent events, an {{existing}} relative, or from items found in kender pouches, such as Bearchase, Lockpick, and Fruitthrow. As children, they constantly ask questions and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on family and friends for needs, and they begin to take part in community activities. As they age, kender children gain education by hearing stories, desiring to acquire new skills, and playing games. They also begin handling and wandering. As kender reach the adolescent and teen-aged years, they become more active participants in Kender Moots, social gatherings where the youth can show off their newly found skills in games and demonstrations. As they near adulthood, kender experience intense wanderlust and leave home.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{was part}} of a wider plan to improve science {{provision}} at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education, when he taught drawing classes (assisted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti) at the Working Men's College, established by the Christian socialists, Frederick James Furnivall and Frederick Denison Maurice. Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment. One result of this involvement was Ruskin's Elements of Drawing (1857). He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals. It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely,</b> such as his future publisher, George Allen.|$|E
50|$|Even after Melbourne {{resigned}} {{permanently in}} August 1841, Victoria continued {{to write to}} him, but eventually the correspondence ceased as it was seen as inappropriate.

25|$|In 1864, Taylor {{defeated}} Union General Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign with {{a smaller}} force, commanding the Confederate forces in the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 8-9. He pursued Banks back to the Mississippi River and, for his efforts, received the thanks of the Confederate Congress. At these two battles, the two commanders whom Taylor had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on: Brigadier Generals Alfred Mouton and Thomas Green, were killed while leading their men into combat. On April 8, 1864, Taylor was promoted to lieutenant general, despite having asked to be relieved because of his distrust of his superior in the campaign, General Edmund Kirby Smith. The Congress of the Confederate States issued a joint resolution, which officially thanked Taylor and his soldiers for their military service during the Red River Campaign.|$|E
25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in {{foraging}} activity, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
500|$|Still, Oppenheimer was {{not well}} known before the war, and {{certainly}} not as renowned as his friend and colleague Ernest O. Lawrence, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron. But as an experimental physicist, Lawrence had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on Oppenheimer, and it was Lawrence who brought Oppenheimer into the effort to develop an atomic bomb, which {{became known as the}} Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who became director of the Manhattan Project on [...] September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on his work on the [...] "Super" [...] (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory. Groves agreed, and after a second meeting with Oppenheimer on a train on October 15, decided that Oppenheimer was the man he needed to head what became the Los Alamos Laboratory, despite Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize or administrative experience.|$|E

500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Cale {{suffered}} from severe bronchial issues, {{which led to}} a doctor prescribing him opiates. He would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the drug in order to fall asleep.

Cale later told an interviewer that, [...] "When I got to New York, drugs were everywhere, and they quickly became part of my artistic experiment".|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} urge to breathe is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood and not by the reduction of oxygen. [...] The body can actually detect low levels of oxygen {{but this is not}} normally perceptible prior to blackout. [...] Persistently elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, hypercapnia (the opposite to hypocapnia), tend to desensitise the body to carbon dioxide, in which case the body may <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the oxygen level in the blood to maintain respiratory drive. This is illustrated in the scenario of type II respiratory failure. However, in a normal healthy person there is no subjective awareness of low oxygen levels.|$|E
50|$|After regaining Ghostwheel's trust, Merlin <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> {{heavily on}} his {{powerful}} creation, and Ghostwheel features as a major subcharacter throughout Merlin's saga.

50|$|When it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> on {{indicators}} <b>to</b> measure, {{what matters}} is not the number of followers or friends, nor the number of publications, but their acceptance by other consumers or companies.

25|$|Chifley, {{a former}} train driver, had no {{training}} in economics and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> heavily on Coombs's advice.

2500|$|Halliwell {{had felt}} {{increasingly}} threatened and isolated by Orton's success, and had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on antidepressants and barbiturates. The bodies were discovered {{the following morning}} when a chauffeur arrived to take Orton to a meeting with director Richard Lester to discuss filming options on Up Against It. Halliwell left a suicide note, informing police that: [...] "If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter part." [...] This is presumed to be a reference to Orton's description of his promiscuity; the diary contains numerous incidents of cottaging in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters, including with rent boys on holiday in North Africa. The diaries have since been published.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} all that has happened, it appears {{inappropriate}} for the MEC to deny {{the request of the}} local 14th medical examiner district to defer any further action until Dr. Siebert has been afforded the opportunity through normal proceedings to both defend his findings and refute the allegations against him as due process requires. ... Imposing sanctions against a medical examiner without requiring these theories to be tested by an impartial jury jeopardizes the independent judgment of the medical examiner that our system of government has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> upon precisely because of its independent objective inquiry. It is ironic that in Dr. Siebert's case the medical examiner has been denied the very protection that his presence in such judicial proceedings is meant to provide.|$|E
2500|$|Shortages {{of water}} between 1949 and 1986 {{led to the}} costly {{temporary}} expedient of importing water from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands or Morocco. On a few occasions, newly commissioned oil tankers were employed to carry up to [...] of water at a time, taking advantage of their maiden voyages to the Middle East to carry the water in tanks {{that had not yet}} been contaminated with oil products. Such an approach was unaffordable and since 1953, Gibraltar has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the desalination of sea water, which now accounts for over 90% of the potable water supply. The running costs are high, however, as the energy required means that the cost of acquiring water through desalination is about three times higher than getting it from wells. A refuse incinerator commissioned in 1993 used to contribute heat to help run the desalination system.|$|E
