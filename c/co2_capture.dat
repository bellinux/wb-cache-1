25|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} – Fossil fuels such as coal are {{burned in}} a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost <b>CO2</b> <b>capture.</b>|$|E
25|$|Next {{generation}} IGCC {{plants with}} <b>CO2</b> <b>capture</b> {{technology will be}} expected to have higher thermal efficiency and to hold the cost down because of simplified systems compared to conventional IGCC. The main feature is that instead of using oxygen and nitrogen to gasify coal, they use oxygen and CO2. The main advantage is {{that it is possible to}} improve the performance of cold gas efficiency and to reduce the unburned carbon (char).|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, Ca-looping offers greater cost {{advantage}} compared to conventional amine-scrubbing technologies. The cost/metric ton for <b>CO2</b> <b>captured</b> through Ca-looping is ~$23.70 whereas that for <b>CO2</b> <b>captured</b> through amine scrubbing is about $35-$96. [...] This {{can be attributed}} to the high availability and low cost of the CaO sorbent (derived from limestone) as compared to MEA. Also, as discussed in section 2, Ca-looping imposes a lower energy penalty than amine scrubbing, resulting in lower energy costs. The amine scrubbing process is energy intensive, with approximately 67% of the operating costs going into steam requirements for solvent regeneration. A more detailed comparison of Ca-looping and amine scrubbing is shown below.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{collaborative}} project {{sponsored by the}} U.S. DOE, MOFs were shown to separate 90% of the CO2 from the flue gas stream using a vacuum pressure swing process. The MOF Mg(dobdc) has a 21.7 wt% CO2 loading capacity. Estimations showed that, if a similar system would be applied to a large scale power plant, the cost of energy would increase by 65%, while a U.S. NETL baseline amine-based system would cause an increase of 81% (the U.S. DOE goal is 35%). The cost of <b>capturing</b> <b>CO2</b> [...] would be $57 / ton <b>CO2</b> <b>captured,</b> while for the amine system the cost {{is estimated to be}} $72 / ton <b>CO2</b> <b>captured.</b> The project estimated that the total capital required to implement such project in a 580 MW power plant would be $354 million.|$|R
50|$|Regeneration energy—Generally {{expressed}} in energy consumed per weight of <b>CO2</b> <b>captured</b> (e.g. 3,000 kJ/kg). These values, if calculated {{directly from the}} latent and sensible heat components of regeneration, measure {{the total amount of}} energy required for regeneration.|$|R
25|$|Carbon capture, utilization, and {{sequestration}} (or storage) {{is increasingly}} being utilized in modern coal gasification projects {{to address the}} greenhouse gas emissions concern {{associated with the use}} of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional coal combustion, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, energy-intensive, and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” <b>CO2</b> <b>capture).</b>|$|E
25|$|Currently Industrial-scale {{gasification}} {{is primarily}} {{used to produce}} electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially {{in the production of}} electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of <b>CO2</b> <b>capture</b> as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.|$|E
25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by <b>CO2</b> <b>capture</b> and storage.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, another {{interesting}} {{feature of the}} introduced hybrid system is on the gain of 100% <b>CO2</b> <b>capturing</b> at comparable high energy efficiency. These features like zero CO2 emission and high energy efficiency make the power plant performance noteworthy.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Bronfman {{also became}} a {{principal}} investor and advisor at Algae Systems, LLC, a third-generation bio-fuel company founded by Matthew Atwood that takes waste water from cities (using <b>CO2</b> <b>captured</b> by GT) and generates jet fuel and diesel.|$|R
50|$|Sensitivity Analysis: Figure 3 {{shows how}} varying 8 {{separate}} parameters affects the cost/metric ton of <b>CO2</b> <b>captured</b> through Ca-looping. It {{is evident that}} the dominant variables that affect cost are related to sorbent use, the Ca/C ratio and the CaO deactivation ratio. This is because the large sorbent quantities required dominate {{the economics of the}} capture process.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{of their}} small, tunable pore sizes and high void fractions, MOFs are a {{promising}} potential material {{for use as}} an adsorbent to capture CO2. [...] MOFs could provide a more efficient alternative to traditional amine solvent-based methods in <b>CO2</b> <b>capture</b> from coal-fired power plants.|$|E
2500|$|Dr Mark Diesendorf has {{suggested}} that the Australian Government has tried to stop the development of wind power, the lowest-cost, new, renewable electricity source, until such time as coal-fired power stations with <b>CO2</b> <b>capture</b> and sequestration and possibly nuclear power stations are available. However, [...] "clean coal" [...] technologies may not be commercially available for at least 20 years. Furthermore, to bring down the high cost of nuclear power to a level where it could compete with wind power would require a new generation of nuclear power stations that is still on the drawing board, which could take at least 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|In gasification, on {{the other}} hand, oxygen is {{normally}} supplied to the gasifiers and just enough fuel is combusted to provide the heat to gasify the rest; moreover, gasification is often performed at elevated pressure. The resulting syngas is typically at higher pressure and not diluted by nitrogen, allowing for much easier, efficient, and less costly removal of CO2. Gasification and integrated gasification combined cycle’s unique ability to easily remove CO2 from the syngas prior to its combustion in a gas turbine (called [...] "pre-combustion" [...] <b>CO2</b> <b>capture)</b> or its use in fuels or chemicals synthesis {{is one of its}} significant advantages over conventional coal utilization systems.|$|E

5000|$|Calcium looping is {{considered}} as potential promising solutions to reduce <b>CO2</b> [...] <b>capture</b> energy penalty. There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods.

Calcium looping is applicable for new builds and retrofits to existing power stations or other stationary industrial CO2 sources because the method can be implemented using large-scale circulating fluidized beds while other methods such as amine scrubbing is required a vastly upscale solvent scrubbing towers. [...] In addition, crushed limestone used in calcium looping as the sorbent is a natural product, which is well distributed all over the world, non-hazardous and inexpensive.

50|$|Once <b>CO2</b> is <b>captured</b> from a gas or {{coal-fired}} power plant, {{it would be}} compressed to ≈100 bar {{so that it would}} be a supercritical fluid. In this fluid form, the CO2 would be easy to transport via pipeline to the place of storage. The CO2 would then be injected deep underground, typically around 1 km, where it would be stable for hundreds to millions of years. At these storage conditions, the density of supercritical CO2 is 600 to 800 kg / m3. For consumers, the cost of electricity from a {{coal-fired power}} plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is estimated to be 0.01 - 0.05 $ / kWh higher than without CCS. For reference, the average cost of electricity in the US in 2004 was 0.0762 $ / kWh. In other terms, the cost of CCS would be 20 - 70 $/ton of <b>CO2</b> <b>captured.</b> The transportation and injection of CO2 is relatively cheap, with the capture costs accounting for 70 - 80% of CCS costs.|$|R
