The lady beetle, Curinus coeruleus (Mulsant), a {{biological}} control agent of the <b>coconut</b> <b>mealybug,</b> Nipaecoccus nipae (Maskell) and the psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, was examined {{for its ability to}} consume Aedes albopictus (Skuse) eggs in the laboratory. Most C. coeruleus larvae in this test preyed on A. albopictus eggs (75 % for the 2 nd and 3 rd instar and 71 % for the 4 th instar). The 2 nd and 3 rd instar larvae consumed an average of 51. 8 eggs compared to an average of 57. 7 eggs consumed by the 4 th instar larvae. The 2 nd and 3 rd instar larvae survived for an average of 5. 3 days, while the 4 th instar larvae survived for an average of 5. 6 days. Curinus coeruleus could not complete its life cycle by feeding only on A. albopictus eggs. Aedes albopictus eggs, which are available year round in Hawaii, may be a supplemental food source for C. coeruleus larvae when {{there is a shortage of}} psyllids...|$|E
