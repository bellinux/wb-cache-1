40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Nearly 20 {{years after}} inception, the Insurance Accounting {{project of the}} International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) is nearing completion. The {{recently}} published June 2013 International Financial Reporting Standard 4 (IFRS 4) Exposure Draft represents a likely picture {{of the future of}} global insurance financial reporting and it is important that insurers begin to understand and prepare for the changes it will bring. This dissertation explores the key principles and likely impacts of the IFRS 4 Phase II standard, in its current proposed form, in the South African life insurance context. In particular, the proposed IFRS 4 Phase II approach to profit reporting is contrasted with the current Financial Soundness Valuation (FSV) approach for simple illustrative term and endowment insurance products. The results of this comparison form the basis {{for a discussion of the}} impacts which the new profit reporting standard will have on insurance <b>contract</b> <b>liabilities</b> and hence profit profiles over time, and an assessment of whether the changes embodied in the new standard better meet the objectives of insurance financial reporting and the needs of the users of financial statements. This dissertation focusses on key areas where there is a high degree of certainty in the exposure draft, and touches more lightly on those areas where change is still expected. The findings indicate that IFRS 4 will result in insurer financial reporting being more principles-based, better meeting the requirements of fundamental financial reporting characteristics and being more comparable with insurer financial reporting internationally. These findings support the conclusion that a move to IFRS 4 for insurer financial reporting in South African will be beneficial to users of financial statements in making economic decisions...|$|E

40|$|Contractual {{liability}} proponents {{claim that}} states can best reform malpractice liability by allowing patients to contract over, and out of, liability. Proponents assert that informed patients {{would be better}} off if allowed to <b>contract</b> over <b>liability</b> than they would if states reformed malpractice liability directly because informed patients would contract for the rules that maximize their welfare. Proponents also claim states reforming malpractice liability could only benefit patients by including a right to <b>contract</b> out of <b>liability.</b> This article demonstrates that these claims are incorrect. Proponents’ faith in informed contracting rests on the incorrect premise that patients obtain the same net benefit from <b>liability</b> imposed by <b>contract</b> as from malpractice liability imposed by the state. Patients who benefit from the deterrence that malpractice liability provides are worse off if required to <b>contract</b> over <b>liability</b> because contractual liability is a fundamentally different, less beneficial, form of liability. Contractual liability is less beneficial and more costly than state-imposed malpractice liability because it is plagued by four inefficiencies: Collective goods, time inconsistency, adverse selection, and network externality problems. Thus, far from expanding choices, the move to contractual liability could hurt patients by forcing them into a form of liability that is both less valuable and more expensive, thereby creating inefficient, welfare-reducing, incentives to waive the right to impose <b>liability</b> by <b>contract</b> for patients who would have benefited from state-imposed liability. This conclusion holds whether patients negotiate <b>liability</b> <b>contracts</b> directly with individual physicians or accept standard form <b>contracts</b> governing malpractice <b>liability</b> offered by their health insurers...|$|R

40|$|American courts, {{particularly}} during the last decade, have become increasingly {{aware of the need}} for protecting the consumer against dangers inherent in the use of defective goods. In few other fields of law has Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s advice to treat rules of law as 2 ̆ 2 tentative working rules 2 ̆ 2 been more heeded. Continuously and relentlessly our law has expanded <b>contract</b> and tort <b>liability</b> so as to satisfy public needs.

There is an ever increasing tendency to permit the consumer injured by defective goods or services to reach the producer directly, if not with the help of contract law, then with the help of a revised law of torts. Not only has the decline of the rules of privity permitted the consumer to reach the producer, but product liability, in contrast to the tenets of classical tort law, is straining away from negligence.

The problems of partial consistency and partial redundancy in the data are discussed. The data mart system serves multiple purposes: beside clinical reporting and quality assessment, the preparation steps for comprehensive studies are enormously simplified.

50|$|Eucken's ordoliberalism, {{which is}} a special German variant of {{neoliberalism}} in its traditional definition, argues {{that the state has}} the task to provide the political framework for economic freedom to flourish. In contrast to laissez-faire, which by the 1930s had been observed to give rise to cartels and an undue concentration of power, ordoliberalism aims to put limits on the economic power of individuals, companies and associations. This is achieved through a legal and institutional framework, including maintenance of private property, enforcement of private <b>contracts,</b> <b>liability,</b> free entry to markets, and monetary stabilization. In this, the state should refrain from directing or intervening in the economic processes of daily practices, as in a centrally planned economy, but rather provide a well-functioning competitive Ordnung (order) in which private agents can act without frequent discretionary influence from the state.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multitask principal-agent model {{to examine how}} environmental liability rules for individual managers within a corporate hierarchy affect, on the one hand, the incentive schemes the organization provides and, on the other hand, the choice between a functional or a product-based organizational structure. If managers are risk neutral, a product-based organization dominates a functional organization and allows to obtain first-best effort level. If, moreover, there are no diseconomies of span, both organizational forms are equivalent. It is also shown that for the dominant function, effort levels are higher in a product-based organization than in a functional one. With risk averse managers, no organizational structure dominates the other in general, but {{we are able to}} identify under which conditions it does not matter who is held liable for environmental damages. <b>contracts,</b> <b>liability,</b> firm structure, principal-agent...|$|R
40|$|In Holding Health Care Accountable, E.

Focusing on disaster medicine, and especially the medical management of violent mass disasters (e. g., where terrorists have deployed weapons of mass destruction), I argue in this essay that Morreim’s classification of duties still fits, {{but that it is}} difficult to hold government powers accountable for their many resource and expertise duties. This difficulty is compounded by political arrangements that foist under-funded mandates for disaster services on healthcare providers. As a result of such arrangements, hospitals and clinicians are prone to liability for expenditures and clinical interventions that are beyond their scope. This problem can be mitigated, I argue, by examining and clarifying the apparent social compact between society and healthcare...|$|R

40|$|The remedy of {{expectancy}} {{damages in}} contract law is conventionally described as strict liability for breach. Parties sometimes stipulate damages in advance, and may {{agree that the}} damages they stipulate shall be the exclusive remedy for breach. They may do so because of their conviction that they can, even in advance, assess damages with greater accuracy than courts, {{and they may be}} wary of litigation costs associated with the postbreach determination of expectancy damages. This Article advances two claims. First, that the familiar expectation remedy is correctly understood to involve elements of fault. There is litigation over the question of fault with respect to the mitigation of damages. Stipulation, on the other hand, makes <b>contract</b> <b>liability</b> stricter because it takes the mitigation question away from courts. It allows less room for courts to modulate the remedy {{on the basis of the}} parties 2 ̆ 7 relative fault. Stipulation often encourages mitigation by one party, but then, to make up for the strict liability character, the parties may stipulate in a more detailed manner to encourage bilateral mitigation. Mitigation considerations should change the way we think about many stipulated remedies. Second, while law is generally described as being suspicious of or even hostile to, stipulation-in large part because courts refuse to enforce 2 ̆ 2 penalty 2 ̆ 2 clauses-in fact, law encourages stipulation. It does this by sometimes declining to award expectancy damages, often in the very situations where stipulation seems sensible, and also by providing expectancy damages where the award of stipulated damages is regarded as a penalty. These two claims illuminate cases on such diverse matters as residential leases, construction contracts, product warranties, service <b>contracts</b> with <b>liability</b> waivers, and no-show customers and their service providers...|$|R
