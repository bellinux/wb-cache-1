A two kilometers causeway construction was built which is situated on the soft clay layer. In order to investigate the behavior of causeway embankment, a full-scale test was conducted of high embankment built on a soft clay deposit. The embankment with 3, 5 m high was supported by two types of reinforcement such as raft and raftaggregate <b>column</b> <b>foundation.</b> Since the ground was undergoing consolidation due to the preload, the raft and raft-aggregate <b>column</b> <b>foundations</b> were monitored in order to analyze the vertical ground movement by inducing the settlement of the foundation. In this study, two types of foundation (raft and raft-aggregate column) were tested to observe the effectiveness of raft-aggregate column compare to raft foundation in reducing the settlement.

40|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} inside Our Lady’s Basilica at Tongeren (Belgium), one of {{the most}} beautiful religious monuments in Belgium, are made possible through an adequate consolidation of the <b>columns</b> masonry <b>foundations.</b> The project includes a large archaeological excavation of the central nave up to a depth of more than three meter. To prevent instability of the <b>columns,</b> the <b>foundation</b> masonry is injected with a hydraulic grout. For the preservation of the archaeological remains, possibly available in the soil, the penetration of the grout into the layered soil must be prevented. Specific properties of the grout are thus required. The fluidity of the grout must be sufficient during injection, but has to decrease rapidly after a pre-determined period. Combined with an effective injection procedure, only the foundation masonry will be filled. The archaeological artefacts will thus be preserved. The grout has to be stable and bleeding must be under control. The compressive and bending strength must be sufficient and secured in time. The injectability of the grout in the foundations must be assured. The development of an appropriate grout for the injection of the <b>columns</b> <b>foundation</b> masonry will be described in this paper. The selections of the grout composition, as well as the design of an effective injection procedure are based on laboratory and on site tests. It is demonstrated that a grout containing a mixture of slaked lime and hydraulic cement performed excellently within the preset boundary conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{consolidation}} theories considering instant load cannot fully {{reveal the}} consolidation mechanism {{of a stone}} <b>column</b> composite <b>foundation</b> used in the expressway embankments due to the time effect of loading; that is, the expressway embankments are often constructed in several stages for a long time. Meanwhile, owing to the special property that the pile-soil stress ratio is larger than 1, the consolidation theory for sand drain well foundation cannot be used directly in the consolidation analysis of stone <b>column</b> composite <b>foundation.</b> Based {{on the principle that}} the vertical load applied on the composite foundation is shared by the stone column and the surrounding soil, the governing solutions for the stone <b>column</b> composite <b>foundation</b> under a multistage load are established. By virtue of the separation of variables, the corresponding solutions of degree of consolidation for loading stage and maintaining load stage are derived separately. According to the Carrillo theorem, the solution for the average total degree of consolidation of entire composite foundation is also obtained. Finally, the reasonableness of the present solution has been verified by comparing the consolidation curve calculated by the present solution with that measured by site test...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical method to optimise {{the position of}} outriggers on shear walls with flexible foundations. This location for the outriggers will cause a maximum reduction in lateral deflection {{at the top of}} the building. The method can be used for preliminary design of high-rise structures subjected to horizontal loading. The method requires the calculation of six structural parameters: bending stiffnesses for the shear wall and outrigger structure, an overall bending stiffness contribution from the exterior columns, rotational stiffnesses for the shear wall and <b>column</b> <b>foundations</b> in addition to a newly suggested bending stiffness parameter representing the structural behaviour of the flexible foundation beam connecting the foundation of the shear wall to the exterior <b>column</b> <b>foundations.</b> These parameters allow the derivation of two compatibility equations for rotations at the intersections of the neutral lines of the shear wall with the outrigger and foundation structures. They yield expressions for the restraining moments at outrigger and foundation levels that act in the opposing direction to the bending moment from the horizontal loading on the structure. Maximising the influence of the restraining moments on the horizontal deflections leads to the optimum location of the outrigger structure. Combining all stiffness parameters into two non-dimensional characteristic structural parameters allows the optimisation procedure for this type of structure to be represented by a single graph that directly gives the optimum level of the outrigger. It is concluded that all six stiffness parameters need to be included in the preliminary analysis of a proposed tall building structure as the optimum location of the outrigger as well as the reductions in horizontal deformations and internal forces in the structure can be significantly influenced by all the structural components...|$|R

The concept of political line - which goes {{back at least to}} the Communist Party of the 1930s - is somewhat similar to the 21st century concept of echo chamber. Those who repeat a political line are serving as an echo chamber; it is widely asserted that conservatives have a much bigger echo chamber than liberals, due to the proliferation of right-wing journals, newspaper <b>columns,</b> <b>foundations,</b> publications, blogs, etc.|$|R
40|$|Ordinary stone {{column is}} one of the ground {{improvement}} techniques for deep soil strata in view of their proven performance, short time schedule, durability, constructability and low costs. The technique may not be suitable for soft soil having undrained shear strength less than or equal 15 kPa due to excessive bulging, and also the soft clay squeezed into the voids of the aggregate.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{analysis}} of a segmented weir sieve-tray distillation column for a 17. 58 kW (5 TR) ammonia/water absorption refrigeration cycle. Balances of mass and energy were performed based on the method of Ponchon-Savarit, from which it was possible to determine the ideal number of trays. The analysis showed that four ideal trays were adequate for that small absorption refrigeration system having the feeding system to the column right above the second tray. It was carried out a sensitivity analysis of the main parameters. Vapor and liquid pressure drop constraint along with ammonia and water mass flow ratios defined the internal geometrical sizes of the column, such as the column diameter and height, as well as other designing parameters. Due to the lack of specific correlations, the present work was based on practical correlations used in the petrochemical and beverage production industries. The analysis also permitted to obtain the recommended values of tray spacing in order to have a <b>compact</b> <b>column.</b> The geometry of the tray turns out to be sensitive to the charge of vapor and, to a lesser extent, to the load of the liquid, being insensible to the diameter of tray holes. It was found a column efficiency of 50 %.
