At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel.

[...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed the description of the album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio."
