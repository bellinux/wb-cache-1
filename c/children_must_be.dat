25|$|The {{right to}} {{petition}} for divorce belongs to both men and women, though procedures for reconciliation and mediation are encouraged. A man may not repudiate his wife without the permission of a judge, {{and she and her}} <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> accorded their full rights under the law. Divorce proceedings take place in a secular court, rather than before a religious official. (See Islamic marital jurisprudence).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> aware of their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity {{that they are doing}} within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.|$|E

50|$|Her {{experiences}} {{there and}} later in Russia, led her {{to believe that the}} rights of a child needed be especially protected and enforced, and her stipulations consisted of the following criteria:#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.#The <b>child</b> that <b>is</b> hungry <b>must</b> <b>be</b> fed, the <b>child</b> that <b>is</b> sick <b>must</b> <b>be</b> nursed, the <b>child</b> that <b>is</b> backward <b>must</b> <b>be</b> helped, the delinquent <b>child</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif <b>must</b> <b>be</b> sheltered and succored.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the first to receive relief in times of distress.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> put in a position to earn a livelihood, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> protected against every form of exploitation.#The <b>child</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> brought up in the consciousness that its talents <b>must</b> <b>be</b> devoted to the service of its fellow men.|$|R

25|$|It {{is crucial}} that {{children}} are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{in an environment that}} allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E
25|$|Students ages 5-12 {{will meet}} at the Education Campus at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens once a month. Students ages 13-18 will attend class once every other month at the Education Campus at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens. Enrollment is limited to home-schooled {{children}} ages 5-18. Children will be enrolled into the appropriate age class based on their age as of September 1, 2016. In accordance with Florida state law, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> 5 years old on or before September 1st to enroll.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute otitis media. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash. If pain is present, treatment to reduce it should be initiated.|$|E

25|$|In the generational {{transmission}} of surnames, the paternal surname's precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames {{from the family}} lineage. Contemporary law allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, but most people observe the traditional paternal–maternal surname order. So the daughter and son of Ángela López Sáenz and Tomás Portillo Blanco are usually called Laura Portillo López and Pedro Portillo López, but also could be called Laura López Portillo and Pedro López Portillo. The two surnames of all of a couple's <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{in the same order}} when recorded in the Registro Civil.|$|E
25|$|Often in {{situations}} where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe malnutrition {{as a result of}} war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and diarrhoea, both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in <b>children),</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired {{in the course of}} their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. <b>Children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.|$|E

500|$|In 1881 Ayres {{worked as}} a {{household}} assistant to Edward Woakes, a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders. By 1885 {{she had become a}} household assistant and nursemaid to the Chandlers, living with the family. After her death, Ayres was described by a local resident as [...] "not one of your fast sort—gentle and quiet-spoke, and always busy about her work".

500|$|Douglas's {{campaign}} against The Well of Loneliness began on 18 August, with poster and billboard advertising and a teaser in the Daily Express promising to expose [...] "A Book That Should Be Suppressed". In his editorial the next day, Douglas wrote that [...] "sexual inversion and perversion" [...] had already become too visible {{and that the}} publication of The Well brought home the need for society to [...] "cleans itself from the leprosy of these lepers". For Douglas the sexological view of homosexuality was pseudoscience, incompatible with the Christian doctrine of free will; instead, he argued, homosexuals were damned by their own choice– which meant that others could be corrupted by [...] "their propaganda". Above all, <b>children</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> protected: [...] "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.
