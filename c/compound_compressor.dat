The experimental analysis is performed for an evaporating temperature range between – 36 oC and – 20 oC and for a condensing temperature range between 30 oC and 47 oC using the refrigerant R- 404 A. The final results are compared with energy analysis from previous works. Additionally, a new criterion of equivalence between the simple vapour compression cycle and the two-stage compression cycle is given...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the ban of the CFC fluids in 2000 and the future {{limitation}} of HCFC fluids, which manufacture limit is the year 2010, refrigerant producers have been working to develop different mixtures, mainly based on HFC fluids, which emulate the properties of the former refrigerants used in refrigeration plants. At the moment, the HFC- 404 A and the HFC- 507 A are the more widely used fluids in Europe as replacement of the CFC- 502 in plants operating at low temperatures. This work presents the experimental evaluation, from an energy point of view, of both refrigerants in the same refrigeration plant, which corresponds to a double-stage vapour compression plant driven by a <b>compound</b> <b>compressor.</b> The characterization was made for an evaporating temperature range between − 36 and − 20 °C for a constant condensing temperature of 40 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{internal}} heat transfer between suction line and gas-cooler outlet line is investigated experimentally in a transcritical carbon dioxide refrigerating circuit. The test rig {{is equipped with}} a semihermetic two-stage reciprocating <b>compound</b> <b>compressor</b> with a water cooled inter-stage heat exchanger and with a finned coil gas-cooler and evaporator. Fixed evaporation pressure was considered, while vapour superheating was varied from 0 °C to 14 °C. Two-phase conditions at the evaporator outlet were also investigated. Gas-cooler outlet pressure was varied from 7. 8 to 11 MPa. The experimental results are compared with available experimental data for the same system without internal heat exchange. The effect of the intercooler efficiency on the cycle performance is also investigated. The system Coefficient of Performance was found to increase up to 20 %. Some hints about the effect of low-purity carbon dioxide on system efficiency are also proposed...|$|E
50|$|While 1308 is a {{very modern}} locomotive, with roller bearings, {{mechanical}} lubricators, stoker, and superheater, {{it was the last}} of a series of 2-6-6-2s that the C&O began in 1911. A very similar design, the USRA 2-6-6-2 was chosen by the United States Railroad Administration as one of its standard designs thirty years earlier during World War I. The advantage of the design was that it could be used on the relatively light, tightly curved, branch lines in West Virginia and Kentucky coal country, and that's where it worked for its seven year working life, making the two-hour run from Peach Creek, near Logan, West Virginia to the Ohio River at Russell, Kentucky with an occasional trip to Hinton, West Virginia. Its use in heavy mountain railroading is emphasized by its two cross <b>compound</b> air <b>compressors</b> mounted on the smokebox door to supply enough air for frequent heavy braking.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to investigate, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically, the potential of improving the cycle efficiency through two stage compression with intermediate cooling, at operating conditions typical of air conditioning. The experimental set-up consists of two closed loop air circuits acting as heat sink and heat source for gas-cooler and evaporator respectively. The tested refrigerating circuit includes two tube-and-fin heat exchangers as gas-cooler and evaporator, a back-pressure valve as throttling device and a double-stage semi-hermetic <b>compound,</b> two-piston, reciprocating <b>compressor</b> equipped with oil separator and intercooler. A full set of thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow-meters allows measurement of all the main parameters of the CO 2 cycle, enabling to perform heat balance both air and refrigerant side. Tests were run at fixed evaporation pressure, evaporator outlet superheating and gas-cooler outlet temperature, varying the gas-cooler outlet pressure in the range 8 - 11 MPa. The optimal gas-cooler pressure for this application as well as the effect of the intercooler efficiency on the cycle performance were investigated. A FORTRAN code for the simulation of an improved two-stage cycle was validated against the experimental results; a theoretical analysis performed with this code is proposed for optimisation and energy performance evaluation of such a cycle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Regulation CE- 1005 / 2009 {{has banned}} {{the use of}} virgin HCFC- 22 in Europe from the 31 st December 2009, because it {{contains}} chlorine, although its use is allowed up to the 31 st December 2014 if it is recycled. Now, manufacturers are developing different free-chlorine drop-in solutions to replace the HCFC- 22 in the existing equipment by non-ozone depleting substances in order to exhaust its remaining life.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental evaluation, from an energy analysis point of view, {{for two of}} the most used inter-stage systems in two-stage vapour compression cycles driven by compound compressors: the direct liquid injection and subcooler systems. The evaluation, considers the two-stage cycle with no intermediate systems as reference cycle and was performed on a plant, driven by a <b>compound</b> <b>compressor</b> using the refrigerant R 404 A for an evaporating temperature range of - 36 to - 20  °C and for a condensing temperature range of 30 - 47  °C. The analysis of the results shows that the inter-stage systems determine the performance of the energy parameters, which are discussed in the paper. The configuration yielding the best results was the two-stage compression cycle with subcooler, since the cooling capacity and COP values for this configuration were the highest. Conversely, the two-stage compression cycle working with direct liquid injection showed lower performance from an energy point of view, though this configuration allows a substantial reduction of the discharge temperature. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to detail an analysis, based on {{experimental}} data, of the inter-stage working conditions of a two-stage vapour compression facility equipped with a <b>compound</b> <b>compressor,</b> which operates with the most usual inter-stage configurations (two-stage with direct liquid injection and two-stage with subcooler) in medium- and low-capacity commercial refrigeration applications. The experimental analysis is performed in an evaporating temperature range between - 36 and - 20 °C, and in a condensing temperature range between 30 and 47 °C, {{using one of the}} fluids most widely-used in Europe for low-temperature applications, the R- 404 a. The inter-stage working temperature/pressure obtained in the tests has been contrasted with the two usual criterion of the optimum working conditions definition: the arithmetical mean of the refrigerant condensing and evaporating temperatures and the criterion of equal pressure ratios in both stages. This paper presents the differences and affinities with the criterion and analyses the influence of the intermediate systems (direct liquid injection and subcooler) on the inter-stage operating conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 62 The design premise in {{upgrading}} two operating {{plants for}} more compression capability is discussed. The {{first is a}} syn gas plant designed for 1000 tons/day of methanol but converted to syn gas only for a primary acetic acid market. The upgrade concentrates on a carbon monoxide (CO) compressor train which upstaged an original pair of compounded centrifugal compressor casings (15 impellers) to a larger casing (first body), roughly four sizes larger at 14 impellers <b>compound</b> <b>compressor</b> casings(two). The new train uses an available larger horsepower steam turbine available from the previous process conversion and its concrete mezzanine and intercoolers located {{just south of the}} present CO train. The timetable called for conversion in one year, plus shutdown and switchover at 30 to 45 days. The second upgrade required adding a third steam turbine driven centrifugal compressor air train, which had been "mothballed" some 13 years prior. The turbine and compressor rotors were vertically immersed in plant fabricated steel containers holding VSI inhibited ISO 43 turbine oil. The empty casings on a 20 foot mezzanine were coated with a tacky rust preventive and dead head blanketed with nitrogen. The time frame was 18 months. The intent of presenting these two conversions is to focus on the design considerations to be addressed for such a project to be successful and also upgrade {{the state of the art}} after 13 to 18 years...|$|E
40|$|In CO 2 {{transcritical}} refrigeration cycles fin-and-tube coils {{are still}} considered as possible gas cooling devices, {{due to their}} lower cost when compared with recent aluminium minichannel heat exchangers. In spite of the very high working pressures, an “off-the-shelf” coil with four ranks of 3 / 8 ” copper tube and louvered fins was found suitable to work with high R 744 pressures and has been studied as a gas-cooler in a test rig built for testing CO 2 equipment operating with air as a secondary fluid. The test rig consists of two closed loop air circuits acting as heat sink and heat source for gas-cooler and evaporator respectively. The tested refrigerating circuit consists of two tube-and-fin heat exchangers as the gas-cooler and the evaporator, a back-pressure valve as the throttling device, a double-stage <b>compound</b> <b>compressor</b> equipped with an oil separator and an intercooler. A full set of thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow-meters allows measurement and recording of all the main parameters of the CO 2 cycle, enabling to perform heat balance both air-side and refrigerant-side. Tests were focused on two different gas-coolers, with continuous and cut fins, and on two different circuit arrangements. Tests on each heat exchanger were run at three different inlet conditions, both for CO 2 and air. A simulation model was developed {{for this type of}} heat exchanger and three models (Dang and Hihara 2004, Gnielinski 1976, Pitla et al. 2002) proposed for the carbon dioxide supercritical cooling heat transfer coefficients were implemented and compared in the code. The model results are compared with the experimental data for the finned coil: emphasis is given to the effect of heat conduction through fins between adjacent tube ranks on the system efficiency. In the paper, the experimental results for transcritical carbon dioxide entering the gas cooler at 87. 0 °C (7. 911 MPa), 97. 6 °C (8. 599 MPa), 107. 8 °C (9. 102 MPa) with air inlet temperature 20. 3 °C, 21. 5 °C and 23. 0 °C respectively are presented. By using a coil with fins modified to reduce the heat conduction, a 3. 7 % to 5. 6 % heat flux improvement was gained. This improvement can be clearly translated in terms of Coefficient Of Performance, since a low value of the CO 2 temperature at its outlet increases the cooling capacity. Considering a reference cycle with the same operating conditions, a 5. 7 % to 6. 6 % increase of COP can be obtained...|$|E
